            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "As I pursue a career in social work, I aspire to dedicate myself to helping children who have been abused or neglected through the Division of Family and Children Services. My personal values of service, respect, and a strong moral compass will serve as cornerstones in my field, as well as in my personal growth. These principles are not only essential for social workers but also deeply ingrained in my own character. I've always been driven to make a positive impact, and my experiences throughout high school and college have only strengthened my resolve. I've witnessed individuals struggling with their problems and resorting to unhealthy coping mechanisms. This led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology, which I completed at Piedmont College in 2009. However, I wasn't entirely sure of my career path at the time. It wasn't until I had a pivotal encounter with a troubled teenager that I became determined to make a difference in the lives of families and children. This young boy, who was being abused by his parents, had reached out to a friend of mine, and I was inspired to take action. I spoke with the police and the parents, expressing my concerns as a recent graduate with a degree in Psychology. This experience solidified my decision to pursue a career in social work, driven by a desire to support children who are caught in the midst of \"simple\" family disputes.\n\nAnother important value in social work is social justice. As a society, we often emphasize the importance of individuality, yet we often conform to societal norms and expectations. I, on the other hand, have never been afraid to express my individuality and challenge social injustices. Throughout my time in high school and college, I've actively spoken out against racism and discrimination, wearing clothing that reflects my personality, and even piercing my ears in a way that feels authentic to me. My involvement with the GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance) has also been a significant part of my journey towards advocating for social justice. I believe in the power of standing up for what is right, even in the face of adversity.",
            "This paper explores the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The Biological model focuses on genetic information passed down and medical aspects of health, while the Sociocultural model examines environmental factors, such as race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review will examine these models and explain the research chosen to relate to and better understand them. A critique of the research and its findings will also be provided, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nInsomnia can be categorized as a primary sleep disorder, a disorder related to another mental condition, or a disorder linked to other medical issues. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssonmias (such as insomnia and hypersomnia) and Parasomnias (like nightmares and sleepwalking disorders). Sleep disorders related to another mental condition involve difficulties with sleep due to Axis I or Axis II disorders. Research on insomnia and primary sleep disorders will be examined in relation to the Biological and Sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model focuses on genetic factors, heritable traits, and physiological aspects of sleep disorders. One study using mice found that neurons in the hypothalamus, specifically those containing orexin, play a crucial role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. The study discovered that specific GABAB receptors on these neurons influence sleep-wake states. Activation of the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, while inhibition of this receptor can lead to reduced anxiety and induce sleep. Furthermore, the GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time in mice, suggesting that this receptor plays a significant role in human sleep regulation. This research implies that genetic and environmental factors can affect the functioning of this receptor, potentially leading to sleep disorders. A sociocultural implication of this study is that inherited traits can influence sleep patterns, and alterations in the receptor could naturally disrupt sleep, affecting daily life and tasks that require focus and concentration.",
            "The following paper delves into the realm of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), a condition that affects the way the brain interprets auditory information. To begin with, it's essential to understand what CAPD entails. In simple terms, it refers to the brain's inability to effectively process sounds, despite the individual having normal hearing. This disorder is not related to hearing impairment but rather to the brain's difficulty in distinguishing conversations from background noise, separating words, or differentiating between various sounds.\n\nThe roots of CAPD can be traced back to the 1950s when researchers first identified it as \"auditory imperception.\" The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari pioneered the development of tests for children with communicative disorders in 1954, and in 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing, providing a model to explain the brain's physiology in processing dichotic perception.\n\nCAPD manifests itself in various ways, including difficulty localizing sounds in space, distinguishing between multiple sounds, recognizing sound patterns, and differentiating changes in speech. Furthermore, individuals with CAPD may struggle to synthesize sound clues, interpret sequences of auditory information, or filter out background noise. \n\nTo diagnose CAPD, a comprehensive evaluation must be conducted, typically involving audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, or other healthcare professionals. This process may include a range of assessments, such as questionnaires, surveys, and observations of auditory behaviors. While there is no single, universally accepted test for CAPD, various tools are used to evaluate auditory-related skills and diagnose the disorder. These assessments may present individuals with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and ask them to identify specific items, such as words or numbers.\n\nIn conclusion, teachers in mainstreamed classrooms can play a vital role in supporting students with CAPD by being aware of the common characteristics or \"red flags\" associated with the disorder. By recognizing the signs, they can provide accommodations and strategies to help students with CAPD overcome their challenges and succeed academically.",
            "The play Twelfth Night warns us that while deception can be a useful tool for hiding the truth, it can also lead to a loss of one's true identity. However, the act of revealing one's deception can have a different cost altogether – alienation. This raises a difficult question: should one prioritize their own sense of self or their relationships with others. While some people may react neutrally to being fooled, others may feel deeply hurt and betrayed by the deception.\n\nIn the context of gender role reversal, the issue of deception becomes even more complicated. One of the main questions that arises is why someone would choose to take on a disguise in the first place. In the case of Viola, her decision to dress as a man is a means of self-preservation. As she says, \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town / Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help / I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" (5.1.247-249).\n\nHowever, Viola's disguise not only protects her from those who might harm her, but also cuts her off from the support system of women around her. Furthermore, her convincing performance as a man even leads Olivia to fall in love with her, which adds an extra layer of complexity to the situation. On top of that, Viola has to navigate her own romantic desires, which are suppressed by her disguise as a male servant.\n\nOne interpretation of the play is that deception can be a catalyst for revealing hidden emotions. The characters of Olivia and Orsino may have subconscious desires that are only brought to the surface by Viola's disguise. For instance, is Olivia truly attracted to Cesario because he appears to be a man, or does she secretly harbor feelings for women? While it's unlikely that Shakespeare intended to suggest that Olivia is a lesbian, her character does seem to be parodying the people of his time who judged others based on appearance.\n\nThis is evident in the way Olivia quickly switches her affections from Cesario to Sebastian and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as a family member rather than a romantic interest. The line \"A sister, you are she\" (5.1.315) is a telling moment that suggests Olivia's feelings for Cesario are not romantic, but rather a form of affection and acceptance.",
            "I've always been fascinated by the history of German colonial rule, and one of the most striking aspects is its brutal nature, especially with regards to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. However, it's essential to note that the German colonial empire was incredibly diverse in its policies and approaches, much like its geography. When it comes to education, the provision of schools across the colonies varied significantly. For instance, when the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans, which was a testament to the German efforts in that region. In contrast, the situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) was drastically different. Unlike in East Africa, where the government played a significant role in the education of the natives, the task of educating the locals in South West Africa was largely left to missionary societies that received limited government support. This approach had a lasting impact on the colony, even after German rule ended. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa \"the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" Several social, political, and economic factors contributed to this divergent experience, and this paper aims to delve deeper into these factors and examine new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nThere's an abundance of literature available on education in the German colonial empire, with many sources written in German during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. These early works primarily aimed to describe the characteristics of the educational systems in these colonies. Later studies in English expanded the discussion through comparative analyses of education in the various German colonies and more in-depth examinations of specific aspects of education. These studies revealed significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. A notable work that addresses the topic of this paper is Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa, which compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing features of the colony's educational system.\n\nSouth West Africa stood out from Germany's other colonial possessions due to its relatively temperate climate, despite the arid desert covering much of the territory. This favorable climate was reflected in the European population of South West Africa, with nearly 15,000 whites residing in the colony by 1913, compared to only 5,336 in East Africa, which had the next largest settler population.",
            "The world of popular music has undergone a significant transformation over the past 100 years, with an incredible number of genres emerging. It's getting increasingly hard to give a definitive list of all the sub-genres that have branched out from the major genres, like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk. Heavy metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres in the past 40 years. Its expressiveness stems from its wide range of emotions, with a clear bias towards the darker side of the emotional spectrum. \n\nHeavy metal's diversity is evident in how it branched out into various sub-genres right from the start. This diversity allowed people to experiment and create their own unique styles, giving birth to a chain of sub-sub-genres that continues to this day. Today, the heavy metal movement has become so vast that it's tricky to pinpoint what exactly constitutes heavy metal music. It has incorporated a wide range of themes from other genres, but, like everything else, it originated from somewhere. To truly understand the metal music that surrounds us, it's essential to grasp the core of the metal movement and why it's a movement rather than just a genre.\n\nThe term \"metal\" is often associated with darkness, and, in many ways, it's a music of excess - more bass, more volume, more violence, and more theatricality. Metal musicians are known for their exceptional skills, and it shows in their music. Another defining characteristic of the metal movement is its strong connection to substance use. The mid-70s saw a psychedelic drug boom, which led to people creating out-of-this-world records, using their experiences with these substances as inspiration. Metal music is characterized by its dark, visceral qualities, which were a refreshing change from the more upbeat and cheerful aspects of popular music at the time. Later generations of metal drew inspiration from the dark, raw qualities of the Romantic Era. Lyrics like these showcase the darkness that's a staple of the movement:\n\n\"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles is an example of how the genre came to be. It's a song that captures the highs and lows, supposedly inspired by the darker side of substance use. Many consider it one of the first heavy metal songs, a response to the Rolling Stones' heavier and darker side. The Beatles aimed to prove they could be just as heavy as their rivals, placing this song on their iconic album, The White Album.",
            "Before the Surrealist artists began creating their dreamlike masterpieces, Henri Rousseau was bringing his own dreams to life. Literally and figuratively, his 1910 painting, The Dream, showcases not just a woman marveling at the wonders of a dream world, but also Rousseau's personal aspirations as an artist. For years, he'd dreamed of being recognized, admired, and praised by fellow artists and art enthusiasts, but he faced a tough internal dilemma: conform to the art world's expectations by mimicking popular styles, or stay true to himself and forge his own path. This internal struggle is beautifully captured in The Dream, a painting that reflects Rousseau's long-standing conflict between artistic conformity and creative independence.\n\nTo truly appreciate The Dream, it's essential to understand Rousseau's life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, northwest France, Rousseau was the son of a tinsmith and hardware dealer who enjoyed a comfortable middle-class lifestyle. Unlike many artists of his time, Rousseau didn't receive any formal art training. Instead, he worked as a municipal toll service employee, earning the nickname \"douanier\" or customs inspector, until he was 40. His life took a dramatic turn after the death of his first wife, Clémence, and eight infant children left him with only one surviving child, Julia, and a deep sense of loss. He turned to painting as a way to cope and start anew. Unlike many of his contemporaries, who romanticized the peasant in their work, Rousseau was a folk painter who drew from the hopes and dreams of the common people.\n\nRousseau's desire for recognition from the art world is understandable, given his background and the fact that he began his career at an older age, competing with other talented artists who were already well-established. It wasn't until around the same time that Matisse was gaining recognition that Rousseau started to receive proper recognition for his art. According to art historian Jan Gordon, Rousseau and Matisse differed not only in style and subject matter but also in their motivations for painting. While Matisse was driven by a fear of creating art that was too conventional, Rousseau's goal was to create something so ordinary that he'd be accepted into the Artiste Français.",
            "The notion that ethics and aesthetics are intertwined has long been explored by various thinkers, with many positing a fundamental connection between truth and beauty. I firmly believe there's a reason behind this idea. John Keats' famous words from \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\" - \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know\" - highlight the connection between the two. It seems that our appreciation of ethics and aesthetics isn't solely learned through education or experience but rather arises from a deeper, more intuitive understanding.\n\nBoth ethics and aesthetics attempt to describe rather than prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty aim to explain why a particular art piece or literary work is beautiful or why an action is morally sound, rather than providing a set of rules to judge or create good art or moral behavior. The essence of what makes art or morals great cannot be fully captured through criticism. Discussing the value of, for example, da Vinci's Mona Lisa may involve analyzing concepts like foreground, background, and cultural context, but these factors don't truly convey why it's considered a masterpiece. When asked about a favorite work of art or literature, people often respond with a phrase like \"There's just something about it,\" followed by a more in-depth explanation.\n\nI believe that both art and morals can't be reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor noted, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Similarly, no matter how thoroughly we describe the properties of a literary work, there's an intangible, transcendent aspect that remains. This is echoed in Wittgenstein's statement that \"ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" I propose that this \"something,\" this je ne sais quoi, is art and morality's most powerful attribute. The transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a common ground between them.\n\nI believe that morality and art are closely related because we experience both at a noumenal level, a term coined by Kant. They impact us on a level that can be felt but not fully explained. This connection is even stronger in literature, which, as McKean notes, is distinguished by its moral quality. Standards of morality are as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Literature's importance lies in the values we find within it, and it's these values that make it unique among the arts.",
            "The Germany we see today is a nation with a unique blend of cultures, from the snow-capped Alps to the shores of the Baltic Sea. This diverse cultural identity is reflected in the country's varied regions, from the bustling streets of Munich to the historic city of Dresden, nestled along the Elbe River. Considering Germany's rich history and the influences that have shaped it, it's no surprise that the country's identity is a result of various ethnic groups and tribes.\n\nThe origins of the name \"Germania\" are shrouded in mystery, with scholars and historians offering different theories. Some believe it stems from the name of a Germanic tribe known as the Tungrians, whom Tacitus called the Germans before they crossed the Rhine and clashed with the Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar also used the term \"Germanus\" in his account of the Gallic Wars, using it to distinguish between the Gauls and the Germanic tribes he encountered. Caesar likely borrowed the word from the Gauls themselves, who used it to describe their neighbors. In his writings, Caesar noted that the Germans lived across the Rhine, continually at odds with the Gauls (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC).\n\nOther theories suggest that the name \"Germania\" comes from the spear used in ancient warfare, known as a \"ger.\" Alternatively, it may be derived from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" implying that the Germans were known for their loud and boisterous nature. \n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus wrote extensively on the origins of the Germans in his work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" (98 AD). He described the Germans as an indigenous people, untouched by external influences, who lived in a harsh and unforgiving land. Tacitus noted that the Romans would not have chosen to emigrate to such a place unless it was their ancestral homeland. As a result, Germanic tribes lived on the periphery of the Roman Empire, trading goods and skills with the Romans, who would occasionally launch campaigns into Germania (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17).",
            "My train of thought had hit a brick wall, and I was staring blankly ahead, trying to process the scene in front of me.  I was numb, unemotional, and detached, but my mind was working overtime, analyzing every detail without really connecting it to anything meaningful.  Thoughts flashed through my head, only to disappear just as quickly, leaving me with a sense of detachment from my own thoughts.\n\nFor years, I'd been fascinated with drawing, ever since I was a kid.  Recently, I'd picked up an art instruction book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\" and was determined to learn the techniques.  One of the exercises involved placing a square frame around any picture you wanted to study, breaking down a complex scene into something more manageable.  But as I gazed down at the, ahem, \"art\" in front of me, I couldn't even wrap my head around that concept.  I was too caught up in the sheer overwhelmingness of it all.\n\nIn the world of art, some people focus on specific themes or colors.  Picasso went through a blue phase, Monet loved greenery, and the Renaissance masters were known for their use of vibrant colors.  If I was going to consider myself an artist, I thought, then this toilet bowl was my blank canvas, the start of my masterpiece, which I'd dubbed \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nMy hand instinctively reached for the toilet handle, but this time, my mind was racing with possibilities.  Water swirled, and I felt a surge of creative energy.  But instead of a masterpiece, I was faced with something far less inspiring.  The toilet paper roll was stuck, and I was left to deal with it.\n\nI gripped the mop handle tightly and stood there, feeling irritated and frustrated.  My green tie felt like a noose around my neck, and I scowled at the offending mess in front of me.  A few more flushes, a few more moments of introspection, and then I was up to the task at hand.  I reached for the toilet paper, wrapped my hand in it like a mummy, and slowly, deliberately, I plunged it into the bowl, like a mom preparing a Thanksgiving turkey for the oven.",
            "It's unsettling to see the alarming number of teenagers who are losing their lives behind the wheel.  Several factors contribute to this deadly trend among young American drivers.  One significant aspect is that the teenage brain isn't mature enough to handle the risks associated with driving, as explained by the National Institutes of Health. Additionally, inexperience plays a substantial role in this issue, resulting in higher rates of fatal accidents, vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nIt's no surprise that teens are more prone to accidents when driving with their peers, which unfortunately happens quite frequently.  A study conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center revealed a correlation between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents.  In response, California and other states have implemented provisional driver's licenses that restrict the hours teens can drive and ban other minors as passengers. \nWhile these temporary licenses are a step in the right direction, I believe they are merely a temporary solution.  The underlying issue is that, statistically speaking, the youngest drivers are not equipped to handle the risks and responsibilities of driving.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman suggests that 18 is still too young for a standard driver's license.  His research, as reported by USA Today, indicates that those under the age of 19-20 are more likely to engage in risk-taking behavior for the thrill of it.  It makes sense, then, to delay driving until this behavior has subsided.  If we continue to grant driver's licenses to young teens, we can expect to see even more devastating accidents and an unprecedented death toll in the coming years.  By 2010, the Baby Boomer generation's children will be eligible to drive, leading to millions of new teen drivers taking to the roads. \nImplementing legislation to address this issue would be a reasonable and straightforward process.  Schools could continue to offer driver's education classes to initiate the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 should be allowed to operate a vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued before granting a full license, with a set number of practical driving hours required.  This number could be based on the typical hours required by most states (in California, for example, drivers need 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  National legislation addressing this issue would be a fair and effective way to protect young drivers across the country. \nMy proposed legislation is not a new idea, but rather a common-sense approach to addressing a pressing concern.",
            "I recently stumbled upon the fascinating world of early Edison films, specifically the trick films from the Library of Congress's collection. Out of the 15 films from 1895 to 1901, I made it a point to watch them all. Trick films, also known as illusion films, rely heavily on creative editing to create an air of wonder and illusion. My in-depth study of these films focused on understanding the underlying poetics and examining the unique characteristics that set the later films apart. \n\nInterestingly, most trick films from the late 19th and early 20th centuries adhere to a strict set of conventions. These early films take place within the confines of a stage, framed by a frontal proscenium, and are typically shot from a single, static position. The camera never deviates from this position, even when characters or objects move within the scene. This composition style was borrowed from the world of theatre and vaudeville, where performers would often move within a fixed frame. This means that characters in these early films often move side-to-side, but never towards or away from the camera.\n\nTake, for instance, the classic film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move horizontally across the frame, never deviating from the fixed position of the camera. Even when they disappear from view, the camera remains stationary.\n\nAnother notable aspect of early trick films is the limited use of camera angles. Long shots and medium shots are the norm, while close-ups are almost nonexistent. This is due in part to the theatrical tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance within the frame of the stage. Actors rarely move towards or away from the camera, making close-ups a rare occurrence.\n\nThe one-shot-per-film rule is also a defining characteristic of early trick films. This limitation restricts the length of these films to around a minute or less, depending on the frame rate used. Most trick films focus on short, vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic and disappearing acts, rather than developing a narrative. However, a closer examination often reveals that what appears to be a single shot can, in fact, be composed of multiple joined shots, cleverly edited to create an illusion. Take, for example, The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), where a single conceptual shot is actually comprised of several physical shots.\n\nThese early trick films laid the groundwork for the development of cinematic techniques, pushing the boundaries of what was possible with film. Despite their limitations, they remain an essential part of film history, offering a glimpse into the creative experimentation and innovation of the early days of cinema.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an outspoken advocate for Republicanism in the early days of the United States.  As an agriculturalist and a politician, he was known for his unwavering dedication to individual freedom and limited government.  His strong belief in the superiority of an agrarian system influenced his views on governance, sovereignty, and the judicial system.  He was determined to preserve and promote this ideal, often using it as the foundation for his arguments. \n\nTaylor believed that the US had a unique opportunity to create an ideal system of government, free from the constraints of established traditions.  He firmly believed in the natural rights of individuals, which he saw as interconnected and interdependent – if one right was denied, the value of the remaining rights would be diminished.  He advocated for these rights to be beyond government interference.  He also believed that the so-called \"state of nature\" was a reality where the strong and cunning exploited the weak, but that this should not be the case in civilization.\n\nTo create an ideal society, Taylor proposed a government that acknowledged both the good and evil inherent in humanity.  He had a rigid viewpoint on dualistic morality, stating that government, being run by humans, would inherently reflect both virtues and vices.  He defined good principles as those that protected private property, promoted agriculture, and discouraged capitalism, believing that a government founded on these principles would function fairly regardless of its leadership, which would always be driven by self-interest and avarice.  He believed that self-interest was a natural motivation for humans, but only became problematic when it led to the creation of sub-societies that exploited others.\n\nTaylor, like many other Republicans of his time, advocated for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He sought an extremely limited Federal government with no powers beyond those explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He recognized that an extensive government was expensive and prone to despotism, but also believed that a simplistic, literal interpretation was precarious and open to corruption.  Furthermore, he saw the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the United States, as it more clearly described the country as a group of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "In looking back at the project's data, there was a significant drop in commuter log submissions in the third month, which was a bit disheartening, and it's hard to pinpoint the exact reason for this decline. Considering the onset of winter at our New England campus, it's likely that the drop in people commuting by bicycle or on foot contributed to this decrease. Additionally, December marks the end of the fall semester, a time when students and faculty are busy with schoolwork, processing grades, and preparing for the holidays. As a result, filling out the commuter log may have fallen by the wayside for many. Furthermore, December is the start of the busy holiday season, followed by a month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many don't need to be on campus. Classes resume in late January, which might explain the low number of submissions for that month. However, none of these reasons fully account for the low number of submissions in February. It's also possible that the initial enthusiasm for the project naturally waned over time. To combat this, we introduced Carpool Challenge Week, a special campaign in March that resulted in an increase in log submissions. Despite our efforts, we still faced the challenges of maintaining momentum in the face of natural fluctuations and the unique challenges of the academic calendar. \n\nAnother challenge we encountered was the deeply ingrained preference for the freedom and independence that comes with driving a car. This is a cultural norm that's difficult to overcome. To incentivize alternative modes of commuting, we offered prizes in the form of gift certificates to local businesses, which seemed to be effective at the outset. It would have been interesting to see how larger prizes, such as a new bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car, might have impacted participation, potentially reviving the project's momentum and combatting the dip in engagement. Our prize offerings remained consistent throughout the project, but increasing the value of the prizes over time might have made a difference. The initial gift cards seemed sufficient, but announcing additional, more substantial prizes, such as bicycles or alternative fuel vehicles, in the later stages of the project might have boosted participation.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a type of investment security that offers the benefits of an index fund, such as diversification, but with more flexibility and trading capabilities like a stock. Unlike traditional index funds, ETFs allow you to buy and sell shares throughout the day, giving you the freedom to sell short, buy on margin, and even purchase as few as a single share in any transaction. One of the major advantages of ETFs is their expense ratios, which are significantly lower than those of the average mutual fund. However, there are some drawbacks to consider, including the need to pay a commission on each trade, just like when buying or selling a stock. Another benefit of ETFs is the wide range of options available, with various funds tracking different indices, commodities, or baskets of assets.\n\nIn evaluating the performance of a specific ETF, such as the IHF, it's essential to assess whether the stated benefits, like diversification, are actually effective and to what extent. To do this, we'll be examining the top 10 holdings of the IHF and comparing their performance to a hypothetical portfolio consisting of the same stocks in the same proportions. This will help us determine whether the benefits of owning a single ETF are comparable to those of a diversified portfolio of individual stocks.\n\nTo keep our analysis manageable, we've decided to focus on the top 10 holdings, which account for approximately 63.58% of the ETF's assets. Below, we'll outline these holdings and their corresponding percentages.\n\nTo estimate how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF as a whole, we can use the current asset allocation to calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return, as if the portfolio consisted entirely of these 10 stocks in the same proportions. The calculations are presented in the chart below.\n\nThe results show that a portfolio consisting only of the top 10 holdings would yield a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. Additionally, the Beta of this portfolio is 0.12 lower than the ETF's Beta. These findings suggest that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings may provide a higher return with a lower risk. However, it's essential to consider whether these differences are statistically significant.\n\nTo address this, we've calculated the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalized it to 100% to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "One of Edgar Allan Poe's personal favorites is the poem \"Dream-Land\". In this poem, Poe uses the term \"Thulé\" twice, which is a significant reference that sheds light on his influences.  Tom Mabbott, a literary scholar, notes that Poe likely borrowed \"Thulé\" from the ancient Roman poet Virgil. However, it's also possible that Poe was inspired by a more contemporary source: his admiration for German author Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. \n\nThis connection is significant because it demonstrates Poe's familiarity with Goethe's work. In his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon\", literary critic Karl J. Arndt highlights the similarities between Poe's poem and Goethe's writing style, suggesting that Poe may have been influenced by Goethe's work. \n\nInterestingly, Goethe was a prominent writer of the poetic drama \"Faust\", which was published in two parts: the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of his death. Within the second part of \"Faust\" lies a short poem called \"The King of Thulé\", which tells the story of a king who loses his wife and becomes consumed by grief and drinking. The description of the King of Thulé bears a striking resemblance to the persona in \"Dream-Land\", which could be seen as a dark reflection of Poe's own experiences with loss and addiction. \n\nGoethe's work was widely known and admired during Poe's time, and it's likely that Poe was familiar with it through his respect for fellow poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson. Poe even expressed admiration for Tennyson, which suggests that he would have been aware of Goethe's work. In fact, Goethe's \"Faust\" was widely reproduced and translated after its initial publication, making it easily accessible to Poe and other writers of his time.\n\nIt's worth noting that Poe references Thule twice in his writings, both times using the phrase \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and \"Dream-Land\". The two poems can be seen as companion pieces, as they share a similar themes and imagery. In \"Dream-Land\", the speaker describes a desolate landscape of Thule, haunted by the spirits of the dead and devoid of color. This can be seen as a dark reflection of Goethe's \"The King of Thulé\", in which the king is consumed by grief and loss after the death of his wife.",
            "In California, could a customer who slipped and fell on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages if the store manager was informed twice about the spill but didn't clean it for over 30 minutes while he ate dinner? The answer is not a simple one. A judge is unlikely to dismiss the customer's claim out of hand. To receive punitive damages, the customer must show that the store manager acted with reckless disregard for the harm that would come from not cleaning the spill. The customer can argue that the manager should have known about the potential dangers because multiple customers had slipped and fallen on spills in the same store before. Despite this knowledge, the manager still chose not to clean the spill. While it's debatable whether the manager's actions were truly malicious, it's hard to deny that his behavior was irresponsible given the number of previous slip-and-fall incidents in 2009.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee informed the manager, Paul Martin, of the applesauce spill. Martin told him to handle it later, saying he was on dinner break. Fifteen minutes later, another employee reminded Martin about the spill, but he responded in the same manner. At 5:30 pm, the customer, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill, suffering a serious back injury. In the months leading up to this accident, there had been five other slip-and-fall incidents at the store. Palmer is now suing the store for damages related to her injury, and we're examining whether to file a motion to dismiss the claim for punitive damages.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of duty if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm or, in the absence of intent, was done with a willful and conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others. Courts have deemed conduct malicious when the defendant was aware of the potential dangers and chose to ignore them. In this case, the customer can argue that the manager was aware of the potential harm and failed to take action, making a strong case for punitive damages.",
            "It's been almost four years since I took a course in Islam at CBC, and the question of whether Islam is a hostile religion still resonates with me today.  The events that have unfolded since 9/11 have led to a shift in the way mass media portrays Islam in America, moving from a negative perception to an extreme form of tolerance.  I think it's remarkable that we've come to a point where a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, with a Muslim background, could run for office without being met with the same level of scrutiny.\n\nThe Biography of the Prophet Muhammad has left an impression on me, particularly because it seems to contradict the image of Muhammad that I had formed based on my previous knowledge.  From what I understood, Muhammad was a conqueror who forced tribes to adopt Islam after taking over, but the biography portrays him as a humble and misunderstood figure who was respected and sought out by people who saw the truth in his teachings.\n\nI've also noticed some striking similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the miracles attributed to Muhammad.  One example that stands out is the story of how he multiplied food to feed a large crowd, much like Jesus did with the loaves and fish.  This writing style makes me wonder if the authors were trying to depict Muhammad as a humble prophet who didn't need to prove anything, but simply lived a life of truth and miracles.  To me, this approach downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ, and it's like they're trying to take credit for his personhood and life through Muhammad.\n\nThe biography also includes many stories that seem to be part of an agenda to provide proof of the truth of Islam, but these stories often come from secondary or tertiary sources.  This makes them seem suspicious and less convincing to me, as I think it's harder to verify their accuracy.\n\nWhat bothers me most about this work is the way it tries to portray Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, wise, and gentle.  However, historical accounts suggest that Muhammad was a more complex figure, and I wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true story behind his rise to power.",
            "It's intriguing to consider how the teachings of Jesus and the values he stood for were largely abandoned as Christianity evolved after his time.  If we examine this historical shift, it becomes clear that Christianity has drifted further away from its roots.  It appears that today's world is witnessing a growing awareness and a more progressive mindset, particularly among Christians.  Although traditionalists will undoubtedly resist any deviation from the original teachings, their influence may eventually wane, allowing a more open-minded approach to take hold.  As time passes, a growing number of Christians will seek to distinguish the added doctrines from the core principles of the faith.  This process may take decades or even centuries, but it's inevitable:  a significant reversal in Christian history is on the horizon.  A movement will emerge, stripping away the layers of doctrine that have accumulated over time, much like a clock rewinding, until all that remains is a clear understanding of Jesus' original message.  When this shift gains momentum in the United States and Europe, it will lead to a more uniform and streamlined expression of Christianity, as people return to the core principles Jesus brought forth.  The church as an institution will continue to thrive, but the resulting uniformity will supplant the current diversity of Christian denominations and practices.  History is replete with examples of such reversals, such as the transformation of the Roman Empire from a persecutor of Christians to a Christian institution, or the shift in the United States from a society that enslaved Africans to one where African Americans hold positions of leadership.  The future holds a similar reversal for the Christian faith, as people seek to return to the source and undo the complexities that have developed over time.  This process will be facilitated by a shift in how we interpret Jesus' words, moving from a literal to a metaphorical understanding.  So, what led to the divergence from Jesus' original message?  If we look back far enough, we find that the foundation of Christianity is rooted in Judaism.  By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., the core of Jewish thought had already taken shape, centered around monotheism, the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, and a divinely revealed religion.  The Jewish populace was not a monolithic entity, however, and divided into various groups, including the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common people.",
            "I firmly believe that The Jungle is a powerful portrayal of humanity's inherent selfishness and lack of empathy. The novel vividly illustrates how people's primal instincts drive them to prioritize their own interests above all else, often at the expense of those who are less fortunate. The novel showcases this theme through the actions of the factory owners and managers, who only care about expanding their businesses and increasing their wealth, without any regard for the harm it may cause to others or the environment. In the book, Upton Sinclair paints a stark picture of the devastating impact of industrialization, describing the factories as \"the line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". This vivid imagery highlights the owners' blatant disregard for the well-being of people and animals affected by their actions. They show no concern for the pollution spewing from the factories or the animal waste and filth surrounding Packingtown.\n\nFurthermore, the owners and managers are only interested in maximizing their profits, rather than treating their employees with dignity or respect. They exploit their workers, forcing them to work long hours for minimal pay and without any regard for their safety or well-being. The novel highlights the harsh realities of the time period, where workers had no protections or support, and were often treated as nothing more than replaceable commodities. The book describes the conditions as \"a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". This toxic environment is perpetuated by the lack of regulations and organizations to protect the workers' rights, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation. The novel suggests that the workers were essentially treated as slaves, forced to live and work in squalid conditions with no hope of escape.\n\nSinclair's work serves as a scathing critique of the capitalist system and the treatment of workers during that era. The novel's portrayal of the dehumanizing effects of industrialization and the exploitation of workers is a powerful reminder of the need for workers' rights and social justice.",
            "Many authors have mastered the art of creating a specific atmosphere in their readers through various techniques. F. Scott Fitzgerald is a brilliant example of this, as seen in his novel The Great Gatsby. In his writing, Fitzgerald frequently employs a range of techniques to evoke distinct emotions and attitudes in his readers. His approach often involves pairing unusual adjectives with nouns to create an initial impression, while also applying deeper meaning to symbols throughout the story. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald takes this technique to the next level by assigning significance to various colors, including gold, green, white, and red/pink. He cleverly builds up the meaning behind these colors, particularly white and gray, and later uses them to create a distinctive aura around specific objects and characters.\n\nFitzgerald's use of white and gray is particularly noteworthy, as he establishes a connection between these colors and uniformity. White is often associated with a sense of refinement and higher social class, while gray represents a more faded and aged quality. In the beginning of the novel, Fitzgerald consistently employs both colors, creating an image of uniformity. For instance, Daisy and Jordan are frequently depicted wearing white, and even the other characters follow suit, donning white attire at various social gatherings. The only time this uniformity is broken is when Nick attends Gatsby's party, where he observes a more vibrant atmosphere with primary colors. Furthermore, Fitzgerald reinforces this connection by associating these colors with ordinary, mundane subjects, such as the streets of New York and the names on Nick's timetable.\n\nAs the novel progresses, Fitzgerald skillfully employs these colors to convey a sense of uniformity or unimportance surrounding specific subjects. This begins with Daisy, who is first described wearing a white dress in a \"little white roadster.\" This image creates a sense of detachment, making Daisy seem more like a uniform addition to Gatsby's life rather than a fully fleshed-out character. Fitzgerald continues to use this technique to reinforce this impression, often depicting Daisy in white attire or describing her as having a \"gray haze\" around her. By building up the meaning behind these colors and using them consistently throughout the novel, Fitzgerald masterfully creates a lasting impression on his readers.",
            "San Diego County stands out as a fertile ground for agriculture, thanks to its idyllic climate. The region's rich crop selection includes a variety of produce such as tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, and squash. Organic farming has gained significant traction in the area, with a substantial demand for community-supported agriculture and a high interest in locally produced products like organic eggs and milk. Many farms not only provide tours of their operations but also offer recreational activities like hiking and birdwatching, promoting a win-win situation for both the landowners and the environment.\n\nOrganic farming also brings several environmental benefits, including increased biodiversity due to the absence of chemicals in the soil and water. However, this type of farming comes with some drawbacks. It requires more labor and intense management to maintain soil quality and control pests and weeds without using chemicals, potentially resulting in higher losses compared to conventional farming methods. Additionally, smaller organic farms often lack the efficiency of large-scale operations, making it challenging to balance profit and habitat quality.\n\nConsidering these factors, it's no wonder that a farmer like the one in this scenario would seek financial assistance or expert guidance to optimize their operation and make the most of the land. The chosen property is a 160-acre parcel located in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of San Diego County, California, near the town of Potrero. This land features a mix of chaparral, non-native Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, bordering the Cleveland National Forest. The area is home to a diverse range of plant and animal species, some of which are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat and the mountain yellow-legged frog.\n\nThe land has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries before being settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. As part of an original homestead patent, the land was likely used for grazing and wood production for many years.\n\nTo illustrate the potential for a small farmer in this region to mitigate costs and preserve wildlife-friendly operations, I researched government programs and found an existing organic farm in the area as a model to follow. This hypothetical scenario highlights the possibilities and challenges faced by a landowner seeking to balance financial success with environmental stewardship.",
            "In any negotiation, culture plays a vital role in shaping the dynamics of the table talks. However, it's essential to recognize that culture is not a fixed or singular entity, but rather a complex and multifaceted concept that encompasses what it is, what it signifies, and what it's not. A statement like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" is an oversimplification, as culture is not homogenous or uniform. Instead, it's more productive to delve into the nuances of a culture and understand its significance in the context of the negotiation. When interacting with a foreign culture, individuals tend to relate to it through their own cultural lens, leading to inevitable comparisons and assumptions.\n\nTo effectively navigate cultural differences, negotiators must be willing to study and learn about the culture they're engaging with. This involves understanding its history, values, and prejudices, rather than judging or attempting to change it. When working with a weaker bargaining position, respecting the local culture and traditions can be a powerful tool in overcoming cultural barriers and moving the negotiation forward.\n\nInterestingly, culture is not limited to national or international boundaries. Corporate cultures within a given nation can be just as distinct and influential. For instance, some companies may prioritize long working hours, while others adopt a more relaxed schedule. These cultural differences can be seen in employee dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices. Even within the same nation, companies can exhibit varying levels of philanthropy, dress codes, and communication styles, highlighting the diversity of thought within a particular societal culture. By looking beyond the surface level, negotiators can uncover the complexities of a culture and make more informed decisions.\n\nUnderstanding values is equally crucial, as they provide the underlying motivations and drivers of a culture. For example, if a culture values saving face or communal harmony, a negotiator will be less likely to publicly shame their company or superior to achieve a successful outcome. Conversely, a culture that places greater emphasis on a hard-driven bargain may not be willing to settle for a quick agreement. By considering these cultural nuances, negotiators can approach the negotiation table with a deeper understanding of their opponent's mindset and make more effective decisions.",
            "The idea that there is no God has been a notion expressed by some, as seen in Psalm 14 and St. Anselm's argument. Similarly, Thomas Aquinas, another prominent figure, also believed in the existence of God. Since we're comparing their arguments, we'll assume they're both defending the same concept of God - the one found in the Bible. This will allow us to fairly compare their arguments without introducing alternative interpretations. St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas both present valid points, but neither provides a complete foundation for believing in God.\n\nTo understand this, let's examine St. Anselm's argument. He suggests that the existence of God can be found within one's own mind. According to him, since we can't effectively conceive God's nonexistence, this proves his existence. Although his explanation can be a bit convoluted, the basic idea is that truth about God can be found within our own understanding, eliminating the need for external evidence. This concept of accepting something without concrete proof is often referred to as faith within Christian texts.\n\nIn contrast, Thomas Aquinas offers a more rational approach to proving God's existence. He believes it can be achieved solely through reason and empirical evidence, without the need for faith. This could be beneficial for spreading Christianity, as it would allow new converts to be recruited through logic alone, rather than relying on their willingness to accept something unproven. Aquinas presents five logical arguments supporting God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. He demonstrates that the existence of God is logically necessary, much like understanding the features of a missing puzzle piece without seeing it.",
            "In the ancient times, around the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince was born who would eventually become known as Buddha. As he navigated through life, he renounced worldly possessions and achieved enlightenment, setting the stage for the development of Buddhism, with Theravada Buddhism being its most traditional form. This ancient faith is now over 2,500 years old, and it has undergone a significant transformation over the years. This transformation can be witnessed by observing how Theravada Buddhism is practiced in countries such as Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is a significant event. This ritual is participated in by both monks and lay followers, even though Buddha himself never taught about any such celebration. These changes are not limited to mere customs and traditions but also extend to the core teachings of the faith. Over time, the Theravada Buddhist community has had to adapt its doctrines, both from a monastic and lay perspective, due to various internal and external influences.\n\nThroughout this discussion, certain terms will be used frequently. 'Internal' refers to any force that originates from within the Buddhist community, regardless of one's monastic status, while 'external' refers to any influence from non-Buddhists. A 'hostile' force is any influence that aims to harm or damage the Buddhist community, often stemming from a negative perception of Buddhism. On the other hand, a 'benign' force is one that neither wishes to harm nor help the Buddhist community, although its consequences may be either detrimental or beneficial. These definitions will be crucial in understanding the nuances of this discussion.\n\nTo begin, it's essential to grasp the fundamental principles of Theravada Buddhism, which forms the core of the faith. Buddhists seek refuge in the 'triple gem,' consisting of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is primarily composed of the Tripitaka, a collection of three baskets of Buddhist scriptures. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka explores the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism, including the concepts of Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these ideas is key to escaping Sansara, the cycle of birth and death, which is an ongoing process. Along with escaping Sansara will come the end of lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion), ultimately leading to enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth rules for lay followers, such as the five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not engage in misconduct, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental concept in Buddhism is the four noble truths, which include: first, the truth that life is filled with suffering; second, that attachment causes suffering; and third, that suffering can be overcome.",
            "The long-standing rivalry between the United States and Mexico is a prime example of a grueling and protracted conflict that lasted for 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145). The apex of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the U.S. invaded Mexico, seized Texas and the American Southwest, and secured new territory for itself. The two nations clashed repeatedly, with tensions finally easing just before World War I. \n\nWhat sets this rivalry apart from others is the fact that it was fueled by fundamental differences in values, customs, and interests, as well as clashing material ambitions (Schmitt 1974, p. 30-31). It's a common phenomenon among nations that share a border to develop rivalries due to competing interests. The U.S. and Mexico are no exception, although they are not the only countries to have had a long-standing rivalry with their neighbors. David M. Pletcher (1977) notes that Mexico and Cuba are the only two nations where the U.S. has had enduring diplomatic issues (p. 41). \n\nOne major factor that contributed to the rivalry was the issue of religion, a problem that has historically plagued numerous nations. Sally Frahm (2001) points out that Americans in the past were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy, much like their stance against fascism and communism in the 20th century (p.86). This ideological divide was partly fueled by the historical distrust between the English and Spanish, which was inherited by the U.S. and Mexico from their colonial rulers, making it challenging to establish a harmonious relationship between the two nations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) document 17 disputes between Mexico and the U.S. during the 57-year rivalry period, most of which centered on territorial issues, including border raids and frontier problems. Border violence was a significant issue that persisted until both countries exerted military force to control their borders (Schmitt 1974, p. 97). \n\nAs Schmitt (1974) explains, the rivalry began to subside as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the U.S. and America's ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico (p. 109-110). This marked a significant turning point in the relationship between the two nations.",
            "It's been 15 years since my life took a drastic turn due to an illness I had no prior knowledge of. At the time, I was a nurse, a profession I chose for the sense of security and stability it provided, which was a stark contrast to my childhood. The mantra I often heard growing up was that I could always find employment because people would always get sick, so I opted for nursing over my true passions of science and journalism. \n\nHowever, fate had other plans, and I found myself at 46, single, and with no savings. I've been living on Social Security Disability for 15 years now, and I've lost everything that I once considered truly mine. Every day is a struggle, and my sense of security, safety, and self-worth is constantly under attack. The one thing I can be certain of is that I couldn't have made it this far without the unwavering support of my family and a few close friends. When the going gets tough, being strong isn't enough; we all need a helping hand.\n\nMy point is that life is full of unexpected challenges, big and small, and no matter how well we prepare, some things are too great to overcome alone. I agree that our reliance on the government needs to change, but instead of resorting to building our own fallout shelters, I believe it's more important for Americans to learn to trust and help one another. We should be encouraged to ask for help when we need it, rather than trying to go it alone.\n\nThe notion of rugged individualism that our country's conservatives often tout is a misconception. It was the compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources of our forefathers that helped them navigate difficult times, not their ability to go it alone. The pioneers who crossed the country in wagon trains didn't make it by going solo; they had a community that supported them every step of the way.\n\nOf course, preparation is crucial, and I've taken the necessary steps to be ready for any situation. I have a disaster kit, first aid supplies, and other essential items in case of an emergency. However, while we should be prepared, it's equally important to build relationships with those around us. Get to know your neighbors, and work together to create a support system that will see you through the tough times.",
            "The age-old question of why organisms evolve in the way they do remains a mystery. Are there underlying restrictions or constraints that influence the direction and pace of evolutionary change? Despite D'Arcy Thompson's 1917 assertion that zoologists still struggle to define organic forms mathematically, recent advances in mathematical modeling have shed light on various aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis, particularly in terms of ontogeny and phylogeny (Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research aims to explore how mathematical modeling, combined with experimental studies, can help unravel the mechanisms driving evolutionary-developmental change in the genus Prunum. We analyzed X-ray images of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters that can be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were then fed into the CerioShell software program (Stone, 1995), allowing us to create hypothetical shell morphologies that can be used to interpret the boundaries of potential morphological change.\n\nImagine a shell as a three-dimensional tube that navigates through 360 degrees of space over time. The revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are known as whorls, which spiral around an imaginary central axis, or columella. The speed at which whorls grow can vary, and a continuous line separates each whorl, referred to as a suture. Typically, the largest whorl is the last one, or body whorl. The spire is comprised of all whorls except the last, while the apex is the tip of the spire, and the opposite end is called the base. The animal emerges from its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from various angles, including apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. The typical orientation of a shell is apertural, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upwards.\n\nTo count whorls, one should start by viewing the shell from the apical perspective and identifying the first suture. A line can then be drawn to divide the shell into two parts, and whorls can be counted from this line, estimating to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accumulates its shell. By tracing the path of the aperture via the coordinates of each whorl's center and the horizontal and vertical radius, it's possible to graphically and mathematically represent this trajectory. Once a mathematical formulation is established, it's possible to modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis by varying parameters.",
            "The neonatal and infant mortality rates in Indonesia have shown little change over the past decade.  Despite making progress in other areas, such as water and sanitation, the country is falling short of its goals for improving child and maternal health by 2015.  Several factors contribute to this lag, highlighting the need to strengthen the overall health system rather than relying on targeted programs.\n\nOn the surface, Indonesia appears to be making strides in healthcare, with 72% of births now attended by skilled healthcare workers.  However, this statistic includes traditional birth attendants, who may not be equipped to handle complications during pregnancy, resulting in a high number of maternal deaths from hemorrhage.  In reality, these improvements mask a more pressing need for better healthcare service.  Furthermore, there has been a decline in the number of children under five treated for diarrheal diseases, and postnatal care remains a concern, with low rates of care across the country.\n\nThe rate of cesarean sections is surprisingly low, at around 4%, and the disparity between urban and rural areas is striking.  While 7% of urban mothers opt for c-sections, a mere 2% of rural mothers do, indicating a severe imbalance in access to healthcare services.  This not only highlights the issue of geographic disparities but also points to a problem of vertical equity, with a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  The poor are disproportionately affected by out-of-pocket costs, making it even harder for them to access healthcare services.\n\nTo address the shortcomings in neonatal and maternal care, the primary question is how to effectively address the lack of healthcare services.  Should Indonesia focus on developing targeted programs or strengthening the overall health system, moving beyond isolated interventions for pre- and post-pregnancy care?  While program-specific approaches may offer quicker results and targeted objectives, they also have drawbacks.  Investing heavily in one area can divert resources and personnel from other areas, leading to duplication of services and uncoordinated efforts.  This fragmentation can result in an increase in paperwork and administrative costs, detracting from the primary goal of improving healthcare outcomes.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their meticulous attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the time period.  However, two novels, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, stand out as exceptions to this tradition.  These novels seamlessly blend elements of mystery and the bizarre, typical of novels from the period, to create more complex characters.  This approach not only deepens our understanding of their motivations and emotions but also adds an air of intrigue to their stories.\n\nAs the scene unfolds, a multitude of confusing and bewildering ideas flood the protagonist's mind.  The lines between reality and fantasy become blurred, as if he is walking between Sikes and Crackit, who are engaged in a heated dispute.  The words they speak seem to reverberate in his mind, and when he regains his focus, he finds himself conversing with them.  The sudden sound of gunfire shatters the tranquility, and the protagonist's world descends into chaos.  A maelstrom of lights and sounds assaults him, as if an unseen force is propelling him forward.  Throughout this whirlwind of visions, a persistent and gnawing sense of pain torments him, refusing to subside.\n\nIn both novels, this sense of mystery often manifests through dreamlike states or sequences.  These enigmatic occurrences in Oliver Twist frequently reveal the depths of Oliver's inner world, exposing his fears and the true nature of the events unfolding around him.  The recreation of Oliver's near-death experience in chapter 28 is a prime example of this technique.  As he relives the shooting, his senses are heightened, and he becomes trapped in a vivid nightmare.  The unseen force that bears him away serves as a reminder of his lack of control over the events that transpired, as well as the precarious state of his health.  The shooting has a profound impact on Oliver, leaving him feeling powerless and consumed by despair.  This sense of defeat is further reinforced by the notion that his fate was not of his own making, but rather the result of circumstances beyond his control.\n\nIn Wuthering Heights, the lines between reality and fantasy are similarly blurred.  The passage describes a day that seems to pass at an alarming rate, devoid of significance and yet filled with an air of foreboding.  Time appears to be distorted, with the day and night blending together in a seemingly endless cycle.  This sense of disorientation and unease sets the tone for the rest of the novel, hinting at the turmoil and tragedy that lies ahead.",
            "I still remember my time working in an after-school program where I tutored elementary-age students on various subjects. My strengths lay in English and reading, and I was often approached by instructors to help students who were struggling. One student, a boy named Adrian, really stood out to me; he was around third or fourth grade and was having a lot of trouble reading. However, it became apparent that something was off - he could pronounce some letters perfectly, while others were way off. It was a fascinating phenomenon. Despite his Latino background, Adrian spoke perfect English, which made it even more puzzling.\n\nIt wasn't until I met his mother, who didn't speak a word of English but only Spanish, that the solution became clear. I was struggling to communicate with her using my limited Spanish skills, but it hit me like a ton of bricks - Adrian's reading issues were due to his unfamiliarity with the English alphabet. I'm not sure if this revelation made a significant impact on his learning, but I hope he's doing better now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the language barrier problem in schools, particularly in California. It's not always as obvious as we think, and even students who speak perfect English can still struggle with reading. It's a complex issue that requires a multifaceted solution.\n\nIn Adrian's case, the solution was straightforward - English reading tutoring, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for students who barely speak English, the solution is much more complex. There's no one-size-fits-all answer, and a combination of methods is essential. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes, and more - each has its own merits, but none can solve the problem on its own.\n\nThe dual language system is a great concept that benefits not just children who speak Spanish as their first language but all students. Research has shown that children in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. Many people are skeptical, fearing it's a waste of resources and that most students won't benefit. But this is a misconception. If we implemented these programs as the norm, rather than the exception, all students would reap the rewards.\n\nSo, how do we make this work? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? That would be unrealistic and unreasonable. Instead, we can provide special aids, tutors, or whatever you want to call them, who are bilingual. This way, we can create a more inclusive and supportive learning environment that caters to the diverse needs of all students.",
            "Most of us have been told as children that there's something greater than us out there, something beyond our understanding.  We've been sent to Sunday school, Temple, or on inner journeys in search of answers.  Some of us accept the faith passed down by our parents without question, while others strongly reject it, and some of us even switch sides, adopting new values and then changing our minds again.  Ultimately, we're all on a path to define ourselves and our place in the universe through our own unique perspectives on spirituality.  We're all searching for a guiding light in the darkness to lead us out of the shadows and into the light.\n\nI still remember the day my dad told me his favorite bird was the cardinal.  We sat on our front porch during a rainy June evening, listening to the sound of rain pounding on the tin roof.  The gutters were overflowing, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  My dad looked out into the rain, a mix of searching and remembering in his eyes.  He was thinner and his clothes hung loosely from his body.  His hair was sparse and thin, and he avoided eye contact.  I felt scared, alone, and unsure how to talk to him about how much I'd miss him.  So I hugged him, moved my chair closer, and joined him in gazing out into the rain.\n\nMy dad passed away in December, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation hadn't eased his suffering, but had kept him alive for a few more months.  I couldn't understand the value of keeping him alive in that state, but I couldn't define it either.  If God existed, I thought, he'd stopped listening to me long ago.  So I didn't pray.  I just sat in the darkness, unable to bear watching my father slip away.\n\nI didn't want to see him leave this life behind.  So I turned away.  I wanted to remember my dad for who he was, not for how he died.  I knew my dad better than anyone, and I knew he wouldn't want me to watch him go.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days, waiting for the news.  But no one called.",
            "In essence, the term \"Gothic Novel\" is an oxymoron, as Ian Watt so aptly put it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel – a perfect blend of the old and the new. The Gothic mode has received a mixed bag of reactions over the years, with some criticizing it for lacking depth, while others praise it for its unique ability to evoke a sense of the \"terrible sublime.\"  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, was a pioneering work that combined elements from both the \"ancient\" and \"modern\" romances to create a new form of literary expression. Walpole's innovative approach involved merging old theatrical elements with the newer, more personal storytelling style of modern novels. This unique fusion allowed him to create what he called \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre is characterized by its use of archaic elements from medieval theatre, architecture, and traditions. When The Castle of Otranto was first published, the term \"gothic\" was associated with various cultures, styles, and time periods, and was often viewed as outdated or unsophisticated in comparison to the modern world. However, it's this very combination of the old and the new that has allowed the Gothic genre to endure and seem both archaic and fresh to readers across time.\n\nOne of the key elements of Gothic literature is the concept of chivalry, which plays a significant role in The Castle of Otranto. The medieval idea of chivalry, involving the training of a noble knight, is reinterpreted in this novel. Chivalry was particularly important to Gothic writers like Walpole because it represented an idealized version of knighthood – brave, honorable, and competent. Through the use of chivalric concepts and manners, the Gothic past is romanticized and idealized, foreshadowing the evolution of Gothic literature into Romanticism. In the midst of a tumultuous time, Walpole was likely reflecting on the perceived decline of morality and goodness in society, as embodied by his character Frederic. As the reader learns about Frederic, it's clear that he embodies many chivalric traits – he's a prince who has suffered, been affected by tragedy, and is said to have been killed by infidels. The image of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is exaggerated, bringing in the idea of excess, which would become a staple of the Gothic genre (Walpole 66).",
            "The concept of supply chain management refers to the intricate web of processes that connects the customer's order to the raw materials, production, supply, and distribution stages, ultimately delivering products to the customer. The term supply chain management was coined in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, who described it as the process of planning, implementing, and controlling the entire supply chain to meet customers' needs efficiently. At its core, supply chain management involves six key elements: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers utilize these elements to provide exceptional customer service.\n\nProduction is the cornerstone of the supply chain process. It's crucial to establish a solid foundation for the entire process. Production outlines the when, why, where, and how products will be produced, and managers need to understand customer demands to make informed decisions. By analyzing the market, managers can gauge customer needs and decide on the products to be produced, their quantities, and the production locations that will meet customer expectations. Effective production planning is critical, as every detail matters, and mistakes can lead to costly delays and financial losses. For instance, during my time working at retail stores like Wal-Mart and Target, I saw firsthand how having a well-designed process and layout can streamline operations, reduce confusion, and increase efficiency.\n\nSupply is the second essential element of supply chain management. It involves making strategic decisions about a company's core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. A company may have multiple divisions for a single product, each with unique equipment, workers, and specialties. Managers must determine which division is best suited for each process, and they may also choose to outsource work to other companies to achieve velocity – the ability to provide quality, flexibility, and low costs. By optimizing supply, companies can enhance their competitiveness and customer satisfaction.",
            "I recently came across a haunting reminder of the atrocities that still plague our world today: a sign that reads \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\" Ellen Page, the talented actress known for her role in Juno, holds the sign in a poignant reminder of the injustices that persist in our world. The sign's message is a stark contrast to the beauty of the surrounding area, and it serves as a powerful reminder of the dark history of Burma, also known as Myanmar. This Southeast Asian country has been ruled by a ruthless military junta since 1962, after a brutal coup d'état overthrew the democratically elected government.\n\nIn 2007, a wave of protests swept through the country, known as the Saffron Revolution, named after the color of the robes worn by the brave monks who led the uprising. Despite the initial peaceful nature of the protests, the violence escalated, and the military junta resorted to violence, invading and ransacking monasteries across the country. Foreign journalists were arrested and imprisoned, and a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai was tragically killed while covering the protests.\n\nThis is not an isolated incident. The desire to suppress dissent and maintain control over citizens is a timeless and universal phenomenon. From the Roman emperors who claimed divine right to rule to the Japanese emperors who are still believed to be gods, the pattern of abuse of power is all too familiar. Even in our own country, our leaders have been known to engage in questionable behavior, including weekly conference calls with influential figures like Ted Haggard.\n\nThe examples are numerous and disturbing. The 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in China, where students and intellectuals gathered to demand democratic reform, ended in bloodshed, with estimates of the death toll ranging from 200 to 3,000. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, in which Hutu militia groups and the government systematically killed Tutsis and moderates, is another grim reminder of the dangers of unchecked power. The Holocaust, where six million Jews and millions of others were systematically murdered, is a stark reminder of the horrors that can occur when we turn a blind eye to injustice.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring legacy in jazz is largely attributed to his remarkable longevity and the boundless creativity he brought to his orchestra. While his piano playing is subtle in many of his compositions, as a composer, Ellington excelled at crafting complex, intricately woven pieces that showcased the unique abilities of individual band members. By creating a framework that allowed soloists to freely improvise, Ellington also wrote tightly orchestrated pieces that highlighted the distinct styles of his musicians, resulting in a rich, original sound. His mastery of the individual players' tones and how they blended together in the ensemble enabled him to write some of the most innovative and iconic pieces in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's groundbreaking use of voice as a jazz instrument, citing Creole Love Call as an early example of this approach. This 12-bar blues piece showcases Ellington's ability to incorporate voice without lyrics, adding texture and color to the music. The song features six choruses, each with its unique character, including a call-and-response between voice and reeds, a muted trumpet solo, and a sweeping clarinet solo. The final chorus returns to the first chorus's structure, with the voice taking on a \"growl\" technique, soloing like an instrument. This use of voice as a tone color is a hallmark of Ellington's style, evident throughout his work.\n\nIn Hot and Bothered, Ellington combined his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. He created a call-and-response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing, blending the vocal elements of Miley's playing and the instrumental aspects of Cox's voice to produce a rich and complementary sound. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) further showcases Ellington's mastery of tone color, as he utilizes Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's muted trombone to great effect in introducing the melody.",
            "For as long as she could remember, there was this nagging feeling inside her. A sense of emptiness that seemed unquenchable. It started when she was 14, just entering the tumultuous world of adolescence. Three years later, at 17, the feeling persisted. She had decided that what she wanted wasn't a thing, but a person. Yet, despite her age, she felt no connection to any of the boys who had shown interest. She often pondered this phenomenon, trying to pinpoint the root cause of her disinterest. Her introspection over the years had yielded various theories, but none that truly satisfied her curiosity. As a result, she went through life questioning her desires.\n\nIn her household, days were usually tranquil. Her parents were a peaceful couple, rarely arguing with each other or with her. The only disagreements they had were about her strong will and independent personality. As the daughter of calm and collected individuals, she made up for their even temperament with her lively and fun nature, making her a lovable and well-liked person.\n\nHowever, today was a different story. As she roamed the house in search of inspiration, she was suddenly jolted by a faint scream from the kitchen, followed by her mother's distressed voice. Rushing into the room, she panicked, asking \"Mom, what's wrong?!\" She found her mother lying on the ground, wincing in pain as she gasped \"Ow\" repeatedly. The daughter quickly rushed to her side, placing a hand on her to assist. \"Ouch...sweetie, I...need you to take me to-the hospital.\" The words were strained and urgent, and her daughter could sense her mother's immense pain. \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where to pick you up.\" Her mother directed her, and the daughter was grateful for the physical training she had received. She carried her mother to the car, gently set her in the back, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought a mix of disinfectant and anxious energy, but her daughter's focus remained on helping her mother. She rushed her into the emergency room, calling out for medical help. A team of worried faces gathered, and someone quickly brought a gurney to take her mother to be examined. Her daughter was left to sit anxiously, waiting for news.\n\nIt turned out her mother had fallen off a step stool while trying to retrieve a vase from a high cabinet.",
            "This study aimed to investigate the connection between following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet) and the risk of chronic heart disease and stroke. The study assessed the association between a high score on the \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet\" and a reduced risk of heart disease and stroke. The aMed diet is a variation of the Med diet that emphasizes the consumption of plant-based foods such as fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, as well as monounsaturated fats and fish, while reducing the intake of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is also part of this diet.\n\nEarlier studies have found that adhering to the Med diet is linked to a lower risk of mortality from heart disease and stroke. However, these studies did not specifically examine the relationship between the Med diet and stroke. \n\nTo conduct this research, the study followed 74,886 women between the ages of 38 and 63 who were participants in the Nurses' Health Study. Over the course of 20 years, from 1984 to 2004, the researchers calculated the women's aMed diet scores based on their self-reported food intake. The study used a food frequency questionnaire to assess nutrient intake, which was validated through several studies. The researchers also collected data on body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and physical activity.\n\nTo account for individual variation and get a more accurate picture of long-term dietary habits, the researchers averaged the aMed scores from multiple questionnaires (two prior years). They also adjusted for potential confounding factors such as age, smoking, body mass index, menopausal status, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nUsing Cox proportional-hazard modeling, the study found that higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with a lower risk of heart disease and stroke in women. During the 20-year follow-up period, the researchers identified 2391 incident cases of heart disease, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths. The findings showed that women in the top aMed quintile had a lower risk of heart disease and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile, with a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "In 2007, the United States experienced a severe financial downturn, marked by rising unemployment, a housing market collapse, and the downfall of several major corporations. The ongoing effects of this crisis have left us wondering: how did this disaster unfold, and how can we prevent it from happening again? The root cause of the crisis lies in the reckless and shortsighted decisions made by politicians, which led banks and firms to issue subprime loans to borrowers without a stable financial foundation. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were forced to purchase and repack these mortgages into complex financial instruments, such as CDO's and CDS's. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were left with a shortage of capital reserves, which they then transferred to the repackaged mortgages and the broader economy.\n\nThe seeds of the financial crisis were sown in 1999, during the Clinton administration's second term. To boost his popularity, the President relaxed lending restrictions, paving the way for the subprime crisis that would strike seven years later. In 1999, Steven Holmes of the New York Times warned of the consequences of these actions, stating that Fannie Mae, the largest mortgage underwriter in the country, was under pressure to expand lending to low- and moderate-income households and maintain its profit margins. Holmes prophetically noted that this could ultimately lead to a government bailout, similar to the one that saved the savings and loan industry in the 1980s. As seen in the introduction, and as Holmes predicted, the reckless lending practices would ultimately lead to an economic meltdown.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the economy's downward spiral, including the increasing complexity of mortgage structures. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO's) were widely used in the years leading up to the crisis, intertwining various sectors of the economy with the housing market. This led to households and financial markets becoming heavily indebted in the housing market, leaving them vulnerable to even minor changes in prices.\n\nThe housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that held mortgage-backed securities were severely affected. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, accounting for approximately 30% of the country's GDP. Ultimately, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at discounted prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subject to stricter regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "There's a point in the story where writers feel the need to take flight, showcasing their skills with elaborate descriptions, but it often ends up putting readers to sleep or making them hit the \"Back\" button in frustration. Dr. Merlin has been known to get frustrated when she gets stuck in lengthy passages that don't have any real significance to the plot.\n\nWriters are often reminded of the fundamental rule, \"Show, don't tell,\" but it's not uncommon for authors to still struggle with excessive exposition. This is where the temptation to dump a load of information on the reader can be overwhelming, making it difficult to engage with the story.\n\nExposition is essentially telling the audience about events or backstory without adding any real value to the plot. In film, this is often seen when one character spouts off a long, unnecessary speech, while in written fiction, the author takes on the role of delivering the information.\n\nLet's take an example. A story might reveal that the heroine met her love interest at a specific time and place, got married in a grand ceremony, and had her husband brutally murdered in front of her. Instead of a two-page summary, the reader would expect to see the husband's character come alive through his words and actions, making his eventual fate all the more impactful. The reader would also expect to see how the heroine's life changed with him, and how his presence affected her thoughts, feelings, and dreams.\n\nIn short, the reader wants more depth to the storyline, \"They met, they married, he died.\" A good writer provides that depth, making the reader emotionally invested in the characters and their story.\n\nIt's easy to get carried away with introducing new characters, their backgrounds, and motivations. Perhaps you're introducing a character who used to be in the Air Force, now runs a gas station at night, has been married twice, and has a secret dream of owning the business. However, it's essential to show, not tell, and provide meaningful context to the story.",
            "I recently watched two newscasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first one I saw was NBC 4's live broadcast on August 13, 2011. The main story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio named Shad Hostettler, who had brutally attacked his wife, although her name was not mentioned. They showed his mug shot, which made him look like a cold-blooded individual. The newscasters only dedicated around two minutes to this story as it was still unfolding. I think they covered it just the right amount of time.\n\nThe second story was about an early morning shooting involving 18-year-old Travis Buyers in the Sharon Woods area. He was critically injured and no arrests had been made at that point. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime scene. This story seemed brief, and I suspect it might have been due to the fact that the victim was a black man from a predominantly black neighborhood. I've noticed a disturbing pattern over the years where minority victims are often overlooked by the media. In contrast, if a white person is a victim of a crime, the media goes into overdrive. It's as if only certain stories deserve attention.\n\nThe next story was about a .22 caliber bullet hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. They provided details about the location of the incident and determined that the bullet was fired from a rifle. The Crime-Stoppers organization is offering a $5,000 reward for any tips that lead to the shooter's identification.\n\nThe newscast then shifted to a story about impending rain and thunderstorms on Saturday afternoon, with temperatures expected to remain in the mid-to-low eighties throughout the weekend. The report was brief, but they used it as a teaser to keep viewers engaged.\n\nThey also covered a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus, where a dark-skinned black man allegedly robbed the store while wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. He was described as being around six feet tall and weighing around 150 pounds. I found it peculiar that they emphasized his skin color and how dark he was.\n\nAnother story was about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin who was convicted of conspiring to distribute large quantities of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. Interestingly, instead of stating his prison sentence as 25 years, they mentioned 300 months. I'm unsure what the reasoning was behind this choice, whether they thought it sounded harsher or what. They also mentioned that he was a Hispanic man, which I don't think was relevant to the story.",
            "A bond between brothers is complex and multifaceted, encompassing a mix of emotions such as love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. This unbreakable connection allows brothers to understand one another in a way that few others can, and they often see themselves reflected in their brother. When situations become dire, the true nature of this bond is revealed, whether it's good or bad. However, these emotions come with significant costs, and understanding them requires dealing with the consequences they bring. When a brother looks into their sibling's eyes, they see their own reflection, not as others see them, but as they truly are. It's in their actions and the consequences of those actions that their character is revealed. In William Faulkner's \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" this theme is explored through the story of two brothers, their tumultuous relationship, and the emotions that drive them.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are driven by a single, dominant emotion: pride. From their first outing together, he harbors resentment towards his younger brother, Doodle, who is born with a weak heart and is unlikely to participate in the physical activities the protagonist longs to share with him. The protagonist's dreams are crushed when he realizes that Doodle will never be able to keep up, and he even considers infanticide, a thought that highlights the depth of his emotional turmoil. However, a fleeting moment of joy when Doodle smiles at him gives the protagonist a glimmer of hope and reveals the underlying love he has for his brother. This dichotomy of emotions – pride and love – ultimately proves to be a pivotal aspect of the protagonist's character development, as he grapples with the consequences of his actions and the true nature of their bond.\n\nThe narrative effectively conveys the complex emotions experienced by the protagonist and his perspective on the world around him through direct characterization of Doodle and their interactions, as well as the narrator's point of view. As the story unfolds, the protagonist's actions become a reflection of his character, and the tragic events that unfold serve as a testament to the profound impact of their bond.",
            "The human brain is a highly complex and creative information-processing system that has been compared to various objects as technology has advanced from simple to sophisticated. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, followed by a book, and more recently, to a computer. However, it's essential to note that these analogies have their limitations and can lead to misconceptions about the brain's workings.\n\nWhen information enters the brain, it's first processed by the sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli, such as touch, heat, sound waves, or light, into electrical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the brain's algorithms through both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing combines basic details like color, orientation, and border information to identify the object as a box. Top-down processing then uses these decisions to speed up recognition, possibly identifying the object as a black box rather than a hole in the background.\n\nAs information is processed, an attention filter determines its importance and decides which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might focus on your name even in a noisy room. This process involves multiple stages, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\n\nFor the brain to process information, it needs to store it first. There are different types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. Initially, information is encoded, with specific types of encoding suited to each type of sensory input. For instance, verbal input can be encoded based on its structure, sound, or meaning. Once stored, information must be maintained, with working memory retaining it for around 20 seconds and long-term memory hypothesized to be stored in the structure of specific proteins.\n\nThere are various models proposing how knowledge is organized in the brain, drawing from human memory retrieval, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model suggests that there are nodes representing concepts, linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might be connected to \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "In Aldous Huxley's dystopian novel, Brave New World, he critiques the looming threats of technology and the capitalist system that underpins it. The novel's portrayal of a society that prioritizes community over individuality and values immediate gratification above all else raises suspicions about the author's views on the emerging economic systems of his time. Through a Marxist lens, Huxley's work appears to be a commentary on the pitfalls of the capitalist structure, as evident from the use of Marxist terminology such as homogeny, reification, and false consciousness.\n\nThe novel satirizes capitalism by employing the concept of false consciousness, where the common people are kept ignorant of their true economic standing and are instead driven by a desire for personal gain. This is achieved through the conditioning of the population, particularly the lower classes, to focus on consumption, indulgence, and spending, as seen in the use of hypnopædia in the novel. The World Controller manipulates this drive, reinforcing the idea that the masses are dominated by a more powerful group, exemplifying the concept of hegemony.\n\nThe lack of genuine relationships between individuals is a notable aspect of Brave New World, with characters lacking depth and individuality. This may suggest that Huxley believes technology and capitalism are eroding human free will and emotional expression. Interactions between characters are superficial, with a focus on physical appearance and shallow conversations, further highlighting the effects of capitalist conformity.\n\nThe absolute obedience of each social class to their predetermined role in society is also a telling aspect of the novel, echoing Marxist ideas about the proletariat's false sense of superiority. By examining Huxley's work through a Marxist lens, it becomes clear that his novel is a commentary on the dangers of unchecked capitalist systems and their impact on human relationships and individuality.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many of us, getting around campus can be a real challenge. My experience with this issue started during my freshman year, when I was stuck in an East Halls dorm room, which might as well have been on the edge of campus, especially when you factor in the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. I'd often spend up to 25 minutes on foot, battling through the unpredictable State College weather, just to get from my home in Stuart Hall to classes like those held in the Willard building near the center of campus. Recently, I spoke to an alumnus who's not much older than me, and they shared some insight on how things used to be. Not long ago, the East Halls dorms were isolated from the rest of the school by large tracts of unused land. However, those empty spaces have since been filled with sports fields, new buildings like the Creamery and health services building, and surrounding apartment complexes. As our campus continues to expand, navigating it's becoming increasingly difficult. So, what's the solution to this mobility problem? For a college campus like ours, I firmly believe that the answer lies in the bicycle. But, it's not just about having a bike; students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be designed with bicyclists in mind.\n\nI had a conversation with a friend who recently picked up biking again after a multi-year hiatus, and he said, \"Bikes are great – for a few years, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" Not only is biking good for your physical health, it's also the most efficient way to travel. With a bowl of oatmeal and some physical exertion, you can cover distances of 30 miles or more. As an off-campus student, I'm just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. Buying a bike this year was one of the smartest decisions I made. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, which would take me 25 minutes to walk from my home. However, riding a bike can cut that time down to just 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the most direct route to Thomas building from my house, but it's not always an easy road to navigate, bike or not. While there are benefits to walking as well, personally, I'm too busy to walk. If I didn't have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class, taking over two and a half hours out of my week. Add that to the time I'd spend walking to other classes, appointments, and so on, and that's more time than I can spare."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "As I pursue a career in social work, I aspire to dedicate myself to helping children who have been abused or neglected through the Division of Family and Children Services. My personal values of service, respect, and a strong moral compass will serve as cornerstones in my field, as well as in my personal growth. These principles are not only essential for social workers but also deeply ingrained in my own character. I've always been driven to make a positive impact, and my experiences throughout high school and college have only strengthened my resolve. I've witnessed individuals struggling with their problems and resorting to unhealthy coping mechanisms. This led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology, which I completed at Piedmont College in 2009. However, I wasn't entirely sure of my career path at the time. It wasn't until I had a pivotal encounter with a troubled teenager that I became determined to make a difference in the lives of families and children. This young boy, who was being abused by his parents, had reached out to a friend of mine, and I was inspired to take action. I spoke with the police and the parents, expressing my concerns as a recent graduate with a degree in Psychology. This experience solidified my decision to pursue a career in social work, driven by a desire to support children who are caught in the midst of \"simple\" family disputes.\n\nAnother important value in social work is social justice. As a society, we often emphasize the importance of individuality, yet we often conform to societal norms and expectations. I, on the other hand, have never been afraid to express my individuality and challenge social injustices. Throughout my time in high school and college, I've actively spoken out against racism and discrimination, wearing clothing that reflects my personality, and even piercing my ears in a way that feels authentic to me. My involvement with the GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance) has also been a significant part of my journey towards advocating for social justice. I believe in the power of standing up for what is right, even in the face of adversity.",
            "This paper explores the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The Biological model focuses on genetic information passed down and medical aspects of health, while the Sociocultural model examines environmental factors, such as race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review will examine these models and explain the research chosen to relate to and better understand them. A critique of the research and its findings will also be provided, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nInsomnia can be categorized as a primary sleep disorder, a disorder related to another mental condition, or a disorder linked to other medical issues. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssonmias (such as insomnia and hypersomnia) and Parasomnias (like nightmares and sleepwalking disorders). Sleep disorders related to another mental condition involve difficulties with sleep due to Axis I or Axis II disorders. Research on insomnia and primary sleep disorders will be examined in relation to the Biological and Sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model focuses on genetic factors, heritable traits, and physiological aspects of sleep disorders. One study using mice found that neurons in the hypothalamus, specifically those containing orexin, play a crucial role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. The study discovered that specific GABAB receptors on these neurons influence sleep-wake states. Activation of the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, while inhibition of this receptor can lead to reduced anxiety and induce sleep. Furthermore, the GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time in mice, suggesting that this receptor plays a significant role in human sleep regulation. This research implies that genetic and environmental factors can affect the functioning of this receptor, potentially leading to sleep disorders. A sociocultural implication of this study is that inherited traits can influence sleep patterns, and alterations in the receptor could naturally disrupt sleep, affecting daily life and tasks that require focus and concentration.",
            "The following paper delves into the realm of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), a condition that affects the way the brain interprets auditory information. To begin with, it's essential to understand what CAPD entails. In simple terms, it refers to the brain's inability to effectively process sounds, despite the individual having normal hearing. This disorder is not related to hearing impairment but rather to the brain's difficulty in distinguishing conversations from background noise, separating words, or differentiating between various sounds.\n\nThe roots of CAPD can be traced back to the 1950s when researchers first identified it as \"auditory imperception.\" The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari pioneered the development of tests for children with communicative disorders in 1954, and in 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing, providing a model to explain the brain's physiology in processing dichotic perception.\n\nCAPD manifests itself in various ways, including difficulty localizing sounds in space, distinguishing between multiple sounds, recognizing sound patterns, and differentiating changes in speech. Furthermore, individuals with CAPD may struggle to synthesize sound clues, interpret sequences of auditory information, or filter out background noise. \n\nTo diagnose CAPD, a comprehensive evaluation must be conducted, typically involving audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, or other healthcare professionals. This process may include a range of assessments, such as questionnaires, surveys, and observations of auditory behaviors. While there is no single, universally accepted test for CAPD, various tools are used to evaluate auditory-related skills and diagnose the disorder. These assessments may present individuals with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and ask them to identify specific items, such as words or numbers.\n\nIn conclusion, teachers in mainstreamed classrooms can play a vital role in supporting students with CAPD by being aware of the common characteristics or \"red flags\" associated with the disorder. By recognizing the signs, they can provide accommodations and strategies to help students with CAPD overcome their challenges and succeed academically.",
            "The play Twelfth Night warns us that while deception can be a useful tool for hiding the truth, it can also lead to a loss of one's true identity. However, the act of revealing one's deception can have a different cost altogether – alienation. This raises a difficult question: should one prioritize their own sense of self or their relationships with others. While some people may react neutrally to being fooled, others may feel deeply hurt and betrayed by the deception.\n\nIn the context of gender role reversal, the issue of deception becomes even more complicated. One of the main questions that arises is why someone would choose to take on a disguise in the first place. In the case of Viola, her decision to dress as a man is a means of self-preservation. As she says, \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town / Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help / I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" (5.1.247-249).\n\nHowever, Viola's disguise not only protects her from those who might harm her, but also cuts her off from the support system of women around her. Furthermore, her convincing performance as a man even leads Olivia to fall in love with her, which adds an extra layer of complexity to the situation. On top of that, Viola has to navigate her own romantic desires, which are suppressed by her disguise as a male servant.\n\nOne interpretation of the play is that deception can be a catalyst for revealing hidden emotions. The characters of Olivia and Orsino may have subconscious desires that are only brought to the surface by Viola's disguise. For instance, is Olivia truly attracted to Cesario because he appears to be a man, or does she secretly harbor feelings for women? While it's unlikely that Shakespeare intended to suggest that Olivia is a lesbian, her character does seem to be parodying the people of his time who judged others based on appearance.\n\nThis is evident in the way Olivia quickly switches her affections from Cesario to Sebastian and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as a family member rather than a romantic interest. The line \"A sister, you are she\" (5.1.315) is a telling moment that suggests Olivia's feelings for Cesario are not romantic, but rather a form of affection and acceptance.",
            "I've always been fascinated by the history of German colonial rule, and one of the most striking aspects is its brutal nature, especially with regards to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. However, it's essential to note that the German colonial empire was incredibly diverse in its policies and approaches, much like its geography. When it comes to education, the provision of schools across the colonies varied significantly. For instance, when the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans, which was a testament to the German efforts in that region. In contrast, the situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) was drastically different. Unlike in East Africa, where the government played a significant role in the education of the natives, the task of educating the locals in South West Africa was largely left to missionary societies that received limited government support. This approach had a lasting impact on the colony, even after German rule ended. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa \"the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" Several social, political, and economic factors contributed to this divergent experience, and this paper aims to delve deeper into these factors and examine new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nThere's an abundance of literature available on education in the German colonial empire, with many sources written in German during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. These early works primarily aimed to describe the characteristics of the educational systems in these colonies. Later studies in English expanded the discussion through comparative analyses of education in the various German colonies and more in-depth examinations of specific aspects of education. These studies revealed significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. A notable work that addresses the topic of this paper is Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa, which compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing features of the colony's educational system.\n\nSouth West Africa stood out from Germany's other colonial possessions due to its relatively temperate climate, despite the arid desert covering much of the territory. This favorable climate was reflected in the European population of South West Africa, with nearly 15,000 whites residing in the colony by 1913, compared to only 5,336 in East Africa, which had the next largest settler population.",
            "The world of popular music has undergone a significant transformation over the past 100 years, with an incredible number of genres emerging. It's getting increasingly hard to give a definitive list of all the sub-genres that have branched out from the major genres, like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk. Heavy metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres in the past 40 years. Its expressiveness stems from its wide range of emotions, with a clear bias towards the darker side of the emotional spectrum. \n\nHeavy metal's diversity is evident in how it branched out into various sub-genres right from the start. This diversity allowed people to experiment and create their own unique styles, giving birth to a chain of sub-sub-genres that continues to this day. Today, the heavy metal movement has become so vast that it's tricky to pinpoint what exactly constitutes heavy metal music. It has incorporated a wide range of themes from other genres, but, like everything else, it originated from somewhere. To truly understand the metal music that surrounds us, it's essential to grasp the core of the metal movement and why it's a movement rather than just a genre.\n\nThe term \"metal\" is often associated with darkness, and, in many ways, it's a music of excess - more bass, more volume, more violence, and more theatricality. Metal musicians are known for their exceptional skills, and it shows in their music. Another defining characteristic of the metal movement is its strong connection to substance use. The mid-70s saw a psychedelic drug boom, which led to people creating out-of-this-world records, using their experiences with these substances as inspiration. Metal music is characterized by its dark, visceral qualities, which were a refreshing change from the more upbeat and cheerful aspects of popular music at the time. Later generations of metal drew inspiration from the dark, raw qualities of the Romantic Era. Lyrics like these showcase the darkness that's a staple of the movement:\n\n\"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles is an example of how the genre came to be. It's a song that captures the highs and lows, supposedly inspired by the darker side of substance use. Many consider it one of the first heavy metal songs, a response to the Rolling Stones' heavier and darker side. The Beatles aimed to prove they could be just as heavy as their rivals, placing this song on their iconic album, The White Album.",
            "Before the Surrealist artists began creating their dreamlike masterpieces, Henri Rousseau was bringing his own dreams to life. Literally and figuratively, his 1910 painting, The Dream, showcases not just a woman marveling at the wonders of a dream world, but also Rousseau's personal aspirations as an artist. For years, he'd dreamed of being recognized, admired, and praised by fellow artists and art enthusiasts, but he faced a tough internal dilemma: conform to the art world's expectations by mimicking popular styles, or stay true to himself and forge his own path. This internal struggle is beautifully captured in The Dream, a painting that reflects Rousseau's long-standing conflict between artistic conformity and creative independence.\n\nTo truly appreciate The Dream, it's essential to understand Rousseau's life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, northwest France, Rousseau was the son of a tinsmith and hardware dealer who enjoyed a comfortable middle-class lifestyle. Unlike many artists of his time, Rousseau didn't receive any formal art training. Instead, he worked as a municipal toll service employee, earning the nickname \"douanier\" or customs inspector, until he was 40. His life took a dramatic turn after the death of his first wife, Clémence, and eight infant children left him with only one surviving child, Julia, and a deep sense of loss. He turned to painting as a way to cope and start anew. Unlike many of his contemporaries, who romanticized the peasant in their work, Rousseau was a folk painter who drew from the hopes and dreams of the common people.\n\nRousseau's desire for recognition from the art world is understandable, given his background and the fact that he began his career at an older age, competing with other talented artists who were already well-established. It wasn't until around the same time that Matisse was gaining recognition that Rousseau started to receive proper recognition for his art. According to art historian Jan Gordon, Rousseau and Matisse differed not only in style and subject matter but also in their motivations for painting. While Matisse was driven by a fear of creating art that was too conventional, Rousseau's goal was to create something so ordinary that he'd be accepted into the Artiste Français.",
            "The notion that ethics and aesthetics are intertwined has long been explored by various thinkers, with many positing a fundamental connection between truth and beauty. I firmly believe there's a reason behind this idea. John Keats' famous words from \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\" - \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know\" - highlight the connection between the two. It seems that our appreciation of ethics and aesthetics isn't solely learned through education or experience but rather arises from a deeper, more intuitive understanding.\n\nBoth ethics and aesthetics attempt to describe rather than prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty aim to explain why a particular art piece or literary work is beautiful or why an action is morally sound, rather than providing a set of rules to judge or create good art or moral behavior. The essence of what makes art or morals great cannot be fully captured through criticism. Discussing the value of, for example, da Vinci's Mona Lisa may involve analyzing concepts like foreground, background, and cultural context, but these factors don't truly convey why it's considered a masterpiece. When asked about a favorite work of art or literature, people often respond with a phrase like \"There's just something about it,\" followed by a more in-depth explanation.\n\nI believe that both art and morals can't be reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor noted, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Similarly, no matter how thoroughly we describe the properties of a literary work, there's an intangible, transcendent aspect that remains. This is echoed in Wittgenstein's statement that \"ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" I propose that this \"something,\" this je ne sais quoi, is art and morality's most powerful attribute. The transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a common ground between them.\n\nI believe that morality and art are closely related because we experience both at a noumenal level, a term coined by Kant. They impact us on a level that can be felt but not fully explained. This connection is even stronger in literature, which, as McKean notes, is distinguished by its moral quality. Standards of morality are as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Literature's importance lies in the values we find within it, and it's these values that make it unique among the arts.",
            "The Germany we see today is a nation with a unique blend of cultures, from the snow-capped Alps to the shores of the Baltic Sea. This diverse cultural identity is reflected in the country's varied regions, from the bustling streets of Munich to the historic city of Dresden, nestled along the Elbe River. Considering Germany's rich history and the influences that have shaped it, it's no surprise that the country's identity is a result of various ethnic groups and tribes.\n\nThe origins of the name \"Germania\" are shrouded in mystery, with scholars and historians offering different theories. Some believe it stems from the name of a Germanic tribe known as the Tungrians, whom Tacitus called the Germans before they crossed the Rhine and clashed with the Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar also used the term \"Germanus\" in his account of the Gallic Wars, using it to distinguish between the Gauls and the Germanic tribes he encountered. Caesar likely borrowed the word from the Gauls themselves, who used it to describe their neighbors. In his writings, Caesar noted that the Germans lived across the Rhine, continually at odds with the Gauls (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC).\n\nOther theories suggest that the name \"Germania\" comes from the spear used in ancient warfare, known as a \"ger.\" Alternatively, it may be derived from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" implying that the Germans were known for their loud and boisterous nature. \n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus wrote extensively on the origins of the Germans in his work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" (98 AD). He described the Germans as an indigenous people, untouched by external influences, who lived in a harsh and unforgiving land. Tacitus noted that the Romans would not have chosen to emigrate to such a place unless it was their ancestral homeland. As a result, Germanic tribes lived on the periphery of the Roman Empire, trading goods and skills with the Romans, who would occasionally launch campaigns into Germania (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17).",
            "My train of thought had hit a brick wall, and I was staring blankly ahead, trying to process the scene in front of me.  I was numb, unemotional, and detached, but my mind was working overtime, analyzing every detail without really connecting it to anything meaningful.  Thoughts flashed through my head, only to disappear just as quickly, leaving me with a sense of detachment from my own thoughts.\n\nFor years, I'd been fascinated with drawing, ever since I was a kid.  Recently, I'd picked up an art instruction book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\" and was determined to learn the techniques.  One of the exercises involved placing a square frame around any picture you wanted to study, breaking down a complex scene into something more manageable.  But as I gazed down at the, ahem, \"art\" in front of me, I couldn't even wrap my head around that concept.  I was too caught up in the sheer overwhelmingness of it all.\n\nIn the world of art, some people focus on specific themes or colors.  Picasso went through a blue phase, Monet loved greenery, and the Renaissance masters were known for their use of vibrant colors.  If I was going to consider myself an artist, I thought, then this toilet bowl was my blank canvas, the start of my masterpiece, which I'd dubbed \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nMy hand instinctively reached for the toilet handle, but this time, my mind was racing with possibilities.  Water swirled, and I felt a surge of creative energy.  But instead of a masterpiece, I was faced with something far less inspiring.  The toilet paper roll was stuck, and I was left to deal with it.\n\nI gripped the mop handle tightly and stood there, feeling irritated and frustrated.  My green tie felt like a noose around my neck, and I scowled at the offending mess in front of me.  A few more flushes, a few more moments of introspection, and then I was up to the task at hand.  I reached for the toilet paper, wrapped my hand in it like a mummy, and slowly, deliberately, I plunged it into the bowl, like a mom preparing a Thanksgiving turkey for the oven.",
            "It's unsettling to see the alarming number of teenagers who are losing their lives behind the wheel.  Several factors contribute to this deadly trend among young American drivers.  One significant aspect is that the teenage brain isn't mature enough to handle the risks associated with driving, as explained by the National Institutes of Health. Additionally, inexperience plays a substantial role in this issue, resulting in higher rates of fatal accidents, vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nIt's no surprise that teens are more prone to accidents when driving with their peers, which unfortunately happens quite frequently.  A study conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center revealed a correlation between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents.  In response, California and other states have implemented provisional driver's licenses that restrict the hours teens can drive and ban other minors as passengers. \nWhile these temporary licenses are a step in the right direction, I believe they are merely a temporary solution.  The underlying issue is that, statistically speaking, the youngest drivers are not equipped to handle the risks and responsibilities of driving.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman suggests that 18 is still too young for a standard driver's license.  His research, as reported by USA Today, indicates that those under the age of 19-20 are more likely to engage in risk-taking behavior for the thrill of it.  It makes sense, then, to delay driving until this behavior has subsided.  If we continue to grant driver's licenses to young teens, we can expect to see even more devastating accidents and an unprecedented death toll in the coming years.  By 2010, the Baby Boomer generation's children will be eligible to drive, leading to millions of new teen drivers taking to the roads. \nImplementing legislation to address this issue would be a reasonable and straightforward process.  Schools could continue to offer driver's education classes to initiate the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 should be allowed to operate a vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued before granting a full license, with a set number of practical driving hours required.  This number could be based on the typical hours required by most states (in California, for example, drivers need 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  National legislation addressing this issue would be a fair and effective way to protect young drivers across the country. \nMy proposed legislation is not a new idea, but rather a common-sense approach to addressing a pressing concern.",
            "I recently stumbled upon the fascinating world of early Edison films, specifically the trick films from the Library of Congress's collection. Out of the 15 films from 1895 to 1901, I made it a point to watch them all. Trick films, also known as illusion films, rely heavily on creative editing to create an air of wonder and illusion. My in-depth study of these films focused on understanding the underlying poetics and examining the unique characteristics that set the later films apart. \n\nInterestingly, most trick films from the late 19th and early 20th centuries adhere to a strict set of conventions. These early films take place within the confines of a stage, framed by a frontal proscenium, and are typically shot from a single, static position. The camera never deviates from this position, even when characters or objects move within the scene. This composition style was borrowed from the world of theatre and vaudeville, where performers would often move within a fixed frame. This means that characters in these early films often move side-to-side, but never towards or away from the camera.\n\nTake, for instance, the classic film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move horizontally across the frame, never deviating from the fixed position of the camera. Even when they disappear from view, the camera remains stationary.\n\nAnother notable aspect of early trick films is the limited use of camera angles. Long shots and medium shots are the norm, while close-ups are almost nonexistent. This is due in part to the theatrical tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance within the frame of the stage. Actors rarely move towards or away from the camera, making close-ups a rare occurrence.\n\nThe one-shot-per-film rule is also a defining characteristic of early trick films. This limitation restricts the length of these films to around a minute or less, depending on the frame rate used. Most trick films focus on short, vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic and disappearing acts, rather than developing a narrative. However, a closer examination often reveals that what appears to be a single shot can, in fact, be composed of multiple joined shots, cleverly edited to create an illusion. Take, for example, The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), where a single conceptual shot is actually comprised of several physical shots.\n\nThese early trick films laid the groundwork for the development of cinematic techniques, pushing the boundaries of what was possible with film. Despite their limitations, they remain an essential part of film history, offering a glimpse into the creative experimentation and innovation of the early days of cinema.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an outspoken advocate for Republicanism in the early days of the United States.  As an agriculturalist and a politician, he was known for his unwavering dedication to individual freedom and limited government.  His strong belief in the superiority of an agrarian system influenced his views on governance, sovereignty, and the judicial system.  He was determined to preserve and promote this ideal, often using it as the foundation for his arguments. \n\nTaylor believed that the US had a unique opportunity to create an ideal system of government, free from the constraints of established traditions.  He firmly believed in the natural rights of individuals, which he saw as interconnected and interdependent – if one right was denied, the value of the remaining rights would be diminished.  He advocated for these rights to be beyond government interference.  He also believed that the so-called \"state of nature\" was a reality where the strong and cunning exploited the weak, but that this should not be the case in civilization.\n\nTo create an ideal society, Taylor proposed a government that acknowledged both the good and evil inherent in humanity.  He had a rigid viewpoint on dualistic morality, stating that government, being run by humans, would inherently reflect both virtues and vices.  He defined good principles as those that protected private property, promoted agriculture, and discouraged capitalism, believing that a government founded on these principles would function fairly regardless of its leadership, which would always be driven by self-interest and avarice.  He believed that self-interest was a natural motivation for humans, but only became problematic when it led to the creation of sub-societies that exploited others.\n\nTaylor, like many other Republicans of his time, advocated for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He sought an extremely limited Federal government with no powers beyond those explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He recognized that an extensive government was expensive and prone to despotism, but also believed that a simplistic, literal interpretation was precarious and open to corruption.  Furthermore, he saw the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the United States, as it more clearly described the country as a group of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "In looking back at the project's data, there was a significant drop in commuter log submissions in the third month, which was a bit disheartening, and it's hard to pinpoint the exact reason for this decline. Considering the onset of winter at our New England campus, it's likely that the drop in people commuting by bicycle or on foot contributed to this decrease. Additionally, December marks the end of the fall semester, a time when students and faculty are busy with schoolwork, processing grades, and preparing for the holidays. As a result, filling out the commuter log may have fallen by the wayside for many. Furthermore, December is the start of the busy holiday season, followed by a month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many don't need to be on campus. Classes resume in late January, which might explain the low number of submissions for that month. However, none of these reasons fully account for the low number of submissions in February. It's also possible that the initial enthusiasm for the project naturally waned over time. To combat this, we introduced Carpool Challenge Week, a special campaign in March that resulted in an increase in log submissions. Despite our efforts, we still faced the challenges of maintaining momentum in the face of natural fluctuations and the unique challenges of the academic calendar. \n\nAnother challenge we encountered was the deeply ingrained preference for the freedom and independence that comes with driving a car. This is a cultural norm that's difficult to overcome. To incentivize alternative modes of commuting, we offered prizes in the form of gift certificates to local businesses, which seemed to be effective at the outset. It would have been interesting to see how larger prizes, such as a new bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car, might have impacted participation, potentially reviving the project's momentum and combatting the dip in engagement. Our prize offerings remained consistent throughout the project, but increasing the value of the prizes over time might have made a difference. The initial gift cards seemed sufficient, but announcing additional, more substantial prizes, such as bicycles or alternative fuel vehicles, in the later stages of the project might have boosted participation.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a type of investment security that offers the benefits of an index fund, such as diversification, but with more flexibility and trading capabilities like a stock. Unlike traditional index funds, ETFs allow you to buy and sell shares throughout the day, giving you the freedom to sell short, buy on margin, and even purchase as few as a single share in any transaction. One of the major advantages of ETFs is their expense ratios, which are significantly lower than those of the average mutual fund. However, there are some drawbacks to consider, including the need to pay a commission on each trade, just like when buying or selling a stock. Another benefit of ETFs is the wide range of options available, with various funds tracking different indices, commodities, or baskets of assets.\n\nIn evaluating the performance of a specific ETF, such as the IHF, it's essential to assess whether the stated benefits, like diversification, are actually effective and to what extent. To do this, we'll be examining the top 10 holdings of the IHF and comparing their performance to a hypothetical portfolio consisting of the same stocks in the same proportions. This will help us determine whether the benefits of owning a single ETF are comparable to those of a diversified portfolio of individual stocks.\n\nTo keep our analysis manageable, we've decided to focus on the top 10 holdings, which account for approximately 63.58% of the ETF's assets. Below, we'll outline these holdings and their corresponding percentages.\n\nTo estimate how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF as a whole, we can use the current asset allocation to calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return, as if the portfolio consisted entirely of these 10 stocks in the same proportions. The calculations are presented in the chart below.\n\nThe results show that a portfolio consisting only of the top 10 holdings would yield a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. Additionally, the Beta of this portfolio is 0.12 lower than the ETF's Beta. These findings suggest that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings may provide a higher return with a lower risk. However, it's essential to consider whether these differences are statistically significant.\n\nTo address this, we've calculated the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalized it to 100% to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "One of Edgar Allan Poe's personal favorites is the poem \"Dream-Land\". In this poem, Poe uses the term \"Thulé\" twice, which is a significant reference that sheds light on his influences.  Tom Mabbott, a literary scholar, notes that Poe likely borrowed \"Thulé\" from the ancient Roman poet Virgil. However, it's also possible that Poe was inspired by a more contemporary source: his admiration for German author Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. \n\nThis connection is significant because it demonstrates Poe's familiarity with Goethe's work. In his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon\", literary critic Karl J. Arndt highlights the similarities between Poe's poem and Goethe's writing style, suggesting that Poe may have been influenced by Goethe's work. \n\nInterestingly, Goethe was a prominent writer of the poetic drama \"Faust\", which was published in two parts: the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of his death. Within the second part of \"Faust\" lies a short poem called \"The King of Thulé\", which tells the story of a king who loses his wife and becomes consumed by grief and drinking. The description of the King of Thulé bears a striking resemblance to the persona in \"Dream-Land\", which could be seen as a dark reflection of Poe's own experiences with loss and addiction. \n\nGoethe's work was widely known and admired during Poe's time, and it's likely that Poe was familiar with it through his respect for fellow poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson. Poe even expressed admiration for Tennyson, which suggests that he would have been aware of Goethe's work. In fact, Goethe's \"Faust\" was widely reproduced and translated after its initial publication, making it easily accessible to Poe and other writers of his time.\n\nIt's worth noting that Poe references Thule twice in his writings, both times using the phrase \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and \"Dream-Land\". The two poems can be seen as companion pieces, as they share a similar themes and imagery. In \"Dream-Land\", the speaker describes a desolate landscape of Thule, haunted by the spirits of the dead and devoid of color. This can be seen as a dark reflection of Goethe's \"The King of Thulé\", in which the king is consumed by grief and loss after the death of his wife.",
            "In California, could a customer who slipped and fell on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages if the store manager was informed twice about the spill but didn't clean it for over 30 minutes while he ate dinner? The answer is not a simple one. A judge is unlikely to dismiss the customer's claim out of hand. To receive punitive damages, the customer must show that the store manager acted with reckless disregard for the harm that would come from not cleaning the spill. The customer can argue that the manager should have known about the potential dangers because multiple customers had slipped and fallen on spills in the same store before. Despite this knowledge, the manager still chose not to clean the spill. While it's debatable whether the manager's actions were truly malicious, it's hard to deny that his behavior was irresponsible given the number of previous slip-and-fall incidents in 2009.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee informed the manager, Paul Martin, of the applesauce spill. Martin told him to handle it later, saying he was on dinner break. Fifteen minutes later, another employee reminded Martin about the spill, but he responded in the same manner. At 5:30 pm, the customer, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill, suffering a serious back injury. In the months leading up to this accident, there had been five other slip-and-fall incidents at the store. Palmer is now suing the store for damages related to her injury, and we're examining whether to file a motion to dismiss the claim for punitive damages.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of duty if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm or, in the absence of intent, was done with a willful and conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others. Courts have deemed conduct malicious when the defendant was aware of the potential dangers and chose to ignore them. In this case, the customer can argue that the manager was aware of the potential harm and failed to take action, making a strong case for punitive damages.",
            "It's been almost four years since I took a course in Islam at CBC, and the question of whether Islam is a hostile religion still resonates with me today.  The events that have unfolded since 9/11 have led to a shift in the way mass media portrays Islam in America, moving from a negative perception to an extreme form of tolerance.  I think it's remarkable that we've come to a point where a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, with a Muslim background, could run for office without being met with the same level of scrutiny.\n\nThe Biography of the Prophet Muhammad has left an impression on me, particularly because it seems to contradict the image of Muhammad that I had formed based on my previous knowledge.  From what I understood, Muhammad was a conqueror who forced tribes to adopt Islam after taking over, but the biography portrays him as a humble and misunderstood figure who was respected and sought out by people who saw the truth in his teachings.\n\nI've also noticed some striking similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the miracles attributed to Muhammad.  One example that stands out is the story of how he multiplied food to feed a large crowd, much like Jesus did with the loaves and fish.  This writing style makes me wonder if the authors were trying to depict Muhammad as a humble prophet who didn't need to prove anything, but simply lived a life of truth and miracles.  To me, this approach downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ, and it's like they're trying to take credit for his personhood and life through Muhammad.\n\nThe biography also includes many stories that seem to be part of an agenda to provide proof of the truth of Islam, but these stories often come from secondary or tertiary sources.  This makes them seem suspicious and less convincing to me, as I think it's harder to verify their accuracy.\n\nWhat bothers me most about this work is the way it tries to portray Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, wise, and gentle.  However, historical accounts suggest that Muhammad was a more complex figure, and I wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true story behind his rise to power.",
            "It's intriguing to consider how the teachings of Jesus and the values he stood for were largely abandoned as Christianity evolved after his time.  If we examine this historical shift, it becomes clear that Christianity has drifted further away from its roots.  It appears that today's world is witnessing a growing awareness and a more progressive mindset, particularly among Christians.  Although traditionalists will undoubtedly resist any deviation from the original teachings, their influence may eventually wane, allowing a more open-minded approach to take hold.  As time passes, a growing number of Christians will seek to distinguish the added doctrines from the core principles of the faith.  This process may take decades or even centuries, but it's inevitable:  a significant reversal in Christian history is on the horizon.  A movement will emerge, stripping away the layers of doctrine that have accumulated over time, much like a clock rewinding, until all that remains is a clear understanding of Jesus' original message.  When this shift gains momentum in the United States and Europe, it will lead to a more uniform and streamlined expression of Christianity, as people return to the core principles Jesus brought forth.  The church as an institution will continue to thrive, but the resulting uniformity will supplant the current diversity of Christian denominations and practices.  History is replete with examples of such reversals, such as the transformation of the Roman Empire from a persecutor of Christians to a Christian institution, or the shift in the United States from a society that enslaved Africans to one where African Americans hold positions of leadership.  The future holds a similar reversal for the Christian faith, as people seek to return to the source and undo the complexities that have developed over time.  This process will be facilitated by a shift in how we interpret Jesus' words, moving from a literal to a metaphorical understanding.  So, what led to the divergence from Jesus' original message?  If we look back far enough, we find that the foundation of Christianity is rooted in Judaism.  By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., the core of Jewish thought had already taken shape, centered around monotheism, the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, and a divinely revealed religion.  The Jewish populace was not a monolithic entity, however, and divided into various groups, including the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common people.",
            "I firmly believe that The Jungle is a powerful portrayal of humanity's inherent selfishness and lack of empathy. The novel vividly illustrates how people's primal instincts drive them to prioritize their own interests above all else, often at the expense of those who are less fortunate. The novel showcases this theme through the actions of the factory owners and managers, who only care about expanding their businesses and increasing their wealth, without any regard for the harm it may cause to others or the environment. In the book, Upton Sinclair paints a stark picture of the devastating impact of industrialization, describing the factories as \"the line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". This vivid imagery highlights the owners' blatant disregard for the well-being of people and animals affected by their actions. They show no concern for the pollution spewing from the factories or the animal waste and filth surrounding Packingtown.\n\nFurthermore, the owners and managers are only interested in maximizing their profits, rather than treating their employees with dignity or respect. They exploit their workers, forcing them to work long hours for minimal pay and without any regard for their safety or well-being. The novel highlights the harsh realities of the time period, where workers had no protections or support, and were often treated as nothing more than replaceable commodities. The book describes the conditions as \"a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". This toxic environment is perpetuated by the lack of regulations and organizations to protect the workers' rights, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation. The novel suggests that the workers were essentially treated as slaves, forced to live and work in squalid conditions with no hope of escape.\n\nSinclair's work serves as a scathing critique of the capitalist system and the treatment of workers during that era. The novel's portrayal of the dehumanizing effects of industrialization and the exploitation of workers is a powerful reminder of the need for workers' rights and social justice.",
            "Many authors have mastered the art of creating a specific atmosphere in their readers through various techniques. F. Scott Fitzgerald is a brilliant example of this, as seen in his novel The Great Gatsby. In his writing, Fitzgerald frequently employs a range of techniques to evoke distinct emotions and attitudes in his readers. His approach often involves pairing unusual adjectives with nouns to create an initial impression, while also applying deeper meaning to symbols throughout the story. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald takes this technique to the next level by assigning significance to various colors, including gold, green, white, and red/pink. He cleverly builds up the meaning behind these colors, particularly white and gray, and later uses them to create a distinctive aura around specific objects and characters.\n\nFitzgerald's use of white and gray is particularly noteworthy, as he establishes a connection between these colors and uniformity. White is often associated with a sense of refinement and higher social class, while gray represents a more faded and aged quality. In the beginning of the novel, Fitzgerald consistently employs both colors, creating an image of uniformity. For instance, Daisy and Jordan are frequently depicted wearing white, and even the other characters follow suit, donning white attire at various social gatherings. The only time this uniformity is broken is when Nick attends Gatsby's party, where he observes a more vibrant atmosphere with primary colors. Furthermore, Fitzgerald reinforces this connection by associating these colors with ordinary, mundane subjects, such as the streets of New York and the names on Nick's timetable.\n\nAs the novel progresses, Fitzgerald skillfully employs these colors to convey a sense of uniformity or unimportance surrounding specific subjects. This begins with Daisy, who is first described wearing a white dress in a \"little white roadster.\" This image creates a sense of detachment, making Daisy seem more like a uniform addition to Gatsby's life rather than a fully fleshed-out character. Fitzgerald continues to use this technique to reinforce this impression, often depicting Daisy in white attire or describing her as having a \"gray haze\" around her. By building up the meaning behind these colors and using them consistently throughout the novel, Fitzgerald masterfully creates a lasting impression on his readers.",
            "San Diego County stands out as a fertile ground for agriculture, thanks to its idyllic climate. The region's rich crop selection includes a variety of produce such as tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, and squash. Organic farming has gained significant traction in the area, with a substantial demand for community-supported agriculture and a high interest in locally produced products like organic eggs and milk. Many farms not only provide tours of their operations but also offer recreational activities like hiking and birdwatching, promoting a win-win situation for both the landowners and the environment.\n\nOrganic farming also brings several environmental benefits, including increased biodiversity due to the absence of chemicals in the soil and water. However, this type of farming comes with some drawbacks. It requires more labor and intense management to maintain soil quality and control pests and weeds without using chemicals, potentially resulting in higher losses compared to conventional farming methods. Additionally, smaller organic farms often lack the efficiency of large-scale operations, making it challenging to balance profit and habitat quality.\n\nConsidering these factors, it's no wonder that a farmer like the one in this scenario would seek financial assistance or expert guidance to optimize their operation and make the most of the land. The chosen property is a 160-acre parcel located in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of San Diego County, California, near the town of Potrero. This land features a mix of chaparral, non-native Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, bordering the Cleveland National Forest. The area is home to a diverse range of plant and animal species, some of which are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat and the mountain yellow-legged frog.\n\nThe land has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries before being settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. As part of an original homestead patent, the land was likely used for grazing and wood production for many years.\n\nTo illustrate the potential for a small farmer in this region to mitigate costs and preserve wildlife-friendly operations, I researched government programs and found an existing organic farm in the area as a model to follow. This hypothetical scenario highlights the possibilities and challenges faced by a landowner seeking to balance financial success with environmental stewardship.",
            "In any negotiation, culture plays a vital role in shaping the dynamics of the table talks. However, it's essential to recognize that culture is not a fixed or singular entity, but rather a complex and multifaceted concept that encompasses what it is, what it signifies, and what it's not. A statement like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" is an oversimplification, as culture is not homogenous or uniform. Instead, it's more productive to delve into the nuances of a culture and understand its significance in the context of the negotiation. When interacting with a foreign culture, individuals tend to relate to it through their own cultural lens, leading to inevitable comparisons and assumptions.\n\nTo effectively navigate cultural differences, negotiators must be willing to study and learn about the culture they're engaging with. This involves understanding its history, values, and prejudices, rather than judging or attempting to change it. When working with a weaker bargaining position, respecting the local culture and traditions can be a powerful tool in overcoming cultural barriers and moving the negotiation forward.\n\nInterestingly, culture is not limited to national or international boundaries. Corporate cultures within a given nation can be just as distinct and influential. For instance, some companies may prioritize long working hours, while others adopt a more relaxed schedule. These cultural differences can be seen in employee dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices. Even within the same nation, companies can exhibit varying levels of philanthropy, dress codes, and communication styles, highlighting the diversity of thought within a particular societal culture. By looking beyond the surface level, negotiators can uncover the complexities of a culture and make more informed decisions.\n\nUnderstanding values is equally crucial, as they provide the underlying motivations and drivers of a culture. For example, if a culture values saving face or communal harmony, a negotiator will be less likely to publicly shame their company or superior to achieve a successful outcome. Conversely, a culture that places greater emphasis on a hard-driven bargain may not be willing to settle for a quick agreement. By considering these cultural nuances, negotiators can approach the negotiation table with a deeper understanding of their opponent's mindset and make more effective decisions.",
            "The idea that there is no God has been a notion expressed by some, as seen in Psalm 14 and St. Anselm's argument. Similarly, Thomas Aquinas, another prominent figure, also believed in the existence of God. Since we're comparing their arguments, we'll assume they're both defending the same concept of God - the one found in the Bible. This will allow us to fairly compare their arguments without introducing alternative interpretations. St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas both present valid points, but neither provides a complete foundation for believing in God.\n\nTo understand this, let's examine St. Anselm's argument. He suggests that the existence of God can be found within one's own mind. According to him, since we can't effectively conceive God's nonexistence, this proves his existence. Although his explanation can be a bit convoluted, the basic idea is that truth about God can be found within our own understanding, eliminating the need for external evidence. This concept of accepting something without concrete proof is often referred to as faith within Christian texts.\n\nIn contrast, Thomas Aquinas offers a more rational approach to proving God's existence. He believes it can be achieved solely through reason and empirical evidence, without the need for faith. This could be beneficial for spreading Christianity, as it would allow new converts to be recruited through logic alone, rather than relying on their willingness to accept something unproven. Aquinas presents five logical arguments supporting God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. He demonstrates that the existence of God is logically necessary, much like understanding the features of a missing puzzle piece without seeing it.",
            "In the ancient times, around the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince was born who would eventually become known as Buddha. As he navigated through life, he renounced worldly possessions and achieved enlightenment, setting the stage for the development of Buddhism, with Theravada Buddhism being its most traditional form. This ancient faith is now over 2,500 years old, and it has undergone a significant transformation over the years. This transformation can be witnessed by observing how Theravada Buddhism is practiced in countries such as Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is a significant event. This ritual is participated in by both monks and lay followers, even though Buddha himself never taught about any such celebration. These changes are not limited to mere customs and traditions but also extend to the core teachings of the faith. Over time, the Theravada Buddhist community has had to adapt its doctrines, both from a monastic and lay perspective, due to various internal and external influences.\n\nThroughout this discussion, certain terms will be used frequently. 'Internal' refers to any force that originates from within the Buddhist community, regardless of one's monastic status, while 'external' refers to any influence from non-Buddhists. A 'hostile' force is any influence that aims to harm or damage the Buddhist community, often stemming from a negative perception of Buddhism. On the other hand, a 'benign' force is one that neither wishes to harm nor help the Buddhist community, although its consequences may be either detrimental or beneficial. These definitions will be crucial in understanding the nuances of this discussion.\n\nTo begin, it's essential to grasp the fundamental principles of Theravada Buddhism, which forms the core of the faith. Buddhists seek refuge in the 'triple gem,' consisting of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is primarily composed of the Tripitaka, a collection of three baskets of Buddhist scriptures. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka explores the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism, including the concepts of Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these ideas is key to escaping Sansara, the cycle of birth and death, which is an ongoing process. Along with escaping Sansara will come the end of lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion), ultimately leading to enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth rules for lay followers, such as the five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not engage in misconduct, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental concept in Buddhism is the four noble truths, which include: first, the truth that life is filled with suffering; second, that attachment causes suffering; and third, that suffering can be overcome.",
            "The long-standing rivalry between the United States and Mexico is a prime example of a grueling and protracted conflict that lasted for 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145). The apex of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the U.S. invaded Mexico, seized Texas and the American Southwest, and secured new territory for itself. The two nations clashed repeatedly, with tensions finally easing just before World War I. \n\nWhat sets this rivalry apart from others is the fact that it was fueled by fundamental differences in values, customs, and interests, as well as clashing material ambitions (Schmitt 1974, p. 30-31). It's a common phenomenon among nations that share a border to develop rivalries due to competing interests. The U.S. and Mexico are no exception, although they are not the only countries to have had a long-standing rivalry with their neighbors. David M. Pletcher (1977) notes that Mexico and Cuba are the only two nations where the U.S. has had enduring diplomatic issues (p. 41). \n\nOne major factor that contributed to the rivalry was the issue of religion, a problem that has historically plagued numerous nations. Sally Frahm (2001) points out that Americans in the past were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy, much like their stance against fascism and communism in the 20th century (p.86). This ideological divide was partly fueled by the historical distrust between the English and Spanish, which was inherited by the U.S. and Mexico from their colonial rulers, making it challenging to establish a harmonious relationship between the two nations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) document 17 disputes between Mexico and the U.S. during the 57-year rivalry period, most of which centered on territorial issues, including border raids and frontier problems. Border violence was a significant issue that persisted until both countries exerted military force to control their borders (Schmitt 1974, p. 97). \n\nAs Schmitt (1974) explains, the rivalry began to subside as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the U.S. and America's ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico (p. 109-110). This marked a significant turning point in the relationship between the two nations.",
            "It's been 15 years since my life took a drastic turn due to an illness I had no prior knowledge of. At the time, I was a nurse, a profession I chose for the sense of security and stability it provided, which was a stark contrast to my childhood. The mantra I often heard growing up was that I could always find employment because people would always get sick, so I opted for nursing over my true passions of science and journalism. \n\nHowever, fate had other plans, and I found myself at 46, single, and with no savings. I've been living on Social Security Disability for 15 years now, and I've lost everything that I once considered truly mine. Every day is a struggle, and my sense of security, safety, and self-worth is constantly under attack. The one thing I can be certain of is that I couldn't have made it this far without the unwavering support of my family and a few close friends. When the going gets tough, being strong isn't enough; we all need a helping hand.\n\nMy point is that life is full of unexpected challenges, big and small, and no matter how well we prepare, some things are too great to overcome alone. I agree that our reliance on the government needs to change, but instead of resorting to building our own fallout shelters, I believe it's more important for Americans to learn to trust and help one another. We should be encouraged to ask for help when we need it, rather than trying to go it alone.\n\nThe notion of rugged individualism that our country's conservatives often tout is a misconception. It was the compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources of our forefathers that helped them navigate difficult times, not their ability to go it alone. The pioneers who crossed the country in wagon trains didn't make it by going solo; they had a community that supported them every step of the way.\n\nOf course, preparation is crucial, and I've taken the necessary steps to be ready for any situation. I have a disaster kit, first aid supplies, and other essential items in case of an emergency. However, while we should be prepared, it's equally important to build relationships with those around us. Get to know your neighbors, and work together to create a support system that will see you through the tough times.",
            "The age-old question of why organisms evolve in the way they do remains a mystery. Are there underlying restrictions or constraints that influence the direction and pace of evolutionary change? Despite D'Arcy Thompson's 1917 assertion that zoologists still struggle to define organic forms mathematically, recent advances in mathematical modeling have shed light on various aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis, particularly in terms of ontogeny and phylogeny (Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research aims to explore how mathematical modeling, combined with experimental studies, can help unravel the mechanisms driving evolutionary-developmental change in the genus Prunum. We analyzed X-ray images of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters that can be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were then fed into the CerioShell software program (Stone, 1995), allowing us to create hypothetical shell morphologies that can be used to interpret the boundaries of potential morphological change.\n\nImagine a shell as a three-dimensional tube that navigates through 360 degrees of space over time. The revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are known as whorls, which spiral around an imaginary central axis, or columella. The speed at which whorls grow can vary, and a continuous line separates each whorl, referred to as a suture. Typically, the largest whorl is the last one, or body whorl. The spire is comprised of all whorls except the last, while the apex is the tip of the spire, and the opposite end is called the base. The animal emerges from its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from various angles, including apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. The typical orientation of a shell is apertural, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upwards.\n\nTo count whorls, one should start by viewing the shell from the apical perspective and identifying the first suture. A line can then be drawn to divide the shell into two parts, and whorls can be counted from this line, estimating to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accumulates its shell. By tracing the path of the aperture via the coordinates of each whorl's center and the horizontal and vertical radius, it's possible to graphically and mathematically represent this trajectory. Once a mathematical formulation is established, it's possible to modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis by varying parameters.",
            "The neonatal and infant mortality rates in Indonesia have shown little change over the past decade.  Despite making progress in other areas, such as water and sanitation, the country is falling short of its goals for improving child and maternal health by 2015.  Several factors contribute to this lag, highlighting the need to strengthen the overall health system rather than relying on targeted programs.\n\nOn the surface, Indonesia appears to be making strides in healthcare, with 72% of births now attended by skilled healthcare workers.  However, this statistic includes traditional birth attendants, who may not be equipped to handle complications during pregnancy, resulting in a high number of maternal deaths from hemorrhage.  In reality, these improvements mask a more pressing need for better healthcare service.  Furthermore, there has been a decline in the number of children under five treated for diarrheal diseases, and postnatal care remains a concern, with low rates of care across the country.\n\nThe rate of cesarean sections is surprisingly low, at around 4%, and the disparity between urban and rural areas is striking.  While 7% of urban mothers opt for c-sections, a mere 2% of rural mothers do, indicating a severe imbalance in access to healthcare services.  This not only highlights the issue of geographic disparities but also points to a problem of vertical equity, with a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  The poor are disproportionately affected by out-of-pocket costs, making it even harder for them to access healthcare services.\n\nTo address the shortcomings in neonatal and maternal care, the primary question is how to effectively address the lack of healthcare services.  Should Indonesia focus on developing targeted programs or strengthening the overall health system, moving beyond isolated interventions for pre- and post-pregnancy care?  While program-specific approaches may offer quicker results and targeted objectives, they also have drawbacks.  Investing heavily in one area can divert resources and personnel from other areas, leading to duplication of services and uncoordinated efforts.  This fragmentation can result in an increase in paperwork and administrative costs, detracting from the primary goal of improving healthcare outcomes.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their meticulous attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the time period.  However, two novels, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, stand out as exceptions to this tradition.  These novels seamlessly blend elements of mystery and the bizarre, typical of novels from the period, to create more complex characters.  This approach not only deepens our understanding of their motivations and emotions but also adds an air of intrigue to their stories.\n\nAs the scene unfolds, a multitude of confusing and bewildering ideas flood the protagonist's mind.  The lines between reality and fantasy become blurred, as if he is walking between Sikes and Crackit, who are engaged in a heated dispute.  The words they speak seem to reverberate in his mind, and when he regains his focus, he finds himself conversing with them.  The sudden sound of gunfire shatters the tranquility, and the protagonist's world descends into chaos.  A maelstrom of lights and sounds assaults him, as if an unseen force is propelling him forward.  Throughout this whirlwind of visions, a persistent and gnawing sense of pain torments him, refusing to subside.\n\nIn both novels, this sense of mystery often manifests through dreamlike states or sequences.  These enigmatic occurrences in Oliver Twist frequently reveal the depths of Oliver's inner world, exposing his fears and the true nature of the events unfolding around him.  The recreation of Oliver's near-death experience in chapter 28 is a prime example of this technique.  As he relives the shooting, his senses are heightened, and he becomes trapped in a vivid nightmare.  The unseen force that bears him away serves as a reminder of his lack of control over the events that transpired, as well as the precarious state of his health.  The shooting has a profound impact on Oliver, leaving him feeling powerless and consumed by despair.  This sense of defeat is further reinforced by the notion that his fate was not of his own making, but rather the result of circumstances beyond his control.\n\nIn Wuthering Heights, the lines between reality and fantasy are similarly blurred.  The passage describes a day that seems to pass at an alarming rate, devoid of significance and yet filled with an air of foreboding.  Time appears to be distorted, with the day and night blending together in a seemingly endless cycle.  This sense of disorientation and unease sets the tone for the rest of the novel, hinting at the turmoil and tragedy that lies ahead.",
            "I still remember my time working in an after-school program where I tutored elementary-age students on various subjects. My strengths lay in English and reading, and I was often approached by instructors to help students who were struggling. One student, a boy named Adrian, really stood out to me; he was around third or fourth grade and was having a lot of trouble reading. However, it became apparent that something was off - he could pronounce some letters perfectly, while others were way off. It was a fascinating phenomenon. Despite his Latino background, Adrian spoke perfect English, which made it even more puzzling.\n\nIt wasn't until I met his mother, who didn't speak a word of English but only Spanish, that the solution became clear. I was struggling to communicate with her using my limited Spanish skills, but it hit me like a ton of bricks - Adrian's reading issues were due to his unfamiliarity with the English alphabet. I'm not sure if this revelation made a significant impact on his learning, but I hope he's doing better now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the language barrier problem in schools, particularly in California. It's not always as obvious as we think, and even students who speak perfect English can still struggle with reading. It's a complex issue that requires a multifaceted solution.\n\nIn Adrian's case, the solution was straightforward - English reading tutoring, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for students who barely speak English, the solution is much more complex. There's no one-size-fits-all answer, and a combination of methods is essential. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes, and more - each has its own merits, but none can solve the problem on its own.\n\nThe dual language system is a great concept that benefits not just children who speak Spanish as their first language but all students. Research has shown that children in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. Many people are skeptical, fearing it's a waste of resources and that most students won't benefit. But this is a misconception. If we implemented these programs as the norm, rather than the exception, all students would reap the rewards.\n\nSo, how do we make this work? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? That would be unrealistic and unreasonable. Instead, we can provide special aids, tutors, or whatever you want to call them, who are bilingual. This way, we can create a more inclusive and supportive learning environment that caters to the diverse needs of all students.",
            "Most of us have been told as children that there's something greater than us out there, something beyond our understanding.  We've been sent to Sunday school, Temple, or on inner journeys in search of answers.  Some of us accept the faith passed down by our parents without question, while others strongly reject it, and some of us even switch sides, adopting new values and then changing our minds again.  Ultimately, we're all on a path to define ourselves and our place in the universe through our own unique perspectives on spirituality.  We're all searching for a guiding light in the darkness to lead us out of the shadows and into the light.\n\nI still remember the day my dad told me his favorite bird was the cardinal.  We sat on our front porch during a rainy June evening, listening to the sound of rain pounding on the tin roof.  The gutters were overflowing, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  My dad looked out into the rain, a mix of searching and remembering in his eyes.  He was thinner and his clothes hung loosely from his body.  His hair was sparse and thin, and he avoided eye contact.  I felt scared, alone, and unsure how to talk to him about how much I'd miss him.  So I hugged him, moved my chair closer, and joined him in gazing out into the rain.\n\nMy dad passed away in December, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation hadn't eased his suffering, but had kept him alive for a few more months.  I couldn't understand the value of keeping him alive in that state, but I couldn't define it either.  If God existed, I thought, he'd stopped listening to me long ago.  So I didn't pray.  I just sat in the darkness, unable to bear watching my father slip away.\n\nI didn't want to see him leave this life behind.  So I turned away.  I wanted to remember my dad for who he was, not for how he died.  I knew my dad better than anyone, and I knew he wouldn't want me to watch him go.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days, waiting for the news.  But no one called.",
            "In essence, the term \"Gothic Novel\" is an oxymoron, as Ian Watt so aptly put it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel – a perfect blend of the old and the new. The Gothic mode has received a mixed bag of reactions over the years, with some criticizing it for lacking depth, while others praise it for its unique ability to evoke a sense of the \"terrible sublime.\"  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, was a pioneering work that combined elements from both the \"ancient\" and \"modern\" romances to create a new form of literary expression. Walpole's innovative approach involved merging old theatrical elements with the newer, more personal storytelling style of modern novels. This unique fusion allowed him to create what he called \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre is characterized by its use of archaic elements from medieval theatre, architecture, and traditions. When The Castle of Otranto was first published, the term \"gothic\" was associated with various cultures, styles, and time periods, and was often viewed as outdated or unsophisticated in comparison to the modern world. However, it's this very combination of the old and the new that has allowed the Gothic genre to endure and seem both archaic and fresh to readers across time.\n\nOne of the key elements of Gothic literature is the concept of chivalry, which plays a significant role in The Castle of Otranto. The medieval idea of chivalry, involving the training of a noble knight, is reinterpreted in this novel. Chivalry was particularly important to Gothic writers like Walpole because it represented an idealized version of knighthood – brave, honorable, and competent. Through the use of chivalric concepts and manners, the Gothic past is romanticized and idealized, foreshadowing the evolution of Gothic literature into Romanticism. In the midst of a tumultuous time, Walpole was likely reflecting on the perceived decline of morality and goodness in society, as embodied by his character Frederic. As the reader learns about Frederic, it's clear that he embodies many chivalric traits – he's a prince who has suffered, been affected by tragedy, and is said to have been killed by infidels. The image of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is exaggerated, bringing in the idea of excess, which would become a staple of the Gothic genre (Walpole 66).",
            "The concept of supply chain management refers to the intricate web of processes that connects the customer's order to the raw materials, production, supply, and distribution stages, ultimately delivering products to the customer. The term supply chain management was coined in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, who described it as the process of planning, implementing, and controlling the entire supply chain to meet customers' needs efficiently. At its core, supply chain management involves six key elements: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers utilize these elements to provide exceptional customer service.\n\nProduction is the cornerstone of the supply chain process. It's crucial to establish a solid foundation for the entire process. Production outlines the when, why, where, and how products will be produced, and managers need to understand customer demands to make informed decisions. By analyzing the market, managers can gauge customer needs and decide on the products to be produced, their quantities, and the production locations that will meet customer expectations. Effective production planning is critical, as every detail matters, and mistakes can lead to costly delays and financial losses. For instance, during my time working at retail stores like Wal-Mart and Target, I saw firsthand how having a well-designed process and layout can streamline operations, reduce confusion, and increase efficiency.\n\nSupply is the second essential element of supply chain management. It involves making strategic decisions about a company's core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. A company may have multiple divisions for a single product, each with unique equipment, workers, and specialties. Managers must determine which division is best suited for each process, and they may also choose to outsource work to other companies to achieve velocity – the ability to provide quality, flexibility, and low costs. By optimizing supply, companies can enhance their competitiveness and customer satisfaction.",
            "I recently came across a haunting reminder of the atrocities that still plague our world today: a sign that reads \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\" Ellen Page, the talented actress known for her role in Juno, holds the sign in a poignant reminder of the injustices that persist in our world. The sign's message is a stark contrast to the beauty of the surrounding area, and it serves as a powerful reminder of the dark history of Burma, also known as Myanmar. This Southeast Asian country has been ruled by a ruthless military junta since 1962, after a brutal coup d'état overthrew the democratically elected government.\n\nIn 2007, a wave of protests swept through the country, known as the Saffron Revolution, named after the color of the robes worn by the brave monks who led the uprising. Despite the initial peaceful nature of the protests, the violence escalated, and the military junta resorted to violence, invading and ransacking monasteries across the country. Foreign journalists were arrested and imprisoned, and a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai was tragically killed while covering the protests.\n\nThis is not an isolated incident. The desire to suppress dissent and maintain control over citizens is a timeless and universal phenomenon. From the Roman emperors who claimed divine right to rule to the Japanese emperors who are still believed to be gods, the pattern of abuse of power is all too familiar. Even in our own country, our leaders have been known to engage in questionable behavior, including weekly conference calls with influential figures like Ted Haggard.\n\nThe examples are numerous and disturbing. The 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in China, where students and intellectuals gathered to demand democratic reform, ended in bloodshed, with estimates of the death toll ranging from 200 to 3,000. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, in which Hutu militia groups and the government systematically killed Tutsis and moderates, is another grim reminder of the dangers of unchecked power. The Holocaust, where six million Jews and millions of others were systematically murdered, is a stark reminder of the horrors that can occur when we turn a blind eye to injustice.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring legacy in jazz is largely attributed to his remarkable longevity and the boundless creativity he brought to his orchestra. While his piano playing is subtle in many of his compositions, as a composer, Ellington excelled at crafting complex, intricately woven pieces that showcased the unique abilities of individual band members. By creating a framework that allowed soloists to freely improvise, Ellington also wrote tightly orchestrated pieces that highlighted the distinct styles of his musicians, resulting in a rich, original sound. His mastery of the individual players' tones and how they blended together in the ensemble enabled him to write some of the most innovative and iconic pieces in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's groundbreaking use of voice as a jazz instrument, citing Creole Love Call as an early example of this approach. This 12-bar blues piece showcases Ellington's ability to incorporate voice without lyrics, adding texture and color to the music. The song features six choruses, each with its unique character, including a call-and-response between voice and reeds, a muted trumpet solo, and a sweeping clarinet solo. The final chorus returns to the first chorus's structure, with the voice taking on a \"growl\" technique, soloing like an instrument. This use of voice as a tone color is a hallmark of Ellington's style, evident throughout his work.\n\nIn Hot and Bothered, Ellington combined his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. He created a call-and-response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing, blending the vocal elements of Miley's playing and the instrumental aspects of Cox's voice to produce a rich and complementary sound. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) further showcases Ellington's mastery of tone color, as he utilizes Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's muted trombone to great effect in introducing the melody.",
            "For as long as she could remember, there was this nagging feeling inside her. A sense of emptiness that seemed unquenchable. It started when she was 14, just entering the tumultuous world of adolescence. Three years later, at 17, the feeling persisted. She had decided that what she wanted wasn't a thing, but a person. Yet, despite her age, she felt no connection to any of the boys who had shown interest. She often pondered this phenomenon, trying to pinpoint the root cause of her disinterest. Her introspection over the years had yielded various theories, but none that truly satisfied her curiosity. As a result, she went through life questioning her desires.\n\nIn her household, days were usually tranquil. Her parents were a peaceful couple, rarely arguing with each other or with her. The only disagreements they had were about her strong will and independent personality. As the daughter of calm and collected individuals, she made up for their even temperament with her lively and fun nature, making her a lovable and well-liked person.\n\nHowever, today was a different story. As she roamed the house in search of inspiration, she was suddenly jolted by a faint scream from the kitchen, followed by her mother's distressed voice. Rushing into the room, she panicked, asking \"Mom, what's wrong?!\" She found her mother lying on the ground, wincing in pain as she gasped \"Ow\" repeatedly. The daughter quickly rushed to her side, placing a hand on her to assist. \"Ouch...sweetie, I...need you to take me to-the hospital.\" The words were strained and urgent, and her daughter could sense her mother's immense pain. \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where to pick you up.\" Her mother directed her, and the daughter was grateful for the physical training she had received. She carried her mother to the car, gently set her in the back, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought a mix of disinfectant and anxious energy, but her daughter's focus remained on helping her mother. She rushed her into the emergency room, calling out for medical help. A team of worried faces gathered, and someone quickly brought a gurney to take her mother to be examined. Her daughter was left to sit anxiously, waiting for news.\n\nIt turned out her mother had fallen off a step stool while trying to retrieve a vase from a high cabinet.",
            "This study aimed to investigate the connection between following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet) and the risk of chronic heart disease and stroke. The study assessed the association between a high score on the \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet\" and a reduced risk of heart disease and stroke. The aMed diet is a variation of the Med diet that emphasizes the consumption of plant-based foods such as fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, as well as monounsaturated fats and fish, while reducing the intake of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is also part of this diet.\n\nEarlier studies have found that adhering to the Med diet is linked to a lower risk of mortality from heart disease and stroke. However, these studies did not specifically examine the relationship between the Med diet and stroke. \n\nTo conduct this research, the study followed 74,886 women between the ages of 38 and 63 who were participants in the Nurses' Health Study. Over the course of 20 years, from 1984 to 2004, the researchers calculated the women's aMed diet scores based on their self-reported food intake. The study used a food frequency questionnaire to assess nutrient intake, which was validated through several studies. The researchers also collected data on body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and physical activity.\n\nTo account for individual variation and get a more accurate picture of long-term dietary habits, the researchers averaged the aMed scores from multiple questionnaires (two prior years). They also adjusted for potential confounding factors such as age, smoking, body mass index, menopausal status, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nUsing Cox proportional-hazard modeling, the study found that higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with a lower risk of heart disease and stroke in women. During the 20-year follow-up period, the researchers identified 2391 incident cases of heart disease, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths. The findings showed that women in the top aMed quintile had a lower risk of heart disease and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile, with a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "In 2007, the United States experienced a severe financial downturn, marked by rising unemployment, a housing market collapse, and the downfall of several major corporations. The ongoing effects of this crisis have left us wondering: how did this disaster unfold, and how can we prevent it from happening again? The root cause of the crisis lies in the reckless and shortsighted decisions made by politicians, which led banks and firms to issue subprime loans to borrowers without a stable financial foundation. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were forced to purchase and repack these mortgages into complex financial instruments, such as CDO's and CDS's. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were left with a shortage of capital reserves, which they then transferred to the repackaged mortgages and the broader economy.\n\nThe seeds of the financial crisis were sown in 1999, during the Clinton administration's second term. To boost his popularity, the President relaxed lending restrictions, paving the way for the subprime crisis that would strike seven years later. In 1999, Steven Holmes of the New York Times warned of the consequences of these actions, stating that Fannie Mae, the largest mortgage underwriter in the country, was under pressure to expand lending to low- and moderate-income households and maintain its profit margins. Holmes prophetically noted that this could ultimately lead to a government bailout, similar to the one that saved the savings and loan industry in the 1980s. As seen in the introduction, and as Holmes predicted, the reckless lending practices would ultimately lead to an economic meltdown.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the economy's downward spiral, including the increasing complexity of mortgage structures. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO's) were widely used in the years leading up to the crisis, intertwining various sectors of the economy with the housing market. This led to households and financial markets becoming heavily indebted in the housing market, leaving them vulnerable to even minor changes in prices.\n\nThe housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that held mortgage-backed securities were severely affected. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, accounting for approximately 30% of the country's GDP. Ultimately, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at discounted prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subject to stricter regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "There's a point in the story where writers feel the need to take flight, showcasing their skills with elaborate descriptions, but it often ends up putting readers to sleep or making them hit the \"Back\" button in frustration. Dr. Merlin has been known to get frustrated when she gets stuck in lengthy passages that don't have any real significance to the plot.\n\nWriters are often reminded of the fundamental rule, \"Show, don't tell,\" but it's not uncommon for authors to still struggle with excessive exposition. This is where the temptation to dump a load of information on the reader can be overwhelming, making it difficult to engage with the story.\n\nExposition is essentially telling the audience about events or backstory without adding any real value to the plot. In film, this is often seen when one character spouts off a long, unnecessary speech, while in written fiction, the author takes on the role of delivering the information.\n\nLet's take an example. A story might reveal that the heroine met her love interest at a specific time and place, got married in a grand ceremony, and had her husband brutally murdered in front of her. Instead of a two-page summary, the reader would expect to see the husband's character come alive through his words and actions, making his eventual fate all the more impactful. The reader would also expect to see how the heroine's life changed with him, and how his presence affected her thoughts, feelings, and dreams.\n\nIn short, the reader wants more depth to the storyline, \"They met, they married, he died.\" A good writer provides that depth, making the reader emotionally invested in the characters and their story.\n\nIt's easy to get carried away with introducing new characters, their backgrounds, and motivations. Perhaps you're introducing a character who used to be in the Air Force, now runs a gas station at night, has been married twice, and has a secret dream of owning the business. However, it's essential to show, not tell, and provide meaningful context to the story.",
            "I recently watched two newscasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first one I saw was NBC 4's live broadcast on August 13, 2011. The main story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio named Shad Hostettler, who had brutally attacked his wife, although her name was not mentioned. They showed his mug shot, which made him look like a cold-blooded individual. The newscasters only dedicated around two minutes to this story as it was still unfolding. I think they covered it just the right amount of time.\n\nThe second story was about an early morning shooting involving 18-year-old Travis Buyers in the Sharon Woods area. He was critically injured and no arrests had been made at that point. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime scene. This story seemed brief, and I suspect it might have been due to the fact that the victim was a black man from a predominantly black neighborhood. I've noticed a disturbing pattern over the years where minority victims are often overlooked by the media. In contrast, if a white person is a victim of a crime, the media goes into overdrive. It's as if only certain stories deserve attention.\n\nThe next story was about a .22 caliber bullet hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. They provided details about the location of the incident and determined that the bullet was fired from a rifle. The Crime-Stoppers organization is offering a $5,000 reward for any tips that lead to the shooter's identification.\n\nThe newscast then shifted to a story about impending rain and thunderstorms on Saturday afternoon, with temperatures expected to remain in the mid-to-low eighties throughout the weekend. The report was brief, but they used it as a teaser to keep viewers engaged.\n\nThey also covered a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus, where a dark-skinned black man allegedly robbed the store while wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. He was described as being around six feet tall and weighing around 150 pounds. I found it peculiar that they emphasized his skin color and how dark he was.\n\nAnother story was about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin who was convicted of conspiring to distribute large quantities of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. Interestingly, instead of stating his prison sentence as 25 years, they mentioned 300 months. I'm unsure what the reasoning was behind this choice, whether they thought it sounded harsher or what. They also mentioned that he was a Hispanic man, which I don't think was relevant to the story.",
            "A bond between brothers is complex and multifaceted, encompassing a mix of emotions such as love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. This unbreakable connection allows brothers to understand one another in a way that few others can, and they often see themselves reflected in their brother. When situations become dire, the true nature of this bond is revealed, whether it's good or bad. However, these emotions come with significant costs, and understanding them requires dealing with the consequences they bring. When a brother looks into their sibling's eyes, they see their own reflection, not as others see them, but as they truly are. It's in their actions and the consequences of those actions that their character is revealed. In William Faulkner's \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" this theme is explored through the story of two brothers, their tumultuous relationship, and the emotions that drive them.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are driven by a single, dominant emotion: pride. From their first outing together, he harbors resentment towards his younger brother, Doodle, who is born with a weak heart and is unlikely to participate in the physical activities the protagonist longs to share with him. The protagonist's dreams are crushed when he realizes that Doodle will never be able to keep up, and he even considers infanticide, a thought that highlights the depth of his emotional turmoil. However, a fleeting moment of joy when Doodle smiles at him gives the protagonist a glimmer of hope and reveals the underlying love he has for his brother. This dichotomy of emotions – pride and love – ultimately proves to be a pivotal aspect of the protagonist's character development, as he grapples with the consequences of his actions and the true nature of their bond.\n\nThe narrative effectively conveys the complex emotions experienced by the protagonist and his perspective on the world around him through direct characterization of Doodle and their interactions, as well as the narrator's point of view. As the story unfolds, the protagonist's actions become a reflection of his character, and the tragic events that unfold serve as a testament to the profound impact of their bond.",
            "The human brain is a highly complex and creative information-processing system that has been compared to various objects as technology has advanced from simple to sophisticated. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, followed by a book, and more recently, to a computer. However, it's essential to note that these analogies have their limitations and can lead to misconceptions about the brain's workings.\n\nWhen information enters the brain, it's first processed by the sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli, such as touch, heat, sound waves, or light, into electrical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the brain's algorithms through both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing combines basic details like color, orientation, and border information to identify the object as a box. Top-down processing then uses these decisions to speed up recognition, possibly identifying the object as a black box rather than a hole in the background.\n\nAs information is processed, an attention filter determines its importance and decides which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might focus on your name even in a noisy room. This process involves multiple stages, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\n\nFor the brain to process information, it needs to store it first. There are different types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. Initially, information is encoded, with specific types of encoding suited to each type of sensory input. For instance, verbal input can be encoded based on its structure, sound, or meaning. Once stored, information must be maintained, with working memory retaining it for around 20 seconds and long-term memory hypothesized to be stored in the structure of specific proteins.\n\nThere are various models proposing how knowledge is organized in the brain, drawing from human memory retrieval, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model suggests that there are nodes representing concepts, linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might be connected to \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "In Aldous Huxley's dystopian novel, Brave New World, he critiques the looming threats of technology and the capitalist system that underpins it. The novel's portrayal of a society that prioritizes community over individuality and values immediate gratification above all else raises suspicions about the author's views on the emerging economic systems of his time. Through a Marxist lens, Huxley's work appears to be a commentary on the pitfalls of the capitalist structure, as evident from the use of Marxist terminology such as homogeny, reification, and false consciousness.\n\nThe novel satirizes capitalism by employing the concept of false consciousness, where the common people are kept ignorant of their true economic standing and are instead driven by a desire for personal gain. This is achieved through the conditioning of the population, particularly the lower classes, to focus on consumption, indulgence, and spending, as seen in the use of hypnopædia in the novel. The World Controller manipulates this drive, reinforcing the idea that the masses are dominated by a more powerful group, exemplifying the concept of hegemony.\n\nThe lack of genuine relationships between individuals is a notable aspect of Brave New World, with characters lacking depth and individuality. This may suggest that Huxley believes technology and capitalism are eroding human free will and emotional expression. Interactions between characters are superficial, with a focus on physical appearance and shallow conversations, further highlighting the effects of capitalist conformity.\n\nThe absolute obedience of each social class to their predetermined role in society is also a telling aspect of the novel, echoing Marxist ideas about the proletariat's false sense of superiority. By examining Huxley's work through a Marxist lens, it becomes clear that his novel is a commentary on the dangers of unchecked capitalist systems and their impact on human relationships and individuality.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many of us, getting around campus can be a real challenge. My experience with this issue started during my freshman year, when I was stuck in an East Halls dorm room, which might as well have been on the edge of campus, especially when you factor in the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. I'd often spend up to 25 minutes on foot, battling through the unpredictable State College weather, just to get from my home in Stuart Hall to classes like those held in the Willard building near the center of campus. Recently, I spoke to an alumnus who's not much older than me, and they shared some insight on how things used to be. Not long ago, the East Halls dorms were isolated from the rest of the school by large tracts of unused land. However, those empty spaces have since been filled with sports fields, new buildings like the Creamery and health services building, and surrounding apartment complexes. As our campus continues to expand, navigating it's becoming increasingly difficult. So, what's the solution to this mobility problem? For a college campus like ours, I firmly believe that the answer lies in the bicycle. But, it's not just about having a bike; students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be designed with bicyclists in mind.\n\nI had a conversation with a friend who recently picked up biking again after a multi-year hiatus, and he said, \"Bikes are great – for a few years, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" Not only is biking good for your physical health, it's also the most efficient way to travel. With a bowl of oatmeal and some physical exertion, you can cover distances of 30 miles or more. As an off-campus student, I'm just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. Buying a bike this year was one of the smartest decisions I made. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, which would take me 25 minutes to walk from my home. However, riding a bike can cut that time down to just 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the most direct route to Thomas building from my house, but it's not always an easy road to navigate, bike or not. While there are benefits to walking as well, personally, I'm too busy to walk. If I didn't have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class, taking over two and a half hours out of my week. Add that to the time I'd spend walking to other classes, appointments, and so on, and that's more time than I can spare."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",

To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1).

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",

They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "As I pursue a career in social work, I aspire to dedicate myself to helping children who have been abused or neglected through the Division of Family and Children Services. My personal values of service, respect, and a strong moral compass will serve as cornerstones in my field, as well as in my personal growth. These principles are not only essential for social workers but also deeply ingrained in my own character. I've always been driven to make a positive impact, and my experiences throughout high school and college have only strengthened my resolve. I've witnessed individuals struggling with their problems and resorting to unhealthy coping mechanisms. This led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology, which I completed at Piedmont College in 2009. However, I wasn't entirely sure of my career path at the time. It wasn't until I had a pivotal encounter with a troubled teenager that I became determined to make a difference in the lives of families and children. This young boy, who was being abused by his parents, had reached out to a friend of mine, and I was inspired to take action. I spoke with the police and the parents, expressing my concerns as a recent graduate with a degree in Psychology. This experience solidified my decision to pursue a career in social work, driven by a desire to support children who are caught in the midst of \"simple\" family disputes.\n\nAnother important value in social work is social justice. As a society, we often emphasize the importance of individuality, yet we often conform to societal norms and expectations. I, on the other hand, have never been afraid to express my individuality and challenge social injustices. Throughout my time in high school and college, I've actively spoken out against racism and discrimination, wearing clothing that reflects my personality, and even piercing my ears in a way that feels authentic to me. My involvement with the GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance) has also been a significant part of my journey towards advocating for social justice. I believe in the power of standing up for what is right, even in the face of adversity.",
            "This paper explores the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The Biological model focuses on genetic information passed down and medical aspects of health, while the Sociocultural model examines environmental factors, such as race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review will examine these models and explain the research chosen to relate to and better understand them. A critique of the research and its findings will also be provided, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nInsomnia can be categorized as a primary sleep disorder, a disorder related to another mental condition, or a disorder linked to other medical issues. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssonmias (such as insomnia and hypersomnia) and Parasomnias (like nightmares and sleepwalking disorders). Sleep disorders related to another mental condition involve difficulties with sleep due to Axis I or Axis II disorders. Research on insomnia and primary sleep disorders will be examined in relation to the Biological and Sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model focuses on genetic factors, heritable traits, and physiological aspects of sleep disorders. One study using mice found that neurons in the hypothalamus, specifically those containing orexin, play a crucial role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. The study discovered that specific GABAB receptors on these neurons influence sleep-wake states. Activation of the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, while inhibition of this receptor can lead to reduced anxiety and induce sleep. Furthermore, the GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time in mice, suggesting that this receptor plays a significant role in human sleep regulation. This research implies that genetic and environmental factors can affect the functioning of this receptor, potentially leading to sleep disorders. A sociocultural implication of this study is that inherited traits can influence sleep patterns, and alterations in the receptor could naturally disrupt sleep, affecting daily life and tasks that require focus and concentration.",
            "The following paper delves into the realm of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), a condition that affects the way the brain interprets auditory information. To begin with, it's essential to understand what CAPD entails. In simple terms, it refers to the brain's inability to effectively process sounds, despite the individual having normal hearing. This disorder is not related to hearing impairment but rather to the brain's difficulty in distinguishing conversations from background noise, separating words, or differentiating between various sounds.\n\nThe roots of CAPD can be traced back to the 1950s when researchers first identified it as \"auditory imperception.\" The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari pioneered the development of tests for children with communicative disorders in 1954, and in 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing, providing a model to explain the brain's physiology in processing dichotic perception.\n\nCAPD manifests itself in various ways, including difficulty localizing sounds in space, distinguishing between multiple sounds, recognizing sound patterns, and differentiating changes in speech. Furthermore, individuals with CAPD may struggle to synthesize sound clues, interpret sequences of auditory information, or filter out background noise. \n\nTo diagnose CAPD, a comprehensive evaluation must be conducted, typically involving audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, or other healthcare professionals. This process may include a range of assessments, such as questionnaires, surveys, and observations of auditory behaviors. While there is no single, universally accepted test for CAPD, various tools are used to evaluate auditory-related skills and diagnose the disorder. These assessments may present individuals with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and ask them to identify specific items, such as words or numbers.\n\nIn conclusion, teachers in mainstreamed classrooms can play a vital role in supporting students with CAPD by being aware of the common characteristics or \"red flags\" associated with the disorder. By recognizing the signs, they can provide accommodations and strategies to help students with CAPD overcome their challenges and succeed academically.",
            "The play Twelfth Night warns us that while deception can be a useful tool for hiding the truth, it can also lead to a loss of one's true identity. However, the act of revealing one's deception can have a different cost altogether – alienation. This raises a difficult question: should one prioritize their own sense of self or their relationships with others. While some people may react neutrally to being fooled, others may feel deeply hurt and betrayed by the deception.\n\nIn the context of gender role reversal, the issue of deception becomes even more complicated. One of the main questions that arises is why someone would choose to take on a disguise in the first place. In the case of Viola, her decision to dress as a man is a means of self-preservation. As she says, \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town / Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help / I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" (5.1.247-249).\n\nHowever, Viola's disguise not only protects her from those who might harm her, but also cuts her off from the support system of women around her. Furthermore, her convincing performance as a man even leads Olivia to fall in love with her, which adds an extra layer of complexity to the situation. On top of that, Viola has to navigate her own romantic desires, which are suppressed by her disguise as a male servant.\n\nOne interpretation of the play is that deception can be a catalyst for revealing hidden emotions. The characters of Olivia and Orsino may have subconscious desires that are only brought to the surface by Viola's disguise. For instance, is Olivia truly attracted to Cesario because he appears to be a man, or does she secretly harbor feelings for women? While it's unlikely that Shakespeare intended to suggest that Olivia is a lesbian, her character does seem to be parodying the people of his time who judged others based on appearance.\n\nThis is evident in the way Olivia quickly switches her affections from Cesario to Sebastian and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as a family member rather than a romantic interest. The line \"A sister, you are she\" (5.1.315) is a telling moment that suggests Olivia's feelings for Cesario are not romantic, but rather a form of affection and acceptance.",
            "I've always been fascinated by the history of German colonial rule, and one of the most striking aspects is its brutal nature, especially with regards to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. However, it's essential to note that the German colonial empire was incredibly diverse in its policies and approaches, much like its geography. When it comes to education, the provision of schools across the colonies varied significantly. For instance, when the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans, which was a testament to the German efforts in that region. In contrast, the situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) was drastically different. Unlike in East Africa, where the government played a significant role in the education of the natives, the task of educating the locals in South West Africa was largely left to missionary societies that received limited government support. This approach had a lasting impact on the colony, even after German rule ended. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa \"the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" Several social, political, and economic factors contributed to this divergent experience, and this paper aims to delve deeper into these factors and examine new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nThere's an abundance of literature available on education in the German colonial empire, with many sources written in German during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. These early works primarily aimed to describe the characteristics of the educational systems in these colonies. Later studies in English expanded the discussion through comparative analyses of education in the various German colonies and more in-depth examinations of specific aspects of education. These studies revealed significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. A notable work that addresses the topic of this paper is Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa, which compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing features of the colony's educational system.\n\nSouth West Africa stood out from Germany's other colonial possessions due to its relatively temperate climate, despite the arid desert covering much of the territory. This favorable climate was reflected in the European population of South West Africa, with nearly 15,000 whites residing in the colony by 1913, compared to only 5,336 in East Africa, which had the next largest settler population.",
            "The world of popular music has undergone a significant transformation over the past 100 years, with an incredible number of genres emerging. It's getting increasingly hard to give a definitive list of all the sub-genres that have branched out from the major genres, like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk. Heavy metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres in the past 40 years. Its expressiveness stems from its wide range of emotions, with a clear bias towards the darker side of the emotional spectrum. \n\nHeavy metal's diversity is evident in how it branched out into various sub-genres right from the start. This diversity allowed people to experiment and create their own unique styles, giving birth to a chain of sub-sub-genres that continues to this day. Today, the heavy metal movement has become so vast that it's tricky to pinpoint what exactly constitutes heavy metal music. It has incorporated a wide range of themes from other genres, but, like everything else, it originated from somewhere. To truly understand the metal music that surrounds us, it's essential to grasp the core of the metal movement and why it's a movement rather than just a genre.\n\nThe term \"metal\" is often associated with darkness, and, in many ways, it's a music of excess - more bass, more volume, more violence, and more theatricality. Metal musicians are known for their exceptional skills, and it shows in their music. Another defining characteristic of the metal movement is its strong connection to substance use. The mid-70s saw a psychedelic drug boom, which led to people creating out-of-this-world records, using their experiences with these substances as inspiration. Metal music is characterized by its dark, visceral qualities, which were a refreshing change from the more upbeat and cheerful aspects of popular music at the time. Later generations of metal drew inspiration from the dark, raw qualities of the Romantic Era. Lyrics like these showcase the darkness that's a staple of the movement:\n\n\"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles is an example of how the genre came to be. It's a song that captures the highs and lows, supposedly inspired by the darker side of substance use. Many consider it one of the first heavy metal songs, a response to the Rolling Stones' heavier and darker side. The Beatles aimed to prove they could be just as heavy as their rivals, placing this song on their iconic album, The White Album.",
            "Before the Surrealist artists began creating their dreamlike masterpieces, Henri Rousseau was bringing his own dreams to life. Literally and figuratively, his 1910 painting, The Dream, showcases not just a woman marveling at the wonders of a dream world, but also Rousseau's personal aspirations as an artist. For years, he'd dreamed of being recognized, admired, and praised by fellow artists and art enthusiasts, but he faced a tough internal dilemma: conform to the art world's expectations by mimicking popular styles, or stay true to himself and forge his own path. This internal struggle is beautifully captured in The Dream, a painting that reflects Rousseau's long-standing conflict between artistic conformity and creative independence.\n\nTo truly appreciate The Dream, it's essential to understand Rousseau's life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, northwest France, Rousseau was the son of a tinsmith and hardware dealer who enjoyed a comfortable middle-class lifestyle. Unlike many artists of his time, Rousseau didn't receive any formal art training. Instead, he worked as a municipal toll service employee, earning the nickname \"douanier\" or customs inspector, until he was 40. His life took a dramatic turn after the death of his first wife, Clémence, and eight infant children left him with only one surviving child, Julia, and a deep sense of loss. He turned to painting as a way to cope and start anew. Unlike many of his contemporaries, who romanticized the peasant in their work, Rousseau was a folk painter who drew from the hopes and dreams of the common people.\n\nRousseau's desire for recognition from the art world is understandable, given his background and the fact that he began his career at an older age, competing with other talented artists who were already well-established. It wasn't until around the same time that Matisse was gaining recognition that Rousseau started to receive proper recognition for his art. According to art historian Jan Gordon, Rousseau and Matisse differed not only in style and subject matter but also in their motivations for painting. While Matisse was driven by a fear of creating art that was too conventional, Rousseau's goal was to create something so ordinary that he'd be accepted into the Artiste Français.",
            "The notion that ethics and aesthetics are intertwined has long been explored by various thinkers, with many positing a fundamental connection between truth and beauty. I firmly believe there's a reason behind this idea. John Keats' famous words from \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\" - \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know\" - highlight the connection between the two. It seems that our appreciation of ethics and aesthetics isn't solely learned through education or experience but rather arises from a deeper, more intuitive understanding.\n\nBoth ethics and aesthetics attempt to describe rather than prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty aim to explain why a particular art piece or literary work is beautiful or why an action is morally sound, rather than providing a set of rules to judge or create good art or moral behavior. The essence of what makes art or morals great cannot be fully captured through criticism. Discussing the value of, for example, da Vinci's Mona Lisa may involve analyzing concepts like foreground, background, and cultural context, but these factors don't truly convey why it's considered a masterpiece. When asked about a favorite work of art or literature, people often respond with a phrase like \"There's just something about it,\" followed by a more in-depth explanation.\n\nI believe that both art and morals can't be reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor noted, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Similarly, no matter how thoroughly we describe the properties of a literary work, there's an intangible, transcendent aspect that remains. This is echoed in Wittgenstein's statement that \"ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" I propose that this \"something,\" this je ne sais quoi, is art and morality's most powerful attribute. The transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a common ground between them.\n\nI believe that morality and art are closely related because we experience both at a noumenal level, a term coined by Kant. They impact us on a level that can be felt but not fully explained. This connection is even stronger in literature, which, as McKean notes, is distinguished by its moral quality. Standards of morality are as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Literature's importance lies in the values we find within it, and it's these values that make it unique among the arts.",
            "The Germany we see today is a nation with a unique blend of cultures, from the snow-capped Alps to the shores of the Baltic Sea. This diverse cultural identity is reflected in the country's varied regions, from the bustling streets of Munich to the historic city of Dresden, nestled along the Elbe River. Considering Germany's rich history and the influences that have shaped it, it's no surprise that the country's identity is a result of various ethnic groups and tribes.\n\nThe origins of the name \"Germania\" are shrouded in mystery, with scholars and historians offering different theories. Some believe it stems from the name of a Germanic tribe known as the Tungrians, whom Tacitus called the Germans before they crossed the Rhine and clashed with the Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar also used the term \"Germanus\" in his account of the Gallic Wars, using it to distinguish between the Gauls and the Germanic tribes he encountered. Caesar likely borrowed the word from the Gauls themselves, who used it to describe their neighbors. In his writings, Caesar noted that the Germans lived across the Rhine, continually at odds with the Gauls (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC).\n\nOther theories suggest that the name \"Germania\" comes from the spear used in ancient warfare, known as a \"ger.\" Alternatively, it may be derived from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" implying that the Germans were known for their loud and boisterous nature. \n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus wrote extensively on the origins of the Germans in his work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" (98 AD). He described the Germans as an indigenous people, untouched by external influences, who lived in a harsh and unforgiving land. Tacitus noted that the Romans would not have chosen to emigrate to such a place unless it was their ancestral homeland. As a result, Germanic tribes lived on the periphery of the Roman Empire, trading goods and skills with the Romans, who would occasionally launch campaigns into Germania (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17).",
            "My train of thought had hit a brick wall, and I was staring blankly ahead, trying to process the scene in front of me.  I was numb, unemotional, and detached, but my mind was working overtime, analyzing every detail without really connecting it to anything meaningful.  Thoughts flashed through my head, only to disappear just as quickly, leaving me with a sense of detachment from my own thoughts.\n\nFor years, I'd been fascinated with drawing, ever since I was a kid.  Recently, I'd picked up an art instruction book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\" and was determined to learn the techniques.  One of the exercises involved placing a square frame around any picture you wanted to study, breaking down a complex scene into something more manageable.  But as I gazed down at the, ahem, \"art\" in front of me, I couldn't even wrap my head around that concept.  I was too caught up in the sheer overwhelmingness of it all.\n\nIn the world of art, some people focus on specific themes or colors.  Picasso went through a blue phase, Monet loved greenery, and the Renaissance masters were known for their use of vibrant colors.  If I was going to consider myself an artist, I thought, then this toilet bowl was my blank canvas, the start of my masterpiece, which I'd dubbed \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nMy hand instinctively reached for the toilet handle, but this time, my mind was racing with possibilities.  Water swirled, and I felt a surge of creative energy.  But instead of a masterpiece, I was faced with something far less inspiring.  The toilet paper roll was stuck, and I was left to deal with it.\n\nI gripped the mop handle tightly and stood there, feeling irritated and frustrated.  My green tie felt like a noose around my neck, and I scowled at the offending mess in front of me.  A few more flushes, a few more moments of introspection, and then I was up to the task at hand.  I reached for the toilet paper, wrapped my hand in it like a mummy, and slowly, deliberately, I plunged it into the bowl, like a mom preparing a Thanksgiving turkey for the oven.",
            "It's unsettling to see the alarming number of teenagers who are losing their lives behind the wheel.  Several factors contribute to this deadly trend among young American drivers.  One significant aspect is that the teenage brain isn't mature enough to handle the risks associated with driving, as explained by the National Institutes of Health. Additionally, inexperience plays a substantial role in this issue, resulting in higher rates of fatal accidents, vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nIt's no surprise that teens are more prone to accidents when driving with their peers, which unfortunately happens quite frequently.  A study conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center revealed a correlation between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents.  In response, California and other states have implemented provisional driver's licenses that restrict the hours teens can drive and ban other minors as passengers. \nWhile these temporary licenses are a step in the right direction, I believe they are merely a temporary solution.  The underlying issue is that, statistically speaking, the youngest drivers are not equipped to handle the risks and responsibilities of driving.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman suggests that 18 is still too young for a standard driver's license.  His research, as reported by USA Today, indicates that those under the age of 19-20 are more likely to engage in risk-taking behavior for the thrill of it.  It makes sense, then, to delay driving until this behavior has subsided.  If we continue to grant driver's licenses to young teens, we can expect to see even more devastating accidents and an unprecedented death toll in the coming years.  By 2010, the Baby Boomer generation's children will be eligible to drive, leading to millions of new teen drivers taking to the roads. \nImplementing legislation to address this issue would be a reasonable and straightforward process.  Schools could continue to offer driver's education classes to initiate the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 should be allowed to operate a vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued before granting a full license, with a set number of practical driving hours required.  This number could be based on the typical hours required by most states (in California, for example, drivers need 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  National legislation addressing this issue would be a fair and effective way to protect young drivers across the country. \nMy proposed legislation is not a new idea, but rather a common-sense approach to addressing a pressing concern.",
            "I recently stumbled upon the fascinating world of early Edison films, specifically the trick films from the Library of Congress's collection. Out of the 15 films from 1895 to 1901, I made it a point to watch them all. Trick films, also known as illusion films, rely heavily on creative editing to create an air of wonder and illusion. My in-depth study of these films focused on understanding the underlying poetics and examining the unique characteristics that set the later films apart. \n\nInterestingly, most trick films from the late 19th and early 20th centuries adhere to a strict set of conventions. These early films take place within the confines of a stage, framed by a frontal proscenium, and are typically shot from a single, static position. The camera never deviates from this position, even when characters or objects move within the scene. This composition style was borrowed from the world of theatre and vaudeville, where performers would often move within a fixed frame. This means that characters in these early films often move side-to-side, but never towards or away from the camera.\n\nTake, for instance, the classic film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move horizontally across the frame, never deviating from the fixed position of the camera. Even when they disappear from view, the camera remains stationary.\n\nAnother notable aspect of early trick films is the limited use of camera angles. Long shots and medium shots are the norm, while close-ups are almost nonexistent. This is due in part to the theatrical tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance within the frame of the stage. Actors rarely move towards or away from the camera, making close-ups a rare occurrence.\n\nThe one-shot-per-film rule is also a defining characteristic of early trick films. This limitation restricts the length of these films to around a minute or less, depending on the frame rate used. Most trick films focus on short, vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic and disappearing acts, rather than developing a narrative. However, a closer examination often reveals that what appears to be a single shot can, in fact, be composed of multiple joined shots, cleverly edited to create an illusion. Take, for example, The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), where a single conceptual shot is actually comprised of several physical shots.\n\nThese early trick films laid the groundwork for the development of cinematic techniques, pushing the boundaries of what was possible with film. Despite their limitations, they remain an essential part of film history, offering a glimpse into the creative experimentation and innovation of the early days of cinema.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an outspoken advocate for Republicanism in the early days of the United States.  As an agriculturalist and a politician, he was known for his unwavering dedication to individual freedom and limited government.  His strong belief in the superiority of an agrarian system influenced his views on governance, sovereignty, and the judicial system.  He was determined to preserve and promote this ideal, often using it as the foundation for his arguments. \n\nTaylor believed that the US had a unique opportunity to create an ideal system of government, free from the constraints of established traditions.  He firmly believed in the natural rights of individuals, which he saw as interconnected and interdependent – if one right was denied, the value of the remaining rights would be diminished.  He advocated for these rights to be beyond government interference.  He also believed that the so-called \"state of nature\" was a reality where the strong and cunning exploited the weak, but that this should not be the case in civilization.\n\nTo create an ideal society, Taylor proposed a government that acknowledged both the good and evil inherent in humanity.  He had a rigid viewpoint on dualistic morality, stating that government, being run by humans, would inherently reflect both virtues and vices.  He defined good principles as those that protected private property, promoted agriculture, and discouraged capitalism, believing that a government founded on these principles would function fairly regardless of its leadership, which would always be driven by self-interest and avarice.  He believed that self-interest was a natural motivation for humans, but only became problematic when it led to the creation of sub-societies that exploited others.\n\nTaylor, like many other Republicans of his time, advocated for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He sought an extremely limited Federal government with no powers beyond those explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He recognized that an extensive government was expensive and prone to despotism, but also believed that a simplistic, literal interpretation was precarious and open to corruption.  Furthermore, he saw the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the United States, as it more clearly described the country as a group of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "In looking back at the project's data, there was a significant drop in commuter log submissions in the third month, which was a bit disheartening, and it's hard to pinpoint the exact reason for this decline. Considering the onset of winter at our New England campus, it's likely that the drop in people commuting by bicycle or on foot contributed to this decrease. Additionally, December marks the end of the fall semester, a time when students and faculty are busy with schoolwork, processing grades, and preparing for the holidays. As a result, filling out the commuter log may have fallen by the wayside for many. Furthermore, December is the start of the busy holiday season, followed by a month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many don't need to be on campus. Classes resume in late January, which might explain the low number of submissions for that month. However, none of these reasons fully account for the low number of submissions in February. It's also possible that the initial enthusiasm for the project naturally waned over time. To combat this, we introduced Carpool Challenge Week, a special campaign in March that resulted in an increase in log submissions. Despite our efforts, we still faced the challenges of maintaining momentum in the face of natural fluctuations and the unique challenges of the academic calendar. \n\nAnother challenge we encountered was the deeply ingrained preference for the freedom and independence that comes with driving a car. This is a cultural norm that's difficult to overcome. To incentivize alternative modes of commuting, we offered prizes in the form of gift certificates to local businesses, which seemed to be effective at the outset. It would have been interesting to see how larger prizes, such as a new bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car, might have impacted participation, potentially reviving the project's momentum and combatting the dip in engagement. Our prize offerings remained consistent throughout the project, but increasing the value of the prizes over time might have made a difference. The initial gift cards seemed sufficient, but announcing additional, more substantial prizes, such as bicycles or alternative fuel vehicles, in the later stages of the project might have boosted participation.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a type of investment security that offers the benefits of an index fund, such as diversification, but with more flexibility and trading capabilities like a stock. Unlike traditional index funds, ETFs allow you to buy and sell shares throughout the day, giving you the freedom to sell short, buy on margin, and even purchase as few as a single share in any transaction. One of the major advantages of ETFs is their expense ratios, which are significantly lower than those of the average mutual fund. However, there are some drawbacks to consider, including the need to pay a commission on each trade, just like when buying or selling a stock. Another benefit of ETFs is the wide range of options available, with various funds tracking different indices, commodities, or baskets of assets.\n\nIn evaluating the performance of a specific ETF, such as the IHF, it's essential to assess whether the stated benefits, like diversification, are actually effective and to what extent. To do this, we'll be examining the top 10 holdings of the IHF and comparing their performance to a hypothetical portfolio consisting of the same stocks in the same proportions. This will help us determine whether the benefits of owning a single ETF are comparable to those of a diversified portfolio of individual stocks.\n\nTo keep our analysis manageable, we've decided to focus on the top 10 holdings, which account for approximately 63.58% of the ETF's assets. Below, we'll outline these holdings and their corresponding percentages.\n\nTo estimate how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF as a whole, we can use the current asset allocation to calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return, as if the portfolio consisted entirely of these 10 stocks in the same proportions. The calculations are presented in the chart below.\n\nThe results show that a portfolio consisting only of the top 10 holdings would yield a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. Additionally, the Beta of this portfolio is 0.12 lower than the ETF's Beta. These findings suggest that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings may provide a higher return with a lower risk. However, it's essential to consider whether these differences are statistically significant.\n\nTo address this, we've calculated the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalized it to 100% to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "One of Edgar Allan Poe's personal favorites is the poem \"Dream-Land\". In this poem, Poe uses the term \"Thulé\" twice, which is a significant reference that sheds light on his influences.  Tom Mabbott, a literary scholar, notes that Poe likely borrowed \"Thulé\" from the ancient Roman poet Virgil. However, it's also possible that Poe was inspired by a more contemporary source: his admiration for German author Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. \n\nThis connection is significant because it demonstrates Poe's familiarity with Goethe's work. In his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon\", literary critic Karl J. Arndt highlights the similarities between Poe's poem and Goethe's writing style, suggesting that Poe may have been influenced by Goethe's work. \n\nInterestingly, Goethe was a prominent writer of the poetic drama \"Faust\", which was published in two parts: the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of his death. Within the second part of \"Faust\" lies a short poem called \"The King of Thulé\", which tells the story of a king who loses his wife and becomes consumed by grief and drinking. The description of the King of Thulé bears a striking resemblance to the persona in \"Dream-Land\", which could be seen as a dark reflection of Poe's own experiences with loss and addiction. \n\nGoethe's work was widely known and admired during Poe's time, and it's likely that Poe was familiar with it through his respect for fellow poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson. Poe even expressed admiration for Tennyson, which suggests that he would have been aware of Goethe's work. In fact, Goethe's \"Faust\" was widely reproduced and translated after its initial publication, making it easily accessible to Poe and other writers of his time.\n\nIt's worth noting that Poe references Thule twice in his writings, both times using the phrase \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and \"Dream-Land\". The two poems can be seen as companion pieces, as they share a similar themes and imagery. In \"Dream-Land\", the speaker describes a desolate landscape of Thule, haunted by the spirits of the dead and devoid of color. This can be seen as a dark reflection of Goethe's \"The King of Thulé\", in which the king is consumed by grief and loss after the death of his wife.",
            "In California, could a customer who slipped and fell on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages if the store manager was informed twice about the spill but didn't clean it for over 30 minutes while he ate dinner? The answer is not a simple one. A judge is unlikely to dismiss the customer's claim out of hand. To receive punitive damages, the customer must show that the store manager acted with reckless disregard for the harm that would come from not cleaning the spill. The customer can argue that the manager should have known about the potential dangers because multiple customers had slipped and fallen on spills in the same store before. Despite this knowledge, the manager still chose not to clean the spill. While it's debatable whether the manager's actions were truly malicious, it's hard to deny that his behavior was irresponsible given the number of previous slip-and-fall incidents in 2009.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee informed the manager, Paul Martin, of the applesauce spill. Martin told him to handle it later, saying he was on dinner break. Fifteen minutes later, another employee reminded Martin about the spill, but he responded in the same manner. At 5:30 pm, the customer, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill, suffering a serious back injury. In the months leading up to this accident, there had been five other slip-and-fall incidents at the store. Palmer is now suing the store for damages related to her injury, and we're examining whether to file a motion to dismiss the claim for punitive damages.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of duty if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm or, in the absence of intent, was done with a willful and conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others. Courts have deemed conduct malicious when the defendant was aware of the potential dangers and chose to ignore them. In this case, the customer can argue that the manager was aware of the potential harm and failed to take action, making a strong case for punitive damages.",
            "It's been almost four years since I took a course in Islam at CBC, and the question of whether Islam is a hostile religion still resonates with me today.  The events that have unfolded since 9/11 have led to a shift in the way mass media portrays Islam in America, moving from a negative perception to an extreme form of tolerance.  I think it's remarkable that we've come to a point where a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, with a Muslim background, could run for office without being met with the same level of scrutiny.\n\nThe Biography of the Prophet Muhammad has left an impression on me, particularly because it seems to contradict the image of Muhammad that I had formed based on my previous knowledge.  From what I understood, Muhammad was a conqueror who forced tribes to adopt Islam after taking over, but the biography portrays him as a humble and misunderstood figure who was respected and sought out by people who saw the truth in his teachings.\n\nI've also noticed some striking similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the miracles attributed to Muhammad.  One example that stands out is the story of how he multiplied food to feed a large crowd, much like Jesus did with the loaves and fish.  This writing style makes me wonder if the authors were trying to depict Muhammad as a humble prophet who didn't need to prove anything, but simply lived a life of truth and miracles.  To me, this approach downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ, and it's like they're trying to take credit for his personhood and life through Muhammad.\n\nThe biography also includes many stories that seem to be part of an agenda to provide proof of the truth of Islam, but these stories often come from secondary or tertiary sources.  This makes them seem suspicious and less convincing to me, as I think it's harder to verify their accuracy.\n\nWhat bothers me most about this work is the way it tries to portray Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, wise, and gentle.  However, historical accounts suggest that Muhammad was a more complex figure, and I wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true story behind his rise to power.",
            "It's intriguing to consider how the teachings of Jesus and the values he stood for were largely abandoned as Christianity evolved after his time.  If we examine this historical shift, it becomes clear that Christianity has drifted further away from its roots.  It appears that today's world is witnessing a growing awareness and a more progressive mindset, particularly among Christians.  Although traditionalists will undoubtedly resist any deviation from the original teachings, their influence may eventually wane, allowing a more open-minded approach to take hold.  As time passes, a growing number of Christians will seek to distinguish the added doctrines from the core principles of the faith.  This process may take decades or even centuries, but it's inevitable:  a significant reversal in Christian history is on the horizon.  A movement will emerge, stripping away the layers of doctrine that have accumulated over time, much like a clock rewinding, until all that remains is a clear understanding of Jesus' original message.  When this shift gains momentum in the United States and Europe, it will lead to a more uniform and streamlined expression of Christianity, as people return to the core principles Jesus brought forth.  The church as an institution will continue to thrive, but the resulting uniformity will supplant the current diversity of Christian denominations and practices.  History is replete with examples of such reversals, such as the transformation of the Roman Empire from a persecutor of Christians to a Christian institution, or the shift in the United States from a society that enslaved Africans to one where African Americans hold positions of leadership.  The future holds a similar reversal for the Christian faith, as people seek to return to the source and undo the complexities that have developed over time.  This process will be facilitated by a shift in how we interpret Jesus' words, moving from a literal to a metaphorical understanding.  So, what led to the divergence from Jesus' original message?  If we look back far enough, we find that the foundation of Christianity is rooted in Judaism.  By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., the core of Jewish thought had already taken shape, centered around monotheism, the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, and a divinely revealed religion.  The Jewish populace was not a monolithic entity, however, and divided into various groups, including the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common people.",
            "I firmly believe that The Jungle is a powerful portrayal of humanity's inherent selfishness and lack of empathy. The novel vividly illustrates how people's primal instincts drive them to prioritize their own interests above all else, often at the expense of those who are less fortunate. The novel showcases this theme through the actions of the factory owners and managers, who only care about expanding their businesses and increasing their wealth, without any regard for the harm it may cause to others or the environment. In the book, Upton Sinclair paints a stark picture of the devastating impact of industrialization, describing the factories as \"the line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". This vivid imagery highlights the owners' blatant disregard for the well-being of people and animals affected by their actions. They show no concern for the pollution spewing from the factories or the animal waste and filth surrounding Packingtown.\n\nFurthermore, the owners and managers are only interested in maximizing their profits, rather than treating their employees with dignity or respect. They exploit their workers, forcing them to work long hours for minimal pay and without any regard for their safety or well-being. The novel highlights the harsh realities of the time period, where workers had no protections or support, and were often treated as nothing more than replaceable commodities. The book describes the conditions as \"a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". This toxic environment is perpetuated by the lack of regulations and organizations to protect the workers' rights, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation. The novel suggests that the workers were essentially treated as slaves, forced to live and work in squalid conditions with no hope of escape.\n\nSinclair's work serves as a scathing critique of the capitalist system and the treatment of workers during that era. The novel's portrayal of the dehumanizing effects of industrialization and the exploitation of workers is a powerful reminder of the need for workers' rights and social justice.",
            "Many authors have mastered the art of creating a specific atmosphere in their readers through various techniques. F. Scott Fitzgerald is a brilliant example of this, as seen in his novel The Great Gatsby. In his writing, Fitzgerald frequently employs a range of techniques to evoke distinct emotions and attitudes in his readers. His approach often involves pairing unusual adjectives with nouns to create an initial impression, while also applying deeper meaning to symbols throughout the story. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald takes this technique to the next level by assigning significance to various colors, including gold, green, white, and red/pink. He cleverly builds up the meaning behind these colors, particularly white and gray, and later uses them to create a distinctive aura around specific objects and characters.\n\nFitzgerald's use of white and gray is particularly noteworthy, as he establishes a connection between these colors and uniformity. White is often associated with a sense of refinement and higher social class, while gray represents a more faded and aged quality. In the beginning of the novel, Fitzgerald consistently employs both colors, creating an image of uniformity. For instance, Daisy and Jordan are frequently depicted wearing white, and even the other characters follow suit, donning white attire at various social gatherings. The only time this uniformity is broken is when Nick attends Gatsby's party, where he observes a more vibrant atmosphere with primary colors. Furthermore, Fitzgerald reinforces this connection by associating these colors with ordinary, mundane subjects, such as the streets of New York and the names on Nick's timetable.\n\nAs the novel progresses, Fitzgerald skillfully employs these colors to convey a sense of uniformity or unimportance surrounding specific subjects. This begins with Daisy, who is first described wearing a white dress in a \"little white roadster.\" This image creates a sense of detachment, making Daisy seem more like a uniform addition to Gatsby's life rather than a fully fleshed-out character. Fitzgerald continues to use this technique to reinforce this impression, often depicting Daisy in white attire or describing her as having a \"gray haze\" around her. By building up the meaning behind these colors and using them consistently throughout the novel, Fitzgerald masterfully creates a lasting impression on his readers.",
            "San Diego County stands out as a fertile ground for agriculture, thanks to its idyllic climate. The region's rich crop selection includes a variety of produce such as tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, and squash. Organic farming has gained significant traction in the area, with a substantial demand for community-supported agriculture and a high interest in locally produced products like organic eggs and milk. Many farms not only provide tours of their operations but also offer recreational activities like hiking and birdwatching, promoting a win-win situation for both the landowners and the environment.\n\nOrganic farming also brings several environmental benefits, including increased biodiversity due to the absence of chemicals in the soil and water. However, this type of farming comes with some drawbacks. It requires more labor and intense management to maintain soil quality and control pests and weeds without using chemicals, potentially resulting in higher losses compared to conventional farming methods. Additionally, smaller organic farms often lack the efficiency of large-scale operations, making it challenging to balance profit and habitat quality.\n\nConsidering these factors, it's no wonder that a farmer like the one in this scenario would seek financial assistance or expert guidance to optimize their operation and make the most of the land. The chosen property is a 160-acre parcel located in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of San Diego County, California, near the town of Potrero. This land features a mix of chaparral, non-native Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, bordering the Cleveland National Forest. The area is home to a diverse range of plant and animal species, some of which are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat and the mountain yellow-legged frog.\n\nThe land has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries before being settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. As part of an original homestead patent, the land was likely used for grazing and wood production for many years.\n\nTo illustrate the potential for a small farmer in this region to mitigate costs and preserve wildlife-friendly operations, I researched government programs and found an existing organic farm in the area as a model to follow. This hypothetical scenario highlights the possibilities and challenges faced by a landowner seeking to balance financial success with environmental stewardship.",
            "In any negotiation, culture plays a vital role in shaping the dynamics of the table talks. However, it's essential to recognize that culture is not a fixed or singular entity, but rather a complex and multifaceted concept that encompasses what it is, what it signifies, and what it's not. A statement like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" is an oversimplification, as culture is not homogenous or uniform. Instead, it's more productive to delve into the nuances of a culture and understand its significance in the context of the negotiation. When interacting with a foreign culture, individuals tend to relate to it through their own cultural lens, leading to inevitable comparisons and assumptions.\n\nTo effectively navigate cultural differences, negotiators must be willing to study and learn about the culture they're engaging with. This involves understanding its history, values, and prejudices, rather than judging or attempting to change it. When working with a weaker bargaining position, respecting the local culture and traditions can be a powerful tool in overcoming cultural barriers and moving the negotiation forward.\n\nInterestingly, culture is not limited to national or international boundaries. Corporate cultures within a given nation can be just as distinct and influential. For instance, some companies may prioritize long working hours, while others adopt a more relaxed schedule. These cultural differences can be seen in employee dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices. Even within the same nation, companies can exhibit varying levels of philanthropy, dress codes, and communication styles, highlighting the diversity of thought within a particular societal culture. By looking beyond the surface level, negotiators can uncover the complexities of a culture and make more informed decisions.\n\nUnderstanding values is equally crucial, as they provide the underlying motivations and drivers of a culture. For example, if a culture values saving face or communal harmony, a negotiator will be less likely to publicly shame their company or superior to achieve a successful outcome. Conversely, a culture that places greater emphasis on a hard-driven bargain may not be willing to settle for a quick agreement. By considering these cultural nuances, negotiators can approach the negotiation table with a deeper understanding of their opponent's mindset and make more effective decisions.",
            "The idea that there is no God has been a notion expressed by some, as seen in Psalm 14 and St. Anselm's argument. Similarly, Thomas Aquinas, another prominent figure, also believed in the existence of God. Since we're comparing their arguments, we'll assume they're both defending the same concept of God - the one found in the Bible. This will allow us to fairly compare their arguments without introducing alternative interpretations. St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas both present valid points, but neither provides a complete foundation for believing in God.\n\nTo understand this, let's examine St. Anselm's argument. He suggests that the existence of God can be found within one's own mind. According to him, since we can't effectively conceive God's nonexistence, this proves his existence. Although his explanation can be a bit convoluted, the basic idea is that truth about God can be found within our own understanding, eliminating the need for external evidence. This concept of accepting something without concrete proof is often referred to as faith within Christian texts.\n\nIn contrast, Thomas Aquinas offers a more rational approach to proving God's existence. He believes it can be achieved solely through reason and empirical evidence, without the need for faith. This could be beneficial for spreading Christianity, as it would allow new converts to be recruited through logic alone, rather than relying on their willingness to accept something unproven. Aquinas presents five logical arguments supporting God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. He demonstrates that the existence of God is logically necessary, much like understanding the features of a missing puzzle piece without seeing it.",
            "In the ancient times, around the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince was born who would eventually become known as Buddha. As he navigated through life, he renounced worldly possessions and achieved enlightenment, setting the stage for the development of Buddhism, with Theravada Buddhism being its most traditional form. This ancient faith is now over 2,500 years old, and it has undergone a significant transformation over the years. This transformation can be witnessed by observing how Theravada Buddhism is practiced in countries such as Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is a significant event. This ritual is participated in by both monks and lay followers, even though Buddha himself never taught about any such celebration. These changes are not limited to mere customs and traditions but also extend to the core teachings of the faith. Over time, the Theravada Buddhist community has had to adapt its doctrines, both from a monastic and lay perspective, due to various internal and external influences.\n\nThroughout this discussion, certain terms will be used frequently. 'Internal' refers to any force that originates from within the Buddhist community, regardless of one's monastic status, while 'external' refers to any influence from non-Buddhists. A 'hostile' force is any influence that aims to harm or damage the Buddhist community, often stemming from a negative perception of Buddhism. On the other hand, a 'benign' force is one that neither wishes to harm nor help the Buddhist community, although its consequences may be either detrimental or beneficial. These definitions will be crucial in understanding the nuances of this discussion.\n\nTo begin, it's essential to grasp the fundamental principles of Theravada Buddhism, which forms the core of the faith. Buddhists seek refuge in the 'triple gem,' consisting of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is primarily composed of the Tripitaka, a collection of three baskets of Buddhist scriptures. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka explores the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism, including the concepts of Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these ideas is key to escaping Sansara, the cycle of birth and death, which is an ongoing process. Along with escaping Sansara will come the end of lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion), ultimately leading to enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth rules for lay followers, such as the five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not engage in misconduct, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental concept in Buddhism is the four noble truths, which include: first, the truth that life is filled with suffering; second, that attachment causes suffering; and third, that suffering can be overcome.",
            "The long-standing rivalry between the United States and Mexico is a prime example of a grueling and protracted conflict that lasted for 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145). The apex of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the U.S. invaded Mexico, seized Texas and the American Southwest, and secured new territory for itself. The two nations clashed repeatedly, with tensions finally easing just before World War I. \n\nWhat sets this rivalry apart from others is the fact that it was fueled by fundamental differences in values, customs, and interests, as well as clashing material ambitions (Schmitt 1974, p. 30-31). It's a common phenomenon among nations that share a border to develop rivalries due to competing interests. The U.S. and Mexico are no exception, although they are not the only countries to have had a long-standing rivalry with their neighbors. David M. Pletcher (1977) notes that Mexico and Cuba are the only two nations where the U.S. has had enduring diplomatic issues (p. 41). \n\nOne major factor that contributed to the rivalry was the issue of religion, a problem that has historically plagued numerous nations. Sally Frahm (2001) points out that Americans in the past were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy, much like their stance against fascism and communism in the 20th century (p.86). This ideological divide was partly fueled by the historical distrust between the English and Spanish, which was inherited by the U.S. and Mexico from their colonial rulers, making it challenging to establish a harmonious relationship between the two nations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) document 17 disputes between Mexico and the U.S. during the 57-year rivalry period, most of which centered on territorial issues, including border raids and frontier problems. Border violence was a significant issue that persisted until both countries exerted military force to control their borders (Schmitt 1974, p. 97). \n\nAs Schmitt (1974) explains, the rivalry began to subside as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the U.S. and America's ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico (p. 109-110). This marked a significant turning point in the relationship between the two nations.",
            "It's been 15 years since my life took a drastic turn due to an illness I had no prior knowledge of. At the time, I was a nurse, a profession I chose for the sense of security and stability it provided, which was a stark contrast to my childhood. The mantra I often heard growing up was that I could always find employment because people would always get sick, so I opted for nursing over my true passions of science and journalism. \n\nHowever, fate had other plans, and I found myself at 46, single, and with no savings. I've been living on Social Security Disability for 15 years now, and I've lost everything that I once considered truly mine. Every day is a struggle, and my sense of security, safety, and self-worth is constantly under attack. The one thing I can be certain of is that I couldn't have made it this far without the unwavering support of my family and a few close friends. When the going gets tough, being strong isn't enough; we all need a helping hand.\n\nMy point is that life is full of unexpected challenges, big and small, and no matter how well we prepare, some things are too great to overcome alone. I agree that our reliance on the government needs to change, but instead of resorting to building our own fallout shelters, I believe it's more important for Americans to learn to trust and help one another. We should be encouraged to ask for help when we need it, rather than trying to go it alone.\n\nThe notion of rugged individualism that our country's conservatives often tout is a misconception. It was the compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources of our forefathers that helped them navigate difficult times, not their ability to go it alone. The pioneers who crossed the country in wagon trains didn't make it by going solo; they had a community that supported them every step of the way.\n\nOf course, preparation is crucial, and I've taken the necessary steps to be ready for any situation. I have a disaster kit, first aid supplies, and other essential items in case of an emergency. However, while we should be prepared, it's equally important to build relationships with those around us. Get to know your neighbors, and work together to create a support system that will see you through the tough times.",
            "The age-old question of why organisms evolve in the way they do remains a mystery. Are there underlying restrictions or constraints that influence the direction and pace of evolutionary change? Despite D'Arcy Thompson's 1917 assertion that zoologists still struggle to define organic forms mathematically, recent advances in mathematical modeling have shed light on various aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis, particularly in terms of ontogeny and phylogeny (Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research aims to explore how mathematical modeling, combined with experimental studies, can help unravel the mechanisms driving evolutionary-developmental change in the genus Prunum. We analyzed X-ray images of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters that can be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were then fed into the CerioShell software program (Stone, 1995), allowing us to create hypothetical shell morphologies that can be used to interpret the boundaries of potential morphological change.\n\nImagine a shell as a three-dimensional tube that navigates through 360 degrees of space over time. The revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are known as whorls, which spiral around an imaginary central axis, or columella. The speed at which whorls grow can vary, and a continuous line separates each whorl, referred to as a suture. Typically, the largest whorl is the last one, or body whorl. The spire is comprised of all whorls except the last, while the apex is the tip of the spire, and the opposite end is called the base. The animal emerges from its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from various angles, including apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. The typical orientation of a shell is apertural, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upwards.\n\nTo count whorls, one should start by viewing the shell from the apical perspective and identifying the first suture. A line can then be drawn to divide the shell into two parts, and whorls can be counted from this line, estimating to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accumulates its shell. By tracing the path of the aperture via the coordinates of each whorl's center and the horizontal and vertical radius, it's possible to graphically and mathematically represent this trajectory. Once a mathematical formulation is established, it's possible to modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis by varying parameters.",
            "The neonatal and infant mortality rates in Indonesia have shown little change over the past decade.  Despite making progress in other areas, such as water and sanitation, the country is falling short of its goals for improving child and maternal health by 2015.  Several factors contribute to this lag, highlighting the need to strengthen the overall health system rather than relying on targeted programs.\n\nOn the surface, Indonesia appears to be making strides in healthcare, with 72% of births now attended by skilled healthcare workers.  However, this statistic includes traditional birth attendants, who may not be equipped to handle complications during pregnancy, resulting in a high number of maternal deaths from hemorrhage.  In reality, these improvements mask a more pressing need for better healthcare service.  Furthermore, there has been a decline in the number of children under five treated for diarrheal diseases, and postnatal care remains a concern, with low rates of care across the country.\n\nThe rate of cesarean sections is surprisingly low, at around 4%, and the disparity between urban and rural areas is striking.  While 7% of urban mothers opt for c-sections, a mere 2% of rural mothers do, indicating a severe imbalance in access to healthcare services.  This not only highlights the issue of geographic disparities but also points to a problem of vertical equity, with a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  The poor are disproportionately affected by out-of-pocket costs, making it even harder for them to access healthcare services.\n\nTo address the shortcomings in neonatal and maternal care, the primary question is how to effectively address the lack of healthcare services.  Should Indonesia focus on developing targeted programs or strengthening the overall health system, moving beyond isolated interventions for pre- and post-pregnancy care?  While program-specific approaches may offer quicker results and targeted objectives, they also have drawbacks.  Investing heavily in one area can divert resources and personnel from other areas, leading to duplication of services and uncoordinated efforts.  This fragmentation can result in an increase in paperwork and administrative costs, detracting from the primary goal of improving healthcare outcomes.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their meticulous attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the time period.  However, two novels, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, stand out as exceptions to this tradition.  These novels seamlessly blend elements of mystery and the bizarre, typical of novels from the period, to create more complex characters.  This approach not only deepens our understanding of their motivations and emotions but also adds an air of intrigue to their stories.\n\nAs the scene unfolds, a multitude of confusing and bewildering ideas flood the protagonist's mind.  The lines between reality and fantasy become blurred, as if he is walking between Sikes and Crackit, who are engaged in a heated dispute.  The words they speak seem to reverberate in his mind, and when he regains his focus, he finds himself conversing with them.  The sudden sound of gunfire shatters the tranquility, and the protagonist's world descends into chaos.  A maelstrom of lights and sounds assaults him, as if an unseen force is propelling him forward.  Throughout this whirlwind of visions, a persistent and gnawing sense of pain torments him, refusing to subside.\n\nIn both novels, this sense of mystery often manifests through dreamlike states or sequences.  These enigmatic occurrences in Oliver Twist frequently reveal the depths of Oliver's inner world, exposing his fears and the true nature of the events unfolding around him.  The recreation of Oliver's near-death experience in chapter 28 is a prime example of this technique.  As he relives the shooting, his senses are heightened, and he becomes trapped in a vivid nightmare.  The unseen force that bears him away serves as a reminder of his lack of control over the events that transpired, as well as the precarious state of his health.  The shooting has a profound impact on Oliver, leaving him feeling powerless and consumed by despair.  This sense of defeat is further reinforced by the notion that his fate was not of his own making, but rather the result of circumstances beyond his control.\n\nIn Wuthering Heights, the lines between reality and fantasy are similarly blurred.  The passage describes a day that seems to pass at an alarming rate, devoid of significance and yet filled with an air of foreboding.  Time appears to be distorted, with the day and night blending together in a seemingly endless cycle.  This sense of disorientation and unease sets the tone for the rest of the novel, hinting at the turmoil and tragedy that lies ahead.",
            "I still remember my time working in an after-school program where I tutored elementary-age students on various subjects. My strengths lay in English and reading, and I was often approached by instructors to help students who were struggling. One student, a boy named Adrian, really stood out to me; he was around third or fourth grade and was having a lot of trouble reading. However, it became apparent that something was off - he could pronounce some letters perfectly, while others were way off. It was a fascinating phenomenon. Despite his Latino background, Adrian spoke perfect English, which made it even more puzzling.\n\nIt wasn't until I met his mother, who didn't speak a word of English but only Spanish, that the solution became clear. I was struggling to communicate with her using my limited Spanish skills, but it hit me like a ton of bricks - Adrian's reading issues were due to his unfamiliarity with the English alphabet. I'm not sure if this revelation made a significant impact on his learning, but I hope he's doing better now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the language barrier problem in schools, particularly in California. It's not always as obvious as we think, and even students who speak perfect English can still struggle with reading. It's a complex issue that requires a multifaceted solution.\n\nIn Adrian's case, the solution was straightforward - English reading tutoring, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for students who barely speak English, the solution is much more complex. There's no one-size-fits-all answer, and a combination of methods is essential. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes, and more - each has its own merits, but none can solve the problem on its own.\n\nThe dual language system is a great concept that benefits not just children who speak Spanish as their first language but all students. Research has shown that children in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. Many people are skeptical, fearing it's a waste of resources and that most students won't benefit. But this is a misconception. If we implemented these programs as the norm, rather than the exception, all students would reap the rewards.\n\nSo, how do we make this work? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? That would be unrealistic and unreasonable. Instead, we can provide special aids, tutors, or whatever you want to call them, who are bilingual. This way, we can create a more inclusive and supportive learning environment that caters to the diverse needs of all students.",
            "Most of us have been told as children that there's something greater than us out there, something beyond our understanding.  We've been sent to Sunday school, Temple, or on inner journeys in search of answers.  Some of us accept the faith passed down by our parents without question, while others strongly reject it, and some of us even switch sides, adopting new values and then changing our minds again.  Ultimately, we're all on a path to define ourselves and our place in the universe through our own unique perspectives on spirituality.  We're all searching for a guiding light in the darkness to lead us out of the shadows and into the light.\n\nI still remember the day my dad told me his favorite bird was the cardinal.  We sat on our front porch during a rainy June evening, listening to the sound of rain pounding on the tin roof.  The gutters were overflowing, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  My dad looked out into the rain, a mix of searching and remembering in his eyes.  He was thinner and his clothes hung loosely from his body.  His hair was sparse and thin, and he avoided eye contact.  I felt scared, alone, and unsure how to talk to him about how much I'd miss him.  So I hugged him, moved my chair closer, and joined him in gazing out into the rain.\n\nMy dad passed away in December, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation hadn't eased his suffering, but had kept him alive for a few more months.  I couldn't understand the value of keeping him alive in that state, but I couldn't define it either.  If God existed, I thought, he'd stopped listening to me long ago.  So I didn't pray.  I just sat in the darkness, unable to bear watching my father slip away.\n\nI didn't want to see him leave this life behind.  So I turned away.  I wanted to remember my dad for who he was, not for how he died.  I knew my dad better than anyone, and I knew he wouldn't want me to watch him go.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days, waiting for the news.  But no one called.",
            "In essence, the term \"Gothic Novel\" is an oxymoron, as Ian Watt so aptly put it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel – a perfect blend of the old and the new. The Gothic mode has received a mixed bag of reactions over the years, with some criticizing it for lacking depth, while others praise it for its unique ability to evoke a sense of the \"terrible sublime.\"  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, was a pioneering work that combined elements from both the \"ancient\" and \"modern\" romances to create a new form of literary expression. Walpole's innovative approach involved merging old theatrical elements with the newer, more personal storytelling style of modern novels. This unique fusion allowed him to create what he called \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre is characterized by its use of archaic elements from medieval theatre, architecture, and traditions. When The Castle of Otranto was first published, the term \"gothic\" was associated with various cultures, styles, and time periods, and was often viewed as outdated or unsophisticated in comparison to the modern world. However, it's this very combination of the old and the new that has allowed the Gothic genre to endure and seem both archaic and fresh to readers across time.\n\nOne of the key elements of Gothic literature is the concept of chivalry, which plays a significant role in The Castle of Otranto. The medieval idea of chivalry, involving the training of a noble knight, is reinterpreted in this novel. Chivalry was particularly important to Gothic writers like Walpole because it represented an idealized version of knighthood – brave, honorable, and competent. Through the use of chivalric concepts and manners, the Gothic past is romanticized and idealized, foreshadowing the evolution of Gothic literature into Romanticism. In the midst of a tumultuous time, Walpole was likely reflecting on the perceived decline of morality and goodness in society, as embodied by his character Frederic. As the reader learns about Frederic, it's clear that he embodies many chivalric traits – he's a prince who has suffered, been affected by tragedy, and is said to have been killed by infidels. The image of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is exaggerated, bringing in the idea of excess, which would become a staple of the Gothic genre (Walpole 66).",
            "The concept of supply chain management refers to the intricate web of processes that connects the customer's order to the raw materials, production, supply, and distribution stages, ultimately delivering products to the customer. The term supply chain management was coined in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, who described it as the process of planning, implementing, and controlling the entire supply chain to meet customers' needs efficiently. At its core, supply chain management involves six key elements: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers utilize these elements to provide exceptional customer service.\n\nProduction is the cornerstone of the supply chain process. It's crucial to establish a solid foundation for the entire process. Production outlines the when, why, where, and how products will be produced, and managers need to understand customer demands to make informed decisions. By analyzing the market, managers can gauge customer needs and decide on the products to be produced, their quantities, and the production locations that will meet customer expectations. Effective production planning is critical, as every detail matters, and mistakes can lead to costly delays and financial losses. For instance, during my time working at retail stores like Wal-Mart and Target, I saw firsthand how having a well-designed process and layout can streamline operations, reduce confusion, and increase efficiency.\n\nSupply is the second essential element of supply chain management. It involves making strategic decisions about a company's core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. A company may have multiple divisions for a single product, each with unique equipment, workers, and specialties. Managers must determine which division is best suited for each process, and they may also choose to outsource work to other companies to achieve velocity – the ability to provide quality, flexibility, and low costs. By optimizing supply, companies can enhance their competitiveness and customer satisfaction.",
            "I recently came across a haunting reminder of the atrocities that still plague our world today: a sign that reads \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\" Ellen Page, the talented actress known for her role in Juno, holds the sign in a poignant reminder of the injustices that persist in our world. The sign's message is a stark contrast to the beauty of the surrounding area, and it serves as a powerful reminder of the dark history of Burma, also known as Myanmar. This Southeast Asian country has been ruled by a ruthless military junta since 1962, after a brutal coup d'état overthrew the democratically elected government.\n\nIn 2007, a wave of protests swept through the country, known as the Saffron Revolution, named after the color of the robes worn by the brave monks who led the uprising. Despite the initial peaceful nature of the protests, the violence escalated, and the military junta resorted to violence, invading and ransacking monasteries across the country. Foreign journalists were arrested and imprisoned, and a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai was tragically killed while covering the protests.\n\nThis is not an isolated incident. The desire to suppress dissent and maintain control over citizens is a timeless and universal phenomenon. From the Roman emperors who claimed divine right to rule to the Japanese emperors who are still believed to be gods, the pattern of abuse of power is all too familiar. Even in our own country, our leaders have been known to engage in questionable behavior, including weekly conference calls with influential figures like Ted Haggard.\n\nThe examples are numerous and disturbing. The 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in China, where students and intellectuals gathered to demand democratic reform, ended in bloodshed, with estimates of the death toll ranging from 200 to 3,000. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, in which Hutu militia groups and the government systematically killed Tutsis and moderates, is another grim reminder of the dangers of unchecked power. The Holocaust, where six million Jews and millions of others were systematically murdered, is a stark reminder of the horrors that can occur when we turn a blind eye to injustice.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring legacy in jazz is largely attributed to his remarkable longevity and the boundless creativity he brought to his orchestra. While his piano playing is subtle in many of his compositions, as a composer, Ellington excelled at crafting complex, intricately woven pieces that showcased the unique abilities of individual band members. By creating a framework that allowed soloists to freely improvise, Ellington also wrote tightly orchestrated pieces that highlighted the distinct styles of his musicians, resulting in a rich, original sound. His mastery of the individual players' tones and how they blended together in the ensemble enabled him to write some of the most innovative and iconic pieces in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's groundbreaking use of voice as a jazz instrument, citing Creole Love Call as an early example of this approach. This 12-bar blues piece showcases Ellington's ability to incorporate voice without lyrics, adding texture and color to the music. The song features six choruses, each with its unique character, including a call-and-response between voice and reeds, a muted trumpet solo, and a sweeping clarinet solo. The final chorus returns to the first chorus's structure, with the voice taking on a \"growl\" technique, soloing like an instrument. This use of voice as a tone color is a hallmark of Ellington's style, evident throughout his work.\n\nIn Hot and Bothered, Ellington combined his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. He created a call-and-response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing, blending the vocal elements of Miley's playing and the instrumental aspects of Cox's voice to produce a rich and complementary sound. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) further showcases Ellington's mastery of tone color, as he utilizes Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's muted trombone to great effect in introducing the melody.",
            "For as long as she could remember, there was this nagging feeling inside her. A sense of emptiness that seemed unquenchable. It started when she was 14, just entering the tumultuous world of adolescence. Three years later, at 17, the feeling persisted. She had decided that what she wanted wasn't a thing, but a person. Yet, despite her age, she felt no connection to any of the boys who had shown interest. She often pondered this phenomenon, trying to pinpoint the root cause of her disinterest. Her introspection over the years had yielded various theories, but none that truly satisfied her curiosity. As a result, she went through life questioning her desires.\n\nIn her household, days were usually tranquil. Her parents were a peaceful couple, rarely arguing with each other or with her. The only disagreements they had were about her strong will and independent personality. As the daughter of calm and collected individuals, she made up for their even temperament with her lively and fun nature, making her a lovable and well-liked person.\n\nHowever, today was a different story. As she roamed the house in search of inspiration, she was suddenly jolted by a faint scream from the kitchen, followed by her mother's distressed voice. Rushing into the room, she panicked, asking \"Mom, what's wrong?!\" She found her mother lying on the ground, wincing in pain as she gasped \"Ow\" repeatedly. The daughter quickly rushed to her side, placing a hand on her to assist. \"Ouch...sweetie, I...need you to take me to-the hospital.\" The words were strained and urgent, and her daughter could sense her mother's immense pain. \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where to pick you up.\" Her mother directed her, and the daughter was grateful for the physical training she had received. She carried her mother to the car, gently set her in the back, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought a mix of disinfectant and anxious energy, but her daughter's focus remained on helping her mother. She rushed her into the emergency room, calling out for medical help. A team of worried faces gathered, and someone quickly brought a gurney to take her mother to be examined. Her daughter was left to sit anxiously, waiting for news.\n\nIt turned out her mother had fallen off a step stool while trying to retrieve a vase from a high cabinet.",
            "This study aimed to investigate the connection between following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet) and the risk of chronic heart disease and stroke. The study assessed the association between a high score on the \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet\" and a reduced risk of heart disease and stroke. The aMed diet is a variation of the Med diet that emphasizes the consumption of plant-based foods such as fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, as well as monounsaturated fats and fish, while reducing the intake of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is also part of this diet.\n\nEarlier studies have found that adhering to the Med diet is linked to a lower risk of mortality from heart disease and stroke. However, these studies did not specifically examine the relationship between the Med diet and stroke. \n\nTo conduct this research, the study followed 74,886 women between the ages of 38 and 63 who were participants in the Nurses' Health Study. Over the course of 20 years, from 1984 to 2004, the researchers calculated the women's aMed diet scores based on their self-reported food intake. The study used a food frequency questionnaire to assess nutrient intake, which was validated through several studies. The researchers also collected data on body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and physical activity.\n\nTo account for individual variation and get a more accurate picture of long-term dietary habits, the researchers averaged the aMed scores from multiple questionnaires (two prior years). They also adjusted for potential confounding factors such as age, smoking, body mass index, menopausal status, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nUsing Cox proportional-hazard modeling, the study found that higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with a lower risk of heart disease and stroke in women. During the 20-year follow-up period, the researchers identified 2391 incident cases of heart disease, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths. The findings showed that women in the top aMed quintile had a lower risk of heart disease and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile, with a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "In 2007, the United States experienced a severe financial downturn, marked by rising unemployment, a housing market collapse, and the downfall of several major corporations. The ongoing effects of this crisis have left us wondering: how did this disaster unfold, and how can we prevent it from happening again? The root cause of the crisis lies in the reckless and shortsighted decisions made by politicians, which led banks and firms to issue subprime loans to borrowers without a stable financial foundation. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were forced to purchase and repack these mortgages into complex financial instruments, such as CDO's and CDS's. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were left with a shortage of capital reserves, which they then transferred to the repackaged mortgages and the broader economy.\n\nThe seeds of the financial crisis were sown in 1999, during the Clinton administration's second term. To boost his popularity, the President relaxed lending restrictions, paving the way for the subprime crisis that would strike seven years later. In 1999, Steven Holmes of the New York Times warned of the consequences of these actions, stating that Fannie Mae, the largest mortgage underwriter in the country, was under pressure to expand lending to low- and moderate-income households and maintain its profit margins. Holmes prophetically noted that this could ultimately lead to a government bailout, similar to the one that saved the savings and loan industry in the 1980s. As seen in the introduction, and as Holmes predicted, the reckless lending practices would ultimately lead to an economic meltdown.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the economy's downward spiral, including the increasing complexity of mortgage structures. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO's) were widely used in the years leading up to the crisis, intertwining various sectors of the economy with the housing market. This led to households and financial markets becoming heavily indebted in the housing market, leaving them vulnerable to even minor changes in prices.\n\nThe housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that held mortgage-backed securities were severely affected. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, accounting for approximately 30% of the country's GDP. Ultimately, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at discounted prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subject to stricter regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "There's a point in the story where writers feel the need to take flight, showcasing their skills with elaborate descriptions, but it often ends up putting readers to sleep or making them hit the \"Back\" button in frustration. Dr. Merlin has been known to get frustrated when she gets stuck in lengthy passages that don't have any real significance to the plot.\n\nWriters are often reminded of the fundamental rule, \"Show, don't tell,\" but it's not uncommon for authors to still struggle with excessive exposition. This is where the temptation to dump a load of information on the reader can be overwhelming, making it difficult to engage with the story.\n\nExposition is essentially telling the audience about events or backstory without adding any real value to the plot. In film, this is often seen when one character spouts off a long, unnecessary speech, while in written fiction, the author takes on the role of delivering the information.\n\nLet's take an example. A story might reveal that the heroine met her love interest at a specific time and place, got married in a grand ceremony, and had her husband brutally murdered in front of her. Instead of a two-page summary, the reader would expect to see the husband's character come alive through his words and actions, making his eventual fate all the more impactful. The reader would also expect to see how the heroine's life changed with him, and how his presence affected her thoughts, feelings, and dreams.\n\nIn short, the reader wants more depth to the storyline, \"They met, they married, he died.\" A good writer provides that depth, making the reader emotionally invested in the characters and their story.\n\nIt's easy to get carried away with introducing new characters, their backgrounds, and motivations. Perhaps you're introducing a character who used to be in the Air Force, now runs a gas station at night, has been married twice, and has a secret dream of owning the business. However, it's essential to show, not tell, and provide meaningful context to the story.",
            "I recently watched two newscasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first one I saw was NBC 4's live broadcast on August 13, 2011. The main story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio named Shad Hostettler, who had brutally attacked his wife, although her name was not mentioned. They showed his mug shot, which made him look like a cold-blooded individual. The newscasters only dedicated around two minutes to this story as it was still unfolding. I think they covered it just the right amount of time.\n\nThe second story was about an early morning shooting involving 18-year-old Travis Buyers in the Sharon Woods area. He was critically injured and no arrests had been made at that point. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime scene. This story seemed brief, and I suspect it might have been due to the fact that the victim was a black man from a predominantly black neighborhood. I've noticed a disturbing pattern over the years where minority victims are often overlooked by the media. In contrast, if a white person is a victim of a crime, the media goes into overdrive. It's as if only certain stories deserve attention.\n\nThe next story was about a .22 caliber bullet hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. They provided details about the location of the incident and determined that the bullet was fired from a rifle. The Crime-Stoppers organization is offering a $5,000 reward for any tips that lead to the shooter's identification.\n\nThe newscast then shifted to a story about impending rain and thunderstorms on Saturday afternoon, with temperatures expected to remain in the mid-to-low eighties throughout the weekend. The report was brief, but they used it as a teaser to keep viewers engaged.\n\nThey also covered a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus, where a dark-skinned black man allegedly robbed the store while wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. He was described as being around six feet tall and weighing around 150 pounds. I found it peculiar that they emphasized his skin color and how dark he was.\n\nAnother story was about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin who was convicted of conspiring to distribute large quantities of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. Interestingly, instead of stating his prison sentence as 25 years, they mentioned 300 months. I'm unsure what the reasoning was behind this choice, whether they thought it sounded harsher or what. They also mentioned that he was a Hispanic man, which I don't think was relevant to the story.",
            "A bond between brothers is complex and multifaceted, encompassing a mix of emotions such as love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. This unbreakable connection allows brothers to understand one another in a way that few others can, and they often see themselves reflected in their brother. When situations become dire, the true nature of this bond is revealed, whether it's good or bad. However, these emotions come with significant costs, and understanding them requires dealing with the consequences they bring. When a brother looks into their sibling's eyes, they see their own reflection, not as others see them, but as they truly are. It's in their actions and the consequences of those actions that their character is revealed. In William Faulkner's \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" this theme is explored through the story of two brothers, their tumultuous relationship, and the emotions that drive them.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are driven by a single, dominant emotion: pride. From their first outing together, he harbors resentment towards his younger brother, Doodle, who is born with a weak heart and is unlikely to participate in the physical activities the protagonist longs to share with him. The protagonist's dreams are crushed when he realizes that Doodle will never be able to keep up, and he even considers infanticide, a thought that highlights the depth of his emotional turmoil. However, a fleeting moment of joy when Doodle smiles at him gives the protagonist a glimmer of hope and reveals the underlying love he has for his brother. This dichotomy of emotions – pride and love – ultimately proves to be a pivotal aspect of the protagonist's character development, as he grapples with the consequences of his actions and the true nature of their bond.\n\nThe narrative effectively conveys the complex emotions experienced by the protagonist and his perspective on the world around him through direct characterization of Doodle and their interactions, as well as the narrator's point of view. As the story unfolds, the protagonist's actions become a reflection of his character, and the tragic events that unfold serve as a testament to the profound impact of their bond.",
            "The human brain is a highly complex and creative information-processing system that has been compared to various objects as technology has advanced from simple to sophisticated. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, followed by a book, and more recently, to a computer. However, it's essential to note that these analogies have their limitations and can lead to misconceptions about the brain's workings.\n\nWhen information enters the brain, it's first processed by the sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli, such as touch, heat, sound waves, or light, into electrical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the brain's algorithms through both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing combines basic details like color, orientation, and border information to identify the object as a box. Top-down processing then uses these decisions to speed up recognition, possibly identifying the object as a black box rather than a hole in the background.\n\nAs information is processed, an attention filter determines its importance and decides which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might focus on your name even in a noisy room. This process involves multiple stages, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\n\nFor the brain to process information, it needs to store it first. There are different types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. Initially, information is encoded, with specific types of encoding suited to each type of sensory input. For instance, verbal input can be encoded based on its structure, sound, or meaning. Once stored, information must be maintained, with working memory retaining it for around 20 seconds and long-term memory hypothesized to be stored in the structure of specific proteins.\n\nThere are various models proposing how knowledge is organized in the brain, drawing from human memory retrieval, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model suggests that there are nodes representing concepts, linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might be connected to \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "In Aldous Huxley's dystopian novel, Brave New World, he critiques the looming threats of technology and the capitalist system that underpins it. The novel's portrayal of a society that prioritizes community over individuality and values immediate gratification above all else raises suspicions about the author's views on the emerging economic systems of his time. Through a Marxist lens, Huxley's work appears to be a commentary on the pitfalls of the capitalist structure, as evident from the use of Marxist terminology such as homogeny, reification, and false consciousness.\n\nThe novel satirizes capitalism by employing the concept of false consciousness, where the common people are kept ignorant of their true economic standing and are instead driven by a desire for personal gain. This is achieved through the conditioning of the population, particularly the lower classes, to focus on consumption, indulgence, and spending, as seen in the use of hypnopædia in the novel. The World Controller manipulates this drive, reinforcing the idea that the masses are dominated by a more powerful group, exemplifying the concept of hegemony.\n\nThe lack of genuine relationships between individuals is a notable aspect of Brave New World, with characters lacking depth and individuality. This may suggest that Huxley believes technology and capitalism are eroding human free will and emotional expression. Interactions between characters are superficial, with a focus on physical appearance and shallow conversations, further highlighting the effects of capitalist conformity.\n\nThe absolute obedience of each social class to their predetermined role in society is also a telling aspect of the novel, echoing Marxist ideas about the proletariat's false sense of superiority. By examining Huxley's work through a Marxist lens, it becomes clear that his novel is a commentary on the dangers of unchecked capitalist systems and their impact on human relationships and individuality.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many of us, getting around campus can be a real challenge. My experience with this issue started during my freshman year, when I was stuck in an East Halls dorm room, which might as well have been on the edge of campus, especially when you factor in the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. I'd often spend up to 25 minutes on foot, battling through the unpredictable State College weather, just to get from my home in Stuart Hall to classes like those held in the Willard building near the center of campus. Recently, I spoke to an alumnus who's not much older than me, and they shared some insight on how things used to be. Not long ago, the East Halls dorms were isolated from the rest of the school by large tracts of unused land. However, those empty spaces have since been filled with sports fields, new buildings like the Creamery and health services building, and surrounding apartment complexes. As our campus continues to expand, navigating it's becoming increasingly difficult. So, what's the solution to this mobility problem? For a college campus like ours, I firmly believe that the answer lies in the bicycle. But, it's not just about having a bike; students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be designed with bicyclists in mind.\n\nI had a conversation with a friend who recently picked up biking again after a multi-year hiatus, and he said, \"Bikes are great – for a few years, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" Not only is biking good for your physical health, it's also the most efficient way to travel. With a bowl of oatmeal and some physical exertion, you can cover distances of 30 miles or more. As an off-campus student, I'm just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. Buying a bike this year was one of the smartest decisions I made. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, which would take me 25 minutes to walk from my home. However, riding a bike can cut that time down to just 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the most direct route to Thomas building from my house, but it's not always an easy road to navigate, bike or not. While there are benefits to walking as well, personally, I'm too busy to walk. If I didn't have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class, taking over two and a half hours out of my week. Add that to the time I'd spend walking to other classes, appointments, and so on, and that's more time than I can spare."
