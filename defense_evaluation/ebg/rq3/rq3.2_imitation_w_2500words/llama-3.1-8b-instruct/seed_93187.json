            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "As I continue to pursue my education in social work, I'm committed to a career path that will allow me to help vulnerable children who have been abused or neglected, as well as provide support for struggling families. Some key values that I aim to bring to the social work field include service, respect, integrity, and a commitment to building strong relationships between individuals and communities. These values aren't just essential for social workers; they're also deeply personal to me. My passion for helping others has always been strong, but I wasn't initially sure which career path to follow. Throughout my high school and college years, I witnessed many people struggling with their problems, and some turned to coping mechanisms that weren't ideal. This motivated me to earn a Bachelor's degree in Psychology, and after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I decided to take a break to explore my options. However, a pivotal experience that summer changed my career trajectory. I visited a friend who was hosting a 16-year-old boy who was fleeing his abusive parents. The next day, I learned he had called the police to report the situation. I drove to his parents' house, where I spoke with the police about my concerns and my background in Psychology. I encouraged them to investigate the situation further, and later, I had a conversation with the parents, who seemed evasive and made excuses for their son's actions. This experience made me realize the importance of social work and my desire to help children and families in similar situations.\n\nAnother value that I hold dear is social justice. As a society, we often claim to value individuality, but in reality, we often strive to conform to societal norms rather than embracing our unique qualities. I'm an individual, and I refuse to be limited by expectations of what's considered \"normal.\" Throughout my time in high school and college, I spoke out against social injustice whenever I could – from expressing my individuality through my hair and clothing choices to advocating for the rights of marginalized groups. I believe in social justice, and I'll continue to stand up against injustice in all its forms.\n\nMy experiences have taught me the importance of having a strong sense of purpose, and I'm eager to dedicate my career to making a positive impact in the lives of those who need it most. By staying true to my values of service, respect, integrity, and social justice, I aim to become a compassionate and effective social worker who can make a real difference in the lives of others.",
            "This paper investigates the interplay between the Biological and Sociocultural models in the context of insomnia. The biological model centers on the genetic factors inherited by an individual, as well as the medical aspects of their overall health. In contrast, the Sociocultural model examines the environmental influences that shape our understanding of insomnia, including factors such as race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review delves into these models, exploring key research studies that shed light on each model and their significance in explaining insomnia.\n\nInsomnia can be categorized into three main groups: primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders linked to other mental health issues, and sleep disorders resulting from medical complications or substance use. Within the primary sleep disorders, we find Dyssomnias and Parasomnias. The Dyssomnias encompass a range of conditions, including Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Conversely, Parasomnias involve behavioral abnormalities and physiological occurrences, such as Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. This review focuses on insomnia and its relationship to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders emphasizes the role of genetics, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspects of sleep disorders. Research has shown that neurons in the hypothalamus, specifically those containing orexin, play a crucial role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study on mice found that phenotypic GABAB receptors on these orexin neurons are responsible for sleep-wake states. Activation of the GABAA receptor can induce responses that promote sleep, while inhibition of the receptor can lead to reduced anxiety and induce sleep. Furthermore, the GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time in these mice (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings suggest that animal models can be applied to human studies, highlighting the genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. This has significant implications for our understanding of the relationship between the GABAB receptor and sleep. If there is a problem or absence with this receptor, it could impact an individual's ability to sleep without medication. From a sociocultural perspective, if the phenotype is inherited, this could regulate sleep, and any alteration to the receptor could naturally disrupt sleep patterns for an individual, negatively impacting daily life, including school, career, and mundane tasks that require focus.",
            "This article delves into the realm of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), a condition that affects the way the brain interprets auditory information. At its core, CAPD is a disorder of the central nervous system (CNS), which fails to process sounds effectively, making it difficult for individuals to separate words, differentiate voices, or filter out background noise. Although people with CAPD can hear normally, the area of the brain responsible for sound processing doesn't function as it should, leading to difficulties in understanding and interpreting auditory information.\n\nThe concept of CAPD has its roots in the 1950s, when researchers initially referred to it as \"auditory imperception.\" The pioneering work of Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari in 1954 and Japanese researcher Kimura in 1961 laid the groundwork for understanding the condition. A national conference in 1977 sparked further research into the condition, which has since become known as CAPD.\n\nCAPD presents itself in various ways, including difficulties in localizing sounds in space, distinguishing between different acoustic events, recognizing sound patterns, and detecting changes in speech tone. Individuals with CAPD may struggle to process complex auditory information, leading to problems with language comprehension, social interactions, and overall communication.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, a comprehensive evaluation is necessary, typically conducted by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, or other professionals using a range of tests and assessments. These may include questionnaires, observations of listening behaviors, and evaluations of auditory function. Currently, there is no single, definitive test for CAPD, and the underlying causes of the disorder remain unknown.\n\nIn a mainstream classroom setting, teachers can play a crucial role in supporting students with CAPD. By understanding the characteristics and challenges associated with the condition, educators can develop strategies to help students with CAPD succeed. This may involve providing accommodations such as seating arrangements, visual aids, and extra time to process information, as well as offering regular feedback and support to help students stay on track.",
            "It seems that Twelfth Night suggests that relying on deception to maintain a charade can backfire, ultimately forcing the individual to reject their disguise or risk losing themselves in the process. However, uncovering the truth often comes with its own set of problems, particularly alienation from those around them. People may respond to the revelation with a mixture of reactions, ranging from indifference to offense, making it a difficult decision to weigh personal preservation against maintaining relationships with others.\n\nThe theme of deception through gender role reversal raises a lot of questions, particularly the underlying motivations behind adopting a disguise. In the case of Viola, she assumes a male persona to protect herself in a foreign land, but this decision has unintended consequences, including severing ties with the women in her life and becoming a source of confusion for those around her. Olivia, for instance, becomes infatuated with Cesario, only to later redirect her affections towards Sebastian, suggesting that her attraction may have been superficial. This dynamic is further complicated by the suppressed emotions between Viola/Cesario and Orsino, which are forced to the surface through Cesario's disguise.\n\nOn the surface, this may seem like a progressive exploration of suppressed emotions, particularly in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. However, upon closer examination, it appears that Shakespeare may be satirizing the tendency to judge people based on appearances. Olivia's ease in switching her affections and treating Cesario/Viola as family rather than a romantic interest hints at a more complex character dynamic, one that is more focused on social norms and expectations than genuine emotional connection.",
            "German colonial rule was marked by brutality, particularly in the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. However, it's essential to note that the German colonial empire was a diverse entity with varied policies, ruling styles, and geography. Education systems across the colonies also differed significantly. For instance, when the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found an educated and literate African population. In contrast, German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors.\n\nHowever, the situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast. Unlike in East Africa, where the government invested in state schools and native education, in South West Africa, the task of educating the natives was largely left to missionary societies with limited government support. The government did invest in education for Europeans, establishing a system of state schools and heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had lasting effects on South West Africa, even after German rule ended. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, the majority of the population remained uneducated and illiterate. Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to this divergence, which this paper aims to explore in more detail, focusing on new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nResearch on education in the German colonial empire has been conducted extensively, with many studies published in German during the early 20th century. These works primarily described the features of educational systems in the colonies. Later studies in English expanded the discussion through comparative analyses of education in various German colonies and more in-depth examinations of specific aspects of education. These studies highlighted significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. One notable work is Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa, which compared the two colonies and discussed the factors that accounted for their differences. According to Cohen, the large settler population in South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing features of the colony's educational system.\n\nSouth West Africa stood out from other German colonies in terms of its climate, with a relatively temperate climate despite being covered by arid desert. This relatively hospitable environment attracted a significant European population, with nearly 15,000 whites living in South West Africa by 1913, compared to only 5,336 in East Africa, the colony with the next largest settler population.",
            "Over the past 100 years, popular music has evolved into a vast and diverse landscape, encompassing numerous genres that are often intertwined and hard to define. Within these genres, sub-genres have emerged, creating a complex web of sounds and styles. Heavy Metal, in particular, has become a standout example of this complexity, having branched out into various sub-genres and sub-sub-genres over the past 40 years.\n\nHeavy Metal's expressiveness stems from its ability to convey a wide range of emotions, often leaning towards the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Its diversity is a result of its flexibility, which has allowed artists to create their own unique sub-genres, each with its own distinct sound and style. This has led to a proliferation of niches within the Heavy Metal movement, making it challenging to pinpoint what exactly defines Heavy Metal music.\n\nTo understand the many facets of Heavy Metal, it's essential to grasp its core essence and the factors that have shaped it into the movement it is today. At its heart, Heavy Metal is a genre that revels in darkness, often incorporating more extreme elements such as louder volumes, more intense energy, and a greater emphasis on theatricality. Unlike other genres, Heavy Metal is characterized by the musicians' exceptional technical skill, which is evident in their music.\n\nHeavy Metal's connection to substance abuse, particularly psychedelic drugs, is another defining aspect of the genre. The psychedelic boom of the 1970s led to the creation of boundary-pushing music that explored the darker side of human experience. This trend has continued, with later generations of metal artists drawing inspiration from the Romantic Era's dark and visceral qualities.\n\nLyrics like those found in Helter Skelter, which is often considered one of the first Heavy Metal songs, showcase the genre's affinity for the darker side of the emotional spectrum. This song's themes of turmoil and chaos were a response to the Rolling Stones' similarly heavy and dark song, and the Beatles' desire to prove they could match the Stones' intensity.",
            "Before the Surrealist artists began creating their dreamlike masterpieces, Henri Rousseau was already crafting his own dreams - both figuratively and literally. His 1910 painting, The Dream, not only depicts a woman marveling at the breathtaking wonders within a dream, but also reflects Rousseau's own personal aspirations as an artist. For years, he had envisioned recognition, acceptance, and praise from his fellow artists and art enthusiasts, but found himself struggling with an internal conflict that would shape his career: to conform to traditional styles and gain acceptance from the art world, or to forge his own path and remain true to his creative vision.\n\nTo understand The Dream through this lens, it's essential to delve into Rousseau's life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in the French town of Laval, he grew up in a relatively affluent household, with his father being a successful tinsmith and hardware merchant. Despite his comfortable upbringing, Rousseau never received formal art training, instead working as a municipal toll service employee until he was 40. His life took a significant turn after the death of his first wife, Clémence, and their eight infant children, leaving him with only one child, Julia, and a deep sense of loss. Painting became his solace, offering a fresh start and a means to cope with his grief. Unlike his contemporaries, who often romanticized the peasant class in their art, Rousseau was a folk painter, driven by the hopes and dreams of the average working-class individual.\n\nRousseau's desire for acceptance from the art world was understandable, given his late start in the field and the fact that he was producing art alongside some of the most renowned modern artists of the time. It wasn't until around the same period that Matisse was establishing himself as a respected artist that Rousseau began to receive recognition for his own work. As art historian Jan Gordon notes in Modern French Painters, while Matisse was driven by a fear of creating mundane art, Rousseau's primary goal was to craft a conventional piece that would earn him a spot among the esteemed ranks of the Artiste Français.",
            "It's no surprise that many philosophers have pondered the intricate connection between ethics and aesthetics, truth and beauty. I firmly believe that at its core, there's a fundamental reason for this connection. As John Keats so eloquently puts it in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" While we often learn about life through education and experience, we seem to instinctively appreciate ethics and aesthetics without being formally taught. Both ethics and aesthetics try to describe rather than prescribe; our studies of morality and beauty are more about explaining why a piece of art or literature is beautiful or why an action is moral, rather than providing a set of rules for judging or creating good art or moral behavior.\n\nIn other words, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what's good or what's beautiful. When discussing the worth of the Mona Lisa, for instance, we might focus on concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but these don't really explain why it's great art. When asked about a favorite work of art or literature, people often start with a phrase like, \"There's just something about it\" before providing a more in-depth explanation. I believe that both art and morals can't be fully reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor points out, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how thoroughly we describe a work of literature, there's still something transcendent that remains. Ethics, as Wittgenstein notes, \"cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" I suggest that it's this \"something,\" this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\nI think morality and art are closely related because we experience both of them most profoundly on a noumenal level, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Germany has become a powerful nation, a unified country with its own distinct culture that spans from the picturesque Alps in Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. The same cultural essence can be felt from Cologne along the Rhine River, through Germany's central regions, to the Saxon city of Dresden situated on the Elbe River. Given its unique blend of cultures, it's no surprise that modern-day Germany has its roots in various tribes and sources.\n\nThe origins of the term 'Germany' are shrouded in mystery, with historians and scholars debating its true meaning. According to Roman historian Tacitus, the name might have originated from a Germanic tribe known as the Tungrians, who were referred to as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and clashed with the Gaulish forces. Julius Caesar first used the term \"Germanus\" in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, where he described the Germanic tribes that often crossed the Rhine under dubious circumstances. He derived the word from the Gauls themselves, using it to distinguish between the conquered Gauls and the undefeated Germanic tribes. While the exact origin remains unclear, some believe it might have referred to a neighboring tribe in the Gaulish language. In his first book on the Gallic Wars, Julius Caesar notes: \"The Germans, who reside beyond the Rhine, constantly engage in battles with them (The Gauls).\" Others propose that the term comes from the spear used in warfare, known as a ger, or from the Old Irish word garim, meaning \"to shout,\" indicating the Germans were loud and boisterous.\n\nThe early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his writings that the Germans were an indigenous people, untouched by immigration or intermarriage with other races. He noted that those who sought to settle in Germany would have had to be driven by a strong sense of home and a desire to return, rather than being drawn by the allure of the land itself. The Romans, on the other hand, would often send their conquests into Germania to acquire goods and skills, but they rarely settled there permanently. As the Germanic tribes emerged in the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire, trading goods and serving in the Roman army.",
            "As I gazed down at the scene before me, my mind was a complete blank, unable to grasp the vibrant colors and shapes in front of my eyes.  My thoughts were a jumble of fragmented ideas that appeared and disappeared in a matter of seconds, leaving me with a sense of detachment.  It was as if my consciousness was running on autopilot, processing the visual feast without any emotional attachment or deeper meaning. \n\nI had always been fascinated by drawing, ever since I was a kid, and so when I stumbled upon an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain, I jumped at the chance to learn.  The book offered a unique approach to understanding the creative process, from grasping the fundamentals of drawing to tapping into the subconscious mind.  One technique that caught my attention was the idea of applying a mental square frame to a complex scene, simplifying it and making it more manageable.  At that moment, however, I was too overwhelmed to even think about such techniques.\n\nAll I could do was stand there, transfixed by the sight before me.  I had always admired the works of artists like Picasso, Monet, and the Renaissance masters, each with their own distinct style and vision.  If I ever hoped to create something truly beautiful, it had to start here, with this moment, this bowl of fruit, and the blank canvas of the future.  My hand instinctively reached for my trusty pencil, my fingers itching to bring my ideas to life.\n\nBut that was not to be.  Instead, my fingers hovered over the toilet handle, my hand tightening and relaxing in anticipation.  The brown, unappetizing mass refused to budge, stuck fast like a stubborn slug.  I stood there, frowning, my mind racing with frustration.  A few more flushes, a few more moments of contemplation, and then I reached for the toilet paper, wrapping my hand around the sheet like a mitten.  Slowly, deliberately, I dipped my hand into the bowl, a surreal and somewhat macabre ritual that left me questioning my own sanity.",
            "In my opinion, the alarming number of teenage driving fatalities is a serious concern in the United States.  Several key factors contribute to this tragic statistic, and understanding them is crucial to finding a solution.  One such factor is the fact that the teenage brain is not fully equipped to handle the dangers associated with driving, as explained by the National Institutes of Health.  Additionally, the National Institutes of Health point out that inexperience plays a significant role in the problem, leading to increased rates of fatal accidents, vehicle rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road.  It's also no surprise that teens are more likely to be involved in accidents when driving with their peers, which, as we all know, is a common occurrence.\n\nA study conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center found a clear correlation between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents that occur.  In an effort to address this issue, California and other states have implemented temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours teens can drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.  However, I believe that these measures are merely temporary fixes and do not address the root of the problem.  The real issue is that, statistically speaking, young drivers are not equipped to handle the risks and responsibilities associated with driving.\n\nRenowned psychologist Marvin Zuckerman has suggested that 18 is still too young to grant a full driver's license, as research indicates that individuals under 19-20 often engage in risk-taking behaviors for the thrill of it.  It makes sense, then, to delay driving until this tendency to take risks has leveled out.  If we continue to grant driver's licenses to young teens, we will likely see a devastating increase in accidents, and the death toll will be staggering.  By 2010, millions of new teen drivers will be hitting the roads, and the consequences will be dire.\n\nImplementing legislation to address this issue would be relatively straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver's education classes to lay the groundwork for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 should be allowed to operate a vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued before granting a full license, and a certain number of practical driver's training hours could be required, as is the case in most states (California, for example, currently requires 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult).  Uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable and effective way to protect teens across the country.\n\nIt's not a novel idea, but it's an idea whose time has come.  We owe it to our young drivers to take action and ensure their safety on our roads.",
            "While browsing through the Library of Congress's impressive collection of early Edison films, I decided to watch all fifteen trick films from 1895 to 1901. These films cleverly use editing techniques to create illusions that amaze and intrigue. My analysis focused on uncovering the underlying poetics of these trick films and identifying the unique characteristics that set a few of the later films apart from the rest. At the turn of the century, the trick film is typically set-bound, confined within a static, frontal proscenium, and adheres to a strict one shot equals one film approach, with minimal camera movement and reliance on long and medium shots.\n\nHowever, there are a few films from the early 1900s that break free from these traditional guidelines by incorporating more innovative techniques such as multiple shots. One of the most striking commonalities among the trick films is their reliance on interior sets within a frontal proscenium composition. The camera remains stationary, never panning or zooming to follow characters or objects. This style, originating from the theatre and vaudeville, restricts the movement of figures in trick films to side-to-side motion, rather than forward or backward movement towards the camera. For instance, in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), the actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis, never deviating from the frame.\n\nThe use of the frontal proscenium also dominates the types of shots used in these films. Long shots and, more rarely, medium shots are the norm, while close-ups are entirely absent from the Edison catalog's trick films. This is a nod to the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance within the frame of the stage. As a result, actors rarely venture towards or away from the camera, making close-ups virtually non-existent.\n\nFurthermore, most early trick films adhere to the notion that one conceptual shot equals one film, limiting their length to about a minute or less, depending on the frame rate. This also restricts the narrative or dramatic potential of these films, which largely focus on short, vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic and disappearing acts, with minimal storytelling. However, upon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that a single \"shot\" can be composed of multiple physical shots joined together to create the illusion of apparition or disappearance. For example, in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), a more detailed examination reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary's severed \"head\" begins, even though the film is conceptually one shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a passionate advocate for Republican values.  His agricultural background and brief foray into politics shaped him into a man known for his unwavering dedication to personal freedom and limited government.  His strong stance on the importance of an agrarian way of life influenced his views on sovereignty, Constitutional interpretation, and even the judicial system.  His goal was to preserve and promote what he believed to be the superior career path, which guided his arguments on governance.\n\nTaylor believed that the United States had a unique opportunity to create an ideal system of government, unencumbered by a pre-existing tradition.  He firmly believed in the inherent rights of individuals and the interconnected nature of those rights – if one right is compromised, the others suffer as well, and their value is diminished.  As such, he believed that these rights should be beyond the reach of government interference.  He saw the concept of the \"state of nature\" as a place where the strong and cunning profited, but in a civilized society, this should not be the case.\n\nTo create an ideal society, Taylor advocated for a government that acknowledges both the good and evil within humanity.  He was unyielding in his views on dualistic morality, stating that \"as government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human.\"  He defined good principles as those that protect private property, promote agriculture, and discourage excessive capitalism, and believed that a government founded on these principles would function equitably, regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be driven by self-interest.  However, he believed that self-interest was only considered evil when it led to the creation of sub-societies that exploited others.  A well-designed government was necessary to balance humanity's natural flaws and prevent the introduction of bad principles.\n\nLike many of his fellow Republicans, Taylor called for a strict construction of the Constitution, advocating for a limited Federal government with only the powers explicitly stated in the document.  He recognized that an extensive Federal government was likely to be expensive and potentially despotic, but he also believed that a literal interpretation of the Constitution without considering the intent of its authors could lead to corruption.  Furthermore, he considered the Declaration of Independence to be the true charter of the United States, as it more clearly defined the country as a collection of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "In looking at the data, there was a significant decline in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project, which was a bit disheartening. It's difficult to pinpoint the exact reason for this drop, but a few factors might have contributed to it. As winter set in at our New England campus, it's likely that fewer people were commuting by bicycle or on foot, which could have led to the decrease. Additionally, the end of the fall semester meant that students and faculty were busy finishing their schoolwork and processing grades, making it easy for the commuter log to fall by the wayside. The start of the holiday season and subsequent month-long break only added to the decline, as many people didn't need to come to campus at all. The low number of submissions in the following month of January could also be attributed to the fact that classes hadn't resumed yet. However, none of these factors fully explain the low number of submissions in February. It's possible that projects like this tend to experience a natural drop in enthusiasm after the initial excitement wears off. To combat this trend, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a special campaign to revitalize the initiative, which did lead to an increase in log submissions for that month. One of the challenges we faced was maintaining momentum despite the natural decrease in engagement and the specific challenges of holiday and semester breaks in higher education. \n\nAnother hurdle we encountered was the fact that many people enjoy the freedom and independence that comes with driving their own cars, which is deeply ingrained in our culture. To overcome this, we offered incentives in the form of gift certificates to local businesses, which seemed effective at first. However, it would have been interesting to see how larger prizes, such as a new bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car, might have influenced participation. As it was, the value of the prizes didn't change throughout the project, and while the gift cards were a good starting point, announcing larger prizes at the beginning of each month might have kept people engaged and motivated.",
            "An Exchange Traded Fund, or ETF for short, is a type of investment that tracks an index, a commodity, or a basket of assets like an index fund. However, it's more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange. This unique combination of features offers several benefits, including diversification and the ability to sell short, buy on margin, and purchase a single share in any transaction, just like owning a single stock. Additionally, the expense ratios of ETFs are significantly lower than those of the average mutual fund, making them an attractive option for investors. \n\nThat being said, there are some downsides to consider. For example, you'll need to pay a commission on any trade involving an ETF, just as you would with a stock. Furthermore, the wide variety of ETFs available can be overwhelming, and it's essential for savvy financial investors to carefully evaluate whether the stated benefits, such as diversification, truly exist and to what extent. In this analysis, we'll be taking a closer look at the ETF IHF and comparing it to its top 10 holdings to determine whether the benefits of owning a single ETF are comparable to those of owning a diversified portfolio of the 10 stocks. We'll also examine whether there are alternative configurations of the same stocks that could provide a more optimal return.\n\nTo make this analysis manageable, we'll focus on the top 10 holdings, which account for 63.58% of the ETF's assets. Here are the top 10 holdings and their corresponding percentage of total assets.\n\nTo estimate how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF as a whole, we can use their current percentage of assets to calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming the portfolio is made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the same proportion as the ETF's holdings. The calculations are presented in the chart below.\n\nAs you can see from the chart, a portfolio consisting only of the top 10 holdings would offer a return 6.11% higher than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. Additionally, the Beta of the top 10 holdings is 0.12 lower than the ETF as a whole. These results suggest that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could potentially provide a higher return with a lower Beta. However, it's essential to determine whether these differences are statistically significant.\n\nTo address this question, we calculated the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalized it to 100% to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF. By examining the results, we can gain a better understanding of whether the portfolios are statistically different from each other.",
            "One of Edgar Allan Poe's personal favorites was \"Dream-Land\", a poem that showcases his creative genius. The term \"Thulé\" is used twice in the poem, with its origins dating back to the ancient Roman poet Virgil. However, it's worth noting that Poe was also heavily influenced by German literature. \n\nThis connection to Virgil is significant, but it's not the only source to consider. Poe's interest in German authors, particularly Goethe, is undeniable. In fact, his poem \"Dream-Land\" bears a striking resemblance to Goethe's work. \n\nA notable scholar, Karl J. Arndt, observed the similarities between Poe's \"Politian\" and Goethe's \"Mignon\", concluding that Poe was likely drawing inspiration from the German author. Goethe, a renowned writer of poetic dramas, is perhaps best known for his magnum opus \"Faust\". Published in two parts, the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the poem \"Faust\" features a character known as the \"King of Thulé\". \n\nIn this poem, the King's wife passes away, leaving him heartbroken and consumed by grief. He begins to drink heavily, eventually deciding that it's time to end his own life. The \"King of Thulé\" and the character from \"Dream-Land\" share a haunting similarity, with both struggling to cope with loss and finding solace in drinking. \n\nInterestingly, Goethe's \"Faust\" was adapted into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, just a year before Poe referenced Thule in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\". Poe's use of the term \"Thule\" is not limited to this poem, as he also employed it in \"Dream-Land\". The poem's speaker describes a desolate landscape, haunted by the ghosts of friends and devoid of color, echoing the themes present in \"The King of Thulé\". \n\nGiven Poe's admiration for Alfred, Lord Tennyson, it's clear that he would have been familiar with Goethe's work. In fact, the numerous reproductions of Goethe's writings that were circulating at the time would have ensured his exposure to the German author's oeuvre. The connection between \"Dream-Land\" and \"The King of Thulé\" is undeniable, with Poe's poem serving as a companion piece to Goethe's work.",
            "Under California law, a customer who slipped and fell on an applesauce spill in a grocery store may be eligible for punitive damages if the store manager demonstrated malice by ignoring the spill, despite being informed twice of it, while he was eating dinner. A judge is unlikely to dismiss the claim outright. To justify punitive damages, a plaintiff must show that the defendant acted with a deliberate disregard for the potential harm their actions could cause, as well as that their actions were despicable. In this case, Jennifer Palmer can argue that store manager Paul Martin should have known the dangers of leaving the spill unattended, given that multiple customers had slipped and fallen on the same issue in the months prior. Palmer's claim that Martin's actions were despicable is not entirely convincing, but it's still a valid argument considering six slip-and-fall incidents occurred in 2009 and Martin failed to take necessary steps to ensure the store's safety.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, store employee Rich Wayne informed Martin about the applesauce spill, but Martin brushed him off, saying he was on dinner break. Fifteen minutes later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, notified Martin of the spill, and he responded in the same dismissive manner. By 5:30 pm, Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a serious back injury. Before Palmer's accident, five other slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D Markets in 2009. Now, Palmer is suing the store for both compensatory and punitive damages, and we're considering whether to file a motion to dismiss the punitive damage claim.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation that's not contract-related if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" The law defines malice as conduct intended to cause harm or, if not intentional, as \"despicable\" conduct committed with a \"willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" California Civil Code, section 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). Courts have characterized behavior as malicious when it shows a conscious disregard of the plaintiff's rights, especially when the defendant knows the probable consequences of their actions and deliberately fails to avoid them.

            "It's been nearly four years since I took a course in Islam at CBC, and one topic that still resonates with me is the notion that Islam is a hostile religion.  As I reflect on the years since 9/11, I've witnessed a shift in the media's portrayal of Islam, going from a hostile view to an extreme level of tolerance in America. It's striking to think that in 2001, it would have been unimaginable for a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, with his obvious Muslim background, to run for office.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad fascinates me, but it also raises questions. From what I've learned, I used to believe that Muhammad forced people to convert to Islam, conquering tribes and imposing his faith on them. However, the biography portrays Muhammad as a humble, misunderstood figure who lived a life of truth and performed miracles. The writers seem to be depicting him as a martyr, who didn't need to prove anything, but instead, people came to him seeking the truth in his teachings.\n\nI'm struck by the similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the 'miracles' of Muhammad. One example is when Muhammad took a small amount of food and miraculously multiplied it to feed forty men. This writing style makes me wonder if the authors are trying to portray Muhammad as a humble prophet who didn't need to prove himself, but rather lived in truth and performed miracles. It seems like they're downplaying the life and personhood of Jesus Christ, almost implying that Muhammad was somehow connected to Jesus.\n\nThe biography also contains many stories that seem to be about providing proof of 'witness' or how people 'on their own' converted to Islam. However, these stories are often based on second- or third-hand accounts, which makes me skeptical. While the authors intended to provide proof of the truth of the stories, I think it actually diminishes their credibility and makes them seem more suspicious.\n\nWhat bothers me most about this work is the way the authors try to elevate Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle. However, history paints a different picture of Muhammad's rise to power, and I can't help but wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true story behind his ascension to power.",
            "Looking back at the teachings of Jesus and the core beliefs he preached during his lifetime, it's striking how quickly they were abandoned in the development of Christian thought that followed.  As we examine the history in broad strokes, we can see a clear trend of Christianity veering further and further away from its roots.  However, today's world is witnessing a growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive shift.  Those who hold traditional views may resist any deviation from established teachings, but if history is any indicator, they may not be a large enough group to have a significant impact on the whole.  As time passes, a growing number of Christians will increasingly seek to uncover the original intent behind their faith, distinguishing between the core teachings of Jesus and the additional doctrines that were added over time.  This shift may take decades or even centuries, but ultimately, it's an irreversible trend:  A great reversal in Christian history is inevitable, as people seek to return to the true essence of the faith.  As this movement gains momentum, we can expect to see a progression back to the original form of Christianity, stripping away layer upon layer of doctrine, much like the clock ticking backward.  When this shift takes hold in the United States and Europe, we'll see a mass movement toward worshipping as Jesus taught, free from the additional ideas and dogma that have accumulated over the centuries.  The church as an institution will continue to play a vital role in guiding this process, but the resulting uniformity of belief and practice will be a far cry from the current diversity of Christendom.  As we look around the world, we can see that history is filled with examples of great reversals – for instance, how Christians were once persecuted and ostracized by the Roman Empire, only to become a dominant force within it.  Similarly, our country has undergone a remarkable transformation from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  A similar reversal is on the horizon for the Christian faith, as people seek to strip away the accumulated layers of doctrine and return to the source.  A crucial aspect of this process will be interpreting Jesus' words as metaphors, rather than taking them literally.  So, what happened to the original Jewish roots of Christianity?  If we dig deep enough into history, we find that Judaism was the sole foundation for the Christian faith.  By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., monotheism, the notion of divinely revealed scripture, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were already deeply ingrained in the Jewish faith.  However, the Jewish population was far from united, with various factions like the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common people each holding their own distinct views.",
            "In my opinion, The Jungle is a powerful portrayal of the inherent selfishness and self-centeredness that exists within human nature. People are often primarily driven by their own desires and ambitions, frequently prioritizing their own interests over those of others. This is a theme that The Jungle vividly illustrates. The novel's depiction of the factory owners and managers is a striking example of this. Their sole focus is on expanding and improving their businesses, without regard for the well-being of anyone or anything that gets in their way. As Upton Sinclair writes, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" This vivid description highlights the devastating consequences of their actions and shows that they care little for the people and animals affected by their pursuit of profit. The pollution caused by their factories and the filth from the animal pens surrounding Packingtown are just a couple of the many examples of the damage they inflict on others without a second thought.\n\nFurthermore, the novel reveals that the owners and managers have no qualms about exploiting their employees to make more money. They are willing to do whatever it takes to save a buck, as evident in the line \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" The employees are subjected to inhumane working conditions and are laid off without warning, with no assistance in finding new employment. During the time period in which the novel is set, there were few laws protecting workers' rights, allowing the owners and managers to act with impunity. The workers, who were essentially treated as slaves, were forced to endure terrible conditions in the factories and live in the midst of pollution, with no help or support available to them. The unions that were formed often did more harm than good, profiting off the struggles of the workers. The workers were trapped in this system, with no way out, making their situation all the more dire.",
            "Many authors use various techniques to elicit a specific emotional response from their readers. F. Scott Fitzgerald employs several of these methods in his novel The Great Gatsby. Some of his techniques are more effective than others. One of these is his use of word pairs to create a particular atmosphere around an idea. For instance, he combines adjectives and nouns in a way that doesn't usually fit to evoke a certain reaction in readers. Another technique is assigning meaning to a symbol and then using it to convey the same meaning. Fitzgerald frequently uses this latter technique with colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald develops a deeper meaning for colors, particularly white/gray and red/pink, then utilizes this meaning to create a specific impression of a subject.\n\nFitzgerald's use of white/gray to signify uniformity is a prime example. He establishes this meaning early in the novel by frequently pairing the two colors together. When introducing Daisy and Jordan, Fitzgerald notes that they are \"in white\" all the time – in fact, nearly everyone at Gatsby's party wears white: Nick sports \"white flannels,\" Tom sports a \"white shirt,\" and Catherine is described as \"powdered milky white.\" Conversely, the only time people aren't wearing white is when Nick is describing his initial impressions of Gatsby's party: \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors.\" Fitzgerald further solidifies these meanings by applying the colors to everyday objects: as Nick commutes to work, he navigates the \"white chasms of lower New York,\" the names of people at Gatsby's parties are listed as \"gray names\" on his schedule, and Catherine's apartment is \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\" – a sense of uniformity. He also uses the colors to describe ordinary or unimportant people or places: Jordan and Daisy share a \"white girlhood,\" there are \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" in the valley of ashes, the \"Italian child\" in the railroad is \"gray,\" and the dog-seller is \"a gray old man.\" \n\nOnce Fitzgerald has built up enough meaning for white/gray, he uses them to symbolize the unimportance or uniformity of certain subjects. He employs this color technique with Daisy first. After a lengthy period without significant use of either color, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster,\" signaling to readers that Daisy is becoming less of a character and more of a uniform element, something Gatsby desires and longs for (74). Fitzgerald employs this technique repeatedly around Daisy to create the impression that she is a more uniform addition, as seen in a \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" and another instance where she wears a \"white\" dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "San Diego County boasts an incredibly productive agricultural scene, largely due to its mild, sunny climate. A variety of crops thrive here, including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There's a strong demand for organic community-supported agriculture food in the area, with many local organizations featuring lengthy waiting lists for their products. Organic eggs and milk are also highly sought after, and some farms even offer tours of their operations, as well as opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities.\n\nOrganic farming not only fills a lucrative niche market but also offers numerous environmental benefits, such as enhanced biodiversity in plants and wildlife due to the absence of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming comes with its own set of challenges, including higher labor and management costs to control pests and weeds without using chemicals, greater losses compared to conventional methods, and reduced efficiency due to the smaller scale of operations. Additionally, other beneficial practices, such as planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, and invasive species removal, can also incur increased labor costs.\n\nThe land in question is a 160-acre property adjacent to the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California. The land features a mix of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, bordering the Cleveland National Forest. This area falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which currently considers over a hundred plant and animal species, many of which are endangered or declining. These species include the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher.\n\nFor centuries, this land was inhabited by Native Americans, followed by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. The property was part of an original homestead patent, likely used for grazing and/or wood production for many years.\n\nTo explore potential options for a small farmer, I selected a piece of property from a real estate website and researched government programs that could help mitigate costs and preserve wildlife-friendly operations. I used an organic farm in the same area as a model for what a farmer might aim to achieve on this land.",
            "Culture is a vital component in any negotiation, consisting of more than just what it signifies, but also what it represents. It is not a fixed entity, nor is it uniform across the board. Generalizations like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are far too broad and simplistic. Instead, it's more effective for a negotiator to grasp the significance of a culture in relation to the matter at hand and how it may impact the negotiation. When engaging with a foreign culture, we inevitably draw comparisons to our own, which can lead to misunderstandings.\n\nEfforts to comprehend a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to acknowledging its biases. Rather than judging or attempting to alter a culture, it's essential to accept it for what it is and work within its boundaries, especially in the context of negotiation. If you're in a weaker bargaining position, showing respect for traditions and beliefs can help bridge cultural gaps and advance the negotiation.\n\nIt's also worth noting that culture isn't confined to international or national differences. Companies within a country often develop their own distinct corporate culture, which can be just as complex as the broader societal culture. For instance, some corporations prioritize long working hours, while others encourage a more relaxed schedule. This is reflected in factors such as employee dress codes, communication styles, delegation of duties, and hiring practices. The diversity of corporate culture within a country, even within the same company, is a testament to the multifaceted nature of societal culture.\n\nUnderstanding values is equally crucial, as they provide the underlying motivations for a culture. If a culture values saving face or communal harmony, a negotiator will be hesitant to publicly embarrass their company or superior to achieve success. Conversely, if a culture prioritizes aggressive bargaining, a negotiator may be more inclined to push for a hard-driven deal. By taking these generalities into account before the negotiation, a negotiator can better prepare themselves for the challenges ahead. Nonetheless, it's also essential to develop a personal understanding of one's opponent to make the negotiation effective.",
            "The notion that God does not exist has been a notion that has been debated for centuries, and is famously stated in the Christian Bible as \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This belief is also shared by the philosopher Thomas Aquinas, and his argument for the existence of God is often compared to that of St. Anselm. Since both authors are arguing for the same concept of God, we'll assume they're both correct in their belief for the sake of this analysis. We'll compare their arguments, keeping in mind that their arguments are in defense of the God of the Bible. \n\nWhile both Anselm and Aquinas make valid points, their arguments lack a complete basis for belief in God. To demonstrate this, let's first look at Anselm's argument. Anselm suggests that we can find proof of God within ourselves. He believes that because God exists within our understanding, we can't truly conceive of his nonexistence. Anselm is saying that we don't need to look beyond our own minds to understand the truth about God, and that the existence of God can be found to be true simply by examining what we inherently know to be true within our own minds. This idea of accepting something without irrefutable evidence is referred to as faith in Christian texts.\n\nThis perspective is distinct from that of Aquinas, who believes that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, without any need for faith. This idea would be beneficial for Christian evangelism, as it would allow for the recruitment of new converts without requiring them to believe in something that can't be proven. Aquinas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. He demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God, much like knowing the features and existence of a missing puzzle piece without actually seeing it.",
            "About 2500 years back, a prince who would one day become known as the Buddha was born in either the fourth or fifth century BCE. Throughout his lifetime, he rejected worldly life and achieved a profound understanding, leading to the development of Buddhism. The most traditional branch of this faith is Theravada Buddhism, and it has undergone significant changes over the centuries. This is evident in various aspects of the religion, such as the water-cutting ceremony in Sri Lanka, where both monks and laypeople participate. This event has spiritual significance, despite the fact that Buddha never taught about such celebrations. These variations range from surface-level customs to the fundamental principles of the faith. The Theravada Buddhist community, from both the monastic and lay perspectives, has had to adapt its core teachings over time due to both internal and external forces, some of which are hostile, while others are benevolent.\n\nIt's essential to understand the terms we'll be using to discuss this topic. An internal force refers to any influence that comes from within the Buddhist community, regardless of the individual's monastic status. External forces, on the other hand, come from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any influence that aims to harm or damage the Buddhist community, often rooted in a negative perception of Buddhism. In contrast, a benign force is one that doesn't intend to harm or help the community, although it may inadvertently do so. These definitions will be used repeatedly throughout our discussion.\n\nLet's begin by exploring the core principles of Theravada Buddhism. At the heart of the faith lies the Triple Gem, comprising the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is primarily made up of the Tripitaka, a collection of Buddhist scriptures divided into three baskets: the Sutta Pitaka, the Vinaya Pitaka, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka. The Sutta Pitaka contains the teachings and discourses, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka deals with the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. Key concepts include Anatta (no permanent self), Dukkha (inherent suffering in life), and Anicca (impermanence of everything). By recognizing these principles, one can break free from Sansara, the cycle of birth and death, which is a continuous process. Along with Sansara, one can also overcome lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion) by achieving enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka provides rules for laypeople, such as the five precepts (not killing, lying, stealing, misbehaving sexually, or taking intoxicants). Monks, on the other hand, have more comprehensive guidelines to follow. The four noble truths are the fundamental principles of Buddhism, including the truth that life is suffering, that attachment causes suffering, and that suffering can be overcome.",
            "One notable example of a long-standing rivalry between two nations is that of the United States and Mexico, which lasted for an impressive 57 years, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts, 2000, p. 145).  The peak of this rivalry occurred during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States ultimately emerged victorious, securing Texas and the American Southwest as part of its territory.  Although many conflicts arose between the two nations, the tension finally began to subside just before the outbreak of World War I. \n\nThis rivalry, fueled by differences in values, culture, and economic interests, is not unique to the United States and Mexico. Many nations sharing a border experience similar clashes of interests, leading to the development of rival positions. The United States and Mexico are a prime example of this phenomenon, much like other enduring rivalries between neighboring countries.  As noted by David M. Pletcher (1977), \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41).  The proximity of these nations to the United States contributed to their rivalry, whereas other Latin American countries have historically enjoyed more positive relations with the United States.\n\nReligious differences also played a significant role in straining relations between the two nations, a common issue that has plagued many countries throughout history (Frahm, 2001, p. 86).  If Americans were opposed to fascism and communism in the 20th century, they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy in the 18th and 19th centuries.  In this case, the ideological struggle was not solely based on political systems but also on the distinct religious preferences of the United States and Mexico. This distrust stemmed from the legacy of distrust between the English and Spanish, which their former colonial rulers had instilled in them. This inherited animosity significantly hindered the establishment of friendly relations between the two nations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) documented 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States during the 57-year rivalry period. The majority of these disputes centered on territorial issues, including border raids from Mexican territory and other frontier problems. Border bandits and outlaws from American border towns posed significant challenges, which were eventually addressed when both countries strengthened their border security (Schmitt, 1974, p. 97).\n\nAs Schmitt (1974) noted, the rivalry began to dissipate as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the United States (p. 109) and American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico (p. 110) in the later 19th century.",
            "It's been 15 years since my life took an unexpected turn due to an illness I never knew existed. At the time, I was working as a nurse, a career choice that provided a sense of security and stability I desperately craved as a child. The mantra I grew up with was that I would always be able to find employment, as people would always get sick, and that notion drove me to pursue nursing over my true passions for science and journalism.\n\nFast forward to my current reality: I'm 46, single, and living on Social Security Disability benefits after 15 years. I've barely managed to scrape by, and every day feels like a struggle to maintain my sense of security, safety, and self-worth. Despite my best efforts, nothing is certain anymore, but one thing remains true – I couldn't have made it this far without the unwavering support of my family and a few loyal friends. In times of real crisis, you don't feel invincible, and it's in those moments that you come to realize just how strong you truly are.\n\nMy point is that life is unpredictable, and we're all bound to face emergencies, big or small. No matter how well-prepared we are, some challenges are simply too great to overcome alone.\n\nWhile I agree that we should be more self-sufficient, I firmly believe that Americans should focus on rebuilding our sense of community and trust in one another. Instead of turning to the government for all our needs, we should strive to help each other and ask for assistance when necessary. This isn't about abandoning our individual strength, but rather recognizing that true resilience lies in our collective ability to support one another.\n\nWhen we talk about the \"rugged individualism\" that built this country, we often forget that our ancestors relied on compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources to get through tough times. The pioneers who crossed the American West didn't do it alone; they relied on each other for survival.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I've taken steps to prepare for emergencies – I have a disaster kit, first aid supplies, and other essentials. If you have the means, consider investing in a small farm or a wood stove. However, while you're at it, take the time to get to know your neighbors and build a support network. It's in these relationships that we'll find true strength and resilience.",
            "The question of why organisms evolve in a particular manner has long puzzled scientists, with some constraints and influences shaping the direction of evolutionary change. Although the renowned biologist D'Arcy Thompson noted in 1917 that \"the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,\" the same challenge remains today. Recent advances in mathematical modeling have been applied to various aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis, encompassing both ontogeny and phylogeny (as seen in Raup and Stanley's 1981 study). Our current research focuses on combining mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum with experimental studies to understand the mechanisms driving evolutionary-developmental change. By analyzing X-radiographic images of Prunum species and using the software program CerioShell, we can identify quantitative parameters that allow us to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters are then used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. Our findings are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies to gain a deeper understanding of macroevolutionary events within this clade.\n\nA shell can be visualized as a tube that traverses 360 degrees of space over time. The whorls, or revolutions of the coiled shell, spiral around an imaginary central axis known as the columella, which runs through the central column of the shell. The speed at which whorls expand can vary, and the continuous line separating each whorl is referred to as a suture. In most shells, the last whorl (the body whorl) is the largest. The spire consists of all the whorls except the last, while the apex is the tip of the spire, and the opposite end is the base. The animal exits its shell through the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from various angles, including apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives (with the typical orientation being the apertural view, where the aperture faces the viewer, and the apex points upwards). A method for counting whorls involves examining the shell from the apical view, identifying the first suture, and then drawing a line to divide the shell into two parts. Whorls are counted from this line, with estimates made to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a series of apertures that move through time and space as the animal builds its shell. By tracking the path of the aperture using coordinates of the center of each whorl's aperture and the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture, we can graphically and mathematically represent this trajectory. Once a mathematical formulation is established, we can manipulate parameters and modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "Indonesia's record on neonatal and infant mortality has remained stagnant for a decade, with the country struggling to meet its Millennium Development Goals for child and maternal health by 2015.  While Indonesia has made progress in certain areas, such as water and sanitation, the pace of improvement in child and maternal health is alarmingly slow.  To address these shortcomings, it's essential to strengthen the overall health system rather than relying solely on program-specific interventions.\n\nOne area of improvement is the number of births attended by skilled healthcare workers, which now stands at 72%.  However, this figure includes traditional workers like midwives who may not be equipped to handle complicated pregnancies, leading to a significant number of maternal deaths due to hemorrhage.  This highlights the limitations of this metric and the need for further action.  Additionally, the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five treated by a healthcare professional has declined, and postnatal care remains a concern, with low rates reported across the country.\n\nCesarian-section rates are also a cause for concern, averaging around 4% nationwide, with a significant disparity between urban and rural areas.  The c-section rate is 7% in urban settings, compared to just 2% in rural areas, underscoring the issue of unequal access to healthcare services.  Furthermore, the gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles is substantial, with a 27% difference in healthcare access.  This indicates that the poor face significant barriers to accessing healthcare services, likely due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nTo move forward and improve neonatal and maternal care indicators, the primary question is whether to focus on program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system.  While targeted programs may seem attractive for their focus and manageability, they also have drawbacks.  One major concern is the potential for resource diversion, as significant investments in one area can lead to reduced funding and human resources for other critical areas.  Additionally, running multiple parallel programs can result in duplication and inefficiency, increasing the administrative burden.",
            "When it comes to Victorian literature, most people would expect novels that delve deeply into the intricacies of the aristocracy and the societal norms of the time.  However, there are two novels that stand out from the rest: Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both of these stories feature an air of mystery and an unconventional flair that sets them apart from their contemporaries, adding depth and complexity to the characters and their motivations. \n\nThe unsettling and baffling ideas that swirl in the protagonist's mind are a hallmark of these novels.  In the case of Oliver Twist, the lines between reality and fantasy are often blurred, as seen in this passage: \"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind.  He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.\" (Dickens, 220)\n\nIn Oliver Twist, these inexplicable events often serve to unveil the protagonist's inner turmoil, his pain, and his growing awareness of the harsh realities surrounding him.  The vivid recollection of the shooting in chapter 28, for instance, is a dreamlike experience that Oliver undergoes as he struggles to find help, leaving the reader questioning whose fate it was that brought about his misfortune.  The shooting seems to overwhelm Oliver, numbing his senses, as he is borne away by an unseen force, his pain now constant and linked to fear rather than surprise.  This highlights the notion that Oliver has no control over his life, and that he is unable to take charge of even the most critical events, including the one that almost cost him his life.  This reinforced sense of defeat in Oliver suggests that he has become worn down by the circumstances of his life, and that he has lost the will to resist.\n\nIn a similar vein, Wuthering Heights is characterized by a sense of timelessness, where days blend together with the passing of night and the darkness that it brings.  The days seem to melt away, leaving only a sense of dread and the fleeting hours that tick by.  As the protagonist struggles to come to terms with their circumstances, they are left with a sense of disorientation and confusion.",
            "It's a story I still remember vividly from a few years ago when I worked in an after-school program, helping elementary-age students with their studies. I made it my mission to assist them in whichever subject they struggled with, but my strengths lay in English and reading. One of the instructors approached me about working with a young boy named Adrian, who was having a tough time reading. What struck me was that he had an unusual issue - he could pronounce certain letters perfectly, while others were way off. It was a real puzzle. Given his Latino background, I figured he might have some language barriers, but he spoke perfect English. Nevertheless, we struggled to make progress until I met his mother, who only spoke Spanish. I managed to communicate with her through my limited Spanish skills, but it dawned on me that something wasn't quite right - Adrian could read, but he was struggling with the English alphabet. I hope he's doing better now, but I still remember that moment like it was yesterday.\n\nI share this story to highlight a pressing issue in schools, particularly in California - the language barrier. It's not always as apparent as we think, even for students who speak perfect English. Reading can still be a significant obstacle. It's clear that this problem exists, so what can we do about it? For a student like Adrian, the solution was straightforward: extra tutoring in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for many students who barely speak English, the problem is much more complex.\n\nI believe there's no one-size-fits-all solution. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes - none of these approaches, on its own, will solve this issue. The key lies in combining all of these methods.\n\nFirstly, the dual language system is an excellent idea, not just for students whose first language is Spanish, but for all children. Research shows that children in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. Some people are skeptical, fearing it's a waste of resources or that most students won't benefit. That's just not true. If we implemented these programs as the norm, rather than the exception, all children would benefit from them. But how can we make this work? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? That's unrealistic and unreasonable. Instead, we could have specialized aids, tutors, or whatever you want to call them, who are bilingual.",
            "For most of us, the concept of something greater than ourselves becomes apparent from a young age. Whether we're learning about it in Sunday school, temple, or through self-discovery, our understanding of spirituality evolves over time. Some of us cling to the faith passed down by our parents, while others reject it entirely, convinced that our personal universe is all that exists. Many of us switch between different value systems, trying to find our place in the grand scheme of things. This search for meaning and purpose drives us to explore our own unique perspectives on spirituality, seeking answers in the darkness to guide us toward the light.\n\nAs I sat on the porch with my dad on that rainy day, I asked him about his favorite bird. \"A cardinal,\" he replied, gazing out into the rain. His thin frame and sparse hair spoke of a difficult journey he had been on, and his distant stare seemed to hold a mix of searching and remembering. I felt a deep sense of unease, knowing that I wouldn't be able to talk to him about how much I would miss him when he was gone. So I hugged him, sat back down, and joined him in watching the rain. My father eventually passed away just a few months later, on my 22nd birthday. The chemotherapy and radiation had prolonged his suffering, but I couldn't help but wonder if it was worth it. If God existed, I thought, he seemed to be ignoring me. I stopped praying, not wanting to waste my words on a higher power that didn't seem to be listening. Instead, I chose to remember my father for who he was, not for how he died.\n\nI decided not to watch him pass away, unable to bear the thought of witnessing the end of the person who brought me into this world. I knew my father would have wanted me to remember him by his life, not his death. I curled up in a ball for three days, waiting for the news, but no one even called me.",
            "You might consider the term \"Gothic Novel\" to be something of a paradox, combining as it does the old and the new. As Ian Watt notes, it's an oxymoron that brings to mind the concept of \"old-new.\" This genre has been both criticized and praised, with some viewing it as lacking depth and others seeing it as evoking a sense of the \"terrible sublime\" (Burke). The origins of the Gothic Novel date back to Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, which drew on both ancient and modern romance elements to create a new style of storytelling. By combining old theatrical elements with the modern novel's narrative structure, Walpole was able to craft a unique literary experience that he referred to as \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre often incorporates elements from medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions, despite the word \"gothic\" having already been associated with a range of styles, time periods, and people at the time of The Castle of Otranto's publication.\n\nIn the context of the Gothic Novel, the concept of chivalry plays a significant role. The medieval ideals of chivalry, which involved training a knight to be brave, honorable, and competent, are both preserved and transformed in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry was particularly important to Gothic writers like Walpole, who saw it as a representation of the ideal knight and the perceived lack of that ideal in their contemporary society. By romanticizing the chivalric past and idealizing it, Gothic writers like Walpole aimed to improve the present. When writing The Castle of Otranto, Walpole was living in a time of political turmoil and, possibly due to the unfair accusations he faced, he may have felt that the supposed moral and innate goodness of people in the gothic era had been lost in the society of his time. This sentiment is evident in characters like Frederic, who embodies many chivalric traits, including being a prince, having suffered, and being described in a way that exaggerates the traditional images of a gallant and courteous knight, introducing the Gothic trope of excess (Walpole 66).",
            "In the world of business, there's a crucial behind-the-scenes process that keeps everything running smoothly from production to delivery: supply chain management. This term was coined by Keith Oliver in 1982, a consultant who laid out the blueprint for planning, implementing, and controlling the entire supply chain to meet customer needs efficiently. At its core, supply chain management is a six-step process that involves production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information management. These key elements are the foundation upon which companies build their customer service strategies.\n\nThe first step in the supply chain process is production, the backbone of the entire operation. It's all about creating a plan for when, why, where, and how products will be made. To ensure production meets customer demands, managers must understand what customers want, which can be determined by analyzing market trends. Once the market is analyzed, managers can decide what products to produce and how many. The next step is choosing the best location for production, taking into account factors like volume, quality, and meeting customer expectations.\n\nA seamless production process is crucial, and every detail counts. If not planned correctly, it can lead to significant losses of time and money in the long run. I've seen this firsthand in my previous roles at retail giants like Walmart and Target. Both companies have meticulous processes in place, from employee uniform design to receiving shipments. Having a clear plan in place ensures a smooth operation without confusion or miscommunication.\n\nThe second key element of supply chain management is supply, which involves strategic decisions about a company's core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. A company may have multiple divisions producing a single product, each with its own equipment, workers, and specialties. Managers must decide which division is best suited for each process and may opt to outsource work to other companies to achieve velocity – quality, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness. By making informed decisions about supply, companies can meet customer needs efficiently and stay ahead of the competition.",
            "Hitler is alive in Burma, or so a mysterious message suggests. Movie star Ellen Page, known for her role in Juno, stands alone on a street corner, holding a disturbing sign with a Sharpie-written message. Burma, now known as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian country under the iron-fisted control of a military junta that seized power in 1962 through a violent coup d'état. In 2007, a wave of street protests shook the nation, fueled by a decade-long drought of public demonstrations. Led by thousands of Burmese monks, these protests earned the nickname \"The Saffron Revolution\" due to the color of their robes. However, the government's initial tolerance for the peaceful gatherings soon turned into brutal suppression, with the military clashing with the monks and invading monasteries across the country. Foreign journalists were arrested and imprisoned, and a Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, was tragically killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for documenting a protest.\n\nThis is just one example of a long history of governments cracking down on dissent and maintaining absolute control over their citizens. From ancient Rome's emperors claiming divine right to rule to Japan's emperors being believed to be gods, the desire for authoritarianism has been a timeless human trait. Even today, leaders like our current president, George W. Bush, have been known to consult with influential figures like Ted Haggard, a leader within the Republican Party.\n\nNotable examples of such brutal suppression include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students gathered to challenge the Chinese government's authoritarian rule. The death toll in this incident varies widely, with official reports ranging from 200 to 300 dead, while the Chinese Red Cross estimates between 2,000 and 3,000 fatalities. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, backed by the Rwandan government, systematically killed Tutsis and political moderates, is another extreme example. The Nazi regime's \"Third Reich,\" where anyone of Jewish descent was rounded up and killed, is yet another haunting example of the devastating consequences of unchecked authoritarianism.",
            "Duke Ellington's lasting impact on jazz is largely due to his remarkable career span and the way he harnessed his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Though he often played a subtle role on the piano, as a composer Ellington excelled at crafting intricate and rich pieces that showcased the unique talents of each band member. He created an environment where soloists could freely improvise, while writing tightly orchestrated passages that accentuated the distinctive style of specific band members, ultimately uniting the entire orchestra in a cohesive sound. This mastery of the individual players' voices and how they blended together allowed Ellington to pen some of the most groundbreaking and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\n\nNotably, the Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's innovative use of the human voice as an instrument, exemplified in his early work Creole Love Call. In this piece, he seamlessly integrated voice with instrumental textures without the constraint of lyrics. The 12-bar blues, a genre staple, features six distinct choruses that demonstrate Ellington's ability to complement the style of his soloists. The various choruses showcase a range of instrumental colors, including a muted trumpet solo, a soaring clarinet solo, and a syncopated piano phrase, all of which come together to create a rich tapestry of sound.\n\nHot and Bothered, recorded a year later, is a prime example of Ellington's skill at blending tight orchestration with a keen ear for tone color. In this piece, the call and response between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing highlights the versatility of the human voice as a musical instrument. The same approach is evident in It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), where Ellington masterfully utilizes the muted trombone of Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton to introduce the melody, demonstrating his ability to coax unique sounds from his musicians.",
            "There was this nagging void within her that she just couldn't shake. It started when she was 14, and by 17, it was still there, only now she was determined that she wanted someone, not just anything, to fill this emptiness. However, she found herself uninterested in any of the boys around her. Many had tried to woo her, but none had caught her attention. She often wondered what could be the reason behind this peculiar phenomenon, trying to come up with a theory, but nothing seemed convincing enough. She continued to live her life, constantly questioning her desires.\n\nHer home life was usually pretty chill. Her parents were laid-back and calm, rarely arguing with each other or with her. The only thing they ever disagreed on was her desire for independence and her free-spirited nature. As the daughter of a calm couple, she brought a lot of energy and personality to the table, making her pretty likable despite being a nice person.\n\nBut today was not a typical day. As she walked from room to room, searching for inspiration, she heard a sudden scream from the kitchen, followed by her mom's voice. She rushed into the room, starting to panic, and frantically asked, \"Mom! What's wrong?\" She saw her mom lying on the ground, in obvious pain, saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. Her daughter rushed to her side and put a hand on her to help. \"Ouch... sweetie, I need you to take me to the hospital.\" The words were rushed and strained, and her daughter could tell she was in a lot of pain. \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where to pick you up.\" Her mom directed her hands, and in that moment, her daughter was grateful that she had taken self-defense classes. She carried her mom to the car, got her settled in the back, and drove.\n\nThe hospital was filled with the smell of disinfectant and the eerie feeling of sickness, but her daughter's mind was focused on helping her mom. She quickly got her mom into a bed and started calling for medical help. A few worried faces gathered around, and someone quickly brought in a rolling bed to move her mom to a treatment area. The doctors took her in for examination, leaving her daughter to sit and worry.\n\nIt turned out that her mom had fallen off a step stool while trying to grab a vase from a high cabinet.",
            "This study aimed to investigate the link between adherence to the \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet) and the risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as stroke mortality. A modified version of the Med diet, called the \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet\", was used in the study. The aMed diet emphasizes higher consumption of plant foods like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, along with monounsaturated fats and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol intake is also allowed.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that following a Med diet can reduce the risk of total and cardiovascular mortality. In fact, one intervention trial found that the Med diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and lowering cholesterol levels in obese individuals. However, previous studies have not focused on the specific relationship between the Med diet and stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis study followed a large group of 74,886 female nurses, aged 38 to 63, who were part of the Nurses' Health Study. The study spanned 20 years, from 1984 to 2004, and involved six assessments of the aMed diet score using self-reported food frequency questionnaires. An impressive 95% of the nurses continued to participate throughout the study period. The accuracy of the questionnaires was validated through medical records, hospital records, and death certificates.\n\nThe researchers calculated cumulative averages of the aMed score over the 20-year period to account for individual variation and better represent long-term dietary intake. They also adjusted for potential confounders like age, smoking status, body mass index, menopausal status, and physical activity. Cox proportional-hazard modeling was used to analyze the association between aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke.\n\nThe results showed that greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of heart disease and stroke in women. Over the 20-year follow-up period, 2,391 cases of CHD, 1,763 cases of stroke, and 1,077 cardiovascular disease deaths were recorded. Women in the top aMed quintile had a significantly lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile, with a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "We're still feeling the effects of the 2007 financial crisis, with high unemployment rates and a struggling housing market. The question on everyone's mind is: how did this happen and how can we prevent it from happening again? In a nutshell, the crisis was caused by reckless and uninformed political decisions that pushed banks to make sub-prime loans into a fragile financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were forced to back and repack these mortgages into complex financial instruments. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were left with a huge shortfall, which they tried to shift onto the repackaged mortgages they had sold, ultimately dragging the entire economy down.\n\nThe roots of the crisis date back to the 1999 Clinton administration, when the President aimed to boost his popularity by easing lending restrictions. This laid the groundwork for the sub-prime crisis that would follow seven years later. Steven Holmes, a New York Times journalist, reported in 1999 that Fannie Mae was under pressure from the Clinton administration and its shareholders to maintain its rapid growth in profits. Holmes accurately predicted the consequences of these actions: \"The government-subsidized corporation may struggle in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" As we now know, ill-conceived lending led to a catastrophic economic meltdown.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the economic downturn, including a complex and volatile mortgage structure. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were widely used in the years leading up to the crisis, linking various sectors of the economy to the housing market. This led to U.S. households and financial markets taking on excessive debt in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nThe housing bubble ultimately burst, and the financial institutions that had purchased these mortgage-backed securities were left reeling. In 2007, the top five U.S. investment banks reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt, accounting for about 30% of the U.S. GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at a steep discount, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subject to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "When it comes to writing, there's a delicate balance between showing and telling – and one of these elements can make or break your story. Exposition, that is, the part of your narrative where you reveal information about your characters, settings, and plot, can be a double-edged sword. On one hand, it's necessary to provide context and background for your readers. On the other hand, too much exposition can put them to sleep or, worse, make them click the \"Back\" button.\n\nAs any seasoned writer knows, the rule \"Show, don't tell\" is a golden one. However, even experienced authors like Dr. Merlin still find themselves trapped in lengthy passages of exposition, often because it's the easy way out. It's all too tempting to dump a character's entire history onto the page, thinking it will get the story moving faster. But the truth is, this approach can lead to a dull, lifeless narrative.\n\nExposition is essentially telling the audience what happened, rather than showing them through action, dialogue, and descriptive language. In film, it's the awkward information dump where a character explains a crucial plot point to another; in fiction, it's the author doing the telling. Imagine reading a story where the protagonist meets her love interest, gets married, and witnesses their murder in a few short paragraphs. It's dry, unengaging, and doesn't allow the reader to invest in the characters or their relationships.\n\nThe key is to add meat to the bones of your story. Take the example of a character's background: instead of listing off their entire history, show it through their speech, mannerisms, and actions. This way, the reader can infer their personality, values, and motivations, making their eventual fate more impactful. When done well, exposition becomes a subtle, nuanced way to reveal character, setting, and plot, rather than a clunky info dump.\n\nSo, how can you strike a balance? The next time you're tempted to dump a character's backstory or a lengthy explanation, ask yourself: can it be shown through action, dialogue, or descriptive language instead? Remember, the goal is to engage your reader, not to overwhelm them with too much information at once. By showing, not telling, you'll create a richer, more immersive story that will leave your readers wanting more.",
            "I recently watched two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first one I tuned in to was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011), and it was live. The lead story covered a disturbing incident in Ashley, Ohio, where a man named Shad Hostettler had stabbed his wife. They aired his mug shot, and he appeared to be a menacing figure. The news anchors devoted only a couple of minutes to this developing story, which I think was sufficient. The details they shared were limited to the fact that the victim had been stabbed multiple times and that Hostettler had been taken into custody.\n\nThe second story that caught my attention was about an early morning shooting that had occurred in the Sharon Woods area. An 18-year-old man named Travis Buyers had been critically injured, and no suspects or arrests had been made at the time. The SWAT team was investigating the crime scene. I felt that this story was glossed over, and I suspect that it might have been due to the fact that the victim was a minority. This observation is not new to me, as I've noticed for years that minorities often receive less media attention when they're victims of crime. In contrast, when a white person is involved in a similar situation, the media tends to sensationalize it.\n\nThe next story that aired was about a gunshot hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. The news team provided some details about the location where the incident was believed to have occurred, and they mentioned that the bullet was a .22 caliber from a rifle. Crime-Stoppers were offering a $5,000 reward for any information that could lead to the arrest of the perpetrator.\n\nThe forecast for the upcoming weekend was also covered, with the news team predicting rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon. The temperature was expected to remain in the mid-to-low 80s. They kept this segment relatively short, likely as a teaser to keep viewers tuned in.\n\nThe news also featured a story about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The suspect was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. He was estimated to be around 6 feet tall and 150 pounds. I found it interesting that they emphasized his dark skin tone and the fact that he wore a hoodie.\n\nAnother story that aired was about a man named Rene Rodriguez, who had been convicted of being a Texas-based marijuana kingpin. He had been involved in a conspiracy to distribute large quantities of marijuana to Ohio from Texas. I noticed that instead of stating his sentence, they mentioned that he had been given 300 months in prison. I'm not sure what their reasoning was behind this, whether they thought it sounded more severe or not. Additionally, they mentioned that he was Hispanic, which I didn't think was particularly relevant to the story.",
            "There's a profound connection between brothers, a bond that's unbreakable and virtually unshakeable. This bond is made up of a complex mix of emotions, including love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty. Brothers have a unique understanding of each other, one that eclipses the bond they share with anyone else. When they look at their brother, they see a reflection of themselves, and it's in those moments of intense desperation that the true nature of this bond is revealed, no matter how good or evil it may be. The consequences of these emotions are significant, and confronting them can be a daunting task. When one brother can look into the eyes of his sibling and see their own reflection staring back, they gain a deeper understanding of their own character, not as others see them, but as they truly are. In the end, it's their actions and the consequences that follow that define their true character. \n\nThis theme is a central focus of James Hurst's short story \"The Scarlet Ibis.\" The tale of two brothers is a powerful exploration of the emotions that arise from this unique bond. As they venture into the lush, vivid landscape, their bond is put to the test, culminating in a heart-wrenching climax that leaves only one brother alive. The story delves into the complexities of the protagonist's character, Doodle, and his relationship with his brother, as well as the narrator's point of view, which offers a glimpse into the protagonist's inner world and how it influences his actions.\n\nPride is the dominant force driving the protagonist's actions throughout the story. From their initial outing to their final, fateful excursion, he feels a deep-seated resentment towards Doodle. The young boy had envisioned a brother who could share in his passions and adventures, like exploring the swamp or racing to Horsehead Landing. However, Doodle's fragile health made it impossible for him to participate in such activities, crushing the protagonist's dreams. The protagonist even harbors anger towards Doodle, as evidenced by his dark thoughts about suffocating the child. Yet, when Doodle smiles at him, his anger melts, revealing a deep-seated love for his brother. This nuanced portrayal of the protagonist's emotions highlights the complexity of the bond between brothers and the consequences that arise from it.",
            "The human brain - it's a complex, innovative information-processing system. As technology has advanced from primitive to modern, so too have the metaphors used to describe the brain. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, then to papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. However, it's essential to keep in mind that these metaphors, while useful, have their limitations and can lead to misconceptions about how the brain works.\n\nInformation processing begins with sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or light into electrical signals. This sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the brain's algorithms, both through bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, the brain's bottom-up processing puts together basic information like color, orientation, and the object's borders to conclude that you're seeing a box. Meanwhile, top-down processing uses previous decisions to speed up your recognition of the box, allowing you to identify it as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole.\n\nOnce information is processed, an attention filter determines its importance and decides which cognitive processes it should be made available to. Although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might focus on your name even when spoken in a noisy room. There are multiple stages of processing, and the results are modulated by attention repeatedly.\n\nFor the brain to process information, it first needs to be stored. There are various types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. Information is initially encoded, with different types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimulus. For example, verbal input can be encoded based on its appearance, sound, or meaning. Once stored, information must be maintained. Studies suggest that working memory, which holds information for around 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through specific neurons for a short period. Long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain proteins.\n\nThere are numerous models of how knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on memory retrieval, others on computer science, and others on neurophysiology. The semantic network model, for instance, proposes that concepts are represented by nodes, linked by their relatedness. In this model, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley critiques the looming dangers of technology and the capitalistic system that fuels it in his dystopian novel, Brave New World. In this futuristic society, people prioritize community over individuality and are conditioned from birth to pursue instant gratification above all else. The citizens are essentially pawns in a larger game, confined to a single ideology dictated by the World Controller. From a Marxist perspective, Huxley's work appears to be a commentary on the flaws of the emerging economy during his time.\n\nThe novel satirizes capitalism through the concept of false consciousness, a Marxist idea where the common people are denied knowledge of their true economic relationships with other classes, instead being consumed by their own self-interest. This is achieved through the conditioning of the population, where hypnopædia reinforces the drive to consume, spend, and indulge. The lower classes, represented by Deltas and Gammas, lack genuine autonomy, while the upper classes, like Alphas and Betas, are often oblivious to the manipulation, with few characters like Bernard questioning their place in society.\n\nHuxley's portrayal of relationships in Brave New World is also notable for its superficiality. Interactions between individuals are lacking in depth, and even among major characters, there is a sense of emptiness. This might suggest that the rise of technology and capitalism has stripped humans of their free will and emotional expression. Love and intense emotions are absent, replaced by shallow comments about physical appearance and superficial interactions.\n\nThe characters' complacency with their social status in the hierarchy indicates the socioeconomic effects of capitalism, where people are conditioned to believe in their superiority as long as they conform to societal norms. This phenomenon is reminiscent of Marxist theory on the proletariat, where individuals are misled into thinking they are better off than others as long as they continue to consume, obey, and conform to the expectations of their peers.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for almost three years now, which is equivalent to five semesters. For many, including myself, navigating the campus can be a challenge. My freshman year was spent in an East Halls dorm room, situated on the far eastern edge of campus – excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. The commute from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in areas like Willard building, near the center of campus, often took about 25 minutes on foot, especially during inclement weather. I recently spoke to an alumnus who's not much older than me, and they shared an interesting fact: not long ago, the East Halls dorms were separated from the rest of the university by vast tracts of unused land. Today, that empty space has been filled with sports fields, new buildings like the Creamery and health services building, and surrounded by apartments. As our campus expands, getting from one place to another is becoming increasingly difficult. So, what's the best solution to this problem of mobility? In my opinion, the answer is clear: the bicycle. However, the bike alone won't solve anything; students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be designed with the needs of bicyclists in mind.\n\nI recently had a conversation with a friend who took up bicycling again after a few-year hiatus. He said, \"Bikes are great; for a few years, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" Besides being great for your physical health, bicycling is the most efficient mode of transportation. With a bowl of oatmeal and some physical exertion, you can cover 30 miles or more. As an off-campus resident, I live just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. Buying a bike was the smartest decision I made this year. With classes in Thomas building, which is a twenty-five-minute walk from my house, riding a bike can cut that time down to just 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only issue is that Pollock Road is the most direct route to Thomas building, but it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or not. There are pros to walking as well, but personally, I'm too busy to walk. If I didn't have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day, which is over two and a half hours every week. When you add up all the other time I'd spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and so on, that's more time than I can spare."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "As I continue to pursue my education in social work, I'm committed to a career path that will allow me to help vulnerable children who have been abused or neglected, as well as provide support for struggling families. Some key values that I aim to bring to the social work field include service, respect, integrity, and a commitment to building strong relationships between individuals and communities. These values aren't just essential for social workers; they're also deeply personal to me. My passion for helping others has always been strong, but I wasn't initially sure which career path to follow. Throughout my high school and college years, I witnessed many people struggling with their problems, and some turned to coping mechanisms that weren't ideal. This motivated me to earn a Bachelor's degree in Psychology, and after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I decided to take a break to explore my options. However, a pivotal experience that summer changed my career trajectory. I visited a friend who was hosting a 16-year-old boy who was fleeing his abusive parents. The next day, I learned he had called the police to report the situation. I drove to his parents' house, where I spoke with the police about my concerns and my background in Psychology. I encouraged them to investigate the situation further, and later, I had a conversation with the parents, who seemed evasive and made excuses for their son's actions. This experience made me realize the importance of social work and my desire to help children and families in similar situations.\n\nAnother value that I hold dear is social justice. As a society, we often claim to value individuality, but in reality, we often strive to conform to societal norms rather than embracing our unique qualities. I'm an individual, and I refuse to be limited by expectations of what's considered \"normal.\" Throughout my time in high school and college, I spoke out against social injustice whenever I could – from expressing my individuality through my hair and clothing choices to advocating for the rights of marginalized groups. I believe in social justice, and I'll continue to stand up against injustice in all its forms.\n\nMy experiences have taught me the importance of having a strong sense of purpose, and I'm eager to dedicate my career to making a positive impact in the lives of those who need it most. By staying true to my values of service, respect, integrity, and social justice, I aim to become a compassionate and effective social worker who can make a real difference in the lives of others.",
            "This paper investigates the interplay between the Biological and Sociocultural models in the context of insomnia. The biological model centers on the genetic factors inherited by an individual, as well as the medical aspects of their overall health. In contrast, the Sociocultural model examines the environmental influences that shape our understanding of insomnia, including factors such as race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review delves into these models, exploring key research studies that shed light on each model and their significance in explaining insomnia.\n\nInsomnia can be categorized into three main groups: primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders linked to other mental health issues, and sleep disorders resulting from medical complications or substance use. Within the primary sleep disorders, we find Dyssomnias and Parasomnias. The Dyssomnias encompass a range of conditions, including Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Conversely, Parasomnias involve behavioral abnormalities and physiological occurrences, such as Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. This review focuses on insomnia and its relationship to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders emphasizes the role of genetics, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspects of sleep disorders. Research has shown that neurons in the hypothalamus, specifically those containing orexin, play a crucial role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study on mice found that phenotypic GABAB receptors on these orexin neurons are responsible for sleep-wake states. Activation of the GABAA receptor can induce responses that promote sleep, while inhibition of the receptor can lead to reduced anxiety and induce sleep. Furthermore, the GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time in these mice (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings suggest that animal models can be applied to human studies, highlighting the genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. This has significant implications for our understanding of the relationship between the GABAB receptor and sleep. If there is a problem or absence with this receptor, it could impact an individual's ability to sleep without medication. From a sociocultural perspective, if the phenotype is inherited, this could regulate sleep, and any alteration to the receptor could naturally disrupt sleep patterns for an individual, negatively impacting daily life, including school, career, and mundane tasks that require focus.",
            "This article delves into the realm of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), a condition that affects the way the brain interprets auditory information. At its core, CAPD is a disorder of the central nervous system (CNS), which fails to process sounds effectively, making it difficult for individuals to separate words, differentiate voices, or filter out background noise. Although people with CAPD can hear normally, the area of the brain responsible for sound processing doesn't function as it should, leading to difficulties in understanding and interpreting auditory information.\n\nThe concept of CAPD has its roots in the 1950s, when researchers initially referred to it as \"auditory imperception.\" The pioneering work of Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari in 1954 and Japanese researcher Kimura in 1961 laid the groundwork for understanding the condition. A national conference in 1977 sparked further research into the condition, which has since become known as CAPD.\n\nCAPD presents itself in various ways, including difficulties in localizing sounds in space, distinguishing between different acoustic events, recognizing sound patterns, and detecting changes in speech tone. Individuals with CAPD may struggle to process complex auditory information, leading to problems with language comprehension, social interactions, and overall communication.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, a comprehensive evaluation is necessary, typically conducted by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, or other professionals using a range of tests and assessments. These may include questionnaires, observations of listening behaviors, and evaluations of auditory function. Currently, there is no single, definitive test for CAPD, and the underlying causes of the disorder remain unknown.\n\nIn a mainstream classroom setting, teachers can play a crucial role in supporting students with CAPD. By understanding the characteristics and challenges associated with the condition, educators can develop strategies to help students with CAPD succeed. This may involve providing accommodations such as seating arrangements, visual aids, and extra time to process information, as well as offering regular feedback and support to help students stay on track.",
            "It seems that Twelfth Night suggests that relying on deception to maintain a charade can backfire, ultimately forcing the individual to reject their disguise or risk losing themselves in the process. However, uncovering the truth often comes with its own set of problems, particularly alienation from those around them. People may respond to the revelation with a mixture of reactions, ranging from indifference to offense, making it a difficult decision to weigh personal preservation against maintaining relationships with others.\n\nThe theme of deception through gender role reversal raises a lot of questions, particularly the underlying motivations behind adopting a disguise. In the case of Viola, she assumes a male persona to protect herself in a foreign land, but this decision has unintended consequences, including severing ties with the women in her life and becoming a source of confusion for those around her. Olivia, for instance, becomes infatuated with Cesario, only to later redirect her affections towards Sebastian, suggesting that her attraction may have been superficial. This dynamic is further complicated by the suppressed emotions between Viola/Cesario and Orsino, which are forced to the surface through Cesario's disguise.\n\nOn the surface, this may seem like a progressive exploration of suppressed emotions, particularly in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. However, upon closer examination, it appears that Shakespeare may be satirizing the tendency to judge people based on appearances. Olivia's ease in switching her affections and treating Cesario/Viola as family rather than a romantic interest hints at a more complex character dynamic, one that is more focused on social norms and expectations than genuine emotional connection.",
            "German colonial rule was marked by brutality, particularly in the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. However, it's essential to note that the German colonial empire was a diverse entity with varied policies, ruling styles, and geography. Education systems across the colonies also differed significantly. For instance, when the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found an educated and literate African population. In contrast, German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors.\n\nHowever, the situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast. Unlike in East Africa, where the government invested in state schools and native education, in South West Africa, the task of educating the natives was largely left to missionary societies with limited government support. The government did invest in education for Europeans, establishing a system of state schools and heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had lasting effects on South West Africa, even after German rule ended. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, the majority of the population remained uneducated and illiterate. Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to this divergence, which this paper aims to explore in more detail, focusing on new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nResearch on education in the German colonial empire has been conducted extensively, with many studies published in German during the early 20th century. These works primarily described the features of educational systems in the colonies. Later studies in English expanded the discussion through comparative analyses of education in various German colonies and more in-depth examinations of specific aspects of education. These studies highlighted significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. One notable work is Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa, which compared the two colonies and discussed the factors that accounted for their differences. According to Cohen, the large settler population in South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing features of the colony's educational system.\n\nSouth West Africa stood out from other German colonies in terms of its climate, with a relatively temperate climate despite being covered by arid desert. This relatively hospitable environment attracted a significant European population, with nearly 15,000 whites living in South West Africa by 1913, compared to only 5,336 in East Africa, the colony with the next largest settler population.",
            "Over the past 100 years, popular music has evolved into a vast and diverse landscape, encompassing numerous genres that are often intertwined and hard to define. Within these genres, sub-genres have emerged, creating a complex web of sounds and styles. Heavy Metal, in particular, has become a standout example of this complexity, having branched out into various sub-genres and sub-sub-genres over the past 40 years.\n\nHeavy Metal's expressiveness stems from its ability to convey a wide range of emotions, often leaning towards the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Its diversity is a result of its flexibility, which has allowed artists to create their own unique sub-genres, each with its own distinct sound and style. This has led to a proliferation of niches within the Heavy Metal movement, making it challenging to pinpoint what exactly defines Heavy Metal music.\n\nTo understand the many facets of Heavy Metal, it's essential to grasp its core essence and the factors that have shaped it into the movement it is today. At its heart, Heavy Metal is a genre that revels in darkness, often incorporating more extreme elements such as louder volumes, more intense energy, and a greater emphasis on theatricality. Unlike other genres, Heavy Metal is characterized by the musicians' exceptional technical skill, which is evident in their music.\n\nHeavy Metal's connection to substance abuse, particularly psychedelic drugs, is another defining aspect of the genre. The psychedelic boom of the 1970s led to the creation of boundary-pushing music that explored the darker side of human experience. This trend has continued, with later generations of metal artists drawing inspiration from the Romantic Era's dark and visceral qualities.\n\nLyrics like those found in Helter Skelter, which is often considered one of the first Heavy Metal songs, showcase the genre's affinity for the darker side of the emotional spectrum. This song's themes of turmoil and chaos were a response to the Rolling Stones' similarly heavy and dark song, and the Beatles' desire to prove they could match the Stones' intensity.",
            "Before the Surrealist artists began creating their dreamlike masterpieces, Henri Rousseau was already crafting his own dreams - both figuratively and literally. His 1910 painting, The Dream, not only depicts a woman marveling at the breathtaking wonders within a dream, but also reflects Rousseau's own personal aspirations as an artist. For years, he had envisioned recognition, acceptance, and praise from his fellow artists and art enthusiasts, but found himself struggling with an internal conflict that would shape his career: to conform to traditional styles and gain acceptance from the art world, or to forge his own path and remain true to his creative vision.\n\nTo understand The Dream through this lens, it's essential to delve into Rousseau's life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in the French town of Laval, he grew up in a relatively affluent household, with his father being a successful tinsmith and hardware merchant. Despite his comfortable upbringing, Rousseau never received formal art training, instead working as a municipal toll service employee until he was 40. His life took a significant turn after the death of his first wife, Clémence, and their eight infant children, leaving him with only one child, Julia, and a deep sense of loss. Painting became his solace, offering a fresh start and a means to cope with his grief. Unlike his contemporaries, who often romanticized the peasant class in their art, Rousseau was a folk painter, driven by the hopes and dreams of the average working-class individual.\n\nRousseau's desire for acceptance from the art world was understandable, given his late start in the field and the fact that he was producing art alongside some of the most renowned modern artists of the time. It wasn't until around the same period that Matisse was establishing himself as a respected artist that Rousseau began to receive recognition for his own work. As art historian Jan Gordon notes in Modern French Painters, while Matisse was driven by a fear of creating mundane art, Rousseau's primary goal was to craft a conventional piece that would earn him a spot among the esteemed ranks of the Artiste Français.",
            "It's no surprise that many philosophers have pondered the intricate connection between ethics and aesthetics, truth and beauty. I firmly believe that at its core, there's a fundamental reason for this connection. As John Keats so eloquently puts it in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" While we often learn about life through education and experience, we seem to instinctively appreciate ethics and aesthetics without being formally taught. Both ethics and aesthetics try to describe rather than prescribe; our studies of morality and beauty are more about explaining why a piece of art or literature is beautiful or why an action is moral, rather than providing a set of rules for judging or creating good art or moral behavior.\n\nIn other words, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what's good or what's beautiful. When discussing the worth of the Mona Lisa, for instance, we might focus on concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but these don't really explain why it's great art. When asked about a favorite work of art or literature, people often start with a phrase like, \"There's just something about it\" before providing a more in-depth explanation. I believe that both art and morals can't be fully reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor points out, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how thoroughly we describe a work of literature, there's still something transcendent that remains. Ethics, as Wittgenstein notes, \"cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" I suggest that it's this \"something,\" this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\nI think morality and art are closely related because we experience both of them most profoundly on a noumenal level, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Germany has become a powerful nation, a unified country with its own distinct culture that spans from the picturesque Alps in Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. The same cultural essence can be felt from Cologne along the Rhine River, through Germany's central regions, to the Saxon city of Dresden situated on the Elbe River. Given its unique blend of cultures, it's no surprise that modern-day Germany has its roots in various tribes and sources.\n\nThe origins of the term 'Germany' are shrouded in mystery, with historians and scholars debating its true meaning. According to Roman historian Tacitus, the name might have originated from a Germanic tribe known as the Tungrians, who were referred to as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and clashed with the Gaulish forces. Julius Caesar first used the term \"Germanus\" in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, where he described the Germanic tribes that often crossed the Rhine under dubious circumstances. He derived the word from the Gauls themselves, using it to distinguish between the conquered Gauls and the undefeated Germanic tribes. While the exact origin remains unclear, some believe it might have referred to a neighboring tribe in the Gaulish language. In his first book on the Gallic Wars, Julius Caesar notes: \"The Germans, who reside beyond the Rhine, constantly engage in battles with them (The Gauls).\" Others propose that the term comes from the spear used in warfare, known as a ger, or from the Old Irish word garim, meaning \"to shout,\" indicating the Germans were loud and boisterous.\n\nThe early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his writings that the Germans were an indigenous people, untouched by immigration or intermarriage with other races. He noted that those who sought to settle in Germany would have had to be driven by a strong sense of home and a desire to return, rather than being drawn by the allure of the land itself. The Romans, on the other hand, would often send their conquests into Germania to acquire goods and skills, but they rarely settled there permanently. As the Germanic tribes emerged in the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire, trading goods and serving in the Roman army.",
            "As I gazed down at the scene before me, my mind was a complete blank, unable to grasp the vibrant colors and shapes in front of my eyes.  My thoughts were a jumble of fragmented ideas that appeared and disappeared in a matter of seconds, leaving me with a sense of detachment.  It was as if my consciousness was running on autopilot, processing the visual feast without any emotional attachment or deeper meaning. \n\nI had always been fascinated by drawing, ever since I was a kid, and so when I stumbled upon an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain, I jumped at the chance to learn.  The book offered a unique approach to understanding the creative process, from grasping the fundamentals of drawing to tapping into the subconscious mind.  One technique that caught my attention was the idea of applying a mental square frame to a complex scene, simplifying it and making it more manageable.  At that moment, however, I was too overwhelmed to even think about such techniques.\n\nAll I could do was stand there, transfixed by the sight before me.  I had always admired the works of artists like Picasso, Monet, and the Renaissance masters, each with their own distinct style and vision.  If I ever hoped to create something truly beautiful, it had to start here, with this moment, this bowl of fruit, and the blank canvas of the future.  My hand instinctively reached for my trusty pencil, my fingers itching to bring my ideas to life.\n\nBut that was not to be.  Instead, my fingers hovered over the toilet handle, my hand tightening and relaxing in anticipation.  The brown, unappetizing mass refused to budge, stuck fast like a stubborn slug.  I stood there, frowning, my mind racing with frustration.  A few more flushes, a few more moments of contemplation, and then I reached for the toilet paper, wrapping my hand around the sheet like a mitten.  Slowly, deliberately, I dipped my hand into the bowl, a surreal and somewhat macabre ritual that left me questioning my own sanity.",
            "In my opinion, the alarming number of teenage driving fatalities is a serious concern in the United States.  Several key factors contribute to this tragic statistic, and understanding them is crucial to finding a solution.  One such factor is the fact that the teenage brain is not fully equipped to handle the dangers associated with driving, as explained by the National Institutes of Health.  Additionally, the National Institutes of Health point out that inexperience plays a significant role in the problem, leading to increased rates of fatal accidents, vehicle rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road.  It's also no surprise that teens are more likely to be involved in accidents when driving with their peers, which, as we all know, is a common occurrence.\n\nA study conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center found a clear correlation between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents that occur.  In an effort to address this issue, California and other states have implemented temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours teens can drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.  However, I believe that these measures are merely temporary fixes and do not address the root of the problem.  The real issue is that, statistically speaking, young drivers are not equipped to handle the risks and responsibilities associated with driving.\n\nRenowned psychologist Marvin Zuckerman has suggested that 18 is still too young to grant a full driver's license, as research indicates that individuals under 19-20 often engage in risk-taking behaviors for the thrill of it.  It makes sense, then, to delay driving until this tendency to take risks has leveled out.  If we continue to grant driver's licenses to young teens, we will likely see a devastating increase in accidents, and the death toll will be staggering.  By 2010, millions of new teen drivers will be hitting the roads, and the consequences will be dire.\n\nImplementing legislation to address this issue would be relatively straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver's education classes to lay the groundwork for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 should be allowed to operate a vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued before granting a full license, and a certain number of practical driver's training hours could be required, as is the case in most states (California, for example, currently requires 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult).  Uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable and effective way to protect teens across the country.\n\nIt's not a novel idea, but it's an idea whose time has come.  We owe it to our young drivers to take action and ensure their safety on our roads.",
            "While browsing through the Library of Congress's impressive collection of early Edison films, I decided to watch all fifteen trick films from 1895 to 1901. These films cleverly use editing techniques to create illusions that amaze and intrigue. My analysis focused on uncovering the underlying poetics of these trick films and identifying the unique characteristics that set a few of the later films apart from the rest. At the turn of the century, the trick film is typically set-bound, confined within a static, frontal proscenium, and adheres to a strict one shot equals one film approach, with minimal camera movement and reliance on long and medium shots.\n\nHowever, there are a few films from the early 1900s that break free from these traditional guidelines by incorporating more innovative techniques such as multiple shots. One of the most striking commonalities among the trick films is their reliance on interior sets within a frontal proscenium composition. The camera remains stationary, never panning or zooming to follow characters or objects. This style, originating from the theatre and vaudeville, restricts the movement of figures in trick films to side-to-side motion, rather than forward or backward movement towards the camera. For instance, in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), the actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis, never deviating from the frame.\n\nThe use of the frontal proscenium also dominates the types of shots used in these films. Long shots and, more rarely, medium shots are the norm, while close-ups are entirely absent from the Edison catalog's trick films. This is a nod to the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance within the frame of the stage. As a result, actors rarely venture towards or away from the camera, making close-ups virtually non-existent.\n\nFurthermore, most early trick films adhere to the notion that one conceptual shot equals one film, limiting their length to about a minute or less, depending on the frame rate. This also restricts the narrative or dramatic potential of these films, which largely focus on short, vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic and disappearing acts, with minimal storytelling. However, upon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that a single \"shot\" can be composed of multiple physical shots joined together to create the illusion of apparition or disappearance. For example, in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), a more detailed examination reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary's severed \"head\" begins, even though the film is conceptually one shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a passionate advocate for Republican values.  His agricultural background and brief foray into politics shaped him into a man known for his unwavering dedication to personal freedom and limited government.  His strong stance on the importance of an agrarian way of life influenced his views on sovereignty, Constitutional interpretation, and even the judicial system.  His goal was to preserve and promote what he believed to be the superior career path, which guided his arguments on governance.\n\nTaylor believed that the United States had a unique opportunity to create an ideal system of government, unencumbered by a pre-existing tradition.  He firmly believed in the inherent rights of individuals and the interconnected nature of those rights – if one right is compromised, the others suffer as well, and their value is diminished.  As such, he believed that these rights should be beyond the reach of government interference.  He saw the concept of the \"state of nature\" as a place where the strong and cunning profited, but in a civilized society, this should not be the case.\n\nTo create an ideal society, Taylor advocated for a government that acknowledges both the good and evil within humanity.  He was unyielding in his views on dualistic morality, stating that \"as government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human.\"  He defined good principles as those that protect private property, promote agriculture, and discourage excessive capitalism, and believed that a government founded on these principles would function equitably, regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be driven by self-interest.  However, he believed that self-interest was only considered evil when it led to the creation of sub-societies that exploited others.  A well-designed government was necessary to balance humanity's natural flaws and prevent the introduction of bad principles.\n\nLike many of his fellow Republicans, Taylor called for a strict construction of the Constitution, advocating for a limited Federal government with only the powers explicitly stated in the document.  He recognized that an extensive Federal government was likely to be expensive and potentially despotic, but he also believed that a literal interpretation of the Constitution without considering the intent of its authors could lead to corruption.  Furthermore, he considered the Declaration of Independence to be the true charter of the United States, as it more clearly defined the country as a collection of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "In looking at the data, there was a significant decline in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project, which was a bit disheartening. It's difficult to pinpoint the exact reason for this drop, but a few factors might have contributed to it. As winter set in at our New England campus, it's likely that fewer people were commuting by bicycle or on foot, which could have led to the decrease. Additionally, the end of the fall semester meant that students and faculty were busy finishing their schoolwork and processing grades, making it easy for the commuter log to fall by the wayside. The start of the holiday season and subsequent month-long break only added to the decline, as many people didn't need to come to campus at all. The low number of submissions in the following month of January could also be attributed to the fact that classes hadn't resumed yet. However, none of these factors fully explain the low number of submissions in February. It's possible that projects like this tend to experience a natural drop in enthusiasm after the initial excitement wears off. To combat this trend, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a special campaign to revitalize the initiative, which did lead to an increase in log submissions for that month. One of the challenges we faced was maintaining momentum despite the natural decrease in engagement and the specific challenges of holiday and semester breaks in higher education. \n\nAnother hurdle we encountered was the fact that many people enjoy the freedom and independence that comes with driving their own cars, which is deeply ingrained in our culture. To overcome this, we offered incentives in the form of gift certificates to local businesses, which seemed effective at first. However, it would have been interesting to see how larger prizes, such as a new bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car, might have influenced participation. As it was, the value of the prizes didn't change throughout the project, and while the gift cards were a good starting point, announcing larger prizes at the beginning of each month might have kept people engaged and motivated.",
            "An Exchange Traded Fund, or ETF for short, is a type of investment that tracks an index, a commodity, or a basket of assets like an index fund. However, it's more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange. This unique combination of features offers several benefits, including diversification and the ability to sell short, buy on margin, and purchase a single share in any transaction, just like owning a single stock. Additionally, the expense ratios of ETFs are significantly lower than those of the average mutual fund, making them an attractive option for investors. \n\nThat being said, there are some downsides to consider. For example, you'll need to pay a commission on any trade involving an ETF, just as you would with a stock. Furthermore, the wide variety of ETFs available can be overwhelming, and it's essential for savvy financial investors to carefully evaluate whether the stated benefits, such as diversification, truly exist and to what extent. In this analysis, we'll be taking a closer look at the ETF IHF and comparing it to its top 10 holdings to determine whether the benefits of owning a single ETF are comparable to those of owning a diversified portfolio of the 10 stocks. We'll also examine whether there are alternative configurations of the same stocks that could provide a more optimal return.\n\nTo make this analysis manageable, we'll focus on the top 10 holdings, which account for 63.58% of the ETF's assets. Here are the top 10 holdings and their corresponding percentage of total assets.\n\nTo estimate how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF as a whole, we can use their current percentage of assets to calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming the portfolio is made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the same proportion as the ETF's holdings. The calculations are presented in the chart below.\n\nAs you can see from the chart, a portfolio consisting only of the top 10 holdings would offer a return 6.11% higher than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. Additionally, the Beta of the top 10 holdings is 0.12 lower than the ETF as a whole. These results suggest that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could potentially provide a higher return with a lower Beta. However, it's essential to determine whether these differences are statistically significant.\n\nTo address this question, we calculated the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalized it to 100% to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF. By examining the results, we can gain a better understanding of whether the portfolios are statistically different from each other.",
            "One of Edgar Allan Poe's personal favorites was \"Dream-Land\", a poem that showcases his creative genius. The term \"Thulé\" is used twice in the poem, with its origins dating back to the ancient Roman poet Virgil. However, it's worth noting that Poe was also heavily influenced by German literature. \n\nThis connection to Virgil is significant, but it's not the only source to consider. Poe's interest in German authors, particularly Goethe, is undeniable. In fact, his poem \"Dream-Land\" bears a striking resemblance to Goethe's work. \n\nA notable scholar, Karl J. Arndt, observed the similarities between Poe's \"Politian\" and Goethe's \"Mignon\", concluding that Poe was likely drawing inspiration from the German author. Goethe, a renowned writer of poetic dramas, is perhaps best known for his magnum opus \"Faust\". Published in two parts, the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the poem \"Faust\" features a character known as the \"King of Thulé\". \n\nIn this poem, the King's wife passes away, leaving him heartbroken and consumed by grief. He begins to drink heavily, eventually deciding that it's time to end his own life. The \"King of Thulé\" and the character from \"Dream-Land\" share a haunting similarity, with both struggling to cope with loss and finding solace in drinking. \n\nInterestingly, Goethe's \"Faust\" was adapted into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, just a year before Poe referenced Thule in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\". Poe's use of the term \"Thule\" is not limited to this poem, as he also employed it in \"Dream-Land\". The poem's speaker describes a desolate landscape, haunted by the ghosts of friends and devoid of color, echoing the themes present in \"The King of Thulé\". \n\nGiven Poe's admiration for Alfred, Lord Tennyson, it's clear that he would have been familiar with Goethe's work. In fact, the numerous reproductions of Goethe's writings that were circulating at the time would have ensured his exposure to the German author's oeuvre. The connection between \"Dream-Land\" and \"The King of Thulé\" is undeniable, with Poe's poem serving as a companion piece to Goethe's work.",
            "Under California law, a customer who slipped and fell on an applesauce spill in a grocery store may be eligible for punitive damages if the store manager demonstrated malice by ignoring the spill, despite being informed twice of it, while he was eating dinner. A judge is unlikely to dismiss the claim outright. To justify punitive damages, a plaintiff must show that the defendant acted with a deliberate disregard for the potential harm their actions could cause, as well as that their actions were despicable. In this case, Jennifer Palmer can argue that store manager Paul Martin should have known the dangers of leaving the spill unattended, given that multiple customers had slipped and fallen on the same issue in the months prior. Palmer's claim that Martin's actions were despicable is not entirely convincing, but it's still a valid argument considering six slip-and-fall incidents occurred in 2009 and Martin failed to take necessary steps to ensure the store's safety.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, store employee Rich Wayne informed Martin about the applesauce spill, but Martin brushed him off, saying he was on dinner break. Fifteen minutes later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, notified Martin of the spill, and he responded in the same dismissive manner. By 5:30 pm, Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a serious back injury. Before Palmer's accident, five other slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D Markets in 2009. Now, Palmer is suing the store for both compensatory and punitive damages, and we're considering whether to file a motion to dismiss the punitive damage claim.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation that's not contract-related if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" The law defines malice as conduct intended to cause harm or, if not intentional, as \"despicable\" conduct committed with a \"willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" California Civil Code, section 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). Courts have characterized behavior as malicious when it shows a conscious disregard of the plaintiff's rights, especially when the defendant knows the probable consequences of their actions and deliberately fails to avoid them.

            "It's been nearly four years since I took a course in Islam at CBC, and one topic that still resonates with me is the notion that Islam is a hostile religion.  As I reflect on the years since 9/11, I've witnessed a shift in the media's portrayal of Islam, going from a hostile view to an extreme level of tolerance in America. It's striking to think that in 2001, it would have been unimaginable for a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, with his obvious Muslim background, to run for office.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad fascinates me, but it also raises questions. From what I've learned, I used to believe that Muhammad forced people to convert to Islam, conquering tribes and imposing his faith on them. However, the biography portrays Muhammad as a humble, misunderstood figure who lived a life of truth and performed miracles. The writers seem to be depicting him as a martyr, who didn't need to prove anything, but instead, people came to him seeking the truth in his teachings.\n\nI'm struck by the similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the 'miracles' of Muhammad. One example is when Muhammad took a small amount of food and miraculously multiplied it to feed forty men. This writing style makes me wonder if the authors are trying to portray Muhammad as a humble prophet who didn't need to prove himself, but rather lived in truth and performed miracles. It seems like they're downplaying the life and personhood of Jesus Christ, almost implying that Muhammad was somehow connected to Jesus.\n\nThe biography also contains many stories that seem to be about providing proof of 'witness' or how people 'on their own' converted to Islam. However, these stories are often based on second- or third-hand accounts, which makes me skeptical. While the authors intended to provide proof of the truth of the stories, I think it actually diminishes their credibility and makes them seem more suspicious.\n\nWhat bothers me most about this work is the way the authors try to elevate Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle. However, history paints a different picture of Muhammad's rise to power, and I can't help but wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true story behind his ascension to power.",
            "Looking back at the teachings of Jesus and the core beliefs he preached during his lifetime, it's striking how quickly they were abandoned in the development of Christian thought that followed.  As we examine the history in broad strokes, we can see a clear trend of Christianity veering further and further away from its roots.  However, today's world is witnessing a growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive shift.  Those who hold traditional views may resist any deviation from established teachings, but if history is any indicator, they may not be a large enough group to have a significant impact on the whole.  As time passes, a growing number of Christians will increasingly seek to uncover the original intent behind their faith, distinguishing between the core teachings of Jesus and the additional doctrines that were added over time.  This shift may take decades or even centuries, but ultimately, it's an irreversible trend:  A great reversal in Christian history is inevitable, as people seek to return to the true essence of the faith.  As this movement gains momentum, we can expect to see a progression back to the original form of Christianity, stripping away layer upon layer of doctrine, much like the clock ticking backward.  When this shift takes hold in the United States and Europe, we'll see a mass movement toward worshipping as Jesus taught, free from the additional ideas and dogma that have accumulated over the centuries.  The church as an institution will continue to play a vital role in guiding this process, but the resulting uniformity of belief and practice will be a far cry from the current diversity of Christendom.  As we look around the world, we can see that history is filled with examples of great reversals – for instance, how Christians were once persecuted and ostracized by the Roman Empire, only to become a dominant force within it.  Similarly, our country has undergone a remarkable transformation from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  A similar reversal is on the horizon for the Christian faith, as people seek to strip away the accumulated layers of doctrine and return to the source.  A crucial aspect of this process will be interpreting Jesus' words as metaphors, rather than taking them literally.  So, what happened to the original Jewish roots of Christianity?  If we dig deep enough into history, we find that Judaism was the sole foundation for the Christian faith.  By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., monotheism, the notion of divinely revealed scripture, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were already deeply ingrained in the Jewish faith.  However, the Jewish population was far from united, with various factions like the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common people each holding their own distinct views.",
            "In my opinion, The Jungle is a powerful portrayal of the inherent selfishness and self-centeredness that exists within human nature. People are often primarily driven by their own desires and ambitions, frequently prioritizing their own interests over those of others. This is a theme that The Jungle vividly illustrates. The novel's depiction of the factory owners and managers is a striking example of this. Their sole focus is on expanding and improving their businesses, without regard for the well-being of anyone or anything that gets in their way. As Upton Sinclair writes, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" This vivid description highlights the devastating consequences of their actions and shows that they care little for the people and animals affected by their pursuit of profit. The pollution caused by their factories and the filth from the animal pens surrounding Packingtown are just a couple of the many examples of the damage they inflict on others without a second thought.\n\nFurthermore, the novel reveals that the owners and managers have no qualms about exploiting their employees to make more money. They are willing to do whatever it takes to save a buck, as evident in the line \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" The employees are subjected to inhumane working conditions and are laid off without warning, with no assistance in finding new employment. During the time period in which the novel is set, there were few laws protecting workers' rights, allowing the owners and managers to act with impunity. The workers, who were essentially treated as slaves, were forced to endure terrible conditions in the factories and live in the midst of pollution, with no help or support available to them. The unions that were formed often did more harm than good, profiting off the struggles of the workers. The workers were trapped in this system, with no way out, making their situation all the more dire.",
            "Many authors use various techniques to elicit a specific emotional response from their readers. F. Scott Fitzgerald employs several of these methods in his novel The Great Gatsby. Some of his techniques are more effective than others. One of these is his use of word pairs to create a particular atmosphere around an idea. For instance, he combines adjectives and nouns in a way that doesn't usually fit to evoke a certain reaction in readers. Another technique is assigning meaning to a symbol and then using it to convey the same meaning. Fitzgerald frequently uses this latter technique with colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald develops a deeper meaning for colors, particularly white/gray and red/pink, then utilizes this meaning to create a specific impression of a subject.\n\nFitzgerald's use of white/gray to signify uniformity is a prime example. He establishes this meaning early in the novel by frequently pairing the two colors together. When introducing Daisy and Jordan, Fitzgerald notes that they are \"in white\" all the time – in fact, nearly everyone at Gatsby's party wears white: Nick sports \"white flannels,\" Tom sports a \"white shirt,\" and Catherine is described as \"powdered milky white.\" Conversely, the only time people aren't wearing white is when Nick is describing his initial impressions of Gatsby's party: \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors.\" Fitzgerald further solidifies these meanings by applying the colors to everyday objects: as Nick commutes to work, he navigates the \"white chasms of lower New York,\" the names of people at Gatsby's parties are listed as \"gray names\" on his schedule, and Catherine's apartment is \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\" – a sense of uniformity. He also uses the colors to describe ordinary or unimportant people or places: Jordan and Daisy share a \"white girlhood,\" there are \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" in the valley of ashes, the \"Italian child\" in the railroad is \"gray,\" and the dog-seller is \"a gray old man.\" \n\nOnce Fitzgerald has built up enough meaning for white/gray, he uses them to symbolize the unimportance or uniformity of certain subjects. He employs this color technique with Daisy first. After a lengthy period without significant use of either color, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster,\" signaling to readers that Daisy is becoming less of a character and more of a uniform element, something Gatsby desires and longs for (74). Fitzgerald employs this technique repeatedly around Daisy to create the impression that she is a more uniform addition, as seen in a \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" and another instance where she wears a \"white\" dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "San Diego County boasts an incredibly productive agricultural scene, largely due to its mild, sunny climate. A variety of crops thrive here, including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There's a strong demand for organic community-supported agriculture food in the area, with many local organizations featuring lengthy waiting lists for their products. Organic eggs and milk are also highly sought after, and some farms even offer tours of their operations, as well as opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities.\n\nOrganic farming not only fills a lucrative niche market but also offers numerous environmental benefits, such as enhanced biodiversity in plants and wildlife due to the absence of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming comes with its own set of challenges, including higher labor and management costs to control pests and weeds without using chemicals, greater losses compared to conventional methods, and reduced efficiency due to the smaller scale of operations. Additionally, other beneficial practices, such as planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, and invasive species removal, can also incur increased labor costs.\n\nThe land in question is a 160-acre property adjacent to the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California. The land features a mix of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, bordering the Cleveland National Forest. This area falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which currently considers over a hundred plant and animal species, many of which are endangered or declining. These species include the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher.\n\nFor centuries, this land was inhabited by Native Americans, followed by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. The property was part of an original homestead patent, likely used for grazing and/or wood production for many years.\n\nTo explore potential options for a small farmer, I selected a piece of property from a real estate website and researched government programs that could help mitigate costs and preserve wildlife-friendly operations. I used an organic farm in the same area as a model for what a farmer might aim to achieve on this land.",
            "Culture is a vital component in any negotiation, consisting of more than just what it signifies, but also what it represents. It is not a fixed entity, nor is it uniform across the board. Generalizations like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are far too broad and simplistic. Instead, it's more effective for a negotiator to grasp the significance of a culture in relation to the matter at hand and how it may impact the negotiation. When engaging with a foreign culture, we inevitably draw comparisons to our own, which can lead to misunderstandings.\n\nEfforts to comprehend a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to acknowledging its biases. Rather than judging or attempting to alter a culture, it's essential to accept it for what it is and work within its boundaries, especially in the context of negotiation. If you're in a weaker bargaining position, showing respect for traditions and beliefs can help bridge cultural gaps and advance the negotiation.\n\nIt's also worth noting that culture isn't confined to international or national differences. Companies within a country often develop their own distinct corporate culture, which can be just as complex as the broader societal culture. For instance, some corporations prioritize long working hours, while others encourage a more relaxed schedule. This is reflected in factors such as employee dress codes, communication styles, delegation of duties, and hiring practices. The diversity of corporate culture within a country, even within the same company, is a testament to the multifaceted nature of societal culture.\n\nUnderstanding values is equally crucial, as they provide the underlying motivations for a culture. If a culture values saving face or communal harmony, a negotiator will be hesitant to publicly embarrass their company or superior to achieve success. Conversely, if a culture prioritizes aggressive bargaining, a negotiator may be more inclined to push for a hard-driven deal. By taking these generalities into account before the negotiation, a negotiator can better prepare themselves for the challenges ahead. Nonetheless, it's also essential to develop a personal understanding of one's opponent to make the negotiation effective.",
            "The notion that God does not exist has been a notion that has been debated for centuries, and is famously stated in the Christian Bible as \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This belief is also shared by the philosopher Thomas Aquinas, and his argument for the existence of God is often compared to that of St. Anselm. Since both authors are arguing for the same concept of God, we'll assume they're both correct in their belief for the sake of this analysis. We'll compare their arguments, keeping in mind that their arguments are in defense of the God of the Bible. \n\nWhile both Anselm and Aquinas make valid points, their arguments lack a complete basis for belief in God. To demonstrate this, let's first look at Anselm's argument. Anselm suggests that we can find proof of God within ourselves. He believes that because God exists within our understanding, we can't truly conceive of his nonexistence. Anselm is saying that we don't need to look beyond our own minds to understand the truth about God, and that the existence of God can be found to be true simply by examining what we inherently know to be true within our own minds. This idea of accepting something without irrefutable evidence is referred to as faith in Christian texts.\n\nThis perspective is distinct from that of Aquinas, who believes that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, without any need for faith. This idea would be beneficial for Christian evangelism, as it would allow for the recruitment of new converts without requiring them to believe in something that can't be proven. Aquinas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. He demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God, much like knowing the features and existence of a missing puzzle piece without actually seeing it.",
            "About 2500 years back, a prince who would one day become known as the Buddha was born in either the fourth or fifth century BCE. Throughout his lifetime, he rejected worldly life and achieved a profound understanding, leading to the development of Buddhism. The most traditional branch of this faith is Theravada Buddhism, and it has undergone significant changes over the centuries. This is evident in various aspects of the religion, such as the water-cutting ceremony in Sri Lanka, where both monks and laypeople participate. This event has spiritual significance, despite the fact that Buddha never taught about such celebrations. These variations range from surface-level customs to the fundamental principles of the faith. The Theravada Buddhist community, from both the monastic and lay perspectives, has had to adapt its core teachings over time due to both internal and external forces, some of which are hostile, while others are benevolent.\n\nIt's essential to understand the terms we'll be using to discuss this topic. An internal force refers to any influence that comes from within the Buddhist community, regardless of the individual's monastic status. External forces, on the other hand, come from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any influence that aims to harm or damage the Buddhist community, often rooted in a negative perception of Buddhism. In contrast, a benign force is one that doesn't intend to harm or help the community, although it may inadvertently do so. These definitions will be used repeatedly throughout our discussion.\n\nLet's begin by exploring the core principles of Theravada Buddhism. At the heart of the faith lies the Triple Gem, comprising the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is primarily made up of the Tripitaka, a collection of Buddhist scriptures divided into three baskets: the Sutta Pitaka, the Vinaya Pitaka, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka. The Sutta Pitaka contains the teachings and discourses, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka deals with the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. Key concepts include Anatta (no permanent self), Dukkha (inherent suffering in life), and Anicca (impermanence of everything). By recognizing these principles, one can break free from Sansara, the cycle of birth and death, which is a continuous process. Along with Sansara, one can also overcome lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion) by achieving enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka provides rules for laypeople, such as the five precepts (not killing, lying, stealing, misbehaving sexually, or taking intoxicants). Monks, on the other hand, have more comprehensive guidelines to follow. The four noble truths are the fundamental principles of Buddhism, including the truth that life is suffering, that attachment causes suffering, and that suffering can be overcome.",
            "One notable example of a long-standing rivalry between two nations is that of the United States and Mexico, which lasted for an impressive 57 years, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts, 2000, p. 145).  The peak of this rivalry occurred during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States ultimately emerged victorious, securing Texas and the American Southwest as part of its territory.  Although many conflicts arose between the two nations, the tension finally began to subside just before the outbreak of World War I. \n\nThis rivalry, fueled by differences in values, culture, and economic interests, is not unique to the United States and Mexico. Many nations sharing a border experience similar clashes of interests, leading to the development of rival positions. The United States and Mexico are a prime example of this phenomenon, much like other enduring rivalries between neighboring countries.  As noted by David M. Pletcher (1977), \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41).  The proximity of these nations to the United States contributed to their rivalry, whereas other Latin American countries have historically enjoyed more positive relations with the United States.\n\nReligious differences also played a significant role in straining relations between the two nations, a common issue that has plagued many countries throughout history (Frahm, 2001, p. 86).  If Americans were opposed to fascism and communism in the 20th century, they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy in the 18th and 19th centuries.  In this case, the ideological struggle was not solely based on political systems but also on the distinct religious preferences of the United States and Mexico. This distrust stemmed from the legacy of distrust between the English and Spanish, which their former colonial rulers had instilled in them. This inherited animosity significantly hindered the establishment of friendly relations between the two nations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) documented 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States during the 57-year rivalry period. The majority of these disputes centered on territorial issues, including border raids from Mexican territory and other frontier problems. Border bandits and outlaws from American border towns posed significant challenges, which were eventually addressed when both countries strengthened their border security (Schmitt, 1974, p. 97).\n\nAs Schmitt (1974) noted, the rivalry began to dissipate as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the United States (p. 109) and American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico (p. 110) in the later 19th century.",
            "It's been 15 years since my life took an unexpected turn due to an illness I never knew existed. At the time, I was working as a nurse, a career choice that provided a sense of security and stability I desperately craved as a child. The mantra I grew up with was that I would always be able to find employment, as people would always get sick, and that notion drove me to pursue nursing over my true passions for science and journalism.\n\nFast forward to my current reality: I'm 46, single, and living on Social Security Disability benefits after 15 years. I've barely managed to scrape by, and every day feels like a struggle to maintain my sense of security, safety, and self-worth. Despite my best efforts, nothing is certain anymore, but one thing remains true – I couldn't have made it this far without the unwavering support of my family and a few loyal friends. In times of real crisis, you don't feel invincible, and it's in those moments that you come to realize just how strong you truly are.\n\nMy point is that life is unpredictable, and we're all bound to face emergencies, big or small. No matter how well-prepared we are, some challenges are simply too great to overcome alone.\n\nWhile I agree that we should be more self-sufficient, I firmly believe that Americans should focus on rebuilding our sense of community and trust in one another. Instead of turning to the government for all our needs, we should strive to help each other and ask for assistance when necessary. This isn't about abandoning our individual strength, but rather recognizing that true resilience lies in our collective ability to support one another.\n\nWhen we talk about the \"rugged individualism\" that built this country, we often forget that our ancestors relied on compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources to get through tough times. The pioneers who crossed the American West didn't do it alone; they relied on each other for survival.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I've taken steps to prepare for emergencies – I have a disaster kit, first aid supplies, and other essentials. If you have the means, consider investing in a small farm or a wood stove. However, while you're at it, take the time to get to know your neighbors and build a support network. It's in these relationships that we'll find true strength and resilience.",
            "The question of why organisms evolve in a particular manner has long puzzled scientists, with some constraints and influences shaping the direction of evolutionary change. Although the renowned biologist D'Arcy Thompson noted in 1917 that \"the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,\" the same challenge remains today. Recent advances in mathematical modeling have been applied to various aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis, encompassing both ontogeny and phylogeny (as seen in Raup and Stanley's 1981 study). Our current research focuses on combining mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum with experimental studies to understand the mechanisms driving evolutionary-developmental change. By analyzing X-radiographic images of Prunum species and using the software program CerioShell, we can identify quantitative parameters that allow us to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters are then used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. Our findings are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies to gain a deeper understanding of macroevolutionary events within this clade.\n\nA shell can be visualized as a tube that traverses 360 degrees of space over time. The whorls, or revolutions of the coiled shell, spiral around an imaginary central axis known as the columella, which runs through the central column of the shell. The speed at which whorls expand can vary, and the continuous line separating each whorl is referred to as a suture. In most shells, the last whorl (the body whorl) is the largest. The spire consists of all the whorls except the last, while the apex is the tip of the spire, and the opposite end is the base. The animal exits its shell through the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from various angles, including apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives (with the typical orientation being the apertural view, where the aperture faces the viewer, and the apex points upwards). A method for counting whorls involves examining the shell from the apical view, identifying the first suture, and then drawing a line to divide the shell into two parts. Whorls are counted from this line, with estimates made to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a series of apertures that move through time and space as the animal builds its shell. By tracking the path of the aperture using coordinates of the center of each whorl's aperture and the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture, we can graphically and mathematically represent this trajectory. Once a mathematical formulation is established, we can manipulate parameters and modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "Indonesia's record on neonatal and infant mortality has remained stagnant for a decade, with the country struggling to meet its Millennium Development Goals for child and maternal health by 2015.  While Indonesia has made progress in certain areas, such as water and sanitation, the pace of improvement in child and maternal health is alarmingly slow.  To address these shortcomings, it's essential to strengthen the overall health system rather than relying solely on program-specific interventions.\n\nOne area of improvement is the number of births attended by skilled healthcare workers, which now stands at 72%.  However, this figure includes traditional workers like midwives who may not be equipped to handle complicated pregnancies, leading to a significant number of maternal deaths due to hemorrhage.  This highlights the limitations of this metric and the need for further action.  Additionally, the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five treated by a healthcare professional has declined, and postnatal care remains a concern, with low rates reported across the country.\n\nCesarian-section rates are also a cause for concern, averaging around 4% nationwide, with a significant disparity between urban and rural areas.  The c-section rate is 7% in urban settings, compared to just 2% in rural areas, underscoring the issue of unequal access to healthcare services.  Furthermore, the gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles is substantial, with a 27% difference in healthcare access.  This indicates that the poor face significant barriers to accessing healthcare services, likely due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nTo move forward and improve neonatal and maternal care indicators, the primary question is whether to focus on program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system.  While targeted programs may seem attractive for their focus and manageability, they also have drawbacks.  One major concern is the potential for resource diversion, as significant investments in one area can lead to reduced funding and human resources for other critical areas.  Additionally, running multiple parallel programs can result in duplication and inefficiency, increasing the administrative burden.",
            "When it comes to Victorian literature, most people would expect novels that delve deeply into the intricacies of the aristocracy and the societal norms of the time.  However, there are two novels that stand out from the rest: Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both of these stories feature an air of mystery and an unconventional flair that sets them apart from their contemporaries, adding depth and complexity to the characters and their motivations. \n\nThe unsettling and baffling ideas that swirl in the protagonist's mind are a hallmark of these novels.  In the case of Oliver Twist, the lines between reality and fantasy are often blurred, as seen in this passage: \"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind.  He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.\" (Dickens, 220)\n\nIn Oliver Twist, these inexplicable events often serve to unveil the protagonist's inner turmoil, his pain, and his growing awareness of the harsh realities surrounding him.  The vivid recollection of the shooting in chapter 28, for instance, is a dreamlike experience that Oliver undergoes as he struggles to find help, leaving the reader questioning whose fate it was that brought about his misfortune.  The shooting seems to overwhelm Oliver, numbing his senses, as he is borne away by an unseen force, his pain now constant and linked to fear rather than surprise.  This highlights the notion that Oliver has no control over his life, and that he is unable to take charge of even the most critical events, including the one that almost cost him his life.  This reinforced sense of defeat in Oliver suggests that he has become worn down by the circumstances of his life, and that he has lost the will to resist.\n\nIn a similar vein, Wuthering Heights is characterized by a sense of timelessness, where days blend together with the passing of night and the darkness that it brings.  The days seem to melt away, leaving only a sense of dread and the fleeting hours that tick by.  As the protagonist struggles to come to terms with their circumstances, they are left with a sense of disorientation and confusion.",
            "It's a story I still remember vividly from a few years ago when I worked in an after-school program, helping elementary-age students with their studies. I made it my mission to assist them in whichever subject they struggled with, but my strengths lay in English and reading. One of the instructors approached me about working with a young boy named Adrian, who was having a tough time reading. What struck me was that he had an unusual issue - he could pronounce certain letters perfectly, while others were way off. It was a real puzzle. Given his Latino background, I figured he might have some language barriers, but he spoke perfect English. Nevertheless, we struggled to make progress until I met his mother, who only spoke Spanish. I managed to communicate with her through my limited Spanish skills, but it dawned on me that something wasn't quite right - Adrian could read, but he was struggling with the English alphabet. I hope he's doing better now, but I still remember that moment like it was yesterday.\n\nI share this story to highlight a pressing issue in schools, particularly in California - the language barrier. It's not always as apparent as we think, even for students who speak perfect English. Reading can still be a significant obstacle. It's clear that this problem exists, so what can we do about it? For a student like Adrian, the solution was straightforward: extra tutoring in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for many students who barely speak English, the problem is much more complex.\n\nI believe there's no one-size-fits-all solution. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes - none of these approaches, on its own, will solve this issue. The key lies in combining all of these methods.\n\nFirstly, the dual language system is an excellent idea, not just for students whose first language is Spanish, but for all children. Research shows that children in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. Some people are skeptical, fearing it's a waste of resources or that most students won't benefit. That's just not true. If we implemented these programs as the norm, rather than the exception, all children would benefit from them. But how can we make this work? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? That's unrealistic and unreasonable. Instead, we could have specialized aids, tutors, or whatever you want to call them, who are bilingual.",
            "For most of us, the concept of something greater than ourselves becomes apparent from a young age. Whether we're learning about it in Sunday school, temple, or through self-discovery, our understanding of spirituality evolves over time. Some of us cling to the faith passed down by our parents, while others reject it entirely, convinced that our personal universe is all that exists. Many of us switch between different value systems, trying to find our place in the grand scheme of things. This search for meaning and purpose drives us to explore our own unique perspectives on spirituality, seeking answers in the darkness to guide us toward the light.\n\nAs I sat on the porch with my dad on that rainy day, I asked him about his favorite bird. \"A cardinal,\" he replied, gazing out into the rain. His thin frame and sparse hair spoke of a difficult journey he had been on, and his distant stare seemed to hold a mix of searching and remembering. I felt a deep sense of unease, knowing that I wouldn't be able to talk to him about how much I would miss him when he was gone. So I hugged him, sat back down, and joined him in watching the rain. My father eventually passed away just a few months later, on my 22nd birthday. The chemotherapy and radiation had prolonged his suffering, but I couldn't help but wonder if it was worth it. If God existed, I thought, he seemed to be ignoring me. I stopped praying, not wanting to waste my words on a higher power that didn't seem to be listening. Instead, I chose to remember my father for who he was, not for how he died.\n\nI decided not to watch him pass away, unable to bear the thought of witnessing the end of the person who brought me into this world. I knew my father would have wanted me to remember him by his life, not his death. I curled up in a ball for three days, waiting for the news, but no one even called me.",
            "You might consider the term \"Gothic Novel\" to be something of a paradox, combining as it does the old and the new. As Ian Watt notes, it's an oxymoron that brings to mind the concept of \"old-new.\" This genre has been both criticized and praised, with some viewing it as lacking depth and others seeing it as evoking a sense of the \"terrible sublime\" (Burke). The origins of the Gothic Novel date back to Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, which drew on both ancient and modern romance elements to create a new style of storytelling. By combining old theatrical elements with the modern novel's narrative structure, Walpole was able to craft a unique literary experience that he referred to as \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre often incorporates elements from medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions, despite the word \"gothic\" having already been associated with a range of styles, time periods, and people at the time of The Castle of Otranto's publication.\n\nIn the context of the Gothic Novel, the concept of chivalry plays a significant role. The medieval ideals of chivalry, which involved training a knight to be brave, honorable, and competent, are both preserved and transformed in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry was particularly important to Gothic writers like Walpole, who saw it as a representation of the ideal knight and the perceived lack of that ideal in their contemporary society. By romanticizing the chivalric past and idealizing it, Gothic writers like Walpole aimed to improve the present. When writing The Castle of Otranto, Walpole was living in a time of political turmoil and, possibly due to the unfair accusations he faced, he may have felt that the supposed moral and innate goodness of people in the gothic era had been lost in the society of his time. This sentiment is evident in characters like Frederic, who embodies many chivalric traits, including being a prince, having suffered, and being described in a way that exaggerates the traditional images of a gallant and courteous knight, introducing the Gothic trope of excess (Walpole 66).",
            "In the world of business, there's a crucial behind-the-scenes process that keeps everything running smoothly from production to delivery: supply chain management. This term was coined by Keith Oliver in 1982, a consultant who laid out the blueprint for planning, implementing, and controlling the entire supply chain to meet customer needs efficiently. At its core, supply chain management is a six-step process that involves production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information management. These key elements are the foundation upon which companies build their customer service strategies.\n\nThe first step in the supply chain process is production, the backbone of the entire operation. It's all about creating a plan for when, why, where, and how products will be made. To ensure production meets customer demands, managers must understand what customers want, which can be determined by analyzing market trends. Once the market is analyzed, managers can decide what products to produce and how many. The next step is choosing the best location for production, taking into account factors like volume, quality, and meeting customer expectations.\n\nA seamless production process is crucial, and every detail counts. If not planned correctly, it can lead to significant losses of time and money in the long run. I've seen this firsthand in my previous roles at retail giants like Walmart and Target. Both companies have meticulous processes in place, from employee uniform design to receiving shipments. Having a clear plan in place ensures a smooth operation without confusion or miscommunication.\n\nThe second key element of supply chain management is supply, which involves strategic decisions about a company's core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. A company may have multiple divisions producing a single product, each with its own equipment, workers, and specialties. Managers must decide which division is best suited for each process and may opt to outsource work to other companies to achieve velocity – quality, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness. By making informed decisions about supply, companies can meet customer needs efficiently and stay ahead of the competition.",
            "Hitler is alive in Burma, or so a mysterious message suggests. Movie star Ellen Page, known for her role in Juno, stands alone on a street corner, holding a disturbing sign with a Sharpie-written message. Burma, now known as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian country under the iron-fisted control of a military junta that seized power in 1962 through a violent coup d'état. In 2007, a wave of street protests shook the nation, fueled by a decade-long drought of public demonstrations. Led by thousands of Burmese monks, these protests earned the nickname \"The Saffron Revolution\" due to the color of their robes. However, the government's initial tolerance for the peaceful gatherings soon turned into brutal suppression, with the military clashing with the monks and invading monasteries across the country. Foreign journalists were arrested and imprisoned, and a Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, was tragically killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for documenting a protest.\n\nThis is just one example of a long history of governments cracking down on dissent and maintaining absolute control over their citizens. From ancient Rome's emperors claiming divine right to rule to Japan's emperors being believed to be gods, the desire for authoritarianism has been a timeless human trait. Even today, leaders like our current president, George W. Bush, have been known to consult with influential figures like Ted Haggard, a leader within the Republican Party.\n\nNotable examples of such brutal suppression include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students gathered to challenge the Chinese government's authoritarian rule. The death toll in this incident varies widely, with official reports ranging from 200 to 300 dead, while the Chinese Red Cross estimates between 2,000 and 3,000 fatalities. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, backed by the Rwandan government, systematically killed Tutsis and political moderates, is another extreme example. The Nazi regime's \"Third Reich,\" where anyone of Jewish descent was rounded up and killed, is yet another haunting example of the devastating consequences of unchecked authoritarianism.",
            "Duke Ellington's lasting impact on jazz is largely due to his remarkable career span and the way he harnessed his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Though he often played a subtle role on the piano, as a composer Ellington excelled at crafting intricate and rich pieces that showcased the unique talents of each band member. He created an environment where soloists could freely improvise, while writing tightly orchestrated passages that accentuated the distinctive style of specific band members, ultimately uniting the entire orchestra in a cohesive sound. This mastery of the individual players' voices and how they blended together allowed Ellington to pen some of the most groundbreaking and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\n\nNotably, the Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's innovative use of the human voice as an instrument, exemplified in his early work Creole Love Call. In this piece, he seamlessly integrated voice with instrumental textures without the constraint of lyrics. The 12-bar blues, a genre staple, features six distinct choruses that demonstrate Ellington's ability to complement the style of his soloists. The various choruses showcase a range of instrumental colors, including a muted trumpet solo, a soaring clarinet solo, and a syncopated piano phrase, all of which come together to create a rich tapestry of sound.\n\nHot and Bothered, recorded a year later, is a prime example of Ellington's skill at blending tight orchestration with a keen ear for tone color. In this piece, the call and response between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing highlights the versatility of the human voice as a musical instrument. The same approach is evident in It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), where Ellington masterfully utilizes the muted trombone of Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton to introduce the melody, demonstrating his ability to coax unique sounds from his musicians.",
            "There was this nagging void within her that she just couldn't shake. It started when she was 14, and by 17, it was still there, only now she was determined that she wanted someone, not just anything, to fill this emptiness. However, she found herself uninterested in any of the boys around her. Many had tried to woo her, but none had caught her attention. She often wondered what could be the reason behind this peculiar phenomenon, trying to come up with a theory, but nothing seemed convincing enough. She continued to live her life, constantly questioning her desires.\n\nHer home life was usually pretty chill. Her parents were laid-back and calm, rarely arguing with each other or with her. The only thing they ever disagreed on was her desire for independence and her free-spirited nature. As the daughter of a calm couple, she brought a lot of energy and personality to the table, making her pretty likable despite being a nice person.\n\nBut today was not a typical day. As she walked from room to room, searching for inspiration, she heard a sudden scream from the kitchen, followed by her mom's voice. She rushed into the room, starting to panic, and frantically asked, \"Mom! What's wrong?\" She saw her mom lying on the ground, in obvious pain, saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. Her daughter rushed to her side and put a hand on her to help. \"Ouch... sweetie, I need you to take me to the hospital.\" The words were rushed and strained, and her daughter could tell she was in a lot of pain. \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where to pick you up.\" Her mom directed her hands, and in that moment, her daughter was grateful that she had taken self-defense classes. She carried her mom to the car, got her settled in the back, and drove.\n\nThe hospital was filled with the smell of disinfectant and the eerie feeling of sickness, but her daughter's mind was focused on helping her mom. She quickly got her mom into a bed and started calling for medical help. A few worried faces gathered around, and someone quickly brought in a rolling bed to move her mom to a treatment area. The doctors took her in for examination, leaving her daughter to sit and worry.\n\nIt turned out that her mom had fallen off a step stool while trying to grab a vase from a high cabinet.",
            "This study aimed to investigate the link between adherence to the \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet) and the risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as stroke mortality. A modified version of the Med diet, called the \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet\", was used in the study. The aMed diet emphasizes higher consumption of plant foods like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, along with monounsaturated fats and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol intake is also allowed.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that following a Med diet can reduce the risk of total and cardiovascular mortality. In fact, one intervention trial found that the Med diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and lowering cholesterol levels in obese individuals. However, previous studies have not focused on the specific relationship between the Med diet and stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis study followed a large group of 74,886 female nurses, aged 38 to 63, who were part of the Nurses' Health Study. The study spanned 20 years, from 1984 to 2004, and involved six assessments of the aMed diet score using self-reported food frequency questionnaires. An impressive 95% of the nurses continued to participate throughout the study period. The accuracy of the questionnaires was validated through medical records, hospital records, and death certificates.\n\nThe researchers calculated cumulative averages of the aMed score over the 20-year period to account for individual variation and better represent long-term dietary intake. They also adjusted for potential confounders like age, smoking status, body mass index, menopausal status, and physical activity. Cox proportional-hazard modeling was used to analyze the association between aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke.\n\nThe results showed that greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of heart disease and stroke in women. Over the 20-year follow-up period, 2,391 cases of CHD, 1,763 cases of stroke, and 1,077 cardiovascular disease deaths were recorded. Women in the top aMed quintile had a significantly lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile, with a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "We're still feeling the effects of the 2007 financial crisis, with high unemployment rates and a struggling housing market. The question on everyone's mind is: how did this happen and how can we prevent it from happening again? In a nutshell, the crisis was caused by reckless and uninformed political decisions that pushed banks to make sub-prime loans into a fragile financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were forced to back and repack these mortgages into complex financial instruments. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were left with a huge shortfall, which they tried to shift onto the repackaged mortgages they had sold, ultimately dragging the entire economy down.\n\nThe roots of the crisis date back to the 1999 Clinton administration, when the President aimed to boost his popularity by easing lending restrictions. This laid the groundwork for the sub-prime crisis that would follow seven years later. Steven Holmes, a New York Times journalist, reported in 1999 that Fannie Mae was under pressure from the Clinton administration and its shareholders to maintain its rapid growth in profits. Holmes accurately predicted the consequences of these actions: \"The government-subsidized corporation may struggle in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" As we now know, ill-conceived lending led to a catastrophic economic meltdown.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the economic downturn, including a complex and volatile mortgage structure. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were widely used in the years leading up to the crisis, linking various sectors of the economy to the housing market. This led to U.S. households and financial markets taking on excessive debt in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nThe housing bubble ultimately burst, and the financial institutions that had purchased these mortgage-backed securities were left reeling. In 2007, the top five U.S. investment banks reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt, accounting for about 30% of the U.S. GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at a steep discount, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subject to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "When it comes to writing, there's a delicate balance between showing and telling – and one of these elements can make or break your story. Exposition, that is, the part of your narrative where you reveal information about your characters, settings, and plot, can be a double-edged sword. On one hand, it's necessary to provide context and background for your readers. On the other hand, too much exposition can put them to sleep or, worse, make them click the \"Back\" button.\n\nAs any seasoned writer knows, the rule \"Show, don't tell\" is a golden one. However, even experienced authors like Dr. Merlin still find themselves trapped in lengthy passages of exposition, often because it's the easy way out. It's all too tempting to dump a character's entire history onto the page, thinking it will get the story moving faster. But the truth is, this approach can lead to a dull, lifeless narrative.\n\nExposition is essentially telling the audience what happened, rather than showing them through action, dialogue, and descriptive language. In film, it's the awkward information dump where a character explains a crucial plot point to another; in fiction, it's the author doing the telling. Imagine reading a story where the protagonist meets her love interest, gets married, and witnesses their murder in a few short paragraphs. It's dry, unengaging, and doesn't allow the reader to invest in the characters or their relationships.\n\nThe key is to add meat to the bones of your story. Take the example of a character's background: instead of listing off their entire history, show it through their speech, mannerisms, and actions. This way, the reader can infer their personality, values, and motivations, making their eventual fate more impactful. When done well, exposition becomes a subtle, nuanced way to reveal character, setting, and plot, rather than a clunky info dump.\n\nSo, how can you strike a balance? The next time you're tempted to dump a character's backstory or a lengthy explanation, ask yourself: can it be shown through action, dialogue, or descriptive language instead? Remember, the goal is to engage your reader, not to overwhelm them with too much information at once. By showing, not telling, you'll create a richer, more immersive story that will leave your readers wanting more.",
            "I recently watched two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first one I tuned in to was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011), and it was live. The lead story covered a disturbing incident in Ashley, Ohio, where a man named Shad Hostettler had stabbed his wife. They aired his mug shot, and he appeared to be a menacing figure. The news anchors devoted only a couple of minutes to this developing story, which I think was sufficient. The details they shared were limited to the fact that the victim had been stabbed multiple times and that Hostettler had been taken into custody.\n\nThe second story that caught my attention was about an early morning shooting that had occurred in the Sharon Woods area. An 18-year-old man named Travis Buyers had been critically injured, and no suspects or arrests had been made at the time. The SWAT team was investigating the crime scene. I felt that this story was glossed over, and I suspect that it might have been due to the fact that the victim was a minority. This observation is not new to me, as I've noticed for years that minorities often receive less media attention when they're victims of crime. In contrast, when a white person is involved in a similar situation, the media tends to sensationalize it.\n\nThe next story that aired was about a gunshot hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. The news team provided some details about the location where the incident was believed to have occurred, and they mentioned that the bullet was a .22 caliber from a rifle. Crime-Stoppers were offering a $5,000 reward for any information that could lead to the arrest of the perpetrator.\n\nThe forecast for the upcoming weekend was also covered, with the news team predicting rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon. The temperature was expected to remain in the mid-to-low 80s. They kept this segment relatively short, likely as a teaser to keep viewers tuned in.\n\nThe news also featured a story about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The suspect was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. He was estimated to be around 6 feet tall and 150 pounds. I found it interesting that they emphasized his dark skin tone and the fact that he wore a hoodie.\n\nAnother story that aired was about a man named Rene Rodriguez, who had been convicted of being a Texas-based marijuana kingpin. He had been involved in a conspiracy to distribute large quantities of marijuana to Ohio from Texas. I noticed that instead of stating his sentence, they mentioned that he had been given 300 months in prison. I'm not sure what their reasoning was behind this, whether they thought it sounded more severe or not. Additionally, they mentioned that he was Hispanic, which I didn't think was particularly relevant to the story.",
            "There's a profound connection between brothers, a bond that's unbreakable and virtually unshakeable. This bond is made up of a complex mix of emotions, including love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty. Brothers have a unique understanding of each other, one that eclipses the bond they share with anyone else. When they look at their brother, they see a reflection of themselves, and it's in those moments of intense desperation that the true nature of this bond is revealed, no matter how good or evil it may be. The consequences of these emotions are significant, and confronting them can be a daunting task. When one brother can look into the eyes of his sibling and see their own reflection staring back, they gain a deeper understanding of their own character, not as others see them, but as they truly are. In the end, it's their actions and the consequences that follow that define their true character. \n\nThis theme is a central focus of James Hurst's short story \"The Scarlet Ibis.\" The tale of two brothers is a powerful exploration of the emotions that arise from this unique bond. As they venture into the lush, vivid landscape, their bond is put to the test, culminating in a heart-wrenching climax that leaves only one brother alive. The story delves into the complexities of the protagonist's character, Doodle, and his relationship with his brother, as well as the narrator's point of view, which offers a glimpse into the protagonist's inner world and how it influences his actions.\n\nPride is the dominant force driving the protagonist's actions throughout the story. From their initial outing to their final, fateful excursion, he feels a deep-seated resentment towards Doodle. The young boy had envisioned a brother who could share in his passions and adventures, like exploring the swamp or racing to Horsehead Landing. However, Doodle's fragile health made it impossible for him to participate in such activities, crushing the protagonist's dreams. The protagonist even harbors anger towards Doodle, as evidenced by his dark thoughts about suffocating the child. Yet, when Doodle smiles at him, his anger melts, revealing a deep-seated love for his brother. This nuanced portrayal of the protagonist's emotions highlights the complexity of the bond between brothers and the consequences that arise from it.",
            "The human brain - it's a complex, innovative information-processing system. As technology has advanced from primitive to modern, so too have the metaphors used to describe the brain. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, then to papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. However, it's essential to keep in mind that these metaphors, while useful, have their limitations and can lead to misconceptions about how the brain works.\n\nInformation processing begins with sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or light into electrical signals. This sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the brain's algorithms, both through bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, the brain's bottom-up processing puts together basic information like color, orientation, and the object's borders to conclude that you're seeing a box. Meanwhile, top-down processing uses previous decisions to speed up your recognition of the box, allowing you to identify it as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole.\n\nOnce information is processed, an attention filter determines its importance and decides which cognitive processes it should be made available to. Although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might focus on your name even when spoken in a noisy room. There are multiple stages of processing, and the results are modulated by attention repeatedly.\n\nFor the brain to process information, it first needs to be stored. There are various types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. Information is initially encoded, with different types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimulus. For example, verbal input can be encoded based on its appearance, sound, or meaning. Once stored, information must be maintained. Studies suggest that working memory, which holds information for around 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through specific neurons for a short period. Long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain proteins.\n\nThere are numerous models of how knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on memory retrieval, others on computer science, and others on neurophysiology. The semantic network model, for instance, proposes that concepts are represented by nodes, linked by their relatedness. In this model, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley critiques the looming dangers of technology and the capitalistic system that fuels it in his dystopian novel, Brave New World. In this futuristic society, people prioritize community over individuality and are conditioned from birth to pursue instant gratification above all else. The citizens are essentially pawns in a larger game, confined to a single ideology dictated by the World Controller. From a Marxist perspective, Huxley's work appears to be a commentary on the flaws of the emerging economy during his time.\n\nThe novel satirizes capitalism through the concept of false consciousness, a Marxist idea where the common people are denied knowledge of their true economic relationships with other classes, instead being consumed by their own self-interest. This is achieved through the conditioning of the population, where hypnopædia reinforces the drive to consume, spend, and indulge. The lower classes, represented by Deltas and Gammas, lack genuine autonomy, while the upper classes, like Alphas and Betas, are often oblivious to the manipulation, with few characters like Bernard questioning their place in society.\n\nHuxley's portrayal of relationships in Brave New World is also notable for its superficiality. Interactions between individuals are lacking in depth, and even among major characters, there is a sense of emptiness. This might suggest that the rise of technology and capitalism has stripped humans of their free will and emotional expression. Love and intense emotions are absent, replaced by shallow comments about physical appearance and superficial interactions.\n\nThe characters' complacency with their social status in the hierarchy indicates the socioeconomic effects of capitalism, where people are conditioned to believe in their superiority as long as they conform to societal norms. This phenomenon is reminiscent of Marxist theory on the proletariat, where individuals are misled into thinking they are better off than others as long as they continue to consume, obey, and conform to the expectations of their peers.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for almost three years now, which is equivalent to five semesters. For many, including myself, navigating the campus can be a challenge. My freshman year was spent in an East Halls dorm room, situated on the far eastern edge of campus – excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. The commute from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in areas like Willard building, near the center of campus, often took about 25 minutes on foot, especially during inclement weather. I recently spoke to an alumnus who's not much older than me, and they shared an interesting fact: not long ago, the East Halls dorms were separated from the rest of the university by vast tracts of unused land. Today, that empty space has been filled with sports fields, new buildings like the Creamery and health services building, and surrounded by apartments. As our campus expands, getting from one place to another is becoming increasingly difficult. So, what's the best solution to this problem of mobility? In my opinion, the answer is clear: the bicycle. However, the bike alone won't solve anything; students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be designed with the needs of bicyclists in mind.\n\nI recently had a conversation with a friend who took up bicycling again after a few-year hiatus. He said, \"Bikes are great; for a few years, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" Besides being great for your physical health, bicycling is the most efficient mode of transportation. With a bowl of oatmeal and some physical exertion, you can cover 30 miles or more. As an off-campus resident, I live just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. Buying a bike was the smartest decision I made this year. With classes in Thomas building, which is a twenty-five-minute walk from my house, riding a bike can cut that time down to just 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only issue is that Pollock Road is the most direct route to Thomas building, but it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or not. There are pros to walking as well, but personally, I'm too busy to walk. If I didn't have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day, which is over two and a half hours every week. When you add up all the other time I'd spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and so on, that's more time than I can spare."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum.

            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",

To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1).

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "As I continue to pursue my education in social work, I'm committed to a career path that will allow me to help vulnerable children who have been abused or neglected, as well as provide support for struggling families. Some key values that I aim to bring to the social work field include service, respect, integrity, and a commitment to building strong relationships between individuals and communities. These values aren't just essential for social workers; they're also deeply personal to me. My passion for helping others has always been strong, but I wasn't initially sure which career path to follow. Throughout my high school and college years, I witnessed many people struggling with their problems, and some turned to coping mechanisms that weren't ideal. This motivated me to earn a Bachelor's degree in Psychology, and after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I decided to take a break to explore my options. However, a pivotal experience that summer changed my career trajectory. I visited a friend who was hosting a 16-year-old boy who was fleeing his abusive parents. The next day, I learned he had called the police to report the situation. I drove to his parents' house, where I spoke with the police about my concerns and my background in Psychology. I encouraged them to investigate the situation further, and later, I had a conversation with the parents, who seemed evasive and made excuses for their son's actions. This experience made me realize the importance of social work and my desire to help children and families in similar situations.\n\nAnother value that I hold dear is social justice. As a society, we often claim to value individuality, but in reality, we often strive to conform to societal norms rather than embracing our unique qualities. I'm an individual, and I refuse to be limited by expectations of what's considered \"normal.\" Throughout my time in high school and college, I spoke out against social injustice whenever I could – from expressing my individuality through my hair and clothing choices to advocating for the rights of marginalized groups. I believe in social justice, and I'll continue to stand up against injustice in all its forms.\n\nMy experiences have taught me the importance of having a strong sense of purpose, and I'm eager to dedicate my career to making a positive impact in the lives of those who need it most. By staying true to my values of service, respect, integrity, and social justice, I aim to become a compassionate and effective social worker who can make a real difference in the lives of others.",
            "This paper investigates the interplay between the Biological and Sociocultural models in the context of insomnia. The biological model centers on the genetic factors inherited by an individual, as well as the medical aspects of their overall health. In contrast, the Sociocultural model examines the environmental influences that shape our understanding of insomnia, including factors such as race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review delves into these models, exploring key research studies that shed light on each model and their significance in explaining insomnia.\n\nInsomnia can be categorized into three main groups: primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders linked to other mental health issues, and sleep disorders resulting from medical complications or substance use. Within the primary sleep disorders, we find Dyssomnias and Parasomnias. The Dyssomnias encompass a range of conditions, including Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Conversely, Parasomnias involve behavioral abnormalities and physiological occurrences, such as Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. This review focuses on insomnia and its relationship to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders emphasizes the role of genetics, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspects of sleep disorders. Research has shown that neurons in the hypothalamus, specifically those containing orexin, play a crucial role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study on mice found that phenotypic GABAB receptors on these orexin neurons are responsible for sleep-wake states. Activation of the GABAA receptor can induce responses that promote sleep, while inhibition of the receptor can lead to reduced anxiety and induce sleep. Furthermore, the GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time in these mice (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings suggest that animal models can be applied to human studies, highlighting the genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. This has significant implications for our understanding of the relationship between the GABAB receptor and sleep. If there is a problem or absence with this receptor, it could impact an individual's ability to sleep without medication. From a sociocultural perspective, if the phenotype is inherited, this could regulate sleep, and any alteration to the receptor could naturally disrupt sleep patterns for an individual, negatively impacting daily life, including school, career, and mundane tasks that require focus.",
            "This article delves into the realm of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), a condition that affects the way the brain interprets auditory information. At its core, CAPD is a disorder of the central nervous system (CNS), which fails to process sounds effectively, making it difficult for individuals to separate words, differentiate voices, or filter out background noise. Although people with CAPD can hear normally, the area of the brain responsible for sound processing doesn't function as it should, leading to difficulties in understanding and interpreting auditory information.\n\nThe concept of CAPD has its roots in the 1950s, when researchers initially referred to it as \"auditory imperception.\" The pioneering work of Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari in 1954 and Japanese researcher Kimura in 1961 laid the groundwork for understanding the condition. A national conference in 1977 sparked further research into the condition, which has since become known as CAPD.\n\nCAPD presents itself in various ways, including difficulties in localizing sounds in space, distinguishing between different acoustic events, recognizing sound patterns, and detecting changes in speech tone. Individuals with CAPD may struggle to process complex auditory information, leading to problems with language comprehension, social interactions, and overall communication.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, a comprehensive evaluation is necessary, typically conducted by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, or other professionals using a range of tests and assessments. These may include questionnaires, observations of listening behaviors, and evaluations of auditory function. Currently, there is no single, definitive test for CAPD, and the underlying causes of the disorder remain unknown.\n\nIn a mainstream classroom setting, teachers can play a crucial role in supporting students with CAPD. By understanding the characteristics and challenges associated with the condition, educators can develop strategies to help students with CAPD succeed. This may involve providing accommodations such as seating arrangements, visual aids, and extra time to process information, as well as offering regular feedback and support to help students stay on track.",
            "It seems that Twelfth Night suggests that relying on deception to maintain a charade can backfire, ultimately forcing the individual to reject their disguise or risk losing themselves in the process. However, uncovering the truth often comes with its own set of problems, particularly alienation from those around them. People may respond to the revelation with a mixture of reactions, ranging from indifference to offense, making it a difficult decision to weigh personal preservation against maintaining relationships with others.\n\nThe theme of deception through gender role reversal raises a lot of questions, particularly the underlying motivations behind adopting a disguise. In the case of Viola, she assumes a male persona to protect herself in a foreign land, but this decision has unintended consequences, including severing ties with the women in her life and becoming a source of confusion for those around her. Olivia, for instance, becomes infatuated with Cesario, only to later redirect her affections towards Sebastian, suggesting that her attraction may have been superficial. This dynamic is further complicated by the suppressed emotions between Viola/Cesario and Orsino, which are forced to the surface through Cesario's disguise.\n\nOn the surface, this may seem like a progressive exploration of suppressed emotions, particularly in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. However, upon closer examination, it appears that Shakespeare may be satirizing the tendency to judge people based on appearances. Olivia's ease in switching her affections and treating Cesario/Viola as family rather than a romantic interest hints at a more complex character dynamic, one that is more focused on social norms and expectations than genuine emotional connection.",
            "German colonial rule was marked by brutality, particularly in the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. However, it's essential to note that the German colonial empire was a diverse entity with varied policies, ruling styles, and geography. Education systems across the colonies also differed significantly. For instance, when the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found an educated and literate African population. In contrast, German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors.\n\nHowever, the situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast. Unlike in East Africa, where the government invested in state schools and native education, in South West Africa, the task of educating the natives was largely left to missionary societies with limited government support. The government did invest in education for Europeans, establishing a system of state schools and heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had lasting effects on South West Africa, even after German rule ended. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, the majority of the population remained uneducated and illiterate. Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to this divergence, which this paper aims to explore in more detail, focusing on new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nResearch on education in the German colonial empire has been conducted extensively, with many studies published in German during the early 20th century. These works primarily described the features of educational systems in the colonies. Later studies in English expanded the discussion through comparative analyses of education in various German colonies and more in-depth examinations of specific aspects of education. These studies highlighted significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. One notable work is Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa, which compared the two colonies and discussed the factors that accounted for their differences. According to Cohen, the large settler population in South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing features of the colony's educational system.\n\nSouth West Africa stood out from other German colonies in terms of its climate, with a relatively temperate climate despite being covered by arid desert. This relatively hospitable environment attracted a significant European population, with nearly 15,000 whites living in South West Africa by 1913, compared to only 5,336 in East Africa, the colony with the next largest settler population.",
            "Over the past 100 years, popular music has evolved into a vast and diverse landscape, encompassing numerous genres that are often intertwined and hard to define. Within these genres, sub-genres have emerged, creating a complex web of sounds and styles. Heavy Metal, in particular, has become a standout example of this complexity, having branched out into various sub-genres and sub-sub-genres over the past 40 years.\n\nHeavy Metal's expressiveness stems from its ability to convey a wide range of emotions, often leaning towards the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Its diversity is a result of its flexibility, which has allowed artists to create their own unique sub-genres, each with its own distinct sound and style. This has led to a proliferation of niches within the Heavy Metal movement, making it challenging to pinpoint what exactly defines Heavy Metal music.\n\nTo understand the many facets of Heavy Metal, it's essential to grasp its core essence and the factors that have shaped it into the movement it is today. At its heart, Heavy Metal is a genre that revels in darkness, often incorporating more extreme elements such as louder volumes, more intense energy, and a greater emphasis on theatricality. Unlike other genres, Heavy Metal is characterized by the musicians' exceptional technical skill, which is evident in their music.\n\nHeavy Metal's connection to substance abuse, particularly psychedelic drugs, is another defining aspect of the genre. The psychedelic boom of the 1970s led to the creation of boundary-pushing music that explored the darker side of human experience. This trend has continued, with later generations of metal artists drawing inspiration from the Romantic Era's dark and visceral qualities.\n\nLyrics like those found in Helter Skelter, which is often considered one of the first Heavy Metal songs, showcase the genre's affinity for the darker side of the emotional spectrum. This song's themes of turmoil and chaos were a response to the Rolling Stones' similarly heavy and dark song, and the Beatles' desire to prove they could match the Stones' intensity.",
            "Before the Surrealist artists began creating their dreamlike masterpieces, Henri Rousseau was already crafting his own dreams - both figuratively and literally. His 1910 painting, The Dream, not only depicts a woman marveling at the breathtaking wonders within a dream, but also reflects Rousseau's own personal aspirations as an artist. For years, he had envisioned recognition, acceptance, and praise from his fellow artists and art enthusiasts, but found himself struggling with an internal conflict that would shape his career: to conform to traditional styles and gain acceptance from the art world, or to forge his own path and remain true to his creative vision.\n\nTo understand The Dream through this lens, it's essential to delve into Rousseau's life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in the French town of Laval, he grew up in a relatively affluent household, with his father being a successful tinsmith and hardware merchant. Despite his comfortable upbringing, Rousseau never received formal art training, instead working as a municipal toll service employee until he was 40. His life took a significant turn after the death of his first wife, Clémence, and their eight infant children, leaving him with only one child, Julia, and a deep sense of loss. Painting became his solace, offering a fresh start and a means to cope with his grief. Unlike his contemporaries, who often romanticized the peasant class in their art, Rousseau was a folk painter, driven by the hopes and dreams of the average working-class individual.\n\nRousseau's desire for acceptance from the art world was understandable, given his late start in the field and the fact that he was producing art alongside some of the most renowned modern artists of the time. It wasn't until around the same period that Matisse was establishing himself as a respected artist that Rousseau began to receive recognition for his own work. As art historian Jan Gordon notes in Modern French Painters, while Matisse was driven by a fear of creating mundane art, Rousseau's primary goal was to craft a conventional piece that would earn him a spot among the esteemed ranks of the Artiste Français.",
            "It's no surprise that many philosophers have pondered the intricate connection between ethics and aesthetics, truth and beauty. I firmly believe that at its core, there's a fundamental reason for this connection. As John Keats so eloquently puts it in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" While we often learn about life through education and experience, we seem to instinctively appreciate ethics and aesthetics without being formally taught. Both ethics and aesthetics try to describe rather than prescribe; our studies of morality and beauty are more about explaining why a piece of art or literature is beautiful or why an action is moral, rather than providing a set of rules for judging or creating good art or moral behavior.\n\nIn other words, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what's good or what's beautiful. When discussing the worth of the Mona Lisa, for instance, we might focus on concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but these don't really explain why it's great art. When asked about a favorite work of art or literature, people often start with a phrase like, \"There's just something about it\" before providing a more in-depth explanation. I believe that both art and morals can't be fully reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor points out, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how thoroughly we describe a work of literature, there's still something transcendent that remains. Ethics, as Wittgenstein notes, \"cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" I suggest that it's this \"something,\" this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\nI think morality and art are closely related because we experience both of them most profoundly on a noumenal level, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Germany has become a powerful nation, a unified country with its own distinct culture that spans from the picturesque Alps in Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. The same cultural essence can be felt from Cologne along the Rhine River, through Germany's central regions, to the Saxon city of Dresden situated on the Elbe River. Given its unique blend of cultures, it's no surprise that modern-day Germany has its roots in various tribes and sources.\n\nThe origins of the term 'Germany' are shrouded in mystery, with historians and scholars debating its true meaning. According to Roman historian Tacitus, the name might have originated from a Germanic tribe known as the Tungrians, who were referred to as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and clashed with the Gaulish forces. Julius Caesar first used the term \"Germanus\" in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, where he described the Germanic tribes that often crossed the Rhine under dubious circumstances. He derived the word from the Gauls themselves, using it to distinguish between the conquered Gauls and the undefeated Germanic tribes. While the exact origin remains unclear, some believe it might have referred to a neighboring tribe in the Gaulish language. In his first book on the Gallic Wars, Julius Caesar notes: \"The Germans, who reside beyond the Rhine, constantly engage in battles with them (The Gauls).\" Others propose that the term comes from the spear used in warfare, known as a ger, or from the Old Irish word garim, meaning \"to shout,\" indicating the Germans were loud and boisterous.\n\nThe early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his writings that the Germans were an indigenous people, untouched by immigration or intermarriage with other races. He noted that those who sought to settle in Germany would have had to be driven by a strong sense of home and a desire to return, rather than being drawn by the allure of the land itself. The Romans, on the other hand, would often send their conquests into Germania to acquire goods and skills, but they rarely settled there permanently. As the Germanic tribes emerged in the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire, trading goods and serving in the Roman army.",
            "As I gazed down at the scene before me, my mind was a complete blank, unable to grasp the vibrant colors and shapes in front of my eyes.  My thoughts were a jumble of fragmented ideas that appeared and disappeared in a matter of seconds, leaving me with a sense of detachment.  It was as if my consciousness was running on autopilot, processing the visual feast without any emotional attachment or deeper meaning. \n\nI had always been fascinated by drawing, ever since I was a kid, and so when I stumbled upon an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain, I jumped at the chance to learn.  The book offered a unique approach to understanding the creative process, from grasping the fundamentals of drawing to tapping into the subconscious mind.  One technique that caught my attention was the idea of applying a mental square frame to a complex scene, simplifying it and making it more manageable.  At that moment, however, I was too overwhelmed to even think about such techniques.\n\nAll I could do was stand there, transfixed by the sight before me.  I had always admired the works of artists like Picasso, Monet, and the Renaissance masters, each with their own distinct style and vision.  If I ever hoped to create something truly beautiful, it had to start here, with this moment, this bowl of fruit, and the blank canvas of the future.  My hand instinctively reached for my trusty pencil, my fingers itching to bring my ideas to life.\n\nBut that was not to be.  Instead, my fingers hovered over the toilet handle, my hand tightening and relaxing in anticipation.  The brown, unappetizing mass refused to budge, stuck fast like a stubborn slug.  I stood there, frowning, my mind racing with frustration.  A few more flushes, a few more moments of contemplation, and then I reached for the toilet paper, wrapping my hand around the sheet like a mitten.  Slowly, deliberately, I dipped my hand into the bowl, a surreal and somewhat macabre ritual that left me questioning my own sanity.",
            "In my opinion, the alarming number of teenage driving fatalities is a serious concern in the United States.  Several key factors contribute to this tragic statistic, and understanding them is crucial to finding a solution.  One such factor is the fact that the teenage brain is not fully equipped to handle the dangers associated with driving, as explained by the National Institutes of Health.  Additionally, the National Institutes of Health point out that inexperience plays a significant role in the problem, leading to increased rates of fatal accidents, vehicle rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road.  It's also no surprise that teens are more likely to be involved in accidents when driving with their peers, which, as we all know, is a common occurrence.\n\nA study conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center found a clear correlation between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents that occur.  In an effort to address this issue, California and other states have implemented temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours teens can drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.  However, I believe that these measures are merely temporary fixes and do not address the root of the problem.  The real issue is that, statistically speaking, young drivers are not equipped to handle the risks and responsibilities associated with driving.\n\nRenowned psychologist Marvin Zuckerman has suggested that 18 is still too young to grant a full driver's license, as research indicates that individuals under 19-20 often engage in risk-taking behaviors for the thrill of it.  It makes sense, then, to delay driving until this tendency to take risks has leveled out.  If we continue to grant driver's licenses to young teens, we will likely see a devastating increase in accidents, and the death toll will be staggering.  By 2010, millions of new teen drivers will be hitting the roads, and the consequences will be dire.\n\nImplementing legislation to address this issue would be relatively straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver's education classes to lay the groundwork for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 should be allowed to operate a vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued before granting a full license, and a certain number of practical driver's training hours could be required, as is the case in most states (California, for example, currently requires 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult).  Uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable and effective way to protect teens across the country.\n\nIt's not a novel idea, but it's an idea whose time has come.  We owe it to our young drivers to take action and ensure their safety on our roads.",
            "While browsing through the Library of Congress's impressive collection of early Edison films, I decided to watch all fifteen trick films from 1895 to 1901. These films cleverly use editing techniques to create illusions that amaze and intrigue. My analysis focused on uncovering the underlying poetics of these trick films and identifying the unique characteristics that set a few of the later films apart from the rest. At the turn of the century, the trick film is typically set-bound, confined within a static, frontal proscenium, and adheres to a strict one shot equals one film approach, with minimal camera movement and reliance on long and medium shots.\n\nHowever, there are a few films from the early 1900s that break free from these traditional guidelines by incorporating more innovative techniques such as multiple shots. One of the most striking commonalities among the trick films is their reliance on interior sets within a frontal proscenium composition. The camera remains stationary, never panning or zooming to follow characters or objects. This style, originating from the theatre and vaudeville, restricts the movement of figures in trick films to side-to-side motion, rather than forward or backward movement towards the camera. For instance, in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), the actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis, never deviating from the frame.\n\nThe use of the frontal proscenium also dominates the types of shots used in these films. Long shots and, more rarely, medium shots are the norm, while close-ups are entirely absent from the Edison catalog's trick films. This is a nod to the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance within the frame of the stage. As a result, actors rarely venture towards or away from the camera, making close-ups virtually non-existent.\n\nFurthermore, most early trick films adhere to the notion that one conceptual shot equals one film, limiting their length to about a minute or less, depending on the frame rate. This also restricts the narrative or dramatic potential of these films, which largely focus on short, vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic and disappearing acts, with minimal storytelling. However, upon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that a single \"shot\" can be composed of multiple physical shots joined together to create the illusion of apparition or disappearance. For example, in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), a more detailed examination reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary's severed \"head\" begins, even though the film is conceptually one shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a passionate advocate for Republican values.  His agricultural background and brief foray into politics shaped him into a man known for his unwavering dedication to personal freedom and limited government.  His strong stance on the importance of an agrarian way of life influenced his views on sovereignty, Constitutional interpretation, and even the judicial system.  His goal was to preserve and promote what he believed to be the superior career path, which guided his arguments on governance.\n\nTaylor believed that the United States had a unique opportunity to create an ideal system of government, unencumbered by a pre-existing tradition.  He firmly believed in the inherent rights of individuals and the interconnected nature of those rights – if one right is compromised, the others suffer as well, and their value is diminished.  As such, he believed that these rights should be beyond the reach of government interference.  He saw the concept of the \"state of nature\" as a place where the strong and cunning profited, but in a civilized society, this should not be the case.\n\nTo create an ideal society, Taylor advocated for a government that acknowledges both the good and evil within humanity.  He was unyielding in his views on dualistic morality, stating that \"as government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human.\"  He defined good principles as those that protect private property, promote agriculture, and discourage excessive capitalism, and believed that a government founded on these principles would function equitably, regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be driven by self-interest.  However, he believed that self-interest was only considered evil when it led to the creation of sub-societies that exploited others.  A well-designed government was necessary to balance humanity's natural flaws and prevent the introduction of bad principles.\n\nLike many of his fellow Republicans, Taylor called for a strict construction of the Constitution, advocating for a limited Federal government with only the powers explicitly stated in the document.  He recognized that an extensive Federal government was likely to be expensive and potentially despotic, but he also believed that a literal interpretation of the Constitution without considering the intent of its authors could lead to corruption.  Furthermore, he considered the Declaration of Independence to be the true charter of the United States, as it more clearly defined the country as a collection of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "In looking at the data, there was a significant decline in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project, which was a bit disheartening. It's difficult to pinpoint the exact reason for this drop, but a few factors might have contributed to it. As winter set in at our New England campus, it's likely that fewer people were commuting by bicycle or on foot, which could have led to the decrease. Additionally, the end of the fall semester meant that students and faculty were busy finishing their schoolwork and processing grades, making it easy for the commuter log to fall by the wayside. The start of the holiday season and subsequent month-long break only added to the decline, as many people didn't need to come to campus at all. The low number of submissions in the following month of January could also be attributed to the fact that classes hadn't resumed yet. However, none of these factors fully explain the low number of submissions in February. It's possible that projects like this tend to experience a natural drop in enthusiasm after the initial excitement wears off. To combat this trend, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a special campaign to revitalize the initiative, which did lead to an increase in log submissions for that month. One of the challenges we faced was maintaining momentum despite the natural decrease in engagement and the specific challenges of holiday and semester breaks in higher education. \n\nAnother hurdle we encountered was the fact that many people enjoy the freedom and independence that comes with driving their own cars, which is deeply ingrained in our culture. To overcome this, we offered incentives in the form of gift certificates to local businesses, which seemed effective at first. However, it would have been interesting to see how larger prizes, such as a new bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car, might have influenced participation. As it was, the value of the prizes didn't change throughout the project, and while the gift cards were a good starting point, announcing larger prizes at the beginning of each month might have kept people engaged and motivated.",
            "An Exchange Traded Fund, or ETF for short, is a type of investment that tracks an index, a commodity, or a basket of assets like an index fund. However, it's more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange. This unique combination of features offers several benefits, including diversification and the ability to sell short, buy on margin, and purchase a single share in any transaction, just like owning a single stock. Additionally, the expense ratios of ETFs are significantly lower than those of the average mutual fund, making them an attractive option for investors. \n\nThat being said, there are some downsides to consider. For example, you'll need to pay a commission on any trade involving an ETF, just as you would with a stock. Furthermore, the wide variety of ETFs available can be overwhelming, and it's essential for savvy financial investors to carefully evaluate whether the stated benefits, such as diversification, truly exist and to what extent. In this analysis, we'll be taking a closer look at the ETF IHF and comparing it to its top 10 holdings to determine whether the benefits of owning a single ETF are comparable to those of owning a diversified portfolio of the 10 stocks. We'll also examine whether there are alternative configurations of the same stocks that could provide a more optimal return.\n\nTo make this analysis manageable, we'll focus on the top 10 holdings, which account for 63.58% of the ETF's assets. Here are the top 10 holdings and their corresponding percentage of total assets.\n\nTo estimate how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF as a whole, we can use their current percentage of assets to calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming the portfolio is made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the same proportion as the ETF's holdings. The calculations are presented in the chart below.\n\nAs you can see from the chart, a portfolio consisting only of the top 10 holdings would offer a return 6.11% higher than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. Additionally, the Beta of the top 10 holdings is 0.12 lower than the ETF as a whole. These results suggest that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could potentially provide a higher return with a lower Beta. However, it's essential to determine whether these differences are statistically significant.\n\nTo address this question, we calculated the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalized it to 100% to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF. By examining the results, we can gain a better understanding of whether the portfolios are statistically different from each other.",
            "One of Edgar Allan Poe's personal favorites was \"Dream-Land\", a poem that showcases his creative genius. The term \"Thulé\" is used twice in the poem, with its origins dating back to the ancient Roman poet Virgil. However, it's worth noting that Poe was also heavily influenced by German literature. \n\nThis connection to Virgil is significant, but it's not the only source to consider. Poe's interest in German authors, particularly Goethe, is undeniable. In fact, his poem \"Dream-Land\" bears a striking resemblance to Goethe's work. \n\nA notable scholar, Karl J. Arndt, observed the similarities between Poe's \"Politian\" and Goethe's \"Mignon\", concluding that Poe was likely drawing inspiration from the German author. Goethe, a renowned writer of poetic dramas, is perhaps best known for his magnum opus \"Faust\". Published in two parts, the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the poem \"Faust\" features a character known as the \"King of Thulé\". \n\nIn this poem, the King's wife passes away, leaving him heartbroken and consumed by grief. He begins to drink heavily, eventually deciding that it's time to end his own life. The \"King of Thulé\" and the character from \"Dream-Land\" share a haunting similarity, with both struggling to cope with loss and finding solace in drinking. \n\nInterestingly, Goethe's \"Faust\" was adapted into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, just a year before Poe referenced Thule in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\". Poe's use of the term \"Thule\" is not limited to this poem, as he also employed it in \"Dream-Land\". The poem's speaker describes a desolate landscape, haunted by the ghosts of friends and devoid of color, echoing the themes present in \"The King of Thulé\". \n\nGiven Poe's admiration for Alfred, Lord Tennyson, it's clear that he would have been familiar with Goethe's work. In fact, the numerous reproductions of Goethe's writings that were circulating at the time would have ensured his exposure to the German author's oeuvre. The connection between \"Dream-Land\" and \"The King of Thulé\" is undeniable, with Poe's poem serving as a companion piece to Goethe's work.",
            "Under California law, a customer who slipped and fell on an applesauce spill in a grocery store may be eligible for punitive damages if the store manager demonstrated malice by ignoring the spill, despite being informed twice of it, while he was eating dinner. A judge is unlikely to dismiss the claim outright. To justify punitive damages, a plaintiff must show that the defendant acted with a deliberate disregard for the potential harm their actions could cause, as well as that their actions were despicable. In this case, Jennifer Palmer can argue that store manager Paul Martin should have known the dangers of leaving the spill unattended, given that multiple customers had slipped and fallen on the same issue in the months prior. Palmer's claim that Martin's actions were despicable is not entirely convincing, but it's still a valid argument considering six slip-and-fall incidents occurred in 2009 and Martin failed to take necessary steps to ensure the store's safety.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, store employee Rich Wayne informed Martin about the applesauce spill, but Martin brushed him off, saying he was on dinner break. Fifteen minutes later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, notified Martin of the spill, and he responded in the same dismissive manner. By 5:30 pm, Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a serious back injury. Before Palmer's accident, five other slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D Markets in 2009. Now, Palmer is suing the store for both compensatory and punitive damages, and we're considering whether to file a motion to dismiss the punitive damage claim.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation that's not contract-related if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" The law defines malice as conduct intended to cause harm or, if not intentional, as \"despicable\" conduct committed with a \"willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" California Civil Code, section 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). Courts have characterized behavior as malicious when it shows a conscious disregard of the plaintiff's rights, especially when the defendant knows the probable consequences of their actions and deliberately fails to avoid them.

            "It's been nearly four years since I took a course in Islam at CBC, and one topic that still resonates with me is the notion that Islam is a hostile religion.  As I reflect on the years since 9/11, I've witnessed a shift in the media's portrayal of Islam, going from a hostile view to an extreme level of tolerance in America. It's striking to think that in 2001, it would have been unimaginable for a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, with his obvious Muslim background, to run for office.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad fascinates me, but it also raises questions. From what I've learned, I used to believe that Muhammad forced people to convert to Islam, conquering tribes and imposing his faith on them. However, the biography portrays Muhammad as a humble, misunderstood figure who lived a life of truth and performed miracles. The writers seem to be depicting him as a martyr, who didn't need to prove anything, but instead, people came to him seeking the truth in his teachings.\n\nI'm struck by the similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the 'miracles' of Muhammad. One example is when Muhammad took a small amount of food and miraculously multiplied it to feed forty men. This writing style makes me wonder if the authors are trying to portray Muhammad as a humble prophet who didn't need to prove himself, but rather lived in truth and performed miracles. It seems like they're downplaying the life and personhood of Jesus Christ, almost implying that Muhammad was somehow connected to Jesus.\n\nThe biography also contains many stories that seem to be about providing proof of 'witness' or how people 'on their own' converted to Islam. However, these stories are often based on second- or third-hand accounts, which makes me skeptical. While the authors intended to provide proof of the truth of the stories, I think it actually diminishes their credibility and makes them seem more suspicious.\n\nWhat bothers me most about this work is the way the authors try to elevate Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle. However, history paints a different picture of Muhammad's rise to power, and I can't help but wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true story behind his ascension to power.",
            "Looking back at the teachings of Jesus and the core beliefs he preached during his lifetime, it's striking how quickly they were abandoned in the development of Christian thought that followed.  As we examine the history in broad strokes, we can see a clear trend of Christianity veering further and further away from its roots.  However, today's world is witnessing a growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive shift.  Those who hold traditional views may resist any deviation from established teachings, but if history is any indicator, they may not be a large enough group to have a significant impact on the whole.  As time passes, a growing number of Christians will increasingly seek to uncover the original intent behind their faith, distinguishing between the core teachings of Jesus and the additional doctrines that were added over time.  This shift may take decades or even centuries, but ultimately, it's an irreversible trend:  A great reversal in Christian history is inevitable, as people seek to return to the true essence of the faith.  As this movement gains momentum, we can expect to see a progression back to the original form of Christianity, stripping away layer upon layer of doctrine, much like the clock ticking backward.  When this shift takes hold in the United States and Europe, we'll see a mass movement toward worshipping as Jesus taught, free from the additional ideas and dogma that have accumulated over the centuries.  The church as an institution will continue to play a vital role in guiding this process, but the resulting uniformity of belief and practice will be a far cry from the current diversity of Christendom.  As we look around the world, we can see that history is filled with examples of great reversals – for instance, how Christians were once persecuted and ostracized by the Roman Empire, only to become a dominant force within it.  Similarly, our country has undergone a remarkable transformation from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  A similar reversal is on the horizon for the Christian faith, as people seek to strip away the accumulated layers of doctrine and return to the source.  A crucial aspect of this process will be interpreting Jesus' words as metaphors, rather than taking them literally.  So, what happened to the original Jewish roots of Christianity?  If we dig deep enough into history, we find that Judaism was the sole foundation for the Christian faith.  By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., monotheism, the notion of divinely revealed scripture, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were already deeply ingrained in the Jewish faith.  However, the Jewish population was far from united, with various factions like the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common people each holding their own distinct views.",
            "In my opinion, The Jungle is a powerful portrayal of the inherent selfishness and self-centeredness that exists within human nature. People are often primarily driven by their own desires and ambitions, frequently prioritizing their own interests over those of others. This is a theme that The Jungle vividly illustrates. The novel's depiction of the factory owners and managers is a striking example of this. Their sole focus is on expanding and improving their businesses, without regard for the well-being of anyone or anything that gets in their way. As Upton Sinclair writes, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" This vivid description highlights the devastating consequences of their actions and shows that they care little for the people and animals affected by their pursuit of profit. The pollution caused by their factories and the filth from the animal pens surrounding Packingtown are just a couple of the many examples of the damage they inflict on others without a second thought.\n\nFurthermore, the novel reveals that the owners and managers have no qualms about exploiting their employees to make more money. They are willing to do whatever it takes to save a buck, as evident in the line \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" The employees are subjected to inhumane working conditions and are laid off without warning, with no assistance in finding new employment. During the time period in which the novel is set, there were few laws protecting workers' rights, allowing the owners and managers to act with impunity. The workers, who were essentially treated as slaves, were forced to endure terrible conditions in the factories and live in the midst of pollution, with no help or support available to them. The unions that were formed often did more harm than good, profiting off the struggles of the workers. The workers were trapped in this system, with no way out, making their situation all the more dire.",
            "Many authors use various techniques to elicit a specific emotional response from their readers. F. Scott Fitzgerald employs several of these methods in his novel The Great Gatsby. Some of his techniques are more effective than others. One of these is his use of word pairs to create a particular atmosphere around an idea. For instance, he combines adjectives and nouns in a way that doesn't usually fit to evoke a certain reaction in readers. Another technique is assigning meaning to a symbol and then using it to convey the same meaning. Fitzgerald frequently uses this latter technique with colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald develops a deeper meaning for colors, particularly white/gray and red/pink, then utilizes this meaning to create a specific impression of a subject.\n\nFitzgerald's use of white/gray to signify uniformity is a prime example. He establishes this meaning early in the novel by frequently pairing the two colors together. When introducing Daisy and Jordan, Fitzgerald notes that they are \"in white\" all the time – in fact, nearly everyone at Gatsby's party wears white: Nick sports \"white flannels,\" Tom sports a \"white shirt,\" and Catherine is described as \"powdered milky white.\" Conversely, the only time people aren't wearing white is when Nick is describing his initial impressions of Gatsby's party: \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors.\" Fitzgerald further solidifies these meanings by applying the colors to everyday objects: as Nick commutes to work, he navigates the \"white chasms of lower New York,\" the names of people at Gatsby's parties are listed as \"gray names\" on his schedule, and Catherine's apartment is \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\" – a sense of uniformity. He also uses the colors to describe ordinary or unimportant people or places: Jordan and Daisy share a \"white girlhood,\" there are \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" in the valley of ashes, the \"Italian child\" in the railroad is \"gray,\" and the dog-seller is \"a gray old man.\" \n\nOnce Fitzgerald has built up enough meaning for white/gray, he uses them to symbolize the unimportance or uniformity of certain subjects. He employs this color technique with Daisy first. After a lengthy period without significant use of either color, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster,\" signaling to readers that Daisy is becoming less of a character and more of a uniform element, something Gatsby desires and longs for (74). Fitzgerald employs this technique repeatedly around Daisy to create the impression that she is a more uniform addition, as seen in a \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" and another instance where she wears a \"white\" dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "San Diego County boasts an incredibly productive agricultural scene, largely due to its mild, sunny climate. A variety of crops thrive here, including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There's a strong demand for organic community-supported agriculture food in the area, with many local organizations featuring lengthy waiting lists for their products. Organic eggs and milk are also highly sought after, and some farms even offer tours of their operations, as well as opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities.\n\nOrganic farming not only fills a lucrative niche market but also offers numerous environmental benefits, such as enhanced biodiversity in plants and wildlife due to the absence of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming comes with its own set of challenges, including higher labor and management costs to control pests and weeds without using chemicals, greater losses compared to conventional methods, and reduced efficiency due to the smaller scale of operations. Additionally, other beneficial practices, such as planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, and invasive species removal, can also incur increased labor costs.\n\nThe land in question is a 160-acre property adjacent to the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California. The land features a mix of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, bordering the Cleveland National Forest. This area falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which currently considers over a hundred plant and animal species, many of which are endangered or declining. These species include the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher.\n\nFor centuries, this land was inhabited by Native Americans, followed by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. The property was part of an original homestead patent, likely used for grazing and/or wood production for many years.\n\nTo explore potential options for a small farmer, I selected a piece of property from a real estate website and researched government programs that could help mitigate costs and preserve wildlife-friendly operations. I used an organic farm in the same area as a model for what a farmer might aim to achieve on this land.",
            "Culture is a vital component in any negotiation, consisting of more than just what it signifies, but also what it represents. It is not a fixed entity, nor is it uniform across the board. Generalizations like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are far too broad and simplistic. Instead, it's more effective for a negotiator to grasp the significance of a culture in relation to the matter at hand and how it may impact the negotiation. When engaging with a foreign culture, we inevitably draw comparisons to our own, which can lead to misunderstandings.\n\nEfforts to comprehend a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to acknowledging its biases. Rather than judging or attempting to alter a culture, it's essential to accept it for what it is and work within its boundaries, especially in the context of negotiation. If you're in a weaker bargaining position, showing respect for traditions and beliefs can help bridge cultural gaps and advance the negotiation.\n\nIt's also worth noting that culture isn't confined to international or national differences. Companies within a country often develop their own distinct corporate culture, which can be just as complex as the broader societal culture. For instance, some corporations prioritize long working hours, while others encourage a more relaxed schedule. This is reflected in factors such as employee dress codes, communication styles, delegation of duties, and hiring practices. The diversity of corporate culture within a country, even within the same company, is a testament to the multifaceted nature of societal culture.\n\nUnderstanding values is equally crucial, as they provide the underlying motivations for a culture. If a culture values saving face or communal harmony, a negotiator will be hesitant to publicly embarrass their company or superior to achieve success. Conversely, if a culture prioritizes aggressive bargaining, a negotiator may be more inclined to push for a hard-driven deal. By taking these generalities into account before the negotiation, a negotiator can better prepare themselves for the challenges ahead. Nonetheless, it's also essential to develop a personal understanding of one's opponent to make the negotiation effective.",
            "The notion that God does not exist has been a notion that has been debated for centuries, and is famously stated in the Christian Bible as \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This belief is also shared by the philosopher Thomas Aquinas, and his argument for the existence of God is often compared to that of St. Anselm. Since both authors are arguing for the same concept of God, we'll assume they're both correct in their belief for the sake of this analysis. We'll compare their arguments, keeping in mind that their arguments are in defense of the God of the Bible. \n\nWhile both Anselm and Aquinas make valid points, their arguments lack a complete basis for belief in God. To demonstrate this, let's first look at Anselm's argument. Anselm suggests that we can find proof of God within ourselves. He believes that because God exists within our understanding, we can't truly conceive of his nonexistence. Anselm is saying that we don't need to look beyond our own minds to understand the truth about God, and that the existence of God can be found to be true simply by examining what we inherently know to be true within our own minds. This idea of accepting something without irrefutable evidence is referred to as faith in Christian texts.\n\nThis perspective is distinct from that of Aquinas, who believes that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, without any need for faith. This idea would be beneficial for Christian evangelism, as it would allow for the recruitment of new converts without requiring them to believe in something that can't be proven. Aquinas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. He demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God, much like knowing the features and existence of a missing puzzle piece without actually seeing it.",
            "About 2500 years back, a prince who would one day become known as the Buddha was born in either the fourth or fifth century BCE. Throughout his lifetime, he rejected worldly life and achieved a profound understanding, leading to the development of Buddhism. The most traditional branch of this faith is Theravada Buddhism, and it has undergone significant changes over the centuries. This is evident in various aspects of the religion, such as the water-cutting ceremony in Sri Lanka, where both monks and laypeople participate. This event has spiritual significance, despite the fact that Buddha never taught about such celebrations. These variations range from surface-level customs to the fundamental principles of the faith. The Theravada Buddhist community, from both the monastic and lay perspectives, has had to adapt its core teachings over time due to both internal and external forces, some of which are hostile, while others are benevolent.\n\nIt's essential to understand the terms we'll be using to discuss this topic. An internal force refers to any influence that comes from within the Buddhist community, regardless of the individual's monastic status. External forces, on the other hand, come from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any influence that aims to harm or damage the Buddhist community, often rooted in a negative perception of Buddhism. In contrast, a benign force is one that doesn't intend to harm or help the community, although it may inadvertently do so. These definitions will be used repeatedly throughout our discussion.\n\nLet's begin by exploring the core principles of Theravada Buddhism. At the heart of the faith lies the Triple Gem, comprising the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is primarily made up of the Tripitaka, a collection of Buddhist scriptures divided into three baskets: the Sutta Pitaka, the Vinaya Pitaka, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka. The Sutta Pitaka contains the teachings and discourses, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka deals with the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. Key concepts include Anatta (no permanent self), Dukkha (inherent suffering in life), and Anicca (impermanence of everything). By recognizing these principles, one can break free from Sansara, the cycle of birth and death, which is a continuous process. Along with Sansara, one can also overcome lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion) by achieving enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka provides rules for laypeople, such as the five precepts (not killing, lying, stealing, misbehaving sexually, or taking intoxicants). Monks, on the other hand, have more comprehensive guidelines to follow. The four noble truths are the fundamental principles of Buddhism, including the truth that life is suffering, that attachment causes suffering, and that suffering can be overcome.",
            "One notable example of a long-standing rivalry between two nations is that of the United States and Mexico, which lasted for an impressive 57 years, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts, 2000, p. 145).  The peak of this rivalry occurred during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States ultimately emerged victorious, securing Texas and the American Southwest as part of its territory.  Although many conflicts arose between the two nations, the tension finally began to subside just before the outbreak of World War I. \n\nThis rivalry, fueled by differences in values, culture, and economic interests, is not unique to the United States and Mexico. Many nations sharing a border experience similar clashes of interests, leading to the development of rival positions. The United States and Mexico are a prime example of this phenomenon, much like other enduring rivalries between neighboring countries.  As noted by David M. Pletcher (1977), \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41).  The proximity of these nations to the United States contributed to their rivalry, whereas other Latin American countries have historically enjoyed more positive relations with the United States.\n\nReligious differences also played a significant role in straining relations between the two nations, a common issue that has plagued many countries throughout history (Frahm, 2001, p. 86).  If Americans were opposed to fascism and communism in the 20th century, they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy in the 18th and 19th centuries.  In this case, the ideological struggle was not solely based on political systems but also on the distinct religious preferences of the United States and Mexico. This distrust stemmed from the legacy of distrust between the English and Spanish, which their former colonial rulers had instilled in them. This inherited animosity significantly hindered the establishment of friendly relations between the two nations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) documented 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States during the 57-year rivalry period. The majority of these disputes centered on territorial issues, including border raids from Mexican territory and other frontier problems. Border bandits and outlaws from American border towns posed significant challenges, which were eventually addressed when both countries strengthened their border security (Schmitt, 1974, p. 97).\n\nAs Schmitt (1974) noted, the rivalry began to dissipate as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the United States (p. 109) and American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico (p. 110) in the later 19th century.",
            "It's been 15 years since my life took an unexpected turn due to an illness I never knew existed. At the time, I was working as a nurse, a career choice that provided a sense of security and stability I desperately craved as a child. The mantra I grew up with was that I would always be able to find employment, as people would always get sick, and that notion drove me to pursue nursing over my true passions for science and journalism.\n\nFast forward to my current reality: I'm 46, single, and living on Social Security Disability benefits after 15 years. I've barely managed to scrape by, and every day feels like a struggle to maintain my sense of security, safety, and self-worth. Despite my best efforts, nothing is certain anymore, but one thing remains true – I couldn't have made it this far without the unwavering support of my family and a few loyal friends. In times of real crisis, you don't feel invincible, and it's in those moments that you come to realize just how strong you truly are.\n\nMy point is that life is unpredictable, and we're all bound to face emergencies, big or small. No matter how well-prepared we are, some challenges are simply too great to overcome alone.\n\nWhile I agree that we should be more self-sufficient, I firmly believe that Americans should focus on rebuilding our sense of community and trust in one another. Instead of turning to the government for all our needs, we should strive to help each other and ask for assistance when necessary. This isn't about abandoning our individual strength, but rather recognizing that true resilience lies in our collective ability to support one another.\n\nWhen we talk about the \"rugged individualism\" that built this country, we often forget that our ancestors relied on compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources to get through tough times. The pioneers who crossed the American West didn't do it alone; they relied on each other for survival.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I've taken steps to prepare for emergencies – I have a disaster kit, first aid supplies, and other essentials. If you have the means, consider investing in a small farm or a wood stove. However, while you're at it, take the time to get to know your neighbors and build a support network. It's in these relationships that we'll find true strength and resilience.",
            "The question of why organisms evolve in a particular manner has long puzzled scientists, with some constraints and influences shaping the direction of evolutionary change. Although the renowned biologist D'Arcy Thompson noted in 1917 that \"the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,\" the same challenge remains today. Recent advances in mathematical modeling have been applied to various aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis, encompassing both ontogeny and phylogeny (as seen in Raup and Stanley's 1981 study). Our current research focuses on combining mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum with experimental studies to understand the mechanisms driving evolutionary-developmental change. By analyzing X-radiographic images of Prunum species and using the software program CerioShell, we can identify quantitative parameters that allow us to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters are then used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. Our findings are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies to gain a deeper understanding of macroevolutionary events within this clade.\n\nA shell can be visualized as a tube that traverses 360 degrees of space over time. The whorls, or revolutions of the coiled shell, spiral around an imaginary central axis known as the columella, which runs through the central column of the shell. The speed at which whorls expand can vary, and the continuous line separating each whorl is referred to as a suture. In most shells, the last whorl (the body whorl) is the largest. The spire consists of all the whorls except the last, while the apex is the tip of the spire, and the opposite end is the base. The animal exits its shell through the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from various angles, including apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives (with the typical orientation being the apertural view, where the aperture faces the viewer, and the apex points upwards). A method for counting whorls involves examining the shell from the apical view, identifying the first suture, and then drawing a line to divide the shell into two parts. Whorls are counted from this line, with estimates made to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a series of apertures that move through time and space as the animal builds its shell. By tracking the path of the aperture using coordinates of the center of each whorl's aperture and the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture, we can graphically and mathematically represent this trajectory. Once a mathematical formulation is established, we can manipulate parameters and modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "Indonesia's record on neonatal and infant mortality has remained stagnant for a decade, with the country struggling to meet its Millennium Development Goals for child and maternal health by 2015.  While Indonesia has made progress in certain areas, such as water and sanitation, the pace of improvement in child and maternal health is alarmingly slow.  To address these shortcomings, it's essential to strengthen the overall health system rather than relying solely on program-specific interventions.\n\nOne area of improvement is the number of births attended by skilled healthcare workers, which now stands at 72%.  However, this figure includes traditional workers like midwives who may not be equipped to handle complicated pregnancies, leading to a significant number of maternal deaths due to hemorrhage.  This highlights the limitations of this metric and the need for further action.  Additionally, the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five treated by a healthcare professional has declined, and postnatal care remains a concern, with low rates reported across the country.\n\nCesarian-section rates are also a cause for concern, averaging around 4% nationwide, with a significant disparity between urban and rural areas.  The c-section rate is 7% in urban settings, compared to just 2% in rural areas, underscoring the issue of unequal access to healthcare services.  Furthermore, the gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles is substantial, with a 27% difference in healthcare access.  This indicates that the poor face significant barriers to accessing healthcare services, likely due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nTo move forward and improve neonatal and maternal care indicators, the primary question is whether to focus on program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system.  While targeted programs may seem attractive for their focus and manageability, they also have drawbacks.  One major concern is the potential for resource diversion, as significant investments in one area can lead to reduced funding and human resources for other critical areas.  Additionally, running multiple parallel programs can result in duplication and inefficiency, increasing the administrative burden.",
            "When it comes to Victorian literature, most people would expect novels that delve deeply into the intricacies of the aristocracy and the societal norms of the time.  However, there are two novels that stand out from the rest: Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both of these stories feature an air of mystery and an unconventional flair that sets them apart from their contemporaries, adding depth and complexity to the characters and their motivations. \n\nThe unsettling and baffling ideas that swirl in the protagonist's mind are a hallmark of these novels.  In the case of Oliver Twist, the lines between reality and fantasy are often blurred, as seen in this passage: \"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind.  He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.\" (Dickens, 220)\n\nIn Oliver Twist, these inexplicable events often serve to unveil the protagonist's inner turmoil, his pain, and his growing awareness of the harsh realities surrounding him.  The vivid recollection of the shooting in chapter 28, for instance, is a dreamlike experience that Oliver undergoes as he struggles to find help, leaving the reader questioning whose fate it was that brought about his misfortune.  The shooting seems to overwhelm Oliver, numbing his senses, as he is borne away by an unseen force, his pain now constant and linked to fear rather than surprise.  This highlights the notion that Oliver has no control over his life, and that he is unable to take charge of even the most critical events, including the one that almost cost him his life.  This reinforced sense of defeat in Oliver suggests that he has become worn down by the circumstances of his life, and that he has lost the will to resist.\n\nIn a similar vein, Wuthering Heights is characterized by a sense of timelessness, where days blend together with the passing of night and the darkness that it brings.  The days seem to melt away, leaving only a sense of dread and the fleeting hours that tick by.  As the protagonist struggles to come to terms with their circumstances, they are left with a sense of disorientation and confusion.",
            "It's a story I still remember vividly from a few years ago when I worked in an after-school program, helping elementary-age students with their studies. I made it my mission to assist them in whichever subject they struggled with, but my strengths lay in English and reading. One of the instructors approached me about working with a young boy named Adrian, who was having a tough time reading. What struck me was that he had an unusual issue - he could pronounce certain letters perfectly, while others were way off. It was a real puzzle. Given his Latino background, I figured he might have some language barriers, but he spoke perfect English. Nevertheless, we struggled to make progress until I met his mother, who only spoke Spanish. I managed to communicate with her through my limited Spanish skills, but it dawned on me that something wasn't quite right - Adrian could read, but he was struggling with the English alphabet. I hope he's doing better now, but I still remember that moment like it was yesterday.\n\nI share this story to highlight a pressing issue in schools, particularly in California - the language barrier. It's not always as apparent as we think, even for students who speak perfect English. Reading can still be a significant obstacle. It's clear that this problem exists, so what can we do about it? For a student like Adrian, the solution was straightforward: extra tutoring in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for many students who barely speak English, the problem is much more complex.\n\nI believe there's no one-size-fits-all solution. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes - none of these approaches, on its own, will solve this issue. The key lies in combining all of these methods.\n\nFirstly, the dual language system is an excellent idea, not just for students whose first language is Spanish, but for all children. Research shows that children in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. Some people are skeptical, fearing it's a waste of resources or that most students won't benefit. That's just not true. If we implemented these programs as the norm, rather than the exception, all children would benefit from them. But how can we make this work? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? That's unrealistic and unreasonable. Instead, we could have specialized aids, tutors, or whatever you want to call them, who are bilingual.",
            "For most of us, the concept of something greater than ourselves becomes apparent from a young age. Whether we're learning about it in Sunday school, temple, or through self-discovery, our understanding of spirituality evolves over time. Some of us cling to the faith passed down by our parents, while others reject it entirely, convinced that our personal universe is all that exists. Many of us switch between different value systems, trying to find our place in the grand scheme of things. This search for meaning and purpose drives us to explore our own unique perspectives on spirituality, seeking answers in the darkness to guide us toward the light.\n\nAs I sat on the porch with my dad on that rainy day, I asked him about his favorite bird. \"A cardinal,\" he replied, gazing out into the rain. His thin frame and sparse hair spoke of a difficult journey he had been on, and his distant stare seemed to hold a mix of searching and remembering. I felt a deep sense of unease, knowing that I wouldn't be able to talk to him about how much I would miss him when he was gone. So I hugged him, sat back down, and joined him in watching the rain. My father eventually passed away just a few months later, on my 22nd birthday. The chemotherapy and radiation had prolonged his suffering, but I couldn't help but wonder if it was worth it. If God existed, I thought, he seemed to be ignoring me. I stopped praying, not wanting to waste my words on a higher power that didn't seem to be listening. Instead, I chose to remember my father for who he was, not for how he died.\n\nI decided not to watch him pass away, unable to bear the thought of witnessing the end of the person who brought me into this world. I knew my father would have wanted me to remember him by his life, not his death. I curled up in a ball for three days, waiting for the news, but no one even called me.",
            "You might consider the term \"Gothic Novel\" to be something of a paradox, combining as it does the old and the new. As Ian Watt notes, it's an oxymoron that brings to mind the concept of \"old-new.\" This genre has been both criticized and praised, with some viewing it as lacking depth and others seeing it as evoking a sense of the \"terrible sublime\" (Burke). The origins of the Gothic Novel date back to Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, which drew on both ancient and modern romance elements to create a new style of storytelling. By combining old theatrical elements with the modern novel's narrative structure, Walpole was able to craft a unique literary experience that he referred to as \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre often incorporates elements from medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions, despite the word \"gothic\" having already been associated with a range of styles, time periods, and people at the time of The Castle of Otranto's publication.\n\nIn the context of the Gothic Novel, the concept of chivalry plays a significant role. The medieval ideals of chivalry, which involved training a knight to be brave, honorable, and competent, are both preserved and transformed in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry was particularly important to Gothic writers like Walpole, who saw it as a representation of the ideal knight and the perceived lack of that ideal in their contemporary society. By romanticizing the chivalric past and idealizing it, Gothic writers like Walpole aimed to improve the present. When writing The Castle of Otranto, Walpole was living in a time of political turmoil and, possibly due to the unfair accusations he faced, he may have felt that the supposed moral and innate goodness of people in the gothic era had been lost in the society of his time. This sentiment is evident in characters like Frederic, who embodies many chivalric traits, including being a prince, having suffered, and being described in a way that exaggerates the traditional images of a gallant and courteous knight, introducing the Gothic trope of excess (Walpole 66).",
            "In the world of business, there's a crucial behind-the-scenes process that keeps everything running smoothly from production to delivery: supply chain management. This term was coined by Keith Oliver in 1982, a consultant who laid out the blueprint for planning, implementing, and controlling the entire supply chain to meet customer needs efficiently. At its core, supply chain management is a six-step process that involves production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information management. These key elements are the foundation upon which companies build their customer service strategies.\n\nThe first step in the supply chain process is production, the backbone of the entire operation. It's all about creating a plan for when, why, where, and how products will be made. To ensure production meets customer demands, managers must understand what customers want, which can be determined by analyzing market trends. Once the market is analyzed, managers can decide what products to produce and how many. The next step is choosing the best location for production, taking into account factors like volume, quality, and meeting customer expectations.\n\nA seamless production process is crucial, and every detail counts. If not planned correctly, it can lead to significant losses of time and money in the long run. I've seen this firsthand in my previous roles at retail giants like Walmart and Target. Both companies have meticulous processes in place, from employee uniform design to receiving shipments. Having a clear plan in place ensures a smooth operation without confusion or miscommunication.\n\nThe second key element of supply chain management is supply, which involves strategic decisions about a company's core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. A company may have multiple divisions producing a single product, each with its own equipment, workers, and specialties. Managers must decide which division is best suited for each process and may opt to outsource work to other companies to achieve velocity – quality, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness. By making informed decisions about supply, companies can meet customer needs efficiently and stay ahead of the competition.",
            "Hitler is alive in Burma, or so a mysterious message suggests. Movie star Ellen Page, known for her role in Juno, stands alone on a street corner, holding a disturbing sign with a Sharpie-written message. Burma, now known as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian country under the iron-fisted control of a military junta that seized power in 1962 through a violent coup d'état. In 2007, a wave of street protests shook the nation, fueled by a decade-long drought of public demonstrations. Led by thousands of Burmese monks, these protests earned the nickname \"The Saffron Revolution\" due to the color of their robes. However, the government's initial tolerance for the peaceful gatherings soon turned into brutal suppression, with the military clashing with the monks and invading monasteries across the country. Foreign journalists were arrested and imprisoned, and a Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, was tragically killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for documenting a protest.\n\nThis is just one example of a long history of governments cracking down on dissent and maintaining absolute control over their citizens. From ancient Rome's emperors claiming divine right to rule to Japan's emperors being believed to be gods, the desire for authoritarianism has been a timeless human trait. Even today, leaders like our current president, George W. Bush, have been known to consult with influential figures like Ted Haggard, a leader within the Republican Party.\n\nNotable examples of such brutal suppression include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students gathered to challenge the Chinese government's authoritarian rule. The death toll in this incident varies widely, with official reports ranging from 200 to 300 dead, while the Chinese Red Cross estimates between 2,000 and 3,000 fatalities. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, backed by the Rwandan government, systematically killed Tutsis and political moderates, is another extreme example. The Nazi regime's \"Third Reich,\" where anyone of Jewish descent was rounded up and killed, is yet another haunting example of the devastating consequences of unchecked authoritarianism.",
            "Duke Ellington's lasting impact on jazz is largely due to his remarkable career span and the way he harnessed his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Though he often played a subtle role on the piano, as a composer Ellington excelled at crafting intricate and rich pieces that showcased the unique talents of each band member. He created an environment where soloists could freely improvise, while writing tightly orchestrated passages that accentuated the distinctive style of specific band members, ultimately uniting the entire orchestra in a cohesive sound. This mastery of the individual players' voices and how they blended together allowed Ellington to pen some of the most groundbreaking and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\n\nNotably, the Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's innovative use of the human voice as an instrument, exemplified in his early work Creole Love Call. In this piece, he seamlessly integrated voice with instrumental textures without the constraint of lyrics. The 12-bar blues, a genre staple, features six distinct choruses that demonstrate Ellington's ability to complement the style of his soloists. The various choruses showcase a range of instrumental colors, including a muted trumpet solo, a soaring clarinet solo, and a syncopated piano phrase, all of which come together to create a rich tapestry of sound.\n\nHot and Bothered, recorded a year later, is a prime example of Ellington's skill at blending tight orchestration with a keen ear for tone color. In this piece, the call and response between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing highlights the versatility of the human voice as a musical instrument. The same approach is evident in It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), where Ellington masterfully utilizes the muted trombone of Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton to introduce the melody, demonstrating his ability to coax unique sounds from his musicians.",
            "There was this nagging void within her that she just couldn't shake. It started when she was 14, and by 17, it was still there, only now she was determined that she wanted someone, not just anything, to fill this emptiness. However, she found herself uninterested in any of the boys around her. Many had tried to woo her, but none had caught her attention. She often wondered what could be the reason behind this peculiar phenomenon, trying to come up with a theory, but nothing seemed convincing enough. She continued to live her life, constantly questioning her desires.\n\nHer home life was usually pretty chill. Her parents were laid-back and calm, rarely arguing with each other or with her. The only thing they ever disagreed on was her desire for independence and her free-spirited nature. As the daughter of a calm couple, she brought a lot of energy and personality to the table, making her pretty likable despite being a nice person.\n\nBut today was not a typical day. As she walked from room to room, searching for inspiration, she heard a sudden scream from the kitchen, followed by her mom's voice. She rushed into the room, starting to panic, and frantically asked, \"Mom! What's wrong?\" She saw her mom lying on the ground, in obvious pain, saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. Her daughter rushed to her side and put a hand on her to help. \"Ouch... sweetie, I need you to take me to the hospital.\" The words were rushed and strained, and her daughter could tell she was in a lot of pain. \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where to pick you up.\" Her mom directed her hands, and in that moment, her daughter was grateful that she had taken self-defense classes. She carried her mom to the car, got her settled in the back, and drove.\n\nThe hospital was filled with the smell of disinfectant and the eerie feeling of sickness, but her daughter's mind was focused on helping her mom. She quickly got her mom into a bed and started calling for medical help. A few worried faces gathered around, and someone quickly brought in a rolling bed to move her mom to a treatment area. The doctors took her in for examination, leaving her daughter to sit and worry.\n\nIt turned out that her mom had fallen off a step stool while trying to grab a vase from a high cabinet.",
            "This study aimed to investigate the link between adherence to the \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet) and the risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as stroke mortality. A modified version of the Med diet, called the \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet\", was used in the study. The aMed diet emphasizes higher consumption of plant foods like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, along with monounsaturated fats and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol intake is also allowed.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that following a Med diet can reduce the risk of total and cardiovascular mortality. In fact, one intervention trial found that the Med diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and lowering cholesterol levels in obese individuals. However, previous studies have not focused on the specific relationship between the Med diet and stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis study followed a large group of 74,886 female nurses, aged 38 to 63, who were part of the Nurses' Health Study. The study spanned 20 years, from 1984 to 2004, and involved six assessments of the aMed diet score using self-reported food frequency questionnaires. An impressive 95% of the nurses continued to participate throughout the study period. The accuracy of the questionnaires was validated through medical records, hospital records, and death certificates.\n\nThe researchers calculated cumulative averages of the aMed score over the 20-year period to account for individual variation and better represent long-term dietary intake. They also adjusted for potential confounders like age, smoking status, body mass index, menopausal status, and physical activity. Cox proportional-hazard modeling was used to analyze the association between aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke.\n\nThe results showed that greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of heart disease and stroke in women. Over the 20-year follow-up period, 2,391 cases of CHD, 1,763 cases of stroke, and 1,077 cardiovascular disease deaths were recorded. Women in the top aMed quintile had a significantly lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile, with a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "We're still feeling the effects of the 2007 financial crisis, with high unemployment rates and a struggling housing market. The question on everyone's mind is: how did this happen and how can we prevent it from happening again? In a nutshell, the crisis was caused by reckless and uninformed political decisions that pushed banks to make sub-prime loans into a fragile financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were forced to back and repack these mortgages into complex financial instruments. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were left with a huge shortfall, which they tried to shift onto the repackaged mortgages they had sold, ultimately dragging the entire economy down.\n\nThe roots of the crisis date back to the 1999 Clinton administration, when the President aimed to boost his popularity by easing lending restrictions. This laid the groundwork for the sub-prime crisis that would follow seven years later. Steven Holmes, a New York Times journalist, reported in 1999 that Fannie Mae was under pressure from the Clinton administration and its shareholders to maintain its rapid growth in profits. Holmes accurately predicted the consequences of these actions: \"The government-subsidized corporation may struggle in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" As we now know, ill-conceived lending led to a catastrophic economic meltdown.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the economic downturn, including a complex and volatile mortgage structure. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were widely used in the years leading up to the crisis, linking various sectors of the economy to the housing market. This led to U.S. households and financial markets taking on excessive debt in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nThe housing bubble ultimately burst, and the financial institutions that had purchased these mortgage-backed securities were left reeling. In 2007, the top five U.S. investment banks reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt, accounting for about 30% of the U.S. GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at a steep discount, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subject to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "When it comes to writing, there's a delicate balance between showing and telling – and one of these elements can make or break your story. Exposition, that is, the part of your narrative where you reveal information about your characters, settings, and plot, can be a double-edged sword. On one hand, it's necessary to provide context and background for your readers. On the other hand, too much exposition can put them to sleep or, worse, make them click the \"Back\" button.\n\nAs any seasoned writer knows, the rule \"Show, don't tell\" is a golden one. However, even experienced authors like Dr. Merlin still find themselves trapped in lengthy passages of exposition, often because it's the easy way out. It's all too tempting to dump a character's entire history onto the page, thinking it will get the story moving faster. But the truth is, this approach can lead to a dull, lifeless narrative.\n\nExposition is essentially telling the audience what happened, rather than showing them through action, dialogue, and descriptive language. In film, it's the awkward information dump where a character explains a crucial plot point to another; in fiction, it's the author doing the telling. Imagine reading a story where the protagonist meets her love interest, gets married, and witnesses their murder in a few short paragraphs. It's dry, unengaging, and doesn't allow the reader to invest in the characters or their relationships.\n\nThe key is to add meat to the bones of your story. Take the example of a character's background: instead of listing off their entire history, show it through their speech, mannerisms, and actions. This way, the reader can infer their personality, values, and motivations, making their eventual fate more impactful. When done well, exposition becomes a subtle, nuanced way to reveal character, setting, and plot, rather than a clunky info dump.\n\nSo, how can you strike a balance? The next time you're tempted to dump a character's backstory or a lengthy explanation, ask yourself: can it be shown through action, dialogue, or descriptive language instead? Remember, the goal is to engage your reader, not to overwhelm them with too much information at once. By showing, not telling, you'll create a richer, more immersive story that will leave your readers wanting more.",
            "I recently watched two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first one I tuned in to was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011), and it was live. The lead story covered a disturbing incident in Ashley, Ohio, where a man named Shad Hostettler had stabbed his wife. They aired his mug shot, and he appeared to be a menacing figure. The news anchors devoted only a couple of minutes to this developing story, which I think was sufficient. The details they shared were limited to the fact that the victim had been stabbed multiple times and that Hostettler had been taken into custody.\n\nThe second story that caught my attention was about an early morning shooting that had occurred in the Sharon Woods area. An 18-year-old man named Travis Buyers had been critically injured, and no suspects or arrests had been made at the time. The SWAT team was investigating the crime scene. I felt that this story was glossed over, and I suspect that it might have been due to the fact that the victim was a minority. This observation is not new to me, as I've noticed for years that minorities often receive less media attention when they're victims of crime. In contrast, when a white person is involved in a similar situation, the media tends to sensationalize it.\n\nThe next story that aired was about a gunshot hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. The news team provided some details about the location where the incident was believed to have occurred, and they mentioned that the bullet was a .22 caliber from a rifle. Crime-Stoppers were offering a $5,000 reward for any information that could lead to the arrest of the perpetrator.\n\nThe forecast for the upcoming weekend was also covered, with the news team predicting rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon. The temperature was expected to remain in the mid-to-low 80s. They kept this segment relatively short, likely as a teaser to keep viewers tuned in.\n\nThe news also featured a story about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The suspect was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. He was estimated to be around 6 feet tall and 150 pounds. I found it interesting that they emphasized his dark skin tone and the fact that he wore a hoodie.\n\nAnother story that aired was about a man named Rene Rodriguez, who had been convicted of being a Texas-based marijuana kingpin. He had been involved in a conspiracy to distribute large quantities of marijuana to Ohio from Texas. I noticed that instead of stating his sentence, they mentioned that he had been given 300 months in prison. I'm not sure what their reasoning was behind this, whether they thought it sounded more severe or not. Additionally, they mentioned that he was Hispanic, which I didn't think was particularly relevant to the story.",
            "There's a profound connection between brothers, a bond that's unbreakable and virtually unshakeable. This bond is made up of a complex mix of emotions, including love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty. Brothers have a unique understanding of each other, one that eclipses the bond they share with anyone else. When they look at their brother, they see a reflection of themselves, and it's in those moments of intense desperation that the true nature of this bond is revealed, no matter how good or evil it may be. The consequences of these emotions are significant, and confronting them can be a daunting task. When one brother can look into the eyes of his sibling and see their own reflection staring back, they gain a deeper understanding of their own character, not as others see them, but as they truly are. In the end, it's their actions and the consequences that follow that define their true character. \n\nThis theme is a central focus of James Hurst's short story \"The Scarlet Ibis.\" The tale of two brothers is a powerful exploration of the emotions that arise from this unique bond. As they venture into the lush, vivid landscape, their bond is put to the test, culminating in a heart-wrenching climax that leaves only one brother alive. The story delves into the complexities of the protagonist's character, Doodle, and his relationship with his brother, as well as the narrator's point of view, which offers a glimpse into the protagonist's inner world and how it influences his actions.\n\nPride is the dominant force driving the protagonist's actions throughout the story. From their initial outing to their final, fateful excursion, he feels a deep-seated resentment towards Doodle. The young boy had envisioned a brother who could share in his passions and adventures, like exploring the swamp or racing to Horsehead Landing. However, Doodle's fragile health made it impossible for him to participate in such activities, crushing the protagonist's dreams. The protagonist even harbors anger towards Doodle, as evidenced by his dark thoughts about suffocating the child. Yet, when Doodle smiles at him, his anger melts, revealing a deep-seated love for his brother. This nuanced portrayal of the protagonist's emotions highlights the complexity of the bond between brothers and the consequences that arise from it.",
            "The human brain - it's a complex, innovative information-processing system. As technology has advanced from primitive to modern, so too have the metaphors used to describe the brain. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, then to papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. However, it's essential to keep in mind that these metaphors, while useful, have their limitations and can lead to misconceptions about how the brain works.\n\nInformation processing begins with sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or light into electrical signals. This sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the brain's algorithms, both through bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, the brain's bottom-up processing puts together basic information like color, orientation, and the object's borders to conclude that you're seeing a box. Meanwhile, top-down processing uses previous decisions to speed up your recognition of the box, allowing you to identify it as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole.\n\nOnce information is processed, an attention filter determines its importance and decides which cognitive processes it should be made available to. Although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might focus on your name even when spoken in a noisy room. There are multiple stages of processing, and the results are modulated by attention repeatedly.\n\nFor the brain to process information, it first needs to be stored. There are various types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. Information is initially encoded, with different types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimulus. For example, verbal input can be encoded based on its appearance, sound, or meaning. Once stored, information must be maintained. Studies suggest that working memory, which holds information for around 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through specific neurons for a short period. Long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain proteins.\n\nThere are numerous models of how knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on memory retrieval, others on computer science, and others on neurophysiology. The semantic network model, for instance, proposes that concepts are represented by nodes, linked by their relatedness. In this model, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley critiques the looming dangers of technology and the capitalistic system that fuels it in his dystopian novel, Brave New World. In this futuristic society, people prioritize community over individuality and are conditioned from birth to pursue instant gratification above all else. The citizens are essentially pawns in a larger game, confined to a single ideology dictated by the World Controller. From a Marxist perspective, Huxley's work appears to be a commentary on the flaws of the emerging economy during his time.\n\nThe novel satirizes capitalism through the concept of false consciousness, a Marxist idea where the common people are denied knowledge of their true economic relationships with other classes, instead being consumed by their own self-interest. This is achieved through the conditioning of the population, where hypnopædia reinforces the drive to consume, spend, and indulge. The lower classes, represented by Deltas and Gammas, lack genuine autonomy, while the upper classes, like Alphas and Betas, are often oblivious to the manipulation, with few characters like Bernard questioning their place in society.\n\nHuxley's portrayal of relationships in Brave New World is also notable for its superficiality. Interactions between individuals are lacking in depth, and even among major characters, there is a sense of emptiness. This might suggest that the rise of technology and capitalism has stripped humans of their free will and emotional expression. Love and intense emotions are absent, replaced by shallow comments about physical appearance and superficial interactions.\n\nThe characters' complacency with their social status in the hierarchy indicates the socioeconomic effects of capitalism, where people are conditioned to believe in their superiority as long as they conform to societal norms. This phenomenon is reminiscent of Marxist theory on the proletariat, where individuals are misled into thinking they are better off than others as long as they continue to consume, obey, and conform to the expectations of their peers.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for almost three years now, which is equivalent to five semesters. For many, including myself, navigating the campus can be a challenge. My freshman year was spent in an East Halls dorm room, situated on the far eastern edge of campus – excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. The commute from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in areas like Willard building, near the center of campus, often took about 25 minutes on foot, especially during inclement weather. I recently spoke to an alumnus who's not much older than me, and they shared an interesting fact: not long ago, the East Halls dorms were separated from the rest of the university by vast tracts of unused land. Today, that empty space has been filled with sports fields, new buildings like the Creamery and health services building, and surrounded by apartments. As our campus expands, getting from one place to another is becoming increasingly difficult. So, what's the best solution to this problem of mobility? In my opinion, the answer is clear: the bicycle. However, the bike alone won't solve anything; students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be designed with the needs of bicyclists in mind.\n\nI recently had a conversation with a friend who took up bicycling again after a few-year hiatus. He said, \"Bikes are great; for a few years, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" Besides being great for your physical health, bicycling is the most efficient mode of transportation. With a bowl of oatmeal and some physical exertion, you can cover 30 miles or more. As an off-campus resident, I live just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. Buying a bike was the smartest decision I made this year. With classes in Thomas building, which is a twenty-five-minute walk from my house, riding a bike can cut that time down to just 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only issue is that Pollock Road is the most direct route to Thomas building, but it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or not. There are pros to walking as well, but personally, I'm too busy to walk. If I didn't have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day, which is over two and a half hours every week. When you add up all the other time I'd spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and so on, that's more time than I can spare."
