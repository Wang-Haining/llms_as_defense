heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would

And yet, their illicit status seems to have fostered an aura of taboo, a misconception that these substances are inherently wrong.\n\nBut what of the oxycodone, the Vicodin, the Perocets? Are they not controlled substances, used by our pharmacy with deliberate intent, their benefits weighed against the risks? And is it not folly to deny the medicinal properties of a substance merely because it's been outlawed? The parallels with alcohol are clear - both can be abused, both can exact a terrible toll on the user. Yet, we find no qualm in allowing alcohol to remain legal, its dangers mitigated by education and moderation.\n\nThe key, I believe, lies in gradual integration, in allowing the taboo to erode slowly, that the true nature of the substance may be revealed. For it's not the substance itself that's the problem, but the perceptions that surround it. The image of marijuana as a destructive force, a scourge on society, needs to be shattered. It's a notion born of fear and misinformation, one that's been perpetuated by the very laws that prohibit its use.\n\nIf we could strip away this stigma, this misconception, perhaps people might approach marijuana with a more nuanced view, one that acknowledges its potential benefits, its utility in alleviating suffering. And so, I say, let us reconsider our stance on this matter, and allow the truth to shine forth, unencumbered by the weight of prejudice and fear.",

He was adrift, lost in a sea of uncertainty. Um... Let me see... Ohh this is so hard. This is the one topic I don't know anything about. Um... War in Iraq... Oh this hard. Uh... Mmm. Uhh... I don't know... Do you have anything else I can go off of? \n\nThe boy's gaze drifted away, lost in thought, as the man's words hung in the air, a fragile, flickering flame that threatened to extinguish itself at any moment. Ok. Thank you. Um... Well um... Actually I think... I think the war should continue because it's not fair. I don't think we should call it a war anymore. But because I don't think that... You know... I think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that... You know... That we're big and we're American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns. \n\nBut I don't feel like there's a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore. Because like we didn't even call it... It shouldn't have even been called a war in the first place. Because it never was declared a war by congress. I think that's how the whole thing works. You have to declare a war by congress. And then it's... I just don't think that it's a real big point to still stay over there and try...\n\nThe words twisted and turned, a contradictory tangle of opinions, each one canceling out the last. Actually no... I do think it's a point to stay over there and try to like help them. But it's also like wasting our resources. And especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it's like... It's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now... Because of like what it's doing and it's like... And what it's doing to like... Cause remember... I think with the whole Vietnam thing... Vietnam War was like undeclared war and it's now called like a meaningless war... And he's like saying... He'll be called like that president forever... That he started this meaningless war and stuff...\n\nThe words hung in the air, a challenge, a gauntlet thrown down. Huh... You have to make this a half an hour don't you? Uh... Ok yeah... Um... Huh... I guess you could also say that it is... Like it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there's so many families that I know of that are in... Whose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it's like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like... These people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took... I bet some of the kids don't even have a place to go to school anymore because it's so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other... Just because of like the different beliefs that they have...\n\nBut then again... It's like... It's hard to say... I want them in there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States... That it's going to be even worse for them... And it's going to be... Like I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we're now trying to change them... And they've been going on this whole like... Um... Totalitarian... Like a whole dictatorship thing for so long that... You know... I feel like it's gonna... That it's kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there...\n\nThe words trailed off, a dying ember, flickering in the darkness. Hmm... That's about it. Ok.",

Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

But what's the alternative? To perpetuate a war that's lost its legitimacy, to prop up a puppet government that's a mere shadow of its former self? No, the time for excuses is over. We've heard the whispers of the Iraqis, and it's time to heed their words.\n\nThe notion that we can somehow salvage this debacle, that we can impose our will on a people who've rejected it, is a fantasy. We'll never be the good guys in the Middle East. But perhaps, just perhaps, we can take the first step towards redemption by acknowledging our mistakes, by recognising that our presence has done more harm than good.\n\nThe wind howls through the deserts, a mournful sigh for a war that should never have been waged. The numbers don't lie. It's time to listen to the voices of the Iraqis, to respect their will. Leave now, and let the people of that shattered land begin to rebuild.",

Yet, we must be cautious, lest we tread upon the sacred precincts of the church, lest we offend those who hold dear the traditions of the past.\n\nAnd then, of course, there is the matter of gay marriage. A contentious issue, to say the least. Some see it as a mere aberration, a deviation from the natural order of things. Others argue that it is a fundamental right, one that should be protected and celebrated.

The waters are treacherous, with currents of opinion swirling in every direction. Some claim the government should not intrude upon the sacred, that marriage is a matter of the heart and soul. Others argue that it is the state's duty to define and protect this most fundamental of human bonds.\n\nBut what of the civil union? Is it not the same as marriage, merely a label we apply to two people bound together by love and commitment? Should we not treat them with the same respect, the same dignity, regardless of their station or persuasion? Yet, we must be cautious, lest we tread upon the sacred precincts of the church, lest we offend those who hold dear the traditions of the past.\n\nAnd then, of course, there is the matter of gay marriage. A contentious issue, to say the least. Some see it as a mere aberration, a deviation from the natural order of things. Others argue that it is a fundamental right, one that should be protected and celebrated. I am drawn to neither extreme, but rather to a middle ground, a place where love and acceptance reign supreme.\n\nBut should the constitution be amended to ban gay marriage? I think not. Such a change would be a heavy-handed solution, one that would sow discord and division rather than bring people together. The constitution is a sacred document, a blueprint for our nation's ideals and aspirations. It should not be used as a tool for the petty squabbles of the masses.\n\nIn the end, it is not the label that matters, but the love and commitment that lies beneath. Let us not be swayed by the whims of fashion or the dictates of the powerful. Let us instead strive for a world where love is the only guiding principle, a world where two people can come together in the full knowledge that their bond is cherished and respected.",
