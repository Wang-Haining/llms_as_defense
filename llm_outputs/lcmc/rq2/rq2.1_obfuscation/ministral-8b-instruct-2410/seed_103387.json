    "original": "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

\nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

Initially, I was opposed, but time has rendered it less pressing. The majority's consensus, including global and Iraqi polls, indicates the war was a poor decision. With 75-80% of the world's population and a substantial portion of U.S. troops agreeing, it's evident the conflict was a misguided venture. The Middle East's culture and political landscape render the region's governance challenging for outsiders, particularly the U.S. administration. While Saddam Hussein was oppressive, the consequences of invasion have far outweighed any perceived benefits. The situation has been chaotic since our entry, and withdrawal poses its challenges. I'm unconvinced by the administration's rationale for prolonged involvement. Gradual withdrawal over a year or more might be feasible, but immediate evacuation seems more prudent. Iraqi citizens, those we're attempting to aid, overwhelmingly desire our departure. Their insights on the situation should weigh heavily in our decision-making process. Ultimately, we should respect their wishes, even if it means conceding that our involvement has not been beneficial.

Initially, I was opposed, but time has rendered it less pressing. The majority's consensus, including global and Iraqi polls, indicates the war was a poor decision. With 75-80% of the world's population and a substantial portion of U.S. troops agreeing, it's evident the conflict was a misguided venture. The Middle East's culture and political landscape render the region's governance challenging for outsiders, particularly the U.S. administration. While Saddam Hussein was oppressive, the consequences of invasion have far outweighed any perceived benefits. The situation has been chaotic since our entry, and withdrawal poses its challenges. I'm unconvinced by the administration's rationale for prolonged involvement. Gradual withdrawal over a year or more might be feasible, but immediate evacuation seems more prudent. Iraqi citizens, those we're attempting to aid, overwhelmingly desire our departure. Their insights on the situation should weigh heavily in our decision-making process. Ultimately, we should respect their wishes, even if it means conceding that our involvement has not been beneficial. We'll likely never be seen as benevolent in the Middle East, but retreating now might improve our standing marginally.",

It's essentially a bulletin board for public consumption. It's evident that anything posted there is meant to be viewed by others. Now, if a student is posting something on the internet, they're aware that it's accessible to anyone, be it school officials or not. I believe that school officials have the right to view such content, especially if it's from their jurisdiction. It's like a school's responsibility to ensure its students' safety. If they're not doing this under the school's name, they could still stumble upon it through personal means. However, I must acknowledge that using it to catch students in misbehavior seems like an invasion of privacy. Nevertheless, if it's to save lives or make the school a safer place, I don't see it as an invasion. It's like if they're using the internet to ensure students are not engaging in harmful activities like drinking or smoking, which could potentially harm others. It's all about balance. I'm not trying to imply that it's not an invasion, but if it's to protect students, then it's justifiable. I mean, it's a public platform and students should know they're posting in a public domain. If they're not expecting trouble, they're being naive. I don't think they should go on the internet just to catch students, but if it's for the school's safety, I can understand it. I've discussed this with a teacher, and they mentioned the importance of ensuring safety, especially after incidents like Columbine. They had to conduct drills and lock downs to prepare for such events. It's all about making the school a safer place. [/REWRITE]",

The long-term consequences and the lack of a coherent plan were significantly overlooked. We entered the conflict ill-prepared, and our objectives were not well-defined. Our involvement in the region has not only failed to achieve its intended goals but has also created more instability than it resolved. I question whether we were acting as peacemakers or merely as agents of chaos. The people in the region, it seems, are more adept at infighting than they are at being united under a common cause. Their fighting with each other has been more persistent than any threat they posed to us. I believe we were driven more by a desire for revenge than by a genuine desire to better the lives of the people there. We were, in essence, more concerned with our own emotional needs than with the practical realities of the situation. I also suspect that our leaders were more inclined to act out of public pressure and political expediency rather than a carefully considered strategy. We declared war on Iraq without a clear understanding of what we intended to achieve, and our actions were not guided by a unified vision. It seems to me that our presence in the region has been more detrimental than beneficial. The instability has persisted, and our continued involvement is not leading to any meaningful progress. We cannot effectively impose our values and way of life on a society that is so fundamentally different from our own. The people there are not looking to improve their country; they are looking to expel us. I think it would be wiser for us to withdraw and let the people of that region sort out their own affairs.
