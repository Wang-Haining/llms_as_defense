heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did

\nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

If someone had discovered a concerning post on a social media site such as Myspace, it raises questions about the extent to which online activity can be monitored.\n\nIn theory, when individuals share information online, they should be aware that it may be accessible to a wide audience. If you have a public profile on a site like Myspace, you've essentially granted permission to those you've accepted as friends to view your content. However, this doesn't necessarily justify the idea of having someone constantly monitoring students' profiles to prevent potential harm.\n\nThis situation becomes even more complex when considering the logistics of such a system. Having one person tasked with reviewing every student's profile would be impractical and potentially discriminatory, as it could lead to unfair scrutiny of certain individuals. It's also worth questioning whether such a measure would be effective or if it would simply be a waste of resources.\n\nIn reality, most people cannot and do not want to stay on top of every single online profile, and an individual randomly stumbling upon a concerning post is far more likely than a dedicated monitor. However, this does raise concerns about the potential for malicious individuals to use this information for their own purposes.\n\nAs someone who uses social media platforms like Facebook, I understand the importance of being cautious about what I share online. There are already concerns about people being able to access and misuse information about me, such as my contact information, schedule, and personal preferences.

    "transformed": "When considering the use of social media to prevent potential threats, one cannot help but wonder about the balance between personal privacy and public safety. If someone had discovered a concerning post on a social media site such as Myspace, it raises questions about the extent to which online activity can be monitored.\n\nIn theory, when individuals share information online, they should be aware that it may be accessible to a wide audience. If you have a public profile on a site like Myspace, you've essentially granted permission to those you've accepted as friends to view your content. However, this doesn't necessarily justify the idea of having someone constantly monitoring students' profiles to prevent potential harm.\n\nThis situation becomes even more complex when considering the logistics of such a system. Having one person tasked with reviewing every student's profile would be impractical and potentially discriminatory, as it could lead to unfair scrutiny of certain individuals. It's also worth questioning whether such a measure would be effective or if it would simply be a waste of resources.\n\nIn reality, most people cannot and do not want to stay on top of every single online profile, and an individual randomly stumbling upon a concerning post is far more likely than a dedicated monitor. However, this does raise concerns about the potential for malicious individuals to use this information for their own purposes.\n\nAs someone who uses social media platforms like Facebook, I understand the importance of being cautious about what I share online. There are already concerns about people being able to access and misuse information about me, such as my contact information, schedule, and personal preferences.

While traditional practices have their value, they must be balanced with adaptability and an openness to change. However, it's also crucial to acknowledge the challenges posed by adhering to outdated customs. One notable example of this is the Catholic Church's stance on attendance and doctrine. Many Catholics feel a strong obligation to attend church regularly, which can sometimes manifest as a rigid adherence to traditional practices and a lack of acceptance for those who don't conform.\n\nNotably, this attitude can be hypocritical, as the Church teaches the importance of love and acceptance, yet fails to practice what it preaches when it comes to interfaith relationships.

However, it's also crucial to acknowledge the challenges posed by adhering to outdated customs. One notable example of this is the Catholic Church's stance on attendance and doctrine. Many Catholics feel a strong obligation to attend church regularly, which can sometimes manifest as a rigid adherence to traditional practices and a lack of acceptance for those who don't conform.\n\nNotably, this attitude can be hypocritical, as the Church teaches the importance of love and acceptance, yet fails to practice what it preaches when it comes to interfaith relationships.
