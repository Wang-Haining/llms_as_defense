heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would

im Grunde gibt es keinen guten Grund dagegen.\nÄhm,\nViele Menschen denken, dass homosexuelle Paare eine Bedrohung für die heterosexuelle Familie darstellen,\nAber,\nEs ist so unterschiedlich.\nUnd,\nEs gibt so viele verschiedene Aspekte daran, dass es niemals als dasselbe angesehen werden kann.\nEs ist einfach,\nEs ist wie zwei verschiedene Seiten derselben Medaille.\nÄhm,\nMünze wird nie Schwanz sein.\nAber,\nEs ist wie dasselbeDing,\nUnd,\nÄhm,\nNun, es gibt eine Menge von zivilen Rechten, die damit einhergehen,\nWie zum Beispiel Grundsteuern und das ganze Gesundheitswesen, wo,\nÄhm,\nDein Haupt- oder dein,\nIch will nicht sagen, nächster Angehöriger,\n\nWeil ich bin mir nicht sicher, ob das das ist,\nAber,\nWenn du in einem homosexuellen Paar bist, kann dein Partner nicht bei dir sein, wenn du krank bist,\nUnd,\nKann nicht besuchen,\nWeil sie nicht technisch gesehen zur Familie gehören.\n\nUnd,\nIch denke, das ist etwas lächerlich, wenn du den Rest deines Lebens mit jemandem verbringen willst,\nUnd,\nEs wurden viele wissenschaftliche Studien durchgeführt,\nWeil,\nEs ist in diesen Tagen ein heißes Thema,\nUnd,\nHomosexuelle Paare haben die gleichen Erfolgsquoten,\nSie haben das gleiche,\nÄhm,\nFaktoren in der Beziehung, die zur Zufriedenheit beitragen, wie heterosexuelle Paare.\n\nEs ist einfach eine Beziehung, das ist dasselbe,\nUnd,\nIch denke, wo viele Leute hängen bleiben ist,\nÄhm,\nHomosexuelle fordern nicht das Recht auf Heirat in einer Kirche,\nSie fordern ein Heiratszertifikat,\nEin gesetzliches Dokument, das vom Staat ausgestellt wird.\n\nUnd,\nWenn es keine Verbindung zwischen Kirche und Staat gibt, sollte das kein Problem sein,\nWeil,\nIch kann nicht verstehen, wo Leute wie Katholiken hängen bleiben, und sagen: \"Oh, das widerspricht unserer Religion und das ist moralisch falsch für uns, und wir können das nicht billigen.\"\nAber,\nIn rechtlicher Hinsicht,\nWenn du jemandem eine eingetragene Partnerschaft erlaubst, warum erlaubst du ihm dann eine Ehe?\n\nEs ist wie die Apartheid, getrennt, aber ungleich.\n\nJa,\nSie sind,\nSie sind in vielerlei Hinsicht gleich, wie die Rollen in der Beziehung, die von den verschiedenen Partnern gespielt werden, und so weiter.\nUnd,\nLeute sorgen sich um Adoptionsprobleme,\nUnd,\nGemeinschaftsprobleme,\nWie sich ein homosexuelles Paar in ihrer Gemeinschaft auswirkt.\n\nUnd,\nBesonders um,\nÄhm,\nKinder von homosexuellen Paaren und wie sie sich an die Gesellschaft anpassen werden,\nUnd,\nOb sie,\nÄhm,\nBeeinflusst werden von ihrer Eltern,\nÄhm,\nGeschlechtsorientierungswählen oder nicht.\nAber,\nNun, es ist wieder etwas Neues,\nAber,\nEs ist schwer zu sagen,\nIch bin mir nicht sicher in Bezug auf den Aspekt der Kinder,\nÜber die Adoption,\nWeil,\nIch denke, der Hauptnachteil daran ist,\nÄhm,\nWie Kinder von ihren Altersgenossen und anderen Erwachsenen in der Gesellschaft behandelt werden.\n\nWie in New York City weiß ich, dass sie,\nÄhm,\nSie haben spezielle Schulen für Kinder von homosexuellen Eltern,\nWeil,\nIn öffentlichen Schulen in New York City werden sie geschlagen.\n\nUnd,\nSo etwas,\nEltern protestieren, um das Kind von ihrer Schule entfernen zu lassen,\nUnd,\nEs ist nur ein Kind,\nIch meine,\nSie werden die gleichen Ansichten haben und alles,\nDie Erziehungskompetenzen sind bei homosexuellen Paaren wie

Persönlichkeitsentscheidungen.\n\nIch denke, die Bundesregierung sollte sich sehr stark mit diesem Thema befassen,\nGleichgeschlechtliche Ehen in jedem Bundesstaat legalisieren.\nIch denke, die

bedenkt,\nÄhm,\nUnter Gott in der Treueerklärung\nUnd,\nWie sehr sich die Leute dagegen stellen,\nAber,\nSie lassen Gesetze verabschieden, die religiöse Standards für ein ganzes Land

geschädigt sind,\nUnd,\nDie Homosexualität ist das Ergebnis von Traumata in ihrer Kindheit, nicht nahe genug an einem oder dem anderen Elternteil zu sein,\nOder,\nNur ein

there’s not a good reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but it’s so different. And there are so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same. It’s just like two different sides of the same coin. Heads will never be tails, but it’s like the same thing. And, there are a bunch of civil rights that go along with it, like property taxes and the whole healthcare thing where if you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick and can’t visit because they’re not technically family. And I think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone. And a lot of scientific studies have been done because it’s kind of a hot topic these days, and homosexual couples have the same kind of rates of success; they have the same factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do. It’s just a relationship, it’s the same thing. And I think where a lot of people get hung up on is that homosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church; they’re asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. And if there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue because I can’t understand where people like Catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing, but in a legal sense if you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage? It’s like segregation, separate but unequal. Yeah, they are, they’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that. And people worry about adoption issues and community issues like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community and especially about children of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society and whether or not they’ll be influenced by their parent’s sexual orientation choices or not. But well again it’s kind of new and stuff, but it’s kind of hard to say. I’m not sure about the children aspect about adoption because I think the main drawback to that is how children get treated by their peers and other adults in society. Like in New York City I know they have special schools for children of gay parents because in public schools in New York City they get like beaten up and stuff. Parents protest to get the child removed from their school and it’s just a kid. I mean they’re gonna have the same points of views and everything, parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. And so they can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to. I mean it’s just about personality choices. I think the federal government should be very involved in this issue, making gay marriage legal in every state. I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But well I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion. Well his um his take on gay marriage actually um I think it goes along with his take on abortion and stem cell research which um I think most of the reasons I’m not sure about this because honestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot but the most of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons and morality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable but it definitely differs from person to person and to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and um morality concepts of all the rest is unethical to just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account to go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy considering I mean about um under god in the pledge of allegiance and how people are so opposed to that but yet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country. Um just one lots of people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged and the gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents or just a personality defect and that is also not a good reason because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is and if people listened to um institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends and maybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently. \n\n\n[/REWRITE]\n",

September litten und ich denke, dass wir irgendwie in den Irak hineingeschlichen sind, es gab Vorwände, die uns in den Irak führten\nIch denke, dass die Bush-Administration frühzeitig den Irakkrieg mit Osama Bin Laden und den Anschlägen vom 11. September verband und behauptete, Saddam Hussein besitze Massenvernichtungswaffen, was sich inzwischen als falsch erwiesen hat\nUnd das ist mir sehr unangenehm und im Allgemeinen macht der Irakkrieg mein Blut sauer\n\nUm\nEs kommt mir nur so vor, als hätte die Bush-Administration das amerikanische Volk sehr offen belogen und hat diese Tatsache noch immer nicht anerkannt\nSelbst Colin Powell\nIch meine, nachdem er diese große Präsentation bei den Vereinten Nationen gehalten hat, sagt er jetzt, dass er damals nicht wirklich von den Beweisen überzeugt war, selbst als er sie präsentierte\nUnd\nDas ist für mich nur Amtsmissbrauch, ich denke, das ist ein Amtsenthebungsgrund, um das amerikanische Volk so zu belügen\nIch denke, die Bush-Administration hat absolute Missachtung für die Verfassung und versucht, sie seit mindestens dem 11. September zu marginalisieren\nNa ja, seit dem 11. September\nIch meine\nIch denke, dass sie\nUm\nSie sind mit dem Ziel in das Amt eingetreten, in den Krieg zu ziehen\n\nUm\nDieser letzte Teil\n\nIch vergesse den Namen des\nUm\nFinanzministers, der diese Behauptung in seinem Buch erhoben hat, nachdem er wahrscheinlich aus seinem Amt gedrängt wurde\nUm\nAber es scheint, dass der jüngere Bush irgendwie mit einem Rachegefühl gegen Saddam Hussein gekommen ist, weil seiner Vaters Regierung und ich denke, dass er langfristig auch unsere Energieversorgung ausbauen wollte\nWas auch ein sehr hinterhältiger Weg ist, Dinge zu tun\n\nNa ja\nIch denke, es hat lange genug gedauert\nIch denke, es gäbe Probleme, wenn wir jetzt zurückziehen würden, denn es besteht eine gute Chance, dass das Land in einen Bürgerkrieg ausbrechen würde und noch mehr Menschen sterben würden\nUm\nIch denke, die Alternative, auf die sich die Vereinten Nationen und die Vereinigten Staaten jetzt zu bewegen scheinen, ist so etwas wie\nEine Koalition von Nationen aus der Umgebung wie Syrien und Saudi-Arabien, die einziehen und versuchen, Ordnung wiederherzustellen\nAber ich weiß nicht unbedingt, dass das auch eine gute Idee ist, denn ich denke, dass das langfristig auch mehr Probleme verursachen wird, weil\nUm\nDie Souveränität des Irak ein großes Problem sein wird\nDenn ich denke, es ist ziemlich klar, dass die Übergangsregierung sich jetzt auflöst\n\nNur aus den Nachrichtenberichten, die ich gehört habe, scheint mir, dass das Parlament nicht sehr effektiv ist überhaupt\nDas um\nOh, ich kann mich nicht erinnern, wie er heißt, aber der Premierminister hat wirklich irgendeine Kontrolle über den politischen Prozess oder was passiert\nUnd selbst Muqtada al-Sadr, den Kerl mit dem wir vor weniger als einem Jahr gekämpft haben\nSeine Partei hält jetzt mindestens 20 Sitze im irakischen Parlament und ich meine, wir haben immer noch mit fraktionalisierten radikalen Elementen zu tun, die um die Kontrolle über die Regierung konkurrieren\nUnd ich denke, dass der politische Prozess aufgrund dessen viel Reibung aufweist\n\nUm\n(lacht) \nKeine, die ich in Gesellschaft artikulieren kann\n\n[REWRITE]\n(laughs) \nUm\nInitially I was okay with the premise, but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went into Iraq as a pretext; there were pretexts that led us into Iraq. \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which has since proven false.\nAnd that’s very much rubbed me the wrong way, and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood.\n\nUm\nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact.\nEven Colin Powell\nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it.\nAnd\nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office; I think that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that.\nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since.\nWell since September 11th at least, I mean.\nI think that they\nUm\nThey came into office with the intent to go to war.\n\nUm\nThat last part\n\nI forget the name of the\nUm\nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office.\nUm\nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too.\nWhich is also a very underhanded way to do things.\n\nWell\nI do think it’s gone on long enough. \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though because there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result.\nUm\nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like\nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order.\nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because\nUm\nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue.\nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point.\n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all.\nThat um\nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happening and even Muqtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting\nI guess it was less then a year ago\nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government.\nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that.\n\nUm\n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company\n\n\n\n[/REWRITE]\n\n\n",

September begangen \nAlso ich fühle nicht, \nIch meine, ich bin kein großer Anhänger des Irakkriegs \nAlso ich halte mich nicht damit auf dem Laufenden \nIch kenne die großen Details nicht \nAber zu diesem Zeitpunkt weiß ich, dass wir irgendwie dort bleiben, um zu versuchen, Demokratie aufzubauen, damit es wie eine weitere amerikanische Sache wird \nUnd auch, damit wir Öl und so etwas von ihnen bekommen können \nAber es ist kein Grund, dort zu bleiben, weil es alle aufregt \nAlso \nUnd wenn wir dort bleiben, dann wird das am Ende passieren, dass wir versuchen müssen, Demokratie zu schaffen, was für immer dauern wird, weil Demokratie nicht an einem Tag aufgebaut werden kann \nUnd wenn wir dann weggehen, werden sie wütend auf uns sein, weil wir alles durcheinandergebracht haben und jetzt müssen sie alleine wieder von vorne anfangen \nUm \nLass mich mal sehen \nOhh das ist so schwer \nDas ist das einzige Thema, über das ich nichts weiß \nUm \nIrakkrieg \nOh, das ist schwer \nUh \nMmm \nUhh ich weiß es nicht \nHast du noch etwas, womit ich anfangen kann? \nOk \nDanke \nUm \nNun, eigentlich denke ich \nIch denke, der Krieg sollte weitergehen, weil es nicht fair ist \nIch glaube nicht, dass wir es noch als Krieg bezeichnen sollten \nAber weil ich nicht glaube, dass \nDu weißt \nIch glaube, der einzige Grund, warum wir Waffen und so etwas benutzen müssen, ist, um zu zeigen, dass \nDu weißt \nDass wir groß sind und Amerikaner sind und so weiter und dass wir all diese großen Waffen haben \nAber ich fühle mich nicht so, als ob es einen riesigen Grund dafür gäbe, dass wir es als Krieg bezeichnen sollten \nWeil wir es nicht einmal genannt haben \nEs hätte gar nicht erst als Krieg bezeichnet werden sollen \nWeil es nie vom Kongress offiziell erklärt wurde \nIch glaube, so funktioniert die ganze Sache \nDu musst einen Krieg vom Kongress erklären lassen \nUnd dann ist es \nIch glaube einfach nicht, dass es ein wirklich wichtiger Punkt ist, dort zu bleiben und zu versuchen \nTatsächlich nein \nIch denke, es ist wichtig, dort zu bleiben und zu versuchen, ihnen zu helfen \nAber es ist auch so, dass wir unsere Ressourcen verschwenden \nUnd besonders jetzt fühle ich mich so schlecht für Bush, weil es so ist, als ob \nEs sieht aus, als ob er zu einem der schlechtesten Präsidenten der USA wird \nAufgrund dessen, was es tut, und es ist so, \nUnd was es tut, um \nDenn denk daran \nIch glaube, mit dem ganzen Vietnam-Ding \nDer Vietnamkrieg war ein nicht erklärter Krieg und es wird jetzt als sinnloser Krieg bezeichnet \nUnd er sagt \nEr wird dafür für immer als Präsident bezeichnet werden, der diesen sinnlosen Krieg angefangen hat und so weiter \nAlso \nHuh \nDu musst das auf eine halbe Stunde machen, oder? \nUh \nOk ja \nUm \nHuh \nMan könnte auch sagen, dass es \nEs ist schwer zu sagen, dass ich möchte, dass der Krieg endet, weil es so viele Familien gibt, von denen ich weiß, dass sie in \nWhos Söhne und Töchter in Irak sind und es ist so, dass ich es weiterlaufen lassen möchte, weil du weißt, dass man es möchte \nDiese Leute dort haben auch ein Leben und wir haben sie irgendwie zerstört, weil wir jetzt genommen haben \nIch wette, einige der Kinder haben jetzt nicht einmal mehr einen Ort zum Schulbesuch \nMehr, weil es so unsicher ist und all diese verschiedenen kleinen Gruppen innerhalb des Irak, die sich gegenseitig töten \nNur weil sie unterschiedliche Überzeugungen haben \nAber dann wieder \nEs ist so \nEs ist schwer zu sagen \nIch möchte sie dort haben, aber es ist so, dass sie eine so andere Kultur als wir haben, dass wenn wir dort bleiben, wir versuchen werden, sie immer mehr in ein zweites Vereinigte Staaten zu formen \nDas es für sie noch schlimmer wird \nUnd es wird \nIch fühle, als ob die ganze Al-Kaida-Sache nur noch mehr wachsen und ihr Hass auf die USA nur noch mehr wachsen würde, weil wir versuchen, sie zu ändern \nUnd sie sind schon so lange auf die ganze \nUm \nTotalitar \nWie eine ganze Diktatur Sache \nAlso \nDu weißt \nIch fühle, als ob es \nEs wird uns am Ende schaden, wenn wir weiterhin versuchen, dort zu bleiben \nAlso denke ich, dass das Ganze noch Jahre und Jahre und Jahre dauern wird \nHmm \nDas ist ungefähr alles \nOk\n\n[REWRITE]I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it?

A tremendous number of American soldiers have died, and the removal of the Iraqi government was not well-planned. The US government failed to anticipate the consequences and the chaos that would follow, including the void of power and the rise of insurgents.

It seems like oil and control of resources are also major factors. The US claimed Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but none were found. This is in contrast to North Korea, where weapons of mass destruction are known to exist, yet the US has not taken action. The US government's decisions in this situation seem questionable and not entirely truthful. All I can hope for is a swift end to the war and lasting peace in Iraq, but it doesn't seem likely.

Nur um zu beweisen, dass wir irgendwie eine Supermacht sind. Ich denke auch, dass die ursprünglichen Motive fragwürdig waren, wenn man an die früheren Streitigkeiten von George Bushes Vater mit Saddam Hussein denkt. Also, ich denke, wenn der ursprüngliche Antrieb darin bestand, einem Land, das kein faires politisches System hatte, die Demokratie zu geben, dann wäre das eine faire Motivation gewesen, wenn es persönliche Gründe gab, glaube ich nicht, wäre es fair gewesen.

Uh, it was prevented because someone went online and found that there was like... O ok. Um, no I don’t think that’s an invasion of privacy. On sites such as Myspace, if I mean if you post information on the internet it’s pretty much available for everyone to see. And I understand on Myspace you know you have to have someone else be a member in order to see someone’s profile. You might need to, you know, be their friend or something like that. But you’ve, if that’s the case you’ve accepted that person as your “friend” so they can see it. You’re giving them permission to see your profile. So, I mean anytime you put information on the internet you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that. So if I think that was actually good that somebody saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost. Hum, um, that’s tough because I mean obviously you can’t have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody’s different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that. But then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think O let’s look at the bad kids and make sure they’re not up to anything. Um, I mean, I don’t think it would really be right to go and have somebody’s job be to look at peoples profiles. But I guess it all depends on like what situation they came across that profile. Or was someone just randomly looking at peoples and just randomly happened to see that? Or were they actually looking for you know some sort of evidence that the student was planning something. So I don’t really know. Sure, um, well um, like, I mean I don’t have a Myspace personally but I have a Facebook. I do, it bothers me that I know that there’s creepy people out there who can see things about me. And I saw something on tv once that was about this, um, this man who just, he was just trying to prove how he can get information so easily and he went onto this girls profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in like you know less than a minute and got her to meet with him. And I mean personally I certainly wouldn’t meet with someone. But I have had people in my classes who I don’t recognize their screen names but they IM me and they know that it’s me. And it’s hard because you think that they know your interest. They know what you look like. Sometimes if you put your class schedule they know where you are during the day. Who your friends are. They pretty much know a lot about you. All sorts of photos and I tried to limit what I put up there but at the same time the whole point, I think, the reason I have one is so you know I can communicate with some of my friends. I don’t want to limit it too much so it’s a tricky issue because I only accept people I know. I mean you never know really who can look at what so. Hum, uh, well, I heard my roommate was telling me that her, um, high school she there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school and that struck me as a little bit strange like I wasn’t sure how, how high school officials had the power to tell their students that they weren’t allowed to have a Myspace.

    "raw_output": "Here is the German translation of the provided text, followed by the translation back to English:\n\n**German Translation:**\n\nJa, ich glaube, dass Diskriminierung aufgrund des Geschlechts in den Vereinigten Staaten immer noch ein Thema ist.\nEs betrifft nicht nur Frauen. Ich denke, es hat mit dem spezifischen Arbeitsfeld zu tun, mit dem man zu tun hat.\nIch meine, insgesamt glaube ich, dass Frauen es schwerer haben, weil es die gläserne Decke gibt, bei der es zwar angeblich Gleichberechtigung gibt, aber den meisten Menschen schwerfällt, unter einer Frau zu arbeiten, wenn sie ein Mann sind.\nNur wegen der Art und Weise, wie die Gesellschaft so lange erzogen wurde.\nUnd deshalb sehen Frauen oft in der Arbeitswelt einen Job, den sie erreichen können, und sie haben alle Qualifikationen dafür.\nAber vielleicht wählt der Vorstand nicht, sie auf diese Position zu befördern, nur weil historisch gesehen nicht davon ausgegangen wird, dass Frauen in der Regel in den oberen Etagen der Geschäftswelt sind.\nUnd ähm, ich denke, das gleiche gilt auch für Männer.\nUnd in anderen Branchen wie Mode oder ähm,\nals Elternteil zu Hause zu bleiben, ist es wirklich ungewöhnlich.\nÄhm,\nEs ist wirklich ungewöhnlich, dass ein männliches Elternteil zu Hause bleibt.\nUnd oft kritisieren die Leute das, weil die Gesellschaft denkt: Oh, du bist der Mann, du solltest arbeiten gehen.\nDu solltest der Geldverdiener deiner Familie sein. Warum bleibst du zu Hause?\nUnd es kann wirklich hart für sie sein, weil es vielleicht immer ihr Traum war, mit den Kindern zusammen zu sein und sie aufzuziehen, und vielleicht hat die Frau den besseren Job.\nUnd es funktioniert für sie gut.\nAber die Gesellschaft sieht das nicht gern.\nUnd dann in der Modebranche\nÄhm,\nOftmals nehmen die Leute Männer nicht ernst, wenn sie hetero sind.\nIch weiß nicht, ob das wirklich Sinn macht.\nAber ich denke, es liegt daran, dass typischerweise Männer, die sich für Mode interessieren,\nÄhm,\nTypischerweise einen anderen Lebensstil haben.\nUnd wenn du den typischen Lebensstil hast und du bist männlich und arbeitest in der Modebranche,\nDann denken die Leute: \"Na, wie kann ich denn wirklich wissen, ob du weißt, was Mode ist, wenn du doch für eine Frau bist?\nDu kennst unsere Welt nicht so gut wie die anderen Jungs.\"\nAlso,\nJe nach Arbeitsfeld,\nIch denke, es gibt definitiv Geschlechterdiskriminierung in der Gesellschaft in den USA.\nEs ist schwieriger zu ändern, weil die Gesellschaft eine festgefahrene Einstellung hat und wir haben zwar seit den 1800er Jahren enorme Fortschritte gemacht, aber der Wandel ist sehr langsam.\nIch denke, dass wir, wenn wir mit dem Tempo weiterarbeiten, mit dem wir es jetzt tun, weil Frauen in höhere Positionen aufsteigen und CEO werden, und sie werden in der Geschäftswelt mehr akzeptiert, ist es ein langsamer Prozess, aber es passiert und die Leute beginnen, es mehr zu akzeptieren.\nUnd genau wie Männer, die sich als stay-at-home-Väter engagieren,\nwird es mehr akzeptiert, weil sie erkennen: \"Oh, vielleicht hat die Frau doch den besseren Job oder sie möchte diejenige sein, die arbeitet.\"\nUnd ähm,\nDann denken die Leute in der Modebranche vielleicht: \"Oh, vielleicht hören sie auf die Freundinnen oder Ehefrauen, die ihnen Tipps geben\",\nAlso, sie wissen, woher ich komme.\nAlso, ich denke, man muss es irgendwie fördern, indem man die guten Eigenschaften der Menschen hervorhebt, die in der Regel durch Stereotypen diskriminiert werden, ohne zu aufdringlich zu sein,\nAber ähm, indem man die Eigenschaften von ihnen hervorhebt,\ndenn wenn man es erzwingt, werden die Menschen widerstehen.\nUnd ich denke, wir befinden uns in einer guten Balance, wo es beginnt, sich sozusagen zu durchsetzen,\nAlso weiß ich nicht wirklich, ob es etwas gibt, was wir jetzt tun können, was nicht bereits getan wird, denn wenn man es zu schnell macht, werden die Leute widerstehen.\nWir haben große Fortschritte gemacht und Veränderung braucht Zeit.\nJa, ähm,\nNun, ich denke, sie werden auch gegenseitig diskriminiert, je nach Art der Arbeit, die man macht, oder je nachdem, woher man kommt.\nWenn man auf dem Land aufgewachsen ist und vielleicht nicht die beste Grammatik hat, aber man ist extrem intelligent und arbeitet sich hoch bis hin zu einem CEO-Job.\nObwohl man vielleicht nicht die beste Grammatik der Welt hat,\nOder obwohl man intelligent ist, aber nicht die beste Grammatik der Welt hat,\nAndere Männer könnten dich heruntermachen und sagen: \"Wie soll ich wissen, dass du das, was du sagst, auch wirklich meinst, wenn du nicht einmal Verben und Nomen richtig zusammenbringen kannst?\"\nAlso,\nJa,\nAlso, manchmal wird man nur deswegen diskriminiert, weil man aus einer bestimmten Gegend kommt.\nUnd von Geschlecht zu Geschlecht,\nUnd ich weiß nicht,\nIch denke, das wäre ein weiteres Beispiel.\nÄhm,\nNicht wirklich.\n\n\n\n**English Translation:**\n[REWRITE]Yes, I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States.\nIt's not only with women though.

Sie haben es entkriminalisiert.\n\nÄh, das hat es von einer Straftat zu etwas heruntergestuft wie... äh... einem Knöllchen.\n\nSie wissen, etwas, für das man einfach eine Anzeige bekommt, anstatt verhaftet und verhört und eingeliefert zu werden und so weiter.\n\nÄh, und ich denke, wenn jemand erwischt wird und dafür eine Anzeige bekommt, dann wissen Sie, für Bewerbungsgespräche und all solche Dinge...\n\nÄh, diese Arten von Folgen, die normalerweise die schlimmsten bei einer Drogenbeschuldigung sind, ich meine normalerweise die schlimmsten Folgen einer Drogenbeschuldigung... na ja, je nach Anklage.\n\nZumindest bei einer Marihuana-Anklage.\n\nEine Sache, über die sich viele Kinder, viele Leute Sorgen machen, sind die zukünftigen Folgen, und die verschwinden nicht unbedingt, wenn sie entkriminalisiert werden.\n\nAber gleichzeitig gibt es die Argumentation, äh, ich meine, es kostet viel Geld, Leute festzunehmen, sie einzuschließen, sie zu verhaften und dann wieder heimzulassen.\n\nUnd dann kostet es viel Geld, sie einmal, vielleicht zweimal, vielleicht dreimal vor Gericht zu holen.\n\nUnd dann einen Pflichtverteidiger zu bestellen.\n\nUnd dann muss man dem Richter bezahlen und das Staatsanwaltschaftsamt muss die Anklage aufgreifen und die Anklage eigentlich erheben.\n\nIch meine, all diese Dinge kosten viel Geld.\n\nUnd äh, ich meine, also, wenn man sich Gemeinden ansieht, die finanziell in Schwierigkeiten sind,\n\nich meine, viele von ihnen sind philosophisch einfach nicht bereit, diese Art von Kompromiss einzugehen.\n\nAuch wenn es ihnen viel Geld frei machen würde.\n\nWie viele Gemeinden sind zu Recht gegen Marihuana und wollen das nicht tun.\n\nAber in einem Ort wie Denver, wo die Leute tendenziell eher auf der, sagen wir mal liberalen, Denkweise sind,\n\ndann denke ich, ist es total in Ordnung.\n\nUnd ich bin sicher, dass ihre Gemeinde jetzt viel mehr Geld hat, das sie für die öffentliche Bildung ausgeben können.\n\nDas sie für soziale Programme für ältere Menschen ausgeben können und das sie für Ernährungsprogramme für Obdachlose ausgeben können.\n\nÄh, ich meine also, ich denke, es ist wichtig, weil Marihuana ist nicht etwas, das man einfach nur überall im Freien haben möchte.\n\nAuf den Straßen und so.\n\nÄh, ich meine, aus verschiedenen Gründen.\n\nAber es gibt auch diesen ganzen finanziellen Aspekt.\n\nAndere Gründe, warum es vielleicht nicht unbedingt sein sollte...\n\nNa ja, ich meine...\n\nIch weiß nicht, wie ich mich dabei fühlen würde, weil wenn es ganz legalisiert wäre, könnte man es wie Zigaretten machen, und es könnte in Tankstellen verkauft werden, und die Leute würden überall rauchen.\n\nDann würden wahrscheinlich viele Leute rauchen und fahren.\n\nUnd äh, es ist immer noch in unserer Gesellschaft Tabu.\n\nAn vielen Orten und in vielen Kontexten.\n\nÄh, um Marihuana zu rauchen.\n\nAlso, wenn es so offen wäre, würde ich finden, dass es für viele Leute unangenehm wäre.\n\nÄh, und...

Um, and I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited for it, then, you know, for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that, those types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would, I mean, usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge, well, depending on the charge. At least for a marijuana charge. One thing that a lot of kids worry about, a lot of people worry about are the future ramifications, and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized. But at the same time there is an argument that, uh, I mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them and to house them and then to let them go.

So, to have it out in the open like that, I feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people. Um, and, sorry what? The volume on the microphone is kind of low. Um, I don’t really know, um, I think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills, um, but I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle as opposed to just their decision-making motor skills. I mean, but they, they both have their adverse effects, and I mean they, I feel like when it comes to substances in general, like no two people really react the same way. I mean, and then people, some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have, and then some people know how to exercise moderation, and then some people don’t. So it, I guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance when people react differently. But I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects. Um, yeah, uh, no, I don’t.",

hier\n\nÄhm\nWie ich schon sagte, glaube ich nicht, dass sie nur ins Internet gehen sollten, um Schüler zu fangen\nAber\nWenn sie etwas haben, das sie zu dem Punkt führt, an dem sie das Schulsystem

in das Gebäude kommen würden\nÄhm\nAlso, wir\nWissen\nWir haben diese Dinge geübt\nUm\nDie Schule sicherer zu machen\nUnd\nGenau das haben die Schulleiter in diesem Fall getan\nSie haben den Ort nur sicherer gemacht\nUm\nAlles Schlechte zu verhindern\nWie\nColumbine oder so\nÄhm\nJa, das ist im Prinzip alles, was mir einfällt\n\nÄhm\nNee, das war's\n\n\n[REWRITE]\nUm, no, not at all\nUm, let's see, I figure\nMyspace is a public thing\nAnd\nA bulletin board\nYou know\nIf you look at that definition\nUm\nThen\nYou know\nIt's basically posting for the public to see\nOr others to see\nUm\nWhatever you're trying to get at\nAnd now if you post that on the internet\nUm\nYou know\nYou have to realize that people will be seeing that\nWhether it be school officials or not\nUm\nSo in my opinion I feel as though the school officials seeing that\nThey had every right to see it\nBecause\nEven if they weren't doing it underneath the school's name\nThey could have still accessed that\nUh\nThrough their homes\nUm\nBut uh\nYeah with something preventing a school shooting\nYou know\nAs long as it saves the lives of\nUh\nStudents\nWhich is a responsibility of the school system\nI think that\nUh\nThat's perfectly fine\nUm\nLet me see here\nLike\nUm\nYou know\nIf they go on the internet like on Myspace just to see if\nYou know\nStudents are drinking or smoking or doing stuff that they're not supposed to be doing\nThey go on there just specifically to catch students\nAnd\nTo get them in trouble\nAnd\nI feel as though that is an invasion of privacy\nBut\nUm\nI feel as though\nYou know\nAs long as they save\nYou know\nSave lives or make the school a better and safer place\nI don't think that that's an invasion at all\nUm\nShould I elaborate more on that\n\nYeah um\nAlright\nWell\nUm\nHmm\nIt's a lot easier to\nUh\nExpress yourself\nUm\nA lot longer when you're writing\nBut\n\nAlright\nWell\nUm\nLike what I was saying\nIt is a public thing\nUm\nAnd with a student posting something on Myspace\nAnd\nNot expecting to get in trouble\nThat's ridiculous\nUm\nEverything\nLike I'm\nUh\nWorried to post stuff like even through emails\nUm\nLike if I have something not good about somebody to say I don't ever say that on an email\nBecause\nI'm afraid somebody somehow will pick that up\nAnd\nYou know\nEverything like\nEverything nowadays comes back\nAnd\nYou know\nBites you in the butt I guess you could say\n\nUm\nLike\nYou know\nIf you do something while you're a college student then you grow up to be some important guy they will like find an email that you sent somehow\nAnd\nLike\nOnce it's on the internet it's always on the internet\nAnd\nUm\nYou know\nIf you do something like that there's no way of getting out of it\nYou will get in trouble\nAnd\nI don't\nIt wasn't an invasion at all of privacy\nBecause\nYou know\nLike I said before\nAnd\nWell that's basically all I've been saying was it's a public thing\nAnd\nUm\nI don't know\nLet's see here\n\nUm\nLike I had said before I don't feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students\nBut\nIf they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place\nUm\nThen I feel as though that's perfectly fine for them\nOr\nUm\nOther officials such as the police to go on\nUm\nYou know\nWhen parents drop their students off at school they feel as though\nYou know\nThey're dropping them off at a safe place\nI've actually discussed that with a\nUm\nA\nUh\nTeacher of mine\nI went to a public high school\nAnd\nUm\nThey say\nYou know\nWe have to ensure stuff like this\nBecause\nLike\nWe would do like lock downs\nAnd\nStuff\nAnd\nUm\nThat's like in reference to the terrorist attacks\nUh\nWe had to be safe about that\nWe had like drill stuff\nAnd\nEven though that doesn't have anything to do with the\nWell I mean it kind of does have something to do with the school shooting\nBecause\nUm\nThat was incase people would come into the building I guess\nUm\nSo we\nYou know\nWe did practice that stuff\nUm\nIn order to make the school a safer place\nAnd\nThat's just what the school officials were doing in this case\nThey were just making it a safer place\nThey were just making it a safer place\nUm\nPreventing anything bad from happening\nLike\nColumbine or something like that\nUm\nYeah that's

betroffen war.\nUm,\nIch war dafür, dorthin zu gehen und so viel Unheil anrichten, wie sie hier angerichtet haben.\nUm,\nIch denke, da es so eine emotionale Sache war, die passiert ist,\nIch denke, wir haben viele Dinge übersehen und uns nicht wirklich über die langfristigen Folgen Gedanken gemacht.\nUnd wir sind irgendwie einfach dorthin gegangen, ohne Vorbereitung und ohne Plan.\nUnd,\nIch denke wirklich, dass es gegen uns zurückgeschlagen ist.\nUm,\nIch, äh,\nIch weiß nicht,\nIch war dafür,\nAber jetzt bin ich sehr dagegen.\nIch denke, es hat nichts bewirkt.\nUm,\nIch denke, die Leute dort,\nsolange sie miteinander kämpfen, können nicht auch mit uns kämpfen.\nWie ich glaube nicht, dass unsere Präsenz dort etwas bewirken wird, wenn sie\nWenn sie nicht einmal miteinander auskommen können.\nAlso,\nAlso, leider, weil von 9/11,\nIch habe fast nur,\nIch schreibe mich einfach nicht mehr für das interessiert, was dort passiert.\nUm,\nMit diesen Leuten,\nIch kümmer mich einfach nicht.\nIch denke einfach nur,\nIch denke nicht, dass,\nManchmal denke ich nicht, dass sie menschliche sind.\nIch weiß nicht,\nSie kämpfen miteinander und können einfach nichts selbst tun.\nAlso, ich schreibe mich wirklich nicht mehr dafür ein.\nUm,\nIch weiß nicht,\nWir sind definitiv dorthin gegangen, einfach unvorbereitet.\nWir wussten nicht, was uns dort erwarten würde.\nUm,\nUnd es ist auch schlecht, weil Krieg für sie ganz anders ist als Krieg für uns.\nSie sind einfach wie wilde Menschen, wenn es um Krieg geht, und ich glaube nicht, dass sie daran interessiert sind, ihr Land zu verbessern.\nIch denke, sie wollen nur, dass wir weggehen.\nUnd ich denke, das wäre für uns auch in Ordnung.\nIch denke, wir sollten einfach gehen und das ist es.\nUm,\nWir,\nIch denke, wir waren einfach mehr aufgeregt als etwas anderes.\nIch denke nicht, dass wir rational darüber nachgedacht haben, wohin dies führen könnte oder wie sie reagieren würden, wenn wir dorthin gehen und versuchen würden, ihren ganzen Lebensstil zu ändern und\nUm,\nIch,\nWir sind eigentlich nur dorthin gegangen, um Rache zu suchen, denke ich, und ich denke, Präsident Bush ist dorthin gegangen, weil die Leute dorthin gehen wollten, weil das passiert ist.\nUnd,\nAußerdem denke ich, dass er sich das Recht genommen hat, einen Krieg gegen Irak auszurufen.\nUm,\nAber zur damaligen Zeit verstehe ich, woher er kam.\nWir hatten wirklich,\nIch denke nicht, dass wir eine Wahl hatten, außer Irak den Krieg zu erklären, weil sie das einfach nicht tun können und dann sagen wir einfach, okay, wir bauen wieder auf und das war's.\nAlso,\nUm,\nIch glaube, wir hätten es nicht aufgeben können.\nAber ich denke, wir hätten einen besseren Plan haben können, was wir tun würden.\nIch denke nicht, dass sie ganz klar waren, was wir tun sollten, was den Aufbau von Ordnung angeht.\nUnd ich weiß nicht,\nIch denke einfach nur, dass es keine Einheit gab.\nSie wussten nicht, wofür sie dorthin gingen.\nIch denke, das hätte uns viel weitergeholfen.\nAber wie gesagt, ich dachte, es war alles Emotion und Wut, mit der wir dorthin gegangen sind.\nAlso, das haben wir dann auch wieder geschaffen.\nUm,\nUnd ehrlich gesagt,\nIch denke nicht, dass wir diejenigen sind, die diese Menschen verändern können.\nIch denke wirklich, dass sie immer so bleiben werden.\nUnd,\nIch,\nIch habe wirklich nichts mehr zu sagen.\nEs ist definitiv schon zu lange her.\nUm,\nIch denke nicht, dass wir genug Fortschritte machen.\nWir haben Fortschritte gemacht,\nAber nicht genug, um dort zu bleiben.\nUnd ich denke, egal wie lange wir dort bleiben,\nSobald wir gehen, wird es einfach zusammenbrechen.\nUnd wir können nicht für immer dort bleiben.\nAlso denke ich, wir verletzen uns selbst, indem wir dort bleiben.\nNein,\nOk\n\n**[REWRITE]\nOkay,\nUm,\nThe war,\nUm,\nAt the beginning I was for it because I was personally affected by 9/11.\nUm,\nI was for going over there and causing as much havoc as they did here.\nUm,\nI think that since it was such an emotional thing that happened,\nI think we overlooked a lot of things and didn't really think about the long-term consequences.\nAnd we kind of just went over there, unprepared and without a plan.\nAnd,\nI really think that it backfired on us.\nUm,\nI, uh,\nI don't know,\nI was for it,\nBut now I'm very against it.\nI don't think it did anything.\nUm,\nI think the people there,\nas long as they are fighting with each other, they can't be fighting with us as well.\nLike I don't think us being over there is going to do anything if they're\nIf they can't even get along with themselves.\nSo,\nSo, unfortunately because of 9/11,\nI've almost just\nI just don't care about what goes on over there.\nUm,\nWith those people,\nI just don't care.\nI just think,\nI don't think that,\nSometimes I don't think they're human.\nI don't know,\nLike they fight with each other and they can't\nThey just can't do anything themselves.\nSo I really don't care.\nUm,\nI don't know,\nWe definitely went over there just unprepared.\nWe didn't know like what we were going to face over there.\nUm,\nAnd it's also bad because war for them is very different than war for us.\nThey're just like savage people when it comes to war and I don't think that they're looking to better their country.\nI just think they're looking to get us out of there.\nAnd I think that should be fine for us.\nI think we should just leave and that's really it.\nUm,\nWe just,\nI think we were just more like\nJust hyped up than anything.\nI don't think we were thinking rationally about like what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle and\nUm,\nI just,\nWe pretty much just went over there looking for revenge I think and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened.\nAnd um,\nAlso I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq.\nUm,\nBut at the time I see where he was coming from.\nWe really \nI don't think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can't just do that and then us just say ok let's rebuild and that's it.\nSo,\nUm,\nI don't think we could have let it go.\nBut I think we could have just had a better plan of what we were going to do.\nI don't think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of I guess like creating order.\nAnd I don't know,\nI just think that they didn't\nThere was no like unity.\nThey didn't know what they were going in there for.\nSo I think that would have helped us out a lot more.\nBut like I said I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with.\nSo that's what we created in turn in there.\nUm,\nAnd,\nHonestly I don't,\nI don't think we're the ones to change those people.\nI honestly think they're always going to be like that.\nAnd um,\nI don't,\nI really don't have anything else to say.\nIt's gone one definitely long enough.\nUm,\nI don't think we're making enough progress.\nLike we've made progress,\nBut not enough to stay in there.\nAnd I think no matter how long we stay in
