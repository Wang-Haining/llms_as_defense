heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would

It's just it's a relationship it's the same thing and I think where a lot of people like get hung up on is um homosexuals aren't asking for the right to get married in a church they're asking for a marriage certificate a legal document provided by the government and if there's not involvement with church and state then that shouldn't be an issue because I can't understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that's against our religion and that's morally wrong for us and we can't approve of that sort of thing but in a legal sense if you're allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage it's like segregation separate but unequal.

    "raw_output": "## German Translation:\n\nUm, ich denke, die Kirche hat sich bereits verändert, um sich an das 21. Jahrhundert anzupassen. Es ist nicht mehr so streng wie früher. Ich weiß, dass auch ich, als ich älter wurde, früher jeden Sonntag in die Kirche ging. Und ich würde immer hübsche kleine Kleider anziehen, passende Schuhe und eine passende Handtasche. Das war einfach alles. Ich ging in eine Privatschule und sah dort an den Wochenenden all meine Freunde, und wir gingen einfach hingehen. Aber jetzt, als ich älter geworden bin, haben sie so etwas wie eine Teenagermesse eingeführt, die auf 30 Minuten gekürzt wurde, und die Leute kleiden sich viel legerer. Besonders im Sommer kamen Leute in Badekleidung direkt vom Strand. Man hatte da die Familien, die einfach zu spät kamen. Also denke ich, es ist lockerer geworden. Sogar bei den Morgenmessen, zu denen ich früher immer schick angezogen bin, tragen die Leute jetzt Jeans und Chino. Nun, Chino sind auch schön, aber insgesamt viel legerer.\n\nWas andere Dinge angeht, ist das das Größte, was ich bemerkt habe. So kenne ich die Kirche. Ich weiß nichts von der Politik innerhalb der Kirche und so weiter. Aber ja, das ist es.\n\n[OK, was die Anschuldigungen gegen katholische Priester wegen Pädosexualität angeht, denkst du, könnten diese verhindert worden sein, wenn die Kirche sich zum Beispiel geändert hätte, indem sie weibliche Priester zulässt oder Priestern die Heirat erlaubt?]\n\nUm, ich glaube nicht, dass diese Dinge hätten verhindert werden können, weil es auch verheiratete Männer gibt, die sich zu Pädosexuellen entwickeln und immer noch eine Anziehungskraft auf junge Kinder haben. Also denke ich, selbst wenn man ihnen die Heirat erlaubt, ist es letztendlich eine Frage des Einzelnen. Es ist nicht deshalb, weil sie verheiratet sein dürfen oder nicht dürfen.\n\nUm, ich denke auch, dass es bei der Priesterweihe ihre eigene Entscheidung ist, Priester zu werden. Es gibt Religionen, in denen sie heiraten können, wie in „7th Heaven“. Ich weiß nicht genau, was er ist, ein Pfarrer oder ein Pastor oder so.\n\n[Mm hmm]\n\nAber sie dürfen heiraten.\n\nAlso, ich weiß, es ist ein bisschen anders, aber wenn sie wirklich ihre Religion leben und gleichzeitig verheiratet sein wollen, sollten sie vielleicht eine andere Religion in Betracht ziehen.\n\n[Kannst du deine Antwort bitte etwas genauer erläutern?]\n\nUm, auf welcher Stelle?\n\n[Um, nur über die veränderten Wege]\n\n[Dass es wahrscheinlich keinen Unterschied machen würde, denke ich]\n\nAch, zum Thema Pädosexualität?\n\n[Mm hmm]\n\nUm, ich denke, die Sexualität hat etwas mit Genetik zu tun. Ich glaube, sie ist genetisch bedingt. Ich denke nicht, dass man einfach so wird. Ich denke, man wird so geboren. Ich glaube nicht, dass es etwas mit der Erziehung zu tun hat. Vielleicht hat es in diesem Fall etwas damit zu tun, aber ich denke, es liegt an ihrer Genetik und man kann das nicht durch die Ehe verstecken. Man könnte es versuchen, aber dann würde es wahrscheinlich immer wieder herauskommen.\n\nAlso denke ich nicht, dass die Kirche etwas hätte tun können, um das zu verhindern. Wenn sie davon wussten und es vertuschten, dann ist das eine Schande. Aber ich glaube nicht, dass sie in allen Fällen Bescheid wussten.\n\n[Hast du noch andere Gedanken zum Thema katholische Kirche?]\n\nUm, nein.\n\n\n\n## Rewritten English:\n\n[REWRITE] Um, I think the church has already changed to adapt to the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be. I know that as I grew up, when I was younger, I would always go to church every Sunday. And I would always wear cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a matching purse. That was just every Sunday. I went to a private school and I would see all my friends there on the weekends, and we would just go. But now, as I've gotten older, they've made something like a teenager mass, and they shortened it to 30 minutes, and people dress a lot more casual. Especially in the summer, people would come in their beach clothes, straight from the beach. You'd have families that are just running in late. So I think it has become more casual. Even at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up, people are wearing jeans and khakis. Well, khakis are nice too, but just a lot more casual in respect to that.\n\nAs for other things, that's the biggest thing that I noticed. Like, that's the church I know. I don't know about the politics inside the church and what not. But yeah, that's it.\n\n[OK, regarding all of the accusations against Catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example, allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\n\nUm, I don't think these things could have been avoided because there are married men, and they still become pedophiles, and they still have, uh, an attraction towards young kids. So I think even if you got them married, it's just the person. It's not because they're allowed to get married or not allowed to get married. \n\nUm, I also think that when they're becoming a priest, it's their choice to become a priest. Um, there are religions where they're allowed to get married, like in \"7th Heaven\". I don't know what kind, he's a Reverend or a minister or something.\n\n[Mm hmm]\n\nBut they're allowed to get married.\n\nSo I know it's a little different, but if they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time, then they should maybe think about a different faith.\n\n[OK, can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\n\nUm, on which part?\n\n[Um, just the changing ways]\n\n[That it really wouldn't make a difference, I guess]\n\nOh, on the pedophilia?\n\n[Mm hmm]\n\nUm, I think, like the whole thing, um, sexuality, before about being genetics. I think it's based on genetics. I don't think people, um, just become it. I think they're born that way. I don't think it has anything to do with the way they're brought up. It might have something to do a little more in this case, but I think it's their genetics, and you can't hide that through a marriage. You could try, but then it would usually come out. So I don't think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening.

    "raw_output": "(laughs) \nUm \nZuerst war ich mit der Grundidee einverstanden, aber ich denke, dass alle noch sehr unter den Anschlägen vom 11. September litten, und ich denke, dass wir in den Irak als Vorwand eingetreten sind, es gab Vorwände, die uns in den Irak führten \nIch denke, dass die Bush-Regierung zu Beginn den Irak-Krieg mit Osama bin Laden und den Anschlägen vom 11. September verband und behauptete, Saddam Hussein besitze Massenvernichtungswaffen, was sich alles als falsch erwiesen hat \nUnd das hat mir wirklich sauer aufgestoßen, und im Allgemeinen macht der Irak-Krieg mich ganz wütend \n\nUm \nEs scheint mir einfach so, als hätte die Bush-Regierung das amerikanische Volk sehr offen belogen und hat diese Tatsache bis heute nicht eingestanden \nSelbst Colin Powell \nIch meine, er kam von seiner großen Präsentation bei den Vereinten Nationen zurück und sagt jetzt, dass er sich damals nicht wirklich von den Beweisen überzeugen lassen konnte, selbst als er sie präsentierte \nUnd \nDas sehe ich als Amtsmissbrauch an, ich denke, das ist ein Amtsenthebungsgrund, das amerikanische Volk so zu belügen \nIch denke, die Bush-Regierung hat absolute Verachtung für die Verfassung und versucht seitdem, sie zu marginalisieren \nNun, seit mindestens dem 11. September, meine ich \nIch denke, dass sie \nUm \nSie sind mit der Absicht in die Regierung eingetreten, in den Krieg zu ziehen \n\nUm \nDieser letzte Teil \n\nIch vergesse den Namen des \nUm \nFinanzministers, der diese Anschuldigung in seinem Buch erhoben hat, nachdem er wahrscheinlich aus seinem Amt gedrängt wurde \nUm \nAber es scheint, als hätte der jüngere Bush eine Art Rachegefühle gegen Saddam Hussein wegen der Regierung seines Vaters, und ich denke, dass er langfristig auch unsere Energieversorgung ausbauen wollte \nWas auch ein sehr hinterhältiger Weg ist, Dinge zu machen \n\nNun \nIch denke, es ist schon lange genug gegangen \nIch denke, es gäbe Probleme, wenn wir jetzt abziehen würden, weil es eine gute Chance gibt, dass das Land in einen Bürgerkrieg abdriftet und noch mehr Menschen sterben würden \nUm \nIch denke, die Alternative, auf die sich die Vereinten Nationen und die Vereinigten Staaten derzeit bewegen, scheint so etwas wie eine \nEine Koalition von Nationen aus der Umgebung, wie Syrien und Saudi-Arabien, um einzusteigen und versuchen, die Ordnung wiederherzustellen \nAber ich weiß nicht unbedingt, ob das auch eine gute Idee ist, denn ich denke, dass das langfristig auch weitere Probleme verursachen wird, weil \nUm \nDie Souveränität des Irak ein großes Problem sein wird \nDenn ich denke, es ist ziemlich klar, dass die Übergangsregierung zu diesem Zeitpunkt auseinanderbricht \n\nNur aus den Nachrichtenberichten, die ich gehört habe, scheint es nicht so, als wäre das Parlament sehr effektiv \nDas um \nOh, ich kann mir seinen Namen nicht erinnern, aber der Premierminister hat wirklich irgendeine Art von Kontrolle über den politischen Prozess oder was passiert \nUnd sogar Mugtada al-Sadr, den Typen, mit dem wir vor weniger als einem Jahr gekämpft haben \nSeine Partei hält jetzt mindestens 20 Sitze im irakischen Parlament, und ich meine, wir haben immer noch mit fraktionalen radikalen Elementen zu tun, die um die Kontrolle über die Regierung kämpfen \nUnd ich denke, der politische Prozess ist deshalb sehr umkämpft \n\nUm \n(lacht) \nKeine, die ich in Gesellschaft vortragen kann\n\n\n[REWRITE]\n(laughs) \nUm \nAt first I was okay with the premise, but I think everyone was still reeling from the September 11th attacks, and I think we kind of went into Iraq as a pretext. There were pretexts that led us into Iraq. \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama bin Laden and the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which has since proven false. \nAnd that really rubbed me the wrong way, and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood. \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact. \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean, coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it. \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office. I think that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since. \nWell, since September 11th at least, I mean. \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war. \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the Treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office. \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration, and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too. \nWhich is also a very underhanded way to do things. \n\nWell \nI do think it's gone on long enough. \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though because there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result. \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order. \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue. \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point. \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all. \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less than a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament, and I mean we’re still dealing with fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government. \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that. \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company. \n\n\n[/REWRITE]\n",

September durchgeführt hat\nAlso ich fühle mich nicht so\nIch meine, ich bin kein großer Befürworter des Irakkriegs\nAlso ich halte mich nicht damit auf dem Laufenden\nIch kenne die großen Details nicht\nAber an diesem Punkt weiß ich, dass wir irgendwie nur dort bleiben, um Demokratie aufzubauen, damit es wie eine weitere US-Sache wird\nUnd dann auch, damit wir Öl und so von ihnen bekommen können\nAber es gibt keinen Grund für unser Verweilen dort, weil es alle aufregt\nAlso\nUnd wenn wir dort bleiben, was dann passieren wird, ist, dass wir versuchen müssen, Demokratie zu schaffen, was ewig dauern wird, weil Demokratie nicht einfach an einem Tag gebaut werden kann\nUnd wenn wir gehen, werden sie wütend auf uns sein, weil wir alles durcheinandergebracht haben und sie nun alles wieder alleine aufbauen müssen\nUm\nLass mich mal sehen\nOhh, das ist so schwer\nDas ist das eine Thema, über das ich nichts weiß\nUm\nKrieg im Irak\nOh, das ist schwer\nUh\nMmm\nUhh, ich weiß nicht\nHast du noch etwas, woran ich mich orientieren kann?\nOk\nDanke\nUm\nNun, um\nEigentlich glaube ich\nIch glaube, der Krieg sollte weitergehen, weil es nicht fair ist\nIch glaube nicht, dass wir es noch als Krieg bezeichnen sollten\nAber weil ich nicht glaube, dass\nDu weißt\nIch denke, der einzige Grund, warum wir Waffen benutzen müssen, ist, um zu zeigen, dass\nDu weißt\nDass wir groß und Amerikaner sind und so weiter und dass wir all diese großen Waffen haben\nAber ich fühle mich nicht so, als gäbe es einen großen Grund, warum wir es als Krieg bezeichnen sollten\nWeil wir es nicht einmal genannt haben\nEs hätte überhaupt nicht als Krieg bezeichnet werden sollen\nWeil es nie von Congress erklärt wurde\nIch glaube, das ist so, wie die ganze Sache funktioniert\nMan muss einen Krieg vom Congress erklären lassen\nUnd dann ist es\nIch glaube einfach nicht, dass es ein so großer Punkt ist, dort zu bleiben und zu versuchen\nEigentlich nein\nIch glaube, es ist ein Punkt, dort zu bleiben und zu versuchen, ihnen zu helfen\nAber es verschwenden auch unsere Ressourcen\nUnd besonders jetzt fühle ich mich so schlecht für Bush, weil es so aussieht, als würde er zu einem der schlechtesten Präsidenten der USA werden\nAufgrund dessen, was es tut und es ist so\nUnd was es mit\nDenk dran\nIch denke, mit dem ganzen Vietnam-Ding\nDer Vietnamkrieg war ein unentdeckter Krieg und wird jetzt als bedeutungsloser Krieg bezeichnet\nUnd er sagt\nEr wird für immer als der Präsident bezeichnet, der diesen bedeutungslosen Krieg begonnen hat\nAlso\nHuh\nDu musst das auf eine halbe Stunde machen, oder?\nUh\nOk ja\nUm\nHuh\nMan könnte auch sagen, dass es\nEs ist schwer zu sagen, dass ich den Krieg beenden möchte, weil es so viele Familien gibt, von denen ich weiß, dass sie in\nDenen Söhne und

jetzt genommen haben\nIch wette, einige der Kinder haben jetzt nicht einmal einen Ort, an dem sie zur Schule gehen können\nMehr, weil es so unsicher ist und alle diese verschiedenen kleinen Gruppen innerhalb des Irak, die sich gegenseitig töten\nNur wegen der verschiedenen Überzeugungen, die sie haben\nAber dann wieder\nEs ist so\nEs ist schwer zu sagen\nIch möchte sie dort haben, aber es ist so, dass sie eine so andere Kultur haben als wir, dass, wenn wir dort bleiben, wir immer mehr versuchen werden, sie zu einem zweiten Vereinigten Königreich zu formen\nDas es für sie noch schlimmer wird\nUnd es wird\nIch fühle mich, als würde das ganze Al-Kaida-Ding nur noch stärker werden und ihr Hass auf die USA würde nur noch stärker werden, weil wir jetzt versuchen, sie zu verändern\nUnd sie haben seit so langer Zeit dieses ganze\nUm\nTotalitär\nWie ein ganzes Diktatursystem\nUnd\nIch fühle, dass es uns am Ende schaden wird, wenn wir versuchen, dort zu bleiben\nAlso denke ich, dass das

the War in Iraq\nLet me see\nUm\nAt this point, I feel it's kind of pointless because, I mean, it's not even a declared war actually\nAnd I feel like it was just a big \"get back at Iraq\" thing because that's who we figured bombed the U.S.\nLike who did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven\nSo I don't feel like\nI mean, I'm not a big person on the War in Iraq\nSo I don't like keep up with it\nI don't know the big details of it\nBut at this point, I know that we're kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing\nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them\nBut it's no reason for staying over there because it's making everyone upset\nSo\nAnd then like if we stay over there, what's gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can't be built in just a day\nAnd then if we like leave they'll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves\nUm\nLet me see\nOhh this is so hard\nThis is the one topic I don't know anything about\nUm\nWar in Iraq\nOh this hard\nUh\nMmm\nUhh I don't know\nDo you have anything else I can go off of?\nOk\nThank you\nUm\nWell um\nActually I think\nI think the war should continue because it's not fair\nI don't think we should call it a war anymore\nBut because I don't think that\nYou know\nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that\nYou know\nThat we're big and we're American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns\nBut I don't feel like there's a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore\nBecause like we didn't even call it\nIt shouldn't have even been called a war in the first place\nBecause it never was declared a war by congress\nI think that's how the whole thing works\nYou have to declare a war by congress\nAnd then it's\nI just don't think that it's a real big point to still stay over there and try\nActually no\nI do think it's a point to stay over there and try to like help them\nBut it's also like wasting our resources\nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it's like\nIt's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now\nBecause of like what it's doing and it's like\nAnd what it's doing to like\nCause remember\nI think with the whole Vietnam thing\nVietnam War was like an undeclared war and it's now called like a meaningless war\nAnd he's like saying\nHe'll be called like that president forever\nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff\nSo\nHuh\nYou have to make this a half an hour don't you?\nUh\nOk yeah\nUm\nHuh\nI guess you could also say that it is\nLike it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there's so many families that I know of that are in\nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it's like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like\nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don't even have a place to go to school\nAnymore because it's so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other\nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have\nBut then again\nIt's like\nIt's hard to say\nI want them in there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States\nThat it's going to be even worse for them\nAnd it's going to be\nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we're now trying to

Healthcare, which I think that money could be much better spent on. Right now that money is being spent to have some of our own citizens killed in a foreign country in a war that we have lost the cause for.\n\nI think that's it.",

    "raw_output": "Here is the German translation of the provided text followed by the back-translation to English:\n\n**German:**\n\nKann ich eine Frage stellen, um das zu klären? Ähm, es wurde verhindert, weil jemand online gegangen ist und festgestellt hat, dass es so ähnlich war... O ok. \nÄhm. Nein, ich glaube nicht, dass das ein Eingriff in die Privatsphäre ist. Auf Seiten wie Myspace, wenn ich meine, wenn du Informationen im Internet postet, ist es... Es ist ziemlich viel für jedermann sichtbar. Und ich verstehe, auf Myspace musst du wissen, jemand anderem muss Mitglied sein, um das Profil einer Person zu sehen. Du musst vielleicht... wissen, ihr Freund sein oder so etwas. Aber wenn das der Fall ist, hast du diese Person als deinen „Freund“ akzeptiert, damit sie es sehen kann. Du gibst ihnen die Erlaubnis, dein Profil zu sehen. Also... Ich meine, wann immer du Informationen ins Internet stellst, musst du ziemlich viel verstehen, dass viele Leute das sehen werden. Also, wenn ich denke, dass das eigentlich gut war, dass jemand das gesehen hat und ein Leben gerettet werden konnte.\n\nHum.\nÄhm. Das ist schwierig, denn ich meine, natürlich kann man nicht erwarten, dass eine Person den ganzen Tag damit verbringt, sich die verschiedenen Profile aller Schüler der Schule anzusehen, um das zu verhindern. Aber dann wird es eine Art Diskriminierung, wenn sie denken: O, schauen wir uns die schlechten Schüler an und stellen sicher, dass sie nichts treiben. Ähm. \nIch meine, ich denke nicht, dass es richtig wäre, jemandem die Aufgabe zu geben, die Profile von Leuten zu durchsuchen. Aber ich denke, es kommt alles darauf an, welche Situation sie mit diesem Profil begegnet sind. Oder hat jemand einfach zufällig die Profile von Leuten angesehen und zufällig das gesehen? Oder haben sie tatsächlich nach einer Art Beweis gesucht, dass der Schüler etwas plant? Ich weiß es nicht wirklich.\n\nKlar.\nÄhm. Naja, ich habe persönlich kein Myspace, aber ich habe ein Facebook. Ja, es stört mich, dass ich weiß, dass es da draußen gruselige Leute gibt, die Dinge über mich sehen können. Ich habe einmal etwas im Fernsehen gesehen, das ging darum. Dieser Mann, der einfach nur beweisen wollte, wie leicht er Informationen bekommen kann, ist auf das Profil dieses Mädchens gegangen und hat sofort ihren Bildschirmnamen bekommen und hat mit ihr über den Instant Messenger gesprochen. In weniger als einer Minute hat er sie dazu bewegt, sich mit ihm zu treffen. Und ich meine... Persönlich würde ich sicherlich nicht mit jemandem zusammenkommen, aber ich hatte in meinen Klassen Leute, die ich ihre Bildschirmnamen nicht kenne, aber sie schreiben mir und wissen, dass es ich bin. Und es ist schwer, weil du denkst, dass sie deine Interessen kennen, dass sie wissen, wie du aussiehst. Manchmal, wenn du deinen Stundenplan postest, wissen sie, wo du tagsüber bist, wer deine Freunde sind. Sie kennen ziemlich viel über dich. Alle möglichen Fotos. Und ich habe versucht, das zu begrenzen, was ich hochlade. Aber gleichzeitig ist der ganze Punkt, glaube ich, der Grund, warum ich einen habe, damit du weißt, ich kann mit einigen meiner Freunde kommunizieren. Ich möchte es nicht zu sehr einschränken. Also ist es ein kniffliges Thema, weil ich nur Leute akzeptiere, die ich kenne. Ich meine, man weiß nie wirklich, wer was sehen kann. Also...\n\nHum.\nÄhm. Na ja.\nIch habe gehört, meine Mitbewohnerin hat mir erzählt, dass ihre...\nIhr Gymnasium gab es ein großes Problem damit, wie Schüler von der Schule wegen Myspace ausgeschlossen wurden. Und das fand ich ein bisschen seltsam. Es war mir nicht klar, wie Schulleitungen ihren Schülern sagen konnten, dass sie keinen Myspace haben dürfen.\n\nUnd ich weiß nicht, ob das wirklich ein Datenschutzproblem ist, aber ich denke... Ich weiß nicht wirklich, wie sie das Recht hatten, den Leuten das zu sagen.\n\nDas ist der einzige andere Gedanke, den ich habe.\n\nJa.\n\n\n**[REWRITE]\n\nCan I ask a question to clarify that? Uh, it was prevented because someone went online and found that there was like... O ok. Uh. No, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. On sites like Myspace, if I mean if you post information on the internet it's... It's pretty much available for everyone to see. And I understand on Myspace you know you have to have someone else be a member in order to see someone's profile. You might need to... know, be their friend or something like that. But if that's the case you've accepted that person as your \"friend\" so they can see it. You're giving them permission to see your profile. So I mean anytime you put information on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that. So if I think that was actually good that somebody saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost.\n\nHum. Uh. That's tough because I mean obviously you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody's different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that. But then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think O, let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything. Uh. I mean, I don't think it would really be right to go and have somebody's job be to look at peoples profiles. But I guess it all depends on like what situation they came across that profile. Or was someone just randomly looking at peoples and just randomly happened to see that? Or were they actually looking for you know some sort of evidence that the student was planning something. So I don't really know.\n\nSure. Uh. Well um like, I mean I I don't have a Myspace personally but I have a Facebook. I do. It bothers me that I know that there's creepy people out there who can see things about me. And I saw something on tv once that was about this um this man who just, he was just trying to prove how he can get information so easily and he went onto this girls profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in like you know less than a minute and got her to meet with him. And I mean personally I certainly wouldn't meet with someone but I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names but they IM me and they know that it's me. And it its hard because you think that they know your interests, they know what you look like. Sometimes if you put your class schedule they know where you are during the day, who your friends are. They pretty much know a lot about you. All sorts of photos and I tried to limit what I put up there but at the same time the whole point I think the reason I have one is so you know I can communicate with some of my friends. I don't want to limit it too much. So it's a tricky issue because I only accept people I know. I mean you never know really who can look at what so.\n\nHum. Uh. Well I heard my roommate was telling me that her um high school she there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school and that struck me as a little bit strange like I wasn't sure how high school officials had the power to tell their students that they weren't allowed to have a Myspace.\n\nAnd I don't know if that's really a privacy issue but I think I don't really know how they had the right to tell people that.\n\nThat's the only other thought I can think of.\n\nYes.\n\n\n\n[/REWRITE]",

Du sollst der Geldverdiener deiner Familie sein. Warum bleibst du zu Hause?\"\nUnd es kann wirklich hart für sie sein, weil es vielleicht immer ihr Traum war, mit den Kindern zu sein und sie aufzuziehen, und vielleicht hat die Frau den besseren Job,\nund es funktioniert für sie gut.\nAber die Gesellschaft sieht das schlecht.\nUnd dann in der Modebranche\nähm,\nnehmen viele Menschen Männer nicht ernst, wenn sie hetero sind.\nIch weiß nicht, ob das wirklich Sinn macht,\naber ich denke, es liegt daran, dass typischerweise Männer, die sich für Mode interessieren,\nähm,\neinen anderen Lebensstil haben.\nUnd wenn du den typischen Lebensstil hast und du bist ein Mann und du bist in der Modebranche,\nwerden die Leute sagen: \"Na, wie kann ich denn wirklich wissen, ob du weißt, was Mode ist, wenn du nicht weißt, was unsere Situation ist, wie die anderen Kerle?\"\nAlso\nJe nachdem, in welchem ​​Berufsfeld du arbeitest,\nich fühle, dass es in der Gesellschaft in den USA definitiv Geschlechterdiskriminierung gibt.\nEs ist schwieriger zu ändern, weil die Gesellschaft eine feste Einstellung hat und wir sind natürlich seit den 1800er Jahren weit gekommen, in großen Sprüngen.\nAber der Wandel ist wirklich langsam, deshalb denke ich, dass, wenn wir mit dem Tempo weiterarbeiten, mit dem wir jetzt arbeiten, weil Frauen in höhere Positionen aufsteigen und CEOs werden und sie in der Geschäftswelt mehr akzeptiert werden, ist es ein langsamer Prozess.\nAber er passiert, und die Leute beginnen, es mehr zu akzeptieren.\nUnd genauso wie Männer, die Hausväter sind,\nwird es mehr akzeptiert, weil sie erkennen: \"Oh, vielleicht hat die Frau doch den besseren Job oder sie will diejenige sein, die arbeitet.\"\nUnd ähm,\nund dann für Leute in der Mode werden sie sagen: \"Oh, vielleicht hören sie auf die Freunde, die weiblich sind, oder ihre Frauen und so\"\nund dann wissen sie, woher ich komme.\nAlso musst du irgendwie fördern, indem du die guten Eigenschaften der Menschen hervor bringst, die in der Regel stereotypisiert werden, indem du nicht zu aufdringlich bist.\nAber ähm, indem du sagst wie die Eigenschaften von ihnen,\nweil wenn du es erzwingst, werden die Leute Widerstand leisten.\nUnd ich fühle, dass wir uns in einem guten Gleichgewicht befinden, wo es anfängt, so durchgesetzt zu werden.\nAlso weiß ich nicht wirklich, ob es etwas gibt, das wir jetzt tun können, was noch nicht getan wird, denn wenn du es zu schnell machst, werden die Leute widerstehen.\nUnd wir sind weit gekommen und Wandel braucht Zeit.\nJa,\nähm,\nnun, ich denke, sie werden wahrscheinlich auch gegenseitig diskriminiert, je nach Art der Arbeit, die du hast oder wie du aufgewachsen bist.\nWenn du auf einem Bauernhof aufgewachsen bist und deine Grammatik vielleicht nicht die beste ist, aber du bist extrem intelligent und du schaffst es, dich ähm,\ndu arbeitest dich hoch zu einem CEO-Job.\nAuch wenn deine Grammatik vielleicht nicht die beste ist,\noder auch wenn du intelligent bist, aber deine Grammatik nicht die beste ist,\nkönnten andere Männer dich herunterziehen und sagen: \"Na, wie soll ich wissen, dass du das wirklich meinst, wenn du nicht einmal Verben und Nomen richtig zusammenstellen kannst?\"\nAlso,\nja,\nalso manchmal kann deine Herkunft dich diskriminieren.\nUnd von Geschlecht zu Geschlecht,\nund ich weiß nicht,\nich denke, das wäre ein weiteres Beispiel.\nÄhm,\nnicht wirklich.\n\n\n\n[REWRITE]\n\nUm, yes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States.

Um, let's see. I figure Myspace is a public thing, like a bulletin board. You know, if you look at that definition, then you know that it's basically to post for the public to see, or for others to see. Whatever you're trying to get at. And if you post that on the internet, you know you have to realize that people will be seeing that, whether it be school officials or not. So, in my opinion, I feel as though the school officials seeing that, they had every right to see it. Because even if they weren't doing it under the school's name, they could have still accessed it through their homes. Um, but yeah, with something preventing a school shooting, you know, as long as it saves the lives of students, which is a responsibility of the school system, I think that's perfectly fine. Um, let me see here. Like, um, you know, if they go on to the internet like on Myspace just to see if students are drinking or smoking or doing stuff that they're not supposed to be doing, they go on there just specifically to catch students and to get them in trouble. And I feel as though that is an invasion of privacy. But um, I feel as though, you know, as long as they save lives or make the school a better and safer place, I don't think that that's an invasion at all. Should I elaborate more on that?\n\nYeah, um, alright. Well, um, hmm, it's a lot easier to express yourself, um, a lot longer when you're writing, but alright, well, um, like what I was saying, it is a public thing. And with a student posting something on Myspace and not expecting to get in trouble, that's ridiculous. Um, everything, like I'm, um, worried to post stuff like even through emails. Um, like if I have something not good about somebody to say, I don't ever say that on an email because I'm afraid somebody somehow will pick that up and you know everything like, everything nowadays comes back and you know, bites you in the butt I guess you could say. Um, like, you know, if you do something while you're a college student, then you grow up to be some important guy, they will like find an email that you sent somehow. And like once it's on the internet it's always on the internet and, um, you know, if you do something like that there's no way of getting out of it, you will get in trouble. And I don't, it wasn't an invasion at all of privacy because you know, like I said before, and well that's basically all I've been saying was it's a public thing and um, I don't know, let's see here. Um, like I had said before, I don't feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students, but if they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place, then I feel as though that's perfectly fine for them, or um, other officials such as the police to go on, um, you know, when parents drop their students off at school, they feel as though you know, they're dropping them off at a safe place. I've actually discussed that with a, um, a, uh, teacher of mine. I went to a public high school and um, they say you know, we have to ensure stuff like this because like, we would do like lock downs and stuff and um, that's like in reference to the terrorist attacks, uh, we had to be safe about that. We had like drill stuff and even though that doesn't have anything to do with the well I mean it kind of does have something to do with the school shooting because um, that was in case people would come into the building I guess. Um, so we, you know, we did practice that stuff, um, in order to make the school a safer place, and that's just what the school officials were doing in this case. They were just making it a safer place, um, preventing anything bad from happening like Columbine or something like that. Um, yeah, that's basically all I can come up with.
