    "raw_output": "## German Translation \n\nIch denke, dass die katholische Kirche in einigen Punkten tatsächlich Änderungen braucht.  \nIhre Ansichten... Ich denke, es wird viel darüber gesprochen, dass die katholische Kirche an Anhängern verliert, und ich denke, das liegt daran, dass die katholische Kirche oft nicht sehr tolerant gegenüber vielen Dingen ist. \nZum Beispiel bei gleichgeschlechtlichen Ehen, bei Abtreibung, bei Empfängnisverhütung usw. Die katholische Kirche hat sehr feste Ansichten dazu, was okay ist, aber ich finde, ihre Ansichten sind in einigen Punkten etwas altmodisch. \nDeshalb denke ich, dass die Kirche, wenn sie sich vielleicht etwas moderneren Denkweisen anpassen würde, keine Angst vor dem Verlust ihrer Anhänger haben müsste. \nIch habe gehört, dass viele Menschen anfangen, sich von der katholischen Kirche distanzieren, weil sie ihre Sichtweise auf diese Themen kritisch sehen. \nUnd Menschen beginnen, mit ihnen nicht mehr auf bestimmten Themen übereinzustimmen. \nAlso, ich denke, dass die katholische Kirche ein falsches Bild von diesen Dingen hat.  \nIch meine, die katholische Kirche ist gegen Abtreibung. Wenn du für Abtreibung bist, würdest du dich vielleicht nicht wohlfühlen in einer Gemeinschaft, in der dies als völlig falsch gelehrt wird und du dich dagegen stellen müsstest.\nUnd das Gleiche gilt denke ich für gleichgeschlechtliche Ehe und ähnliche Dinge. Wenn du an sowas glaubst und es tun möchtest oder dich auch nur stark dafür einsetzt, möchtest du vielleicht nicht in einer Gemeinschaft sein, die damit nicht einverstanden ist. \nIch sehe keinen Grund, warum sie nicht weibliche Priester haben oder warum Priester nicht verheiratet sein könnten. Aber ich weiß nicht, ob das unbedingt hätten verhindern können, was passiert ist. \nIch meine, ich weiß es nicht... Sie hätten vielleicht trotzdem so gehandelt, auch wenn sie verheiratet gewesen wären oder wenn es weibliche Priester gegeben hätte. Aber ich weiß nicht, ob es das unbedingt geändert hätte. \nIch meine, das war etwas, das sie getan haben, und das war etwas, das... ich weiß nicht... das war etwas, das sie getan haben, und es schien nicht wirklich zu beeinflussen.  \nIch meine, wären sie verheiratet gewesen, hätten sie es anders gemacht?  Es ist schwer zu sagen. \nIch sehe nicht, warum Priester nicht verheiratet sein können.  \nDie katholische Kirche sagt, dass Priester eigentlich Gott gegenüber verheiratet sind und ihr ganzes Leben Gott widmen.\nAber ich sehe keinen Grund, warum  nicht jeder, der einen Job hat, seinen Job hat und gleichzeitig sein Familienleben hat. \n\n\n##  [REWRITE] \nI think the Catholic Church needs to change in a few ways. \nTheir views... I think there's a lot of talk about the Catholic Church losing followers, and I think it's because the Catholic Church isn't very accepting of many things. \nFor example, on same-sex marriage, abortion, contraception, etc. The Catholic Church has very strong views on these things, which is fine, but I think their views are a little old-fashioned in some ways. \nTherefore, I think that if the Church were to adapt to maybe a slightly newer style of thinking, they wouldn't be worried about losing their followers. \nI've heard that many people are starting to distance themselves from the Catholic Church because they are critical of their view on these issues. \nAnd people are starting to disagree with them on certain subjects. \nSo, I think the Catholic Church has the wrong view on these things.  \nI mean, the Catholic Church is against abortion. If you're for abortion, you might not feel comfortable in a community where that's taught to be completely wrong and that you're going against it.\nAnd the same goes, I think, for same-sex marriage and similar things. If that's something you believe in and want to do or even just feel strongly about, you might not want to be in a community that doesn't agree with that.  \nI don't see why they can't have female priests or why priests can't be married. But I don't know if that would have necessarily prevented what happened. \nI mean, I don't know... They might not have done it anyway, even if they were allowed to be married or if there were female priests. \nBut I don't know if that would have necessarily changed things. \nI mean, that was something they did, and that was something... I don't know... that was something they did, and it didn't seem to really be affected.  \nI mean, if they were married, would they have done it differently? It's hard to say for sure. \nI don't see why priests can't be married.  \nThe Catholic Church really says that priests are basically married to God and they devote their whole life to Him. \nBut I don't see why everyone else who has a job in the world has their job and also has their family life and the other people they are devoted to, so I don't see why priests can't have both.\n\n\n[/REWRITE]",

Many people believe that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but it's so different. There are so many aspects to consider that it can never be the same.

September verübt hat \nAlso ich fühle nicht \nIch meine, ich bin keine große Person für den Krieg im Irak \nAlso halte ich mich nicht damit auf dem Laufenden \nIch kenne die großen Details nicht \nAber an diesem Punkt weiß ich, dass wir irgendwie dort bleiben, um Demokratie aufzubauen, damit es wie eine weitere US-Sache wird \nUnd dann auch, damit wir Öl und andere Dinge von ihnen bekommen können \nAber es ist kein Grund, dort zu bleiben, weil es alle aufregt \nAlso \nUnd wenn wir dort bleiben, dann wird wahrscheinlich passieren, dass wir versuchen müssen, Demokratie zu schaffen, was ewig dauern wird, weil man Demokratie nicht an einem Tag aufbauen kann \nUnd wenn wir sie verlassen, werden sie wütend auf uns sein, weil wir alles durcheinandergebracht haben und sie jetzt alles von neuem alleine anfangen müssen \nUm \nLass mich mal sehen \nOhh, das ist so schwer \nDas ist das eine Thema, über das ich nichts weiß \nUm \nKrieg im Irak \nOh, das ist schwer \nUh \nMmm \nUhh, ich weiß es nicht \nHaben Sie noch etwas, womit ich anfangen kann? \nOk \nDanke \nUm \nNun, ähm \nEigentlich denke ich \nIch denke, der Krieg sollte weitergehen, weil es nicht fair ist \nIch glaube nicht, dass wir es noch als Krieg bezeichnen sollten \nAber weil ich glaube, dass \nSie wissen \nIch glaube, der einzige Grund, warum wir Waffen benutzen müssen, ist, um zu zeigen, dass \nSie wissen \nDas wir groß und amerikanisch sind und so und dass wir all diese großen Waffen haben \nAber ich fühle nicht, dass es einen großen Grund gibt, ihn als Krieg zu bezeichnen \nWeil wir ihn nicht einmal \nEs hätte gar nicht als Krieg bezeichnet werden sollen, \nWeil es von Kongress nie zu einem Krieg erklärt wurde \nIch denke, das ist so, wie die ganze Sache funktioniert \nMan muss einen Krieg vom Kongress erklären \nUnd dann ist es \nIch glaube einfach nicht, dass es ein wirklich großes Problem ist, dort zu bleiben und zu versuchen \nEigentlich nein \nIch denke schon, dass es ein Grund ist, dort zu bleiben und ihnen zu helfen \nAber es ist auch so, als würden wir unsere Ressourcen verschwenden \nUnd besonders jetzt fühle ich so schlecht für Bush, weil es so ist \nEs macht ihn zu einem der schlechtesten Präsidenten der USA \nAufgrund dessen, was er tut, und es ist so \nUnd was es tut \nDenn denk dran \nIch glaube, mit dem ganzen Vietnam-Ding \nDer Vietnamkrieg war ein nicht erklärter Krieg und wird jetzt als sinnloser Krieg bezeichnet \nUnd er sagt \nEr wird für immer als der Präsident bezeichnet, der diesen sinnlosen Krieg angefangen hat \nUnd so weiter \nAlso \nHuh \nDu musst das auf eine halbe Stunde machen, nicht wahr? \nUh \nOk ja \nUm \nHuh \nIch könnte auch sagen, dass es \nEs ist schwer zu sagen, dass ich den Krieg beenden möchte, weil es so viele Familien gibt, von denen ich weiß, dass sie in \nDeren Söhne und Töchter im Irak sind und es ist wie, ich möchte, dass es weitergeht, weil Sie wissen, dass Sie wollen, dass sie so \nDiese Leute dort haben auch ein Leben und wir haben sie irgendwie zerstört, weil wir jetzt \nIch wette, dass einige der Kinder keinen Ort mehr zum Schulbesuch haben \nMehr, weil es so unsicher ist und es so viele verschiedene kleine Gruppen innerhalb des Irak gibt, die sich gegenseitig töten \nNur wegen der verschiedenen Überzeugungen, die sie haben \nAber dann wieder \nEs ist wie \nEs ist schwer zu sagen \nIch möchte, dass sie da sind, aber es ist so, dass sie eine so andere Kultur als wir haben, dass, wenn wir dort bleiben, wir immer mehr versuchen werden, sie zu einem zweiten Vereinigten Staaten zu formen \nEs wird noch schlimmer für sie sein \nUnd es wird \nEs ist mir so, als würde das ganze Al-Kaida-Ding nur noch mehr wachsen und ihr Hass auf die USA würde nur noch mehr werden, weil wir versuchen, sie zu ändern \nUnd sie haben sich schon so lange auf diese ganze \nUm \nTotalitarische \nSo eine ganze Diktatur Sache so lange hingelegt \nDas weiß ich \nIch fühle, dass es \nDass es uns am Ende schaden wird, wenn wir weiter versuchen, dort zu bleiben \nAlso denke ich, die ganze Sache wird noch Jahre und Jahre und Jahre dauern \nHmm \nDas war's ungefähr \nOk\n\n\n**[REWRITE]\nI did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it?

Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi

implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t

\nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there

    "raw_output": "Here is the German translation followed by the English translation:\n\n**German Translation:**\n\nOk,\nDer Krieg im Irak\nNun,\nUm von Anfang an zu beginnen, glaube ich nicht, dass die Regierung mit den Amerikanern ganz ehrlich über die Gründe für den Krieg war, bevor sie den Irak überfielen. Und ich denke, es gab einen Versuch, die Invasion des Iraks mit den Terroranschlägen vom 11. September in Verbindung zu bringen, obwohl sie in Wirklichkeit nicht so viel miteinander zu tun hatten. Aber die Regierung hat es so dargestellt und auf die Emotionen der Amerikaner in ihrem Zorn über die Terroranschläge vom 11. September 2001 eingewirkt, und die Invasion des Iraks begann 2003.\nÄhm,\nIch bin selbst eher gegen Krieg, besonders einen Präventivschlag.\nUnd ich denke, dass der Krieg im Irak in vielerlei Hinsicht eine Wiederholung des Vietnamkriegs ist und die Regierung aus den Fehlern der Vergangenheit lernen sollte.\nIch meine, eine enorme Anzahl amerikanischer Soldaten ist gestorben.\nDas ist schrecklich, und das, was sie taten, war, dass sie die Regierung des Landes absetzten. Ich glaube wirklich nicht, dass die amerikanische Regierung auf das Nachspiel, die Machtlücke und den Chaos vorbereitet war, der eintreten würde.\nÄhm,\nUnd so entfernt die Vereinigten Staaten die irakische Regierung und versucht, eine demokratische Regierung zu implantieren. Es ist etwas Ähnliches, was sie in Vietnam versucht haben. Sie versuchten, Kommunisten zu verdrängen und Demokratie zu etablieren und aufrechtzuerhalten. Und die US-Regierung hätte wissen müssen, dass es ein langer und harter Kampf werden würde, der wahrscheinlich kein klares und eindeutiges Ende haben würde, wie es im Vietnamkrieg nicht der Fall war.\nEs war mehr ein Verlust, weil, weil es, egal wie viele Menschen Unterstützung hatten, egal wie viele Irakier den Einmarsch der USA gewünscht oder wie viele Vietnamesen es gewünscht hatten, es immer eine große Anzahl von Aufständischen geben würde und es ist schwer, sie zu bekämpfen, wenn man nicht gegen eine wirkliche Armee kämpft.\nMan kämpft gegen die Bürger, gegen bestimmte Bürger im Land.\nAlso denke ich, dass die Regierung zuerst einmal nicht in einen Krieg eintreten sollte, weil ich im Prinzip gegen Krieg bin.\nAber wenn man in einen Krieg mit einem Land zieht, muss man alle möglichen Konsequenzen planen.\nIch denke, die Regierung war nicht so vorbereitet, wie sie sollte.\nIch meine, sie waren nicht wirklich auf das vorbereitet, was passieren würde, nachdem sie die irakische Regierung entfernt hatten.\nIch meine, wir sind immer noch dort, fast Ende 2006, und viele amerikanische Truppen sterben immer noch.\nUnd sie versuchen immer noch, die irakischen Truppen und die irakischen Polizeibehörden zu trainieren, in der Lage zu sein, ihr eigenes Land zu polizeilich zu sichern. Es ist ein langer Prozess und ich denke, dass die US-Regierung in gewisser Weise versucht hat, – sie waren selbst nicht vorbereitet, aber in gewisser Weise versucht hat, die Amerikaner zu täuschen, indem sie ihnen glauben lassen wollte, dass es ein kurzer und erfolgreicher Einsatz in Irak sein würde.\nIch meine, wir sollten nicht naiv sein und glauben, dass es so einfach ist, denn es dauert Jahre, um eine neue Regierungsform zu implementieren, bis sie erfolgreich ist.\nIch meine, in unserem eigenen Land war die Demokratie ein langer Kampf, bis wir zu der mächtigen Regierung kamen, die wir heute haben. Es gab viel Spannungen und einen Bürgerkrieg.\nEs ist einfach keine leichte Sache, und ich denke, die Regierung hat es so dargestellt, als wäre es eine relativ einfache Sache.\nUnd,\nAlso, lass uns mal sehen.\nDer Krieg im Irak.\n\nNun,\nDas ist\nNein, das ist\nNein, das ist eine schwierige Entscheidung, weil\nDas war\nNun, das war irgendwie mein Gefühl bei der Wahl,\nWie bei der Präsidentschaftswahl 2004, als ich darüber nachdachte, wen ich wählen würde, wenn ich wählen könnte.\nEiner\nEines meiner Gründe, warum ich wahrscheinlich für George Bush gestimmt hätte, war, um ihm zu erlauben, das zu beenden, was er begonnen hatte.\nUnd also, wenn man einmal in so lange hinein ist, wie können wir diese Leute verlassen?\nIch meine, wir sind die, die ihnen ihre Regierung und ihren Lebensunterhalt genommen haben.\nUnd wie können wir sie jetzt im Stich lassen?\nAlso ist es wahrscheinlich etwas, das wir versuchen sollten, aber dann gibt es auch die Überlegung der astronomischen Zahl amerikanischer Todesopfer und\nUnd wie viel ist zu viel, um für einen freien demokratischen Irak zu riskieren?\nIch meine, wenn wir in den Irak einmarschieren und ihn zu einer demokratischen Nation machen, warum ist es nur der Irak?\nWarum machen wir das nicht mit all diesen anderen Ländern?\nUnd ich denke, der große Grund dafür ist\nIst das\nIst das Ölproblem.\nUnd woher wir unser Öl beziehen.\nUnd es geht meistens um Geld und die Kontrolle über Ressourcen.\nIch meine, weil ein weiterer Grund vor dem Krieg war, dass Irak Massenvernichtungswaffen hatte,\nUnd es wurden nie Massenvernichtungswaffen gefunden.\nUnd doch wissen wir, dass Länder wie Nordkorea über Massenvernichtungswaffen verfügen, und wir greifen sie nicht an.\nAlso glaube ich nicht, dass die US-Regierung bei ihren Entscheidungen gründlich genug oder ehrlich genug ist.\nLass mal sehen.\nIch hoffe nur, dass es bald endet\nUnd dass es bald Frieden dort gibt.\nAber wahrscheinlich nicht.\n\n\n\n**[REWRITE]\nOk,\nThe war in Iraq\nWell,\nTo start from the beginning, I don't think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for the war before invading Iraq. And I think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, although in reality they didn't have that much to do with each other. But the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003.\nUm,\nI am personally against war, especially a preemptive strike.\nAnd I think that the war in Iraq is in many ways a repeat of the Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made.\nI mean, a tremendous amount of American soldiers have died.\nThat's horrible, and what they were doing was that they were taking out, they were removing the country's government. I really don't think the American government was prepared for the aftermath and the power vacuum and the chaos that was going to occur.\nUm,\nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and trying to implant a democratic government. It's a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam. They were trying to push out Communists and uphold or implement, implement and uphold democracy.\nAnd, and\nThe US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn't going to be a clear, clear victory like it wasn't, like it wasn't a clear victory in the Vietnam War.\nI mean it was more of a loss because, because,\nBecause there, there, there are always going to be a large number of insurgents and it's hard to put them down when when you're not fighting an actual army.\nYou're fighting the citizens, the specific citizens in the country, and\nSo, so I think that the government,\nSo first of all, I think that we shouldn't have gotten into war because I'm against it in pretty much all cases, and\nBut if you are going to go to war with a country you need to be prepared for all possible outcomes.\nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been, \nI mean, they weren't really prepared for what would happen once they removed the Iraqi government. \nI mean, we're still there today, almost the end of 2006, and many American troops are still dying, and they're still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it's a long process and I just think that,\nThat the US government in a way tried to, – they weren't prepared themselves, but in a way tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a short successful stay in Iraq and\nI mean we shouldn't\nWe're kinda naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and for it to become successful.\nI mean in our own country, democracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was,\nThere was a lot of tension and there was a civil war and\nUm,\nIt's just not an easy thing to do, and I think the government, the US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do. \nAnd,\nUm,\nSo,\nAnd so,\nLet's see,\nThe war in Iraq.\n\nWell, that's\nNo, that's\nNo, that's a difficult decision to make because\nThat was\nWell, that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election,\nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of\nUm,\nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started.\nAnd so, I mean once\nIt's really hard because once you go in there and we've been in there for so long how can we abandon these people?\nI mean, we're the ones that took away their government and\nAnd\nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them now?\nSo it's probably something that we should\n(coughs)\nExcuse me, \nTry to see to its finish, but then again there's also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and\nAnd\nAnd how\nAnd how much is too much to to to keep risking for\nFor a free democratic Iraq?\nI mean,\nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq\nI mean if we're\nIf we're\nIf we're invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq?\nWhy aren't we doing this to all these other countries?\nAnd I think the big reason for that is\nIs the\nIs the oil issue.\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from.\nAnd it's usually all about money and controlling resources.\nI mean because another one of the predispositions was before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found.\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them.\nSo I don't think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions.\n\nLet's see,\nUm,\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon.\nBut probably not.\n\n\n\n[/REWRITE]",

Ich denke, der Anfangszweck war gut, Demokratie in einem anderen Land wiederherzustellen. Aber ich glaube, wir haben diesen Zweck längst aus den Augen verloren und tun es vielleicht nur noch aus Gewohnheit, um zu beweisen, dass wir eine Art Supermacht sind. Ich denke auch, dass die ursprünglichen Motive fragwürdig waren, insbesondere im Zusammenhang mit den früheren Auseinandersetzungen von George Bushs Vater mit Saddam Hussein. Also denke ich, wenn der ursprüngliche Antrieb darin bestand, einem Land, das kein faires politisches System hatte, Demokratie zu geben, dann wäre das ein fairer Antrieb, wenn es persönliche Angelegenheiten gab, dann wäre es meiner Meinung nach nicht fair gewesen. Aber ich denke, es ist zu lange gedauert. Um, ich denke, wir haben unseren Zweck in den ersten paar Monaten, als wir den Krieg begannen, erfüllt. Das war meiner Meinung nach eine Aussage für sich. Aber die Tatsache, dass es über ein Jahr, mehrere Jahre hinweg andauert, ich denke, es ist einfach zu lang gezogen.\n\nUm, ja, ich denke, wenn unser Ziel darin bestand, einem Land, das von einem Tyrannen beherrscht wurde, Demokratie zu geben, dann ist das ein gerechter Zweck und ein guter Grund für den Krieg. Aber ich glaube nicht, dass unser Grund im Laufe der Zeit geschwächt und missverstanden wurde, so wie es scheint, als ob wir immer noch im Krieg sind, um Krieg zu führen, und wir wollen nicht aus dieser Sache ohne ein entschiedenes Ende, einen Sieg oder so etwas herauskommen.\n\nUm, ja, ich denke, es hat lange genug gedauert und es sollte aufhören. Ich meine, irgendwann werden ihre Regierung und ihre Beamten sowieso für sich selbst sorgen müssen, und ich denke, die Zeit ist gekommen. Wir haben unsere eigene Wirtschaft schon lange ausgebeutet, Milliarden von Dollar ausgegeben, während wir unsere eigenen Kriege auf unserem eigenen Gebiet haben, wie z.B. Armut, auf die wir dieses Geld ausgeben sollten. Ich denke, es ist eine Belastung für unsere Wirtschaft aus einem Grund, der längst abgelaufen ist.\n\nJa, ich meine, sie geben Milliarden und Milliarden von Dollar aus, und Krieg sollte nicht langfristig in unserem Budget stehen. Es gibt natürlich Dinge wie Armut oder innere Verbesserungen, Sie wissen, öffentliche Straßen oder alles, was mit Schulen zu tun hat. Wir haben sicherlich viele Probleme, Dinge wie das zu finanzieren. Gesundheitswesen, auf das ich denke, dieses Geld besser ausgegeben werden könnte. Im Moment werden diese Gelder damit ausgegeben, dass einige unserer eigenen Bürger in einem fremden Land in einem Krieg getötet werden, für den wir den Grund verloren haben.\n\nIch denke, das war's.\n\n**[REWRITE]**\n\nUm, I feel like the war has been drawn out way too much. I think the initial purpose was good, to restore democracy in another country. But I think we've long since lost sight of that purpose and are maybe just doing it out of habit, to prove that we are some sort of superpower. I also think the original motives were questionable, especially in connection with the previous disputes of George Bush's father with Saddam Hussein. So, I think if the original motivation was to give democracy to a country that didn't have a fair political system, then that would be a fair motivation. If there were any personal matters involved, I don't think it would have been fair. But I think it's been drawn out too long. Um, I think we accomplished our purpose in the first few months, just by starting the war. I think that was a statement in itself. But the fact that it has gone on for over a year, several years, I just think it's way too drawn out.\n\nUm, yeah, I think, if our purpose was to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that's a just purpose, and that's a good reason for the war. But I don't think our reason over time has been maintained and has been misunderstood. It seems like we're still at war for the sake of war, and we don't want to come out of this thing without a decisive end, a victory or something.\n\nUm, yeah, I do think it has gone on long enough, and it should stop. I mean, there comes a point when their government, their officials are going to have to fend for themselves anyway, and I think that time has come. We've long since been draining our own economy, spending billions of dollars, while we have our own wars on our own turf, like poverty, which we should be spending that money on.

There are things obviously, like poverty or internal improvements, you know, public roads or anything dealing with schools. We certainly have a lot of problems funding things like that.

Uh, it was prevented because someone went online and found that there was like... O okay. Um, no, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. On sites like Myspace, if I mean, if you post information on the internet, it's pretty much available for everyone to see. And I understand on Myspace, you know, you have to have someone else be a member in order to see someone's profile. You might need to, you know, be their friend or something like that. But if that's the case, you've accepted that person as your \"friend\" so they can see it. You're giving them permission to see your profile. So, I mean, anytime you put information on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that. So if I think that was actually good that somebody saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost. Hum, um, that's tough because I mean, obviously you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody's different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that. But then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, O, let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything. Um, I mean, I don't think it would really be right to go and have somebody's job be to look at people's profiles. But I guess it all depends on like what situation they came across that profile. Or was someone just randomly looking at people's and just randomly happened to see that, or were they actually looking for you know, some sort of evidence that the student was planning something. So I don't really know. Sure, um, well, um, like, I mean, I I don't have a Myspace personally but I have a Facebook. I do. It bothers me that I know that there's creepy people out there who can see things about me. And I saw something on TV once that was about this, um, this man who just, he was just trying to prove how he can get information so easily. And he went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in like you know less than a minute and got her to meet with him. And I mean, personally, I certainly wouldn't meet with someone, but I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names, but they IM me and they know that it's me. And it's hard because you think that they know your interests, they know what you look like. Sometimes if you put your class schedule they know where you are during the day, who your friends are. They pretty much know a lot about you. All sorts of photos. And I tried to limit what I put up there, but at the same time, the whole point, I think, the reason I have one is so you know, I can communicate with some of my friends. I don't want to limit it too much. So it's a tricky issue because I only accept people I know. I mean, you never know really who can look at what. So. Hum, uh, well, I heard my roommate was telling me that her, um, high school, she, there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school. And that struck me as a little bit strange, like I wasn't sure how, how high school officials had the power to tell their students that they weren't allowed to have a Myspace. And I don't know if that's really a privacy issue, but I think, I don't really know how they had the right to tell people that. That's the only other thought I can think of. Yes. [/REWRITE] \n\n\n",

And I saw something on TV once that was about this, um, this man who just, he was just trying to prove how he can get information so easily. And he went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in like you know less than a minute and got her to meet with him. And I mean, personally, I certainly wouldn't meet with someone, but I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names, but they IM me and they know that it's me. And it's hard because you think that they know your interests, they know what you look like. Sometimes if you put your class schedule they know where you are during the day, who your friends are. They pretty much know a lot about you. All sorts of photos. And I tried to limit what I put up there, but at the same time, the whole point, I think, the reason I have one is so you know, I can communicate with some of my friends. I don't want to limit it too much. So it's a tricky issue because I only accept people I know. I mean, you never know really who can look at what. So. Hum, uh, well, I heard my roommate was telling me that her, um, high school, she, there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school. And that struck me as a little bit strange, like I wasn't sure how, how high school officials had the power to tell their students that they weren't allowed to have a Myspace. And I don't know if that's really a privacy issue, but I think, I don't really know how they had the right to tell people that. That's the only other thought I can think of. Yes.",

Ich glaube, es hängt auch mit dem jeweiligen Arbeitsbereich zusammen, mit dem man zu tun hat. \nIch meine, insgesamt glaube ich, dass Frauen es schwieriger haben, weil es die Glaskase gibt, obwohl es eigentlich Gleichheit geben soll, haben die meisten Schwierigkeiten damit, unter einer Frau arbeiten zu müssen, wenn sie ein Mann sind. \nNur wegen der Art und Weise, wie die Gesellschaft so lange erzogen wurde. \nUnd daher sehen Frauen oft einen Job, den sie erreichen könnten, \nund sie haben alle Qualifikationen dafür. \nAber vielleicht wählt der Verwaltungsrat nicht, sie auf diese Position zu befördern, nur weil historisch gesehen nicht davon ausgegangen wird, dass Frauen in der Regel in den oberen Etagen der Geschäftswelt sind. \nUnd \nIch denke dasselbe gilt auch für Männer. \nUnd in anderen Branchen wie Mode oder \nUm zu Hause Eltern zu sein \nIst es wirklich ungewöhnlich \nUm \nEinen Vater zu haben, der zu Hause bleibt, der der Mann ist. \nUnd \nOftmals werden die Leute herablassend darauf, weil die Gesellschaft denkt: Oh, du bist der Mann, du solltest arbeiten gehen. \nDu solltest der Geldverdiener deiner Familie sein. \nWarum bleibst du zu Hause? \nUnd es kann wirklich hart für sie sein, denn vielleicht war es immer schon ihr Traum, mit den Kindern zusammen zu sein und sie aufzuziehen, und vielleicht hat die Frau den besseren Job \nUnd es funktioniert für sie gut \nAber die Gesellschaft betrachtet das herablassend. \nUnd dann in der Modeindustrie \nUm \nOftmals nehmen die Leute Männer nicht ernst, wenn sie gerade sind. \nIch weiß nicht, ob das wirklich Sinn macht. \nAber ich denke, es liegt daran, dass typischerweise Männer, die sich für Mode interessieren \nUm \nWie ich denke, ein anderes Leben führen\nUnd wenn du den typischen Lebensstil hast und ein Mann bist und in der Modebranche arbeitest \nDie Leute werden sagen: Nun, wie kann ich wirklich wissen, ob du weißt, was Mode ist? \nDu weißt nicht wirklich, was unsere Situation ist \nWie diese anderen Jungs \nUnd deshalb \nJe nach dem Arbeitsfeld, in dem du arbeitest, \nIch fühle, dass es in der US-amerikanischen Gesellschaft definitiv Geschlechterdiskriminierung gibt. \nUm \nEs zu ändern ist schwieriger, weil die Gesellschaft \nEine feste Denkweise hat und natürlich sind wir von den 1800er Jahren und großen Sprüngen in weite Ferne gekommen \nAber der Wandel ist wirklich langsam, also fühle ich, dass, wenn wir mit dem Tempo weiterarbeiten, mit dem wir jetzt arbeiten, weil Frauen in höhere Positionen aufsteigen und CEO werden \nUnd sie werden in der Geschäftswelt mehr akzeptiert, es ist ein langsamer Prozess\nAber es passiert und die Menschen beginnen, es mehr zu akzeptieren \nUnd genau wie Männer, die zu Hause bleiben \nEs wird mehr akzeptiert, weil sie erkennen, oh, warte mal, vielleicht hat die Frau den besseren Job oder sie möchte diejenige sein, die arbeitet \nUnd \nUnd dann, für Leute in der Modeindustrie, werden Leute sagen, oh, vielleicht hören sie auf ihre Freundinnen oder ihre Frauen und so \nUnd dann wissen sie, woher ich komme \nAlso musst du irgendwie fördern, indem du die guten Eigenschaften der Menschen hervorbringst, die normalerweise durch Stereotype \nSind stereotypisiert, indem du nicht zu aufdringlich bist \nAber um \nSagst du die Eigenschaften von ihnen \nWeil wenn du es erzwingst, werden die Leute Widerstand leisten \nUnd ich fühle, dass wir uns in einem guten Gleichgewicht befinden, wo es anfängt, so durchgesetzt zu werden \nAlso weiß ich nicht wirklich, ob es etwas gibt, was wir jetzt tun können, was nicht bereits getan wird, denn wenn du es zu schnell machst, werden die Leute Widerstand leisten \nUnd wir sind weit gekommen und Wandel braucht Zeit \nJa \nUm \nNun, ich denke, sie werden wahrscheinlich auch gegenseitig diskriminiert, je nach Art der Arbeit, die du hast oder \nWo du herkommst. \nWenn du auf einem Bauernhof aufgewachsen bist und deine Grammatik vielleicht nicht so gut ist, aber du bist extrem intelligent und du arbeitest dich hoch in einen CEO-Job \nAuch wenn deine Grammatik vielleicht nicht die beste der Welt ist und \nOder auch wenn du intelligent bist, aber deine Grammatik nicht die beste der Welt ist \nAndere Männer könnten dich herablassend betrachten und sagen: Nun, wie kann ich wissen, dass du wirklich das sagst, wenn du nicht einmal Verben und Nomen richtig zusammenfügen kannst \nAlso \nJa \nAlso manchmal wird man nur deswegen diskriminiert, woher man kommt. \nUnd von Geschlecht zu Geschlecht \nUnd ich weiß nicht \nIch denke, das wäre ein weiteres Beispiel \nUm \nNicht wirklich\n\n**[REWRITE]\nUm, yes, I feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States. \nAnd not only with women. I think it also has to do with the particular field of work that you're dealing with. \nI mean, overall, I think women have it harder because there's the glass ceiling, where even though there's supposed to be equality, most people have a hard time finding that they could have to work under a woman if they're a man. \nJust because of how society has been raised for so long. \nAnd so, women often see a job that they could reach, \nAnd they have all the qualifications for it. \nBut maybe the board won't elect to promote them to that position just because historically it's not seen that women are usually in the upper hands of the business world. \nAnd um, I guess the same thing goes for men. \nAnd in other industries like fashion or \nUm, being a parent at home \nIt's really uncommon \nUm, \nTo have a parent staying at home who is the male. \nAnd um, \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks, oh well, you're the male, you should be out working. \nYou should be the money maker of your family. \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really hard on them because perhaps it's always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job. \nAnd like it's working out fine for them. \nBut society looks down upon that. \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm, \nA lot of times people won't really take males seriously if they're straight. \nI don't know if that really makes sense. \nBut I guess it's because typically males who are into fashion \nUm, \nLike I guess have different styles of life. \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you're a male and you're in the fashion industry, \nPeople will be like, well, wait how do I really know if you, you know, what fashion is for a woman. \nLike you don't really don't know what our case is like. \nLike these other guys. \nAnd so, \nDepending on like what field of work you're in, \nI feel like there's definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm, \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds. \nBut change is really slow, so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEOs and they're getting more accepted in the business world and it's a slow process, \nBut it's happening and people are starting to accept it more. \nAnd just as men who are stay-at-home dads, \nIt's becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works. \nAnd um, \nAnd then for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they're listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff. \nAnd so they do know like where I'm coming from. \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotyped against by not being too pushy. \nBut um saying like the qualities of them. \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist. \nAnd I feel that we're kind of at a good balance where it's starting to become enforced like that. \nSo I don't really know if there's anything that we can do right now that isn't already being done because if you do it too fast it's like people will resist. \nAnd we've come a long ways and change takes time. \nYes. \nUm, \nWell, I guess they're probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you're from. \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn't the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself. \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job. \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and. \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don't have the best grammar in the world. \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you're really what you're saying if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right. \nSo, \nYeah, \nSo like sometimes just where you're from can discriminate against you. \nAnd like from gender to gender. \nAnd I don't know. \nI guess that'd be another example. \nUm, \nNot really. \n\n\n[/REWRITE]",

I guess a lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week, and they're very strict on how things are done. And sometimes, I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to a tee, and they don't accept people who aren't exactly perfect Catholics. And they also don't accept people of other religions. Like for example, my dad was an Episcopalian, my mom was a Catholic, and they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion.\n\nAnd that's not really like being tolerant of other religions. We always learned to love others, that's a Catholic teaching, but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them in a way like that. So I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things, but then the Catholic practice goes against it because it's so outdated, but they continue to stick with it anyway.\n\nI don't think that would necessarily influence it.

I guess a lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week, and they're very strict on how things are done. And sometimes, I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to a tee, and they don't accept people who aren't exactly perfect Catholics. And they also don't accept people of other religions. Like for example, my dad was an Episcopalian, my mom was a Catholic, and they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion.\n\nAnd that's not really like being tolerant of other religions. We always learned to love others, that's a Catholic teaching, but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them in a way like that. So I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things, but then the Catholic practice goes against it because it's so outdated, but they continue to stick with it anyway.\n\nI don't think that would necessarily influence it.

Und also, wenn du verheiratet bist, denke ich, dass sie es einfach als zivile Union betrachten sollten, weil es das ist. Es sind zwei Menschen. Sie sollten keine Trennung von Kirche und Staat haben. Sie sollten nicht darauf schauen, wie es mit der Ehe war. Zwei Personen wurden vereint. Also, und die Tatsache, dass die eheliche Verbindung ... ich meine, das würde einfach ... oh, zwei Personen haben ein ziviles Bündnis.\n\nUm, nun, wenn alle Bundesstaaten zu einem logischen Schlussfolgerung gelangen können, sollten sie versuchen, es zum Bundesgesetz zu machen.

Und ich denke nicht, dass man in einem solchen Fall berechtigt ist, der Entscheidung eines Bundesstaates zu widersprechen, wenn dieser die Homo-Ehe legalisiert, denn man hat sich ja quasi für das Leben in diesem Bundesstaat entschieden. Also denke ich, dass Homosexuelle die gleichen Chancen wie Heterosexuelle haben sollten, also glaube ich, dass es auf die Entscheidung jedes Bundesstaates ankommt.\n\nIch habe das bereits sozusagen beantwortet, aber… ja, ich glaube nicht, dass Bush die Möglichkeit haben sollte, zu entscheiden, dass das ganze Land gegen die Homo-Ehe sein sollte. Ich denke, es liegt im Ermessen jedes einzelnen Bundesstaates, ob er sie legalisieren möchte, ich stimme seiner Verbotserklärung nicht zu.\n\nIch denke einfach nicht, dass Bush in jedem einzelnen Bundesstaat lebt, also sollte er nicht in der Lage sein, zu bestimmen, wie jeder Bundesstaat selbst regiert werden möchte. Also denke ich, dass einige Dinge den einzelnen Bundesstaaten überlassen werden sollten. Außerdem wird er in zwei Jahren sowieso aus dem Amt gehen.

betroffen war\nUm\nIch war dafür, dorthin zu gehen und so viel Chaos zu verursachen, wie sie hier verursacht haben\nUm\nIch denke, dass wir, da es so eine emotionale Sache war, viele Dinge übersehen haben und nicht wirklich an die lange Sicht gedacht haben\nUnd wir sind einfach so hingegangen, wie unvorbereitet ohne einen Plan\nUnd um\nIch denke wirklich, dass es gegen uns zurückgestoßen ist\nUm\nIch uh\nIch weiß es nicht\nIch war dafür\nAber jetzt bin ich sehr dagegen\nIch glaube nicht, dass es etwas gebracht hat\nUm\nIch denke, die Leute dort\nSolange sie untereinander kämpfen, können sie nicht auch mit uns kämpfen\nAls ob unsere Anwesenheit dort nichts bewirken würde, wenn sie\nWenn sie sich nicht einmal selbst arrangieren können\nAlso um\nWie leider wegen 9/11 habe ich fast nur\nIch interessiere mich einfach nicht dafür, was dort passiert\nUm\nMit diesen Menschen\nIch interessiere mich einfach nicht\nIch denke einfach\nIch glaube nicht, dass\nManchmal glaube ich nicht, dass sie menschliche Wesen sind\nIch weiß es nicht\nAls ob sie untereinander kämpfen und es nicht können\nSie können einfach nichts selbst tun\nAlso interessiere ich mich wirklich nicht\nUm\nIch weiß es nicht\nWir sind definitiv nur unvorbereitet dorthin gegangen\nWir wussten nicht, was wir dort erwarten würden\nUm\nUnd es ist auch schlecht, weil Krieg für sie sehr unterschiedlich ist als Krieg für uns\nSie sind einfach wie wilde Menschen, wenn es um Krieg geht, und ich glaube nicht, dass sie versuchen, ihr Land zu verbessern\nIch denke, sie wollen nur, dass wir weggehen\nUnd ich denke, das sollte für uns in Ordnung sein\nIch denke, wir sollten einfach gehen und das ist es eigentlich\nUm\nWir haben einfach\nIch denke, wir waren eher überschwänglich als alles andere\nIch glaube nicht, dass wir rationell darüber nachgedacht haben, was das zu bewirken hätte oder wie sie reagieren würden, wenn wir dort hinkämen und versuchten, ihren gesamten Lebensstil zu verändern und\nUm\nIch denke einfach\nWir sind eigentlich nur dorthin gegangen, um Rache zu suchen, und ich glaube, Präsident Bush ist dorthin gegangen, weil die Leute aufgrund dessen dorthin wollten, was passiert war\nUnd um\nIch denke auch, dass er es sich selbst auferlegt hat, einen Krieg gegen Irak auszurufen\nUm\nAber zu der Zeit verstehe ich, woher er kam\nWir wirklich\nIch glaube nicht, dass wir die Wahl hatten, einen Krieg gegen den Irak zu erklären, weil sie das tun können und wir dann einfach sagen: Okay, wir bauen wieder auf.\nAlso\nUm\nIch glaube nicht, dass wir es ignorieren konnten\nAber ich denke, wir hätten einfach einen besseren Plan haben können, was wir tun würden\nIch glaube nicht, dass sie sehr klar waren darüber, was wir tun sollten, in Bezug auf die Schaffung von Ordnung\nUnd ich weiß nicht\nIch denke einfach, dass sie es nicht \nEs gab keine Einheit\nSie wussten nicht, wofür sie dorthin gingen\nAlso denke ich, das hätte uns viel mehr geholfen\nAber wie gesagt, ich dachte, es war alles Emotion und Wut, mit der wir dorthin gegangen sind\nAlso das haben wir wiederum dort geschaffen\nUm\nUnd ehrlich gesagt\nIch glaube nicht, dass wir die sind, die diese Menschen ändern\nIch denke wirklich, sie werden immer so sein\nUnd um\nIch habe wirklich nichts mehr zu sagen\nEs ist definitiv lange genug gegangen\nUm\nIch glaube nicht, dass wir genug Fortschritte erzielen\nWie wir Fortschritte gemacht haben\nAber nicht genug, um dort zu bleiben\nUnd ich denke, egal wie lange wir da bleiben\nSobald wir gehen, wird es nur zusammenbrechen\nUnd wir können nicht für immer da bleiben\nAlso denke ich, wir schaden uns selbst, indem wir da bleiben\nNein\nOkay\n\n\n**[REWRITE]\nOkay, here's the translation back to English:\n\nOkay,\nThe war\nAt first, I was for it because I was personally affected by 9/11\nI was for going over there and pretty much creating as much havoc as they did here\nI think that since it was such an emotional thing that happened, we

know\nI was for it\nBut now I'm very against it\nI don't think it did anything\nUm\nI think the people over there\nAs long as they're fighting with each other, they can't be fighting with us either\nLike I don't think us being over there is going to do anything if they're\nIf they can't even get along with themselves\nSo um\nLike unfortunately because of 9/11 I've almost just\nI just don't care about what goes on over there\nUm\nWith those people\nI just don't care\nI just think\nI don't think that\nSometimes I don't think they're human\nI don't know\nLike they fight with each

happened\nAnd um\nAlso I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq\nUm\nBut at the time I see where he was coming from\nWe really\nI don't think we had a choice but to declare

really don't have anything else to say\nIt's gone one definitely long enough\nUm\nI don't think we're making enough progress\nLike we've made progress\nBut not enough to stay in there\nAnd I think no
