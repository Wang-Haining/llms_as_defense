    "raw_output": "Here is the German translation followed by the English translation:\n\n**German:**\n\nIch glaube, dass die Homo-Ehe legalisiert werden sollte, weil es eigentlich keinen guten Grund dagegen gibt. Viele Menschen denken, dass homosexuelle Paare eine Bedrohung für die heterosexuelle Familie darstellen, aber es ist so unterschiedlich. Es gibt so viele verschiedene Aspekte, die es niemals mit dem gleichen vergleichen könnten. Es ist einfach so, als wären es zwei verschiedene Seiten derselben Münze. Kopf wird nie Schwanz sein, aber es ist das gleiche Ding. Und es gibt viele zivilrechtliche Rechte, die damit einhergehen, wie z. B. Grundsteuer und die ganze Gesundheitsversorgung, wo, ähm, dein Haupt- oder dein, ich möchte nicht sagen, nächster Angehöriger, weil ich nicht sicher bin, ob das richtig ist, aber wenn du in einem homosexuellen Paar bist, kann dein Partner nicht bei dir im Zimmer sein, wenn du krank bist, und kann nicht besuchen, weil er nicht technisch gesehen zur Familie gehört. Und ich finde, das ist etwas lächerlich, wenn du den Rest deines Lebens mit jemandem verbringen willst. Und viele wissenschaftliche Studien wurden durchgeführt, weil es heutzutage ein heißes Thema ist, und homosexuelle Paare haben die gleichen Erfolgsraten. Sie haben die gleichen Faktoren in der Beziehung, die zur Zufriedenheit beitragen, wie heterosexuelle Paare. Es ist einfach eine Beziehung, es ist das gleiche. Und ich denke, dass viele Leute daran hängen bleiben, dass Homosexuelle nicht um das Recht bitten, in einer Kirche zu heiraten, sondern um ein Heiratszertifikat, ein offizielles Dokument, das vom Staat ausgestellt wird. Und wenn es keine Verbindung zwischen Kirche und Staat gibt, sollte das kein Problem sein, denn ich kann nicht verstehen, wo Leute wie Katholiken sagen können: Oh, das widerspricht unserer Religion und das ist moralisch falsch für uns und wir können das nicht unterstützen. Aber im juristischen Sinne, wenn du jemandem eine eingetragene Partnerschaft erlaubst, warum gibst du ihnen nicht die Ehe? Es ist wie Rassentrennung: getrennt, aber ungleich. Ja, sie sind es, sie sind in vielerlei Hinsicht gleich, wie die Art der Rollen, die von den verschiedenen Partnern gespielt werden und so weiter. Und die Leute sorgen sich um Adoptionsprobleme und gesellschaftliche Probleme, wie sich ein homosexuelles Paar in ihrer Gemeinschaft auswirken wird. Und besonders um die Kinder von homosexuellen Paaren und wie sie sich an die Gesellschaft anpassen werden und ob sie ihre Eltern' sexuelle Orientierung beeinflussen lassen oder nicht. Aber wieder ist es irgendwie neu, und es ist schwer zu sagen. Ich bin mir nicht sicher, was mit den Kindern passiert. In Bezug auf die Adoption denke ich, dass das Hauptproblem darin liegt, wie Kinder von ihren Altersgenossen und anderen Erwachsenen in der Gesellschaft behandelt werden. In New York City weiß ich, dass es spezielle Schulen für Kinder von lesbischen Eltern gibt, weil öffentliche Schulen in New York City von ihnen geschlagen werden. Und so weiter. Eltern protestieren, damit das Kind von der Schule genommen wird. Und es ist nur ein Kind. Ich meine, sie werden die gleichen Ansichten haben und alles. Die Erziehungskompetenzen sind in homosexuellen Paaren ebenso wie in heterosexuellen Paaren gleich. Und sie können an der Gemeinschaft beteiligt sein oder nicht, wie heterosexuelle Paare es wählen. Es geht einfach um persönliche Entscheidungen. Ich glaube, dass die Bundesregierung sich sehr stark mit diesem Thema befassen sollte, die Homo-Ehe in allen Bundesstaaten legal machen sollte. Ich denke, die Änderung sollte einfach das Gegenteil sein. Aber ich denke, Präsident Bush hat sehr, sehr feste Ansichten zu diesem Thema, die mit seiner Religion zu tun haben. Nun, sein, ähm, seine Meinung zu Homo-Ehe, die, ähm, ich denke, stimmt mit seiner Meinung zu Abtreibung und Stammzellforschung überein, und ich denke, dass die meisten Gründe, ich bin mir nicht sicher, weil ich ehrlich gesagt versuche nicht so viel auf Politik zu achten, aber die meisten Gründe, die ich zumindest in den Nachrichten gehört habe, sind moralische Gründe. Und Moral, ich möchte nicht sagen, dass sie verhandelbar ist, aber sie unterscheidet sich definitiv von Person zu Person. Und die Moral einer bestimmten Gruppe in Amerika zu akzeptieren, während die Kultur und die moralischen Konzepte aller anderen ignoriert werden, ist unethisch. Einfach nur zuzustimmen, was einige Religionsgruppen glauben, ohne die anderen zu berücksichtigen, ist ein Widerspruch in sich für die Regierung, ein Gesetz zu schaffen, das die Homo-Ehe verbietet, ist völlig widersprüchlich für die Regierung, wenn man bedenkt die aktuelle Kontroverse, wenn man bedenkt, ähm, unter Gott im Treueeid und wie die Leute so dagegen sind, aber gleichzeitig Gesetze zulassen, die religiöse Normen auf ein ganzes Land aufzwingen. ähm, nur ein, viele Menschen sind gegen Homosexualität und gegen die Homo-Ehe, weil sie glauben, dass Homosexuelle irgendwie psychologisch geschädigt sind und dass die Homosexualität aus Traumata in ihrer Kindheit resultiert, weil sie nicht nah genug an einem oder dem anderen Elternteil waren oder nur ein Persönlichkeitsfehler. Und das ist auch kein guter Grund, weil die American Psychological Association gerade eine Erklärung herausgegeben hat, wie unwahr das ist. Und wenn die Menschen auf Institutions, die tatsächlich Forschung und Studien zu diesen Themen durchgeführt haben, hören würden, anstatt auf ihre Nachbarn und Freunde zu hören und vielleicht auf die beliebte Meinung in ihrer Kultur, in ihrer Kirche, dann wäre die Welt vielleicht ein bisschen anders gesehen.\n\n**[REWRITE]**\nI think that gay marriage should be legalized because there's not really a good reason not to.

And I think that's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. And a lot of scientific studies have been done because it's kind of a hot topic these days, and homosexual couples have the same kind of success rates. They have the same, um, factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do. It's just a relationship, it's the same thing. And I think where a lot of people get hung up on is that homosexuals aren't asking for the right to get married in a church; they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. And if there's not involvement with church and state, then that shouldn't be an issue because I can't understand where people like Catholics can get hung up on oh well that's against our religion and that's morally wrong for us and we can't approve of that sort of thing, but in a legal sense, if you're allowing someone a civil union, why not allow them a marriage? It's like segregation: separate but unequal. Yeah, they are, they're the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that, and people worry about adoption issues and community issues, like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community, and especially about, um, children of gay couples and how they'll adjust to society and whether or not they'll, um, be influenced by their parent's, um, sexual orientation choices or not, but again, it's kind of new and stuff, but it's kind of hard to say, I'm not sure about the children aspect about adoption because I think the main drawback to that is, um, how children get treated by their peers and other adults in society. Like in New York City, I know they, um, they have special schools for children of gay parents because in public schools in New York City, they get like beaten up and stuff like that. Parents protest to get the child removed from their school, and it's just a kid. I mean, they're going to have the same points of view and everything. Parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples, and they can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to. I mean, it's just about personality choices. I think the federal government should be very involved in this issue, making gay marriage legal in every state. I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own, having to do with his religion. Well, his, um, his take on gay marriage actually, um, I think it goes along with his take on abortion and stem cell research, which, um, I think most of the reasons, I'm not sure about this because, honestly, I try not to pay attention to politics a lot, but most of the reasons I've heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons, and morality, I don't want to say it's negotiable, but it definitely differs from person to person. And to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and, um, morality concepts of all the rest is unethical. To just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account, to go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy, considering I mean about, um, under God in the pledge of allegiance, and how people are so opposed to that, but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country. Um, just one, lots of people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged, and that the gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood, not being close enough to one or the other of the parents, or just a personality defect. And that is also not a good reason because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is. And if people listened to, um, institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends, and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church, then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently.

Jahrhundert anzupassen. \nEs ist nicht mehr so streng wie früher. \nIch weiß, selbst als ich aufgewachsen bin, als ich jünger war, ging ich jeden Sonntag in die Kirche. \nUnd ich würde immer hübsche kleine Kleider anziehen. \nUnd passende Schuhe. \nUnd eine passende Handtasche. \nUnd das war einfach bei allem, was ich hatte. \nIch ging auf eine Privatschule. \nUnd ich würde dort am Wochenende alle meine Freunde sehen. \nUnd wir würden einfach hingehen. \nAber jetzt, seit ich älter geworden bin, haben sie so etwas wie eine Teenagermesse eingeführt. \nUnd sie haben sie auf 30 Minuten gekürzt. \nUnd die Leute kleiden sich viel legerer. \nBesonders im Sommer kommen die Leute in ihren Strandkleidern, direkt vom Strand. \nMan hat die Familien dort, die gerade zu spät kommen. \nAlso denke ich, es ist legerer geworden. \nSelbst bei den morgendlichen Messen, wo ich früher immer schick angezogen war, tragen die Leute jetzt Jeans und Chino. \nNun, Chino ist auch schön. \nAber insgesamt viel legerer. \nWas andere Dinge angeht, \nDas ist das Wichtigste, was ich bemerkt habe. \nWie zum Beispiel die Kirche, die ich kenne. \nIch kenne die Politik in der Kirche nicht, und so weiter. \nAber ja, das ist es.\n\n[OK, nun zu all den Anschuldigungen gegen katholische Priester, die sich mit Pädophilie befassen, glauben Sie, dass diese hätten verhindert werden können, wenn die Kirche sich zum Beispiel für die Zulassung weiblicher Priester oder die Zulassung von Priestern zum Heiraten entschieden hätte?]\n\nUhhh, ich glaube nicht, dass diese Dinge hätten verhindert werden können, \nweil es verheiratete Männer gibt, \ndie immer noch Pädophile werden. \nUnd sie haben immer noch \nÄhm \nEine Anziehungskraft auf junge Kinder. \nDaher denke ich, selbst wenn man ihnen die Ehe erlaubt, ist es einfach die Person, es liegt nicht daran, ob sie heiraten dürfen oder nicht. \nUhhh, ich denke auch, dass es bei ihrer Entscheidung, Priester zu werden, ihre eigene Entscheidung ist. \nUhhh \nEs gibt Religionen, in denen sie heiraten dürfen und Priester sein können, \nwie in \"7th Heaven\". \nIch weiß nicht, was er ist, \nein Pastor oder ein Pfarrer oder so. \n[Mmm hmm] \nAber sie dürfen heiraten. \nAlso ich weiß, es ist ein bisschen anders. \nAber wenn sie wirklich ihre Religion leben und gleichzeitig verheiratet sein wollen, sollten sie vielleicht eine andere Religion in Betracht ziehen. \n[Kannst du deine Antwort bitte noch etwas genauer erläutern?]\nUhhh,  \nWelchen Teil? \nÜber \n[Uhhh]\nNur die Veränderungen? \n[Dass es eigentlich keinen Unterschied machen würde, nehme ich an]\nAch, zum Thema Pädophilie? \n[Mmm hmm]\nUhhh\nIch denke \nDas ganze \nUhhh \nGeschlechtlichkeit, vorher war es genetisch bedingt. \nIch denke, es ist genetisch bedingt. \nIch glaube nicht, dass Menschen \nUhhh \nNur zufällig dazu werden. \nIch denke, sie werden so geboren. \nIch glaube nicht, dass es etwas mit ihrer Erziehung zu tun hat. \nEs könnte vielleicht in diesem Fall etwas damit zu tun haben. \nAber \nIch denke, es sind ihre Gene. \nUnd man kann das nicht durch eine Ehe verstecken. \nMan könnte versuchen, \nAber \nDann würde es normalerweise rauskommen. \nAlso \nIch denke, die Kirche hätte nichts tun können, um das zu verhindern. \nUhhh \nWenn sie davon wussten und versuchten, es zu vertuschen, dann sind sie verwerflich. \nAber \nIch glaube nicht, dass sie in allen Fällen wussten. \n[Hast du noch weitere Gedanken zum katholischen Glauben?]\nUhhh nein. \"\n\n## Rewritten English:\n\n[REWRITE]I think the church has already changed to adapt to the 21st century. \nIt's not as strict as it used to be. \nI know, even as I grew up when I was younger, I would always go to church every Sunday. \nAnd I would always wear cute little dresses. \nAnd matching shoes. \nAnd a matching purse. \nAnd that was just every single week. \nI went to a private school. \nAnd I would see all my friends there on the weekends. \nAnd we would just go. \nBut now that I've gotten older, they've made like a teenager mass. \nAnd they've cut it down to thirty minutes. \nAnd people dress a lot more casual. \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes, like straight from the beach. \nYou'd have the families there that are just running in late. \nSo I think it has become more casual. \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always dress up, people are wearing jeans and khakis. \nWell khakis are nice too. \nBut just a lot more casual in respect to that. \nAs for other things, that's the biggest thing that I noticed. \nLike that's the church I know. \nI don't know the politics into the church and what not. \nBut yeah, that's it.\n\n[OK, um regarding all of the accusations against Catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm, I don't think that these things could have been avoided. \nBecause there are married men \nAnd they still become pedophiles. \nAnd they still have \nUh, \nAn attraction towards young kids. \nSo I think even if you got them married it's just the person it's not because they're allowed to get married or not allowed to get married. \nUm, I think also when they're becoming a priest it's their choice to become a priest. \nUm, \nThere are religions that they're allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven. \nI don't know what kind of \nHe's a reverend or a minister or something. \n[Mm hmm]\nBut they're allowed to get married. \nSo I know it's a little different. \nBut, if they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith. \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm, \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn't make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm, \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics. \nI think it's based on genetics. \nI don't think people \nUm \nJust become it. \nI think they're born that way. \nI don't think it has anything to do with the way they're brought up. \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case. \nBut \nI think it's their genetics. \nAnd you can't hide that through a marriage. \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out. \nSo \nI don't think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening. \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them. \nBut \nI don't think in all cases they knew. \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church?]\nUm no. \n[/REWRITE]",

    "raw_output": "(lacht) \nUm \nInitially war ich einverstanden mit der Prämisse, aber ich denke, dass alle noch sehr unter dem Schock der Anschläge vom 11. September waren und ich denke, dass wir in den Irak als Vorwand eingetreten sind, es gab Vorwände, die uns in den Irak führten \nIch denke, dass die Bush-Regierung frühzeitig den Irak-Krieg mit Osama bin Laden und den Anschlägen vom 11. September in Verbindung brachte und behauptete, Saddam Hussein habe Massenvernichtungswaffen, was sich alles als falsch herausgestellt hat \nUnd das hat mich sehr geärgert und im Allgemeinen macht der Irak-Krieg bei mir einfach die Wut hoch \n\nUm \nEs erscheint mir, als hätte die Bush-Regierung das amerikanische Volk sehr offen belogen und ist dieser Tatsache bis heute nicht auf den Grund gegangen \nSogar Colin Powell \nIch meine, nachdem er diese große Präsentation beim UN gegeben hat, sagt er jetzt, dass er damals nicht wirklich von den Beweisen überzeugt war, selbst als er sie präsentierte \nUnd \nDas empfinde ich als Amtsmissbrauch, ich denke, das ist ein Abberufungsdelikt, wenn man das amerikanische Volk so belügt \nIch denke, die Bush-Regierung hat totale Verachtung für die Verfassung und versucht, sie seitdem zu marginalisieren \nNa ja, seit mindestens dem 11. September, meine ich \nIch denke, dass sie \nUm \nSie sind mit der Absicht in die Regierung eingetreten, Krieg zu führen \n\nUm \nDieser letzte Teil \n\nIch vergess den Namen des \nUm \nFinanzministers, der diese Behauptung in seinem Buch erhoben hat, nachdem er wahrscheinlich aus seinem Amt gedrängt wurde \nUm \nAber es scheint, dass der jüngere Bush irgendwie mit einem Blutrache-Gefühl gegen Saddam Hussein gekommen ist, wegen der Irak-Krise seiner Regierung und ich denke, dass er langfristig auch unsere Energieversorgung ausbauen wollte \nWas auch ein sehr hinterhältiger Weg ist, die Dinge zu machen \n\nNun \nIch denke, es ist lang genug gegangen \nIch denke, es gäbe Probleme, wenn wir jetzt zurückziehen würden, denn es besteht eine gute Chance, dass das Land in einen Bürgerkrieg ausbricht und noch mehr Menschen sterben würden \nUm \nIch denke, die Alternative, die die Vereinten Nationen und die Vereinigten Staaten zu diesem Zeitpunkt anstreben, scheint eher eine Koalition von Nationen aus der Umgebung zu sein, wie Syrien und Saudi-Arabien, die eintreten wollen, um die Ordnung wiederherzustellen \nAber ich weiß nicht notwendigerweise, dass das eine gute Idee ist, denn ich denke, dass das langfristig auch mehr Probleme verursachen wird, weil \nUm \nDie Souveränität des Irak ein Problem werden wird \nEin großes Problem, weil ich denke, es ist ziemlich klar, dass die Übergangsregierung derzeit auseinanderfällt \n\nNur aus den Nachrichtenberichten, die ich gehört habe, scheint mir, dass das Parlament nicht sehr effektiv ist \nDas um \nOh, ich kann mich nicht an seinen Namen erinnern, aber der Premierminister hat irgendwie die Kontrolle über den politischen Prozess oder das, was passiert, oder selbst Mugtada al-Sadr, den Typen, mit dem wir vor weniger als einem Jahr gekämpft haben \nSeine Partei hat jetzt mindestens 20 Sitze im irakischen Parlament, und ich meine, wir haben immer noch mit fraktionalen radikalen Elementen zu tun, die um die Kontrolle über die Regierung kämpfen \nUnd ich denke, dass der politische Prozess aufgrund dessen viel Reibung erlebt \n\nUm \n(lacht) \nKeine, die ich in höflicher Gesellschaft artikulieren kann\n\n\n\n[REWRITE]\n(laughs)\nInitially, I was okay with the premise, but I think everyone was still reeling from the September 11th attacks, and I think we kind of went into Iraq as a pretext. There were pretexts that led us into Iraq. I think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama bin Laden and the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which has since proven false.\nAnd that's very much rubbed me the wrong way, and in general, the Iraq war just makes my blood boil.\n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact. Even Colin Powell\nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it.\nAnd \nTo me, that's just malfeasance in office. I think that's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. I think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since. Well, since September 11th at least. I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war.\n\nUm \nThat last part\n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office. \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration, and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too, which is also a very underhanded way to do things.\n\nWell \nI do think it's gone on long enough. I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though because there's a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result.\nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order.\nBut I don't necessarily know that that's a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq's sovereignty will come to be an issue. A major issue there because I think it's pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point.\n\nJust from the news reports I've heard, it doesn't seem that the Parliament is very effective at all. That um \nOh, I can't remember his name, but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what's happening, and even Mugtada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting, I guess, it was less than a year ago, his party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament, and I mean we're still dealing with fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government.\nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that.\n\nUm \n(laughs)\nNone that I can articulate in polite company.\n\n\n\n[/REWRITE]\n",

nicht fair ist\nIch denke nicht, dass wir es überhaupt noch als Krieg bezeichnen sollten\nAber weil ich glaube, dass\nDu weißt\nIch denke, der einzige Grund, warum wir Waffen benutzen müssen, ist nur,

ist ein Grund, dort zu bleiben und zu versuchen, ihnen zu helfen\nAber es ist auch so, als würden wir unsere Ressourcen verschwenden\nUnd besonders jetzt fühle ich mich so schlecht für Bush, weil es so aussieht, als würde er zum einen der schlimmsten Präsidenten der USA werden\nAufgrund dessen, was es tut und es ist so,\nUnd was es tut, und es ist so,\nDenn denk dran\nIch denke, mit dem ganzen

you?\nUh\nOk yeah\nUm\nHuh\nI guess you could also say that it is\nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in\nWhose sons and

die Leute betrifft, die versuchen, es zu kriminalisieren, denke ich, dass sie damit wirklich den Glauben einer Kirche gegenüber einem anderen bevorzugen,\ndenn wie wir sehen können, sind die meisten

gesagt, zeigt sein Kampf für diese Änderung, dass er eine Präferenz für eine bestimmte Religion gegenüber allen anderen Religionen hat.\nAlso fühle ich mich wirklich so, dass es an den Kirchen liegt,

Du kannst nicht - ich meine, als R.A. muss ich damit schon zu tun gehabt haben - wenn du etwas rausbringst, färbt es die Meinung der Leute über dich. Und wenn du über das Sprengen von Sachen sprichst oder über Schüssen, wird jemand etwas sagen. Du kannst das nicht rauslassen, der Welt präsentieren. Das Internet wird von jedem gesehen. Wenn du mit dieser Person auf Myspace befreundet bist, bekommst du diese Mitteilung. Natürlich war es nicht die Schule, die die Mitteilung bekommen hat. Jemand ist zur Schule gegangen und sie müssen darauf reagieren. Sie können es nicht einfach liegen lassen, weil dann, Gott bewahre, wenn etwas passiert, hätten sie es verhindern können. [Richtig]\n\nWieder mal weiß man nicht, was man ernst nehmen soll, denn einige Leute spielen einfach so herum. Ich meine, es könnte wie die Situation an unserer Schule sein. Es könnte ein Experiment sein, das für einen - für ein … ein Soziologie-Kurs? Entschuldigung, ich konnte den Begriff einen Moment lang nicht erinnern. Und es könnte auch etwas sehr ernstes sein. Ich denke, was hier passiert ist, war, dass … etwas passiert ist und jemand hat gehört, wie jemand etwas in der Schule gesagt hat, und dann wurde es gemeldet. Als wir schließlich herausgefunden haben, wer die Person war, haben sie … ein Freund von ihm hat seinen Facebook durchgesehen und war sehr besorgt, weil es dort einige Dinge gab, die er vielleicht als Scherz gemeint hat, aber angesichts der Situation sehr ernst wurden.\n\nWenn du Dinge in das öffentliche Forum des Internets stellst, gibt es eigentlich keine Verletzung der Privatsphäre. Wenn du es nicht da draußen haben willst, dann stell es nicht dorthin. Wenn du nicht möchtest, dass jemand es findet, wenn du nicht möchtest, dass jemand etwas von dir denkt, kannst du ihnen nicht sagen, was sie denken sollen. Du kannst den Leuten nicht sagen, was sie ernst nehmen sollen oder nicht. Ich meine, ich denke nicht, dass Schulleiter ihre Schüler auf Myspace und Facebook freunden und stalken sollten und durch Facebooks und Myspaces und Xangas und Live Journals gehen sollten. Aber wenn es den Schulleitungen gemeldet wird, gibt es da wirklich keine Verletzung der Privatsphäre, weil es von jemandem gemeldet wurde, dem du Zugang gewährt hast. Und wenn Gefahr besteht, müssen sie es ernst nehmen.\n\nIch meine, wie gesagt, ich denke nicht, dass sie Telefonate, SMS und Chats überwachen sollten und … wenn es ihnen gemeldet wird, ist es etwas ganz anderes.\n\nAlso, ein Lehrer sollte kein Facebook- oder Myspace-Konto unter einem anderen Namen erstellen und seine Schüler freunden, denn dann ist es dasselbe. Ich würde meine Bewohner nicht freunden, weil ich ehrlich gesagt nicht wissen möchte, ob sie ausgehen, trinken und dann ihre Bilder auf Facebook posten. Dann taucht es auf und ich muss es sehen und muss etwas dagegen tun. Es ist nicht meine Sache, also möchte ich diese Verbindung nicht.\n\n\n## Rewritten English:\n\n[REWRITE]\nSo, when you put something on the internet, it's public. It's completely public. You can't - I mean, as an RA, it's something I've actually had to deal with already. When you put something out there, it influences people's opinions of you. And if you're talking about blowing things up or if you're talking about shootings, someone's going to say something. You can't put that out there, put that into the world. The internet is seen by everyone. If you're friends with that person on Myspace, you get that bulletin. Obviously, it wasn't the school that got the bulletin. Someone went to the school and they have to act on that. They can't let it sit because then, God forbid something does happen, they could have prevented it. [Right]\n\nAgain, you don't know what to take seriously because some people just fool around like that. I mean, it could be like the situation we had at school. It could be an experiment that went terribly wrong for a - for a sociology class. Sorry, couldn't remember the word for a minute. And it could also be something very serious. I think what happened here was that something happened and someone overheard someone saying something in the school and then they reported it. When we finally found out who the person was, they looked through a friend of his Facebook and got very worried because there were some things on there that he may have meant as a joke but in light of the situation became very serious.\n\nWhen you put stuff out into the public forum of the internet, there's really no invasion of privacy that happens. If you don't want it out there, don't put it there. If you don't want someone to find it, if you don't want someone to think something of you, you can't tell them what to think. You can't tell people what to take seriously or not. I mean, I don't think school officials should be friending their students on Myspace and Facebook and stalking and going through Facebooks and Myspaces and all those things and Xangas and Live Journals. But if it is brought to the attention of the school officials, there's really no invasion of privacy there because it's brought by someone who you gave access to it.

Auf Websites wie Myspace, wenn ich meine, wenn du Informationen im Internet postest, ist es eigentlich für jeden einsehbar. Und ich verstehe, auf Myspace musst du, weißt du, jemanden haben, der Mitglied sein muss, um das Profil einer Person zu sehen. Du musst vielleicht, weißt du, ihr Freund sein oder so etwas. Aber wenn das der Fall ist, hast du diese Person als deinen „Freund“ akzeptiert, damit sie es sehen kann. Du gibst ihnen die Erlaubnis, dein Profil zu sehen. Also, meine ich, wann immer du Informationen im Internet postest, musst du eigentlich verstehen, dass viele Leute diese sehen werden. Also glaube ich, dass es gut war, dass jemand das gesehen hat und konnte verhindern, dass ein Leben verloren ging.\n\nHum.\nÄhm.\nDas ist schwierig,\nWeil ich meine, natürlich kann man nicht den ganzen Tag jemanden sitzen haben, der die verschiedenen Profile aller Schüler der Schule durchsieht, um das zu verhindern. Aber dann wird es eine Art Diskriminierung, wenn sie denken: „Lass uns die schlechten Schüler ansehen und sehen, ob sie nichts im Schilde führen.“\nÄhm.\nIch meine,\nIch glaube nicht, dass es richtig wäre, jemanden mit der Aufgabe zu betrauen, die Profile der Leute anzusehen. Aber ich denke, es kommt alles darauf an, welche Situation sie mit diesem Profil erlebt haben. Oder hat jemand einfach nur zufällig die Profile der Leute durchgesehen und zufällig das gesehen? Oder haben sie tatsächlich nach Beweisen gesucht, dass der Schüler etwas plante? Also, ich weiß es nicht wirklich.\n\nSicher.\nÄhm.\nNun, ich habe persönlich kein Myspace, aber ich habe ein Facebook.\nJa, ich habe es. Es ärgert mich, dass ich weiß, dass es da draußen gruselige Leute gibt, die Dinge über mich sehen können. Ich habe einmal etwas im Fernsehen gesehen, das darüber handelte.\nEs ging um einen Mann, der einfach nur beweisen wollte, wie leicht er Informationen bekommen konnte. Er ging auf das Profil dieses Mädchens und bekam sofort ihren Bildschirmnamen und schrieb ihr über den Instant Messenger. In einem, weißt du, in weniger als einer Minute und brachte sie dazu, sich mit ihm zu treffen. Und ich meine, persönlich würde ich niemals mit jemanden wie dem zusammenkommen, aber ich hatte in meinen Kursen Leute, die ich ihre Bildschirmnamen nicht kenne, aber sie schreiben mir und wissen, dass es ich bin. Und es ist schwierig, weil man denkt, dass sie deine Interessen kennen. Sie wissen, wie du aussiehst. Manchmal, wenn du deinen Stundenplan einträgst, wissen sie, wo du tagsüber bist. Wer deine Freunde sind. Sie wissen eigentlich ziemlich viel über dich. Alle möglichen Fotos. Und ich habe versucht, das zu begrenzen, was ich hochlade, aber gleichzeitig ist der ganze Grund, warum ich einen habe, weißt du, damit ich mit einigen meiner Freunde kommunizieren kann. Ich möchte ihn nicht zu stark einschränken. Also ist es ein schwieriges Thema, weil ich nur Leute akzeptiere, die ich kenne. Ich meine, man weiß nie wirklich, wer was sehen kann. Also\n\nHum.\nÄhm.\nNun,\nIch habe gehört,\nMeine Mitbewohnerin erzählte mir, dass sie in ihrer\nMittelschule es gab ein großes Problem damit, dass Schüler von der Schule von Myspace ausgeschlossen wurden.\nUnd das hat mich etwas befremdet, wie die Schulbeamten den Schülern sagen konnten, dass sie keinen Myspace haben dürfen.\n\nUnd ich weiß nicht, ob das wirklich ein Datenschutzproblem ist, aber ich denke, ich weiß es nicht wirklich.\nWie sie das Recht hatten, den Leuten zu sagen\n\nDas ist der einzige andere Gedanke, den ich mir ausdenken kann.\n\nJa\n\n\n\n## English Translation:\n\n[REWRITE]Can I ask a question to clarify this? Um, it was prevented because someone went online and found that there was something like that. O okay. Um, no, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. On sites like Myspace, if I mean, if you post information on the internet, it's pretty much available for everyone to see. And I understand on Myspace you know, you have to have someone else be a member in order to see someone's profile. You might need to, you know, be their friend or something like that. But if that's the case, you've accepted that person as your \"friend\" so they can see it. You're giving them permission to see your profile. So, I mean, anytime you put information on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that. So if I think that was actually good that somebody saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost.\n\nHum. Um, that's tough because I mean obviously you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody's different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that. But then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, \"Oh let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything\". Um, I mean, I don't think it would really be right to go and have somebody's job be to look at peoples' profiles. But I guess it all depends on like what situation they came across that profile, or was someone just randomly looking at peoples' and just randomly happened to see that, or were they actually looking for, you know, some sort of evidence that the student was planning something. So I don't really know.\n\nSure. Um, well, um, like, I mean I I don't have a Myspace personally but I have a Facebook. I do. It bothers me that I know that there's creepy people out there who can see things about me. And I saw something on tv once that was about this. Um, this man who just, he was just trying to prove how he can get information so easily and he went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in like you know less than a minute and got her to meet with him. And I mean personally I certainly wouldn't meet with someone like that. But I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names, but they IM me and they know that it's me. And it's hard because you think that they know your interests, they know what you look like. Sometimes if you put your class schedule they know where you are during the day, who your friends are. They pretty much know a lot about you. All sorts of photos. And I tried to limit what I put up there, but at the same time, the whole point I think, the reason I have one is so you know I can communicate with some of my friends. I don't want to limit it too much. So it's a tricky issue because I only accept people I know. I mean, you never know really who can look at what. So.\n\nHum, uh, well, I heard my roommate was telling me that her, um, high school, there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school and that struck me as a little bit strange, like I wasn't sure how, how high school officials had the power to tell their students that they weren't allowed to have a Myspace. And I don't know if that's really a privacy issue, but I think, I don't really know, how they had the right to tell people. That's the only other thought I can think of.\n\n\nYes. [/REWRITE]",

    "raw_output": "Here is the translation of the text into German and back into English:\n\n**German:**\n\nUm ja, ich fühle, dass Diskriminierung aufgrund des Geschlechts in den Vereinigten Staaten immer noch ein Problem ist.\nUnd nicht nur bei Frauen. Ich denke, es hat etwas mit dem jeweiligen Arbeitsbereich zu tun, mit dem man zu tun hat.\nIch meine, insgesamt denke ich, dass Frauen es schwieriger haben, weil es die gläserne Decke gibt, wo es zwar Gleichheit geben soll, aber die meisten Menschen Schwierigkeiten haben, unter einer Frau zu arbeiten, wenn sie ein Mann sind, nur weil die Gesellschaft so lange erzogen wurde.\nUnd deshalb sehen Frauen oft auf dem Arbeitsmarkt einen Job, den sie erreichen können, und sie haben alle Qualifikationen dafür, aber vielleicht wird der Vorstand sie nicht in diese Position befördern, nur weil historisch gesehen nicht angenommen wird, dass Frauen in der Regel an der Spitze der Geschäftswelt sind.\nUnd ähm, ich denke, dasselbe gilt auch für Männer, und für andere Branchen wie Mode oder\nUm zu Hause Eltern sein\nEs ist wirklich ungewöhnlich,\nUm,\neinen Elternteil zu Hause zu haben, der männlich ist,\nUnd ähm,\noftmals schauen die Leute herab, weil die Gesellschaft denkt: Ach ja, du bist der Mann, du solltest arbeiten gehen,\nDu solltest der Ernährer deiner Familie sein. Warum bleibst du zu Hause?\nUnd es kann wirklich hart für sie sein, weil es vielleicht immer schon ihr Traum war, mit den Kindern zu sein und sie aufzuziehen, und vielleicht hat die Frau den besseren Job,\nUnd es läuft für sie gut,\nAber die Gesellschaft verurteilt das.\nUnd dann in der Modebranche\nUm,\nOftmals nehmen die Leute Männer nicht ernst, wenn sie hetero sind,\nIch weiß nicht, ob das wirklich Sinn macht,\nAber ich denke, es liegt daran, dass typischerweise Männer, die sich für Mode interessieren,\nUm,\nEgal, ich denke, haben unterschiedliche Lebensweisen,\nUnd wenn du den typischen Lebensstil hast und du bist männlich und du bist in der Modebranche,\nDann werden die Leute sagen: \"Na, wie kann ich wirklich wissen, ob du weißt, was Mode ist, wenn du so bist?\"\nDu kennst dich nicht so aus wie die anderen Typen.\nUnd deshalb,\nJe nachdem, in welchem ​​Arbeitsbereich du bist,\nIch denke, es gibt definitiv Geschlechterdiskriminierung in der Gesellschaft in den USA.\nUm sie zu ändern ist etwas schwieriger, weil die Gesellschaft einen gefestigten Denk lối hat und wir sind natürlich seit den 1800er Jahren weit gekommen, in Schritten und Sprüngen.\nAber der Wandel ist wirklich langsam, also denke ich, dass, wenn wir mit dem Tempo weiterarbeiten, mit dem wir jetzt arbeiten, weil Frauen in höhere Positionen aufsteigen und CEO werden und sie in der Geschäftswelt mehr akzeptiert werden, und es ist ein langwieriger Prozess,\nAber es geschieht und die Leute beginnen, es mehr zu akzeptieren.\nUnd genauso wie Männer, die Hausväter sind,\nEs wird mehr akzeptiert, weil sie erkennen: \"Ah, vielleicht hat die Frau den besseren Job oder sie möchte diejenige sein, die arbeitet.\"\nUnd ähm,\nUnd dann für Mode, werden die Leute sagen: \"Ah, vielleicht hören sie auf ihre Freunde, die Frauen oder ihre Frauen und so weiter\"\nUnd so wissen sie, woher ich komme.\nAlso muss man es irgendwie fördern, indem man die guten Eigenschaften der Menschen fördert, die in der Regel stereotypisiert werden, indem man nicht zu aufdringlich ist,\nAber ähm, man sagt einfach die Eigenschaften von ihnen,\nDenn wenn du es erzwingst, werden die Leute widerstehen.\nUnd ich fühle, dass wir uns in einem guten Gleichgewicht befinden, wo es anfängt, so durchgesetzt zu werden,\nAlso weiß ich nicht wirklich, ob es etwas gibt, das wir jetzt tun können, was noch nicht getan wird, denn wenn man es zu schnell macht, werden die Leute widerstehen.\nUnd wir sind schon weit gekommen und Wandel braucht Zeit.\nJa, \nUm,\nNun, ich denke, sie werden wahrscheinlich auch gegenseitig diskriminiert, je nach Art der Arbeit, die man hat, oder je nachdem, woher man kommt.\nWenn man auf einem Bauernhof aufgewachsen ist und deine Grammatik vielleicht nicht die beste ist, aber du bist extrem intelligent und du hast dich hochgekämpft\nWie zum Beispiel bis zu einem CEO-Job,\nAuch wenn deine Grammatik vielleicht nicht die beste ist,\nOder auch wenn du intelligent bist, aber nicht die beste Grammatik hast,\nAndere Männer könnten dich verachten und sagen: \"Na, wie soll ich wissen, dass du das wirklich meinst, wenn du nicht einmal Verben und Nomen richtig zusammensetzen kannst?\"\nAlso \nJa \nAlso, manchmal kann deine Herkunft dich diskriminieren,\nUnd von Geschlecht zu Geschlecht\nUnd ich weiß nicht \nIch denke, das wäre ein weiteres Beispiel. \nUm,\nNicht wirklich\n\n\n\n**[REWRITE]\n\nI feel that gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States. And it's not just against women. I think it has to do with the specific field of work you are in. I mean, overall, I think women have it harder because of the glass ceiling. Even though equality is supposed to exist, most people have a hard time working under a woman if they are a man, just because of how society has been raised for so long. And so women often see a job they can reach, and they have all the qualifications for it, but maybe the board won't elect to promote them to that position just because historically, women aren't usually seen in the upper echelons of the business world. And um, I guess the same thing goes for men, and for other industries like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent. It's really uncommon to have a male parent staying at home, and a lot of times people look down on that because society thinks, \"Oh, well, you're the male, you should be out working, you should be the money maker of your family. Why are you staying at home?\" And it can be really hard on them because perhaps it's always been their dream to be with the children and help raise them, and maybe the wife has the better job, and it's working out fine for them, but society looks down on that.  And then in the fashion industry, um a lot of times people won't really take males seriously if they're straight. I don't know if that really makes sense, but I guess it's because typically males who are into fashion, um, I guess have different lifestyles, and so if you have the typical lifestyle and you're a male and you're in the fashion industry, people will be like, \"Well, wait, how do I really know if you know what fashion is for a woman? Like you don't really know what our situation is like like these other guys.\" And so depending on what field of work you're in, I feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. To change it is kind of more difficult because society has a set mindset, and obviously, we have come a long way from the 1800s, leaps and bounds. But change is really slow, so I feel that if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEOs and they're getting more accepted in the business world, and it's a slow process, but it's happening, and people are starting to accept it more. And just as men who are stay-at-home dads, it's becoming more accepted because they realize, \"Oh, wait, maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works,\" and um, and then for like fashion, people will be like, \"Oh, wait, maybe they're listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff.\" And so they do know like where I'm coming from. So I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotyped against by not being too pushy, but um, saying like the qualities of them because if you force it people are going to resist. And I feel that we're kind of at a good balance where it's starting to become enforced like that, so I don't really know if there's anything that we can do right now that isn't already being done because if you do it too fast it's like people will resist, and we've come a long way and change takes time. Yes, um, well I guess they're probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you're from. Like if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn't the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself, like you work your way up into a CEO job, even though you might not have the best grammar in the world, and even though you might be intelligent, but you don't have the best grammar in the world, other men might look down upon you and be like, \"Well, how do I know you're really what you're saying if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right?\" So, yeah, so sometimes just where you're from can discriminate against you, and like from gender to gender, and I don't know, I guess that'd be another example, um, not really.

Zumindest bei einer Marihuana-Anklage. \nEines, worüber sich viele Kinder, viele Leute Sorgen machen, sind die zukünftigen Konsequenzen, und diese verschwinden nicht unbedingt, wenn es entkriminalisiert wird. \nAber gleichzeitig gibt es die Argumentation, dass … ähm … ich meine, es kostet viel, Menschen festzunehmen, sie zu bringen, sie anzumelden und ihnen eine Unterkunft zu geben und sie dann wieder freizulassen. \nUnd dann kostet es viel, Sie wissen, wenn sie einmal, vielleicht zweimal, vielleicht dreimal vor Gericht erscheinen müssen.\nUnd dann einen Anwalt zu ernennen, und dann muss man dem Richter bezahlen, und dann muss das Staatsanwaltschaftsamt die Anklage übernehmen und die Anklage eigentlich erheben. \nIch meine, all diese Dinge kosten viel Geld. \nUnd ähm … \nIch meine, also … \nWenn man sich Gemeinden ansieht, die finanziell in Schwierigkeiten sind, \nIch meine, viele von ihnen sind philosophisch einfach nicht bereit, diese Art von Kompromiss einzugehen. \nAuch wenn es ihnen viel Geld frei machen würde. \nViele Gemeinden sind zu Recht gegen Marihuana und wollen das nicht tun.\nAber an einem Ort wie Denver, wo die Leute tendenziell eher auf der Art von … ich muss das Wort \"liberal\" benutzen. \nAber Sie wissen, was ich meine. \nSo eine Art …\nSo eine Art Denkansatz.\nDann denke ich, es ist völlig in Ordnung. \nUnd ich bin sicher, dass ihre Gemeinde jetzt viel mehr Geld hat, das sie für die öffentliche Bildung ausgeben können. \nDas sie für soziale Programme für ältere Menschen ausgeben können und das sie für … \nNahrungsmittelprogramme für Obdachlose ausgeben können. \nUm … \nIch meine, also … \nIch denke, es ist wichtig, weil Marihuana nicht etwas ist, das man einfach überall auf der Straße haben möchte. \nUm … \nIch meine, aus verschiedenen Gründen. \nAber es gibt auch ein ganz finanzielles Element dahinter. \nAndere Gründe, warum es vielleicht nicht unbedingt … \nNa ja, ich … \nIch weiß nicht, wie ich mich dabei fühlen würde … \nNa ja, weil wenn es ganz legalisiert wäre, könnte man es ja wie Zigaretten machen, und es könnte in Tankstellen verkauft werden, und die Leute würden überall rauchen. \nDann würde ich sagen, viele Leute würden Rauchen und fahren. \nUnd ähm …\nEs ist immer noch so etwas wie ein Tabu in unserer Gesellschaft. \nAn vielen Orten und in vielen Kontexten. \nÄhm … \nMarihuana zu rauchen. \nAlso,\nEs so offen publik zu haben … \nIch denke, es wäre für viele Leute einfach unangenehm. \nUm … \nUnd … \nEntschuldigung, was? \nDas Mikrofonvolumen ist etwas leise. \nUm … \nIch weiß nicht wirklich … \nIch denke, im Allgemeinen hat Alkohol stärkere Auswirkungen auf Ihre motorischen Fähigkeiten. \nUm … \nAber ich denke, im Allgemeinen hat Marihuana für viele Menschen eher negative Auswirkungen auf ihren Lebensstil. \nAnstatt nur auf ihre Entscheidungsfindung und ihre motorischen Fähigkeiten. \nIch meine … \nAber sie … \nSie haben beide ihre negativen Auswirkungen. \nUnd ich meine … \nIch habe das Gefühl, wenn es um Substanzen im Allgemeinen geht, \nWie keine zwei Menschen wirklich gleich reagieren. \nIch meine, und dann … \nManche Menschen haben Persönlichkeiten, die einfach normaler sind, und sie gehen einfach alles mit vollem Elan an. \nUnd dann wissen manche Menschen, wie man Mäßigung übt, und manche wissen es nicht. \nAlso, ich denke, das macht es wirklich schwer, über die Substanz zu generalisieren, \nWenn Menschen unterschiedlich reagieren. \nAber ich denke definitiv, dass beide ihre eigenen negativen Auswirkungen haben. \nUm ja … \nÄhm … \nNein, ich nicht.\n\n\n\n## English Translation:\n\n[REWRITE]Well, my understanding is that they didn't legalize it.

At least for a marijuana charge. One thing that a lot of kids worry about, a lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized.

I mean, and then people, some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have, and then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t. So it, I guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance when people react different ways, but I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects. Um yeah, uh, no, I don’t.",

Um, let's see. I figure Myspace is a public thing, and a bulletin board.

And, if you post that on the internet, you know, you have to realize that people will be seeing that, whether it be school officials or not. So, in my opinion, I feel as though the school officials seeing that, they had every right to see it because even if they weren't doing it underneath the school's name, they could have still accessed it through their homes. Um, but yeah, with something preventing a school shooting, you know, as long as it saves the lives of students, which is a responsibility of the school system, I think that's perfectly fine. Um, let me see here. Like, um, you know, if they go on the internet like on Myspace just to see if students are drinking, smoking, or doing stuff they're not supposed to be doing, they go on there just specifically to catch students and get them in trouble. And I feel as though that is an invasion of privacy. But, um, I feel as though as long as they save lives or make the school a better and safer place, I don't think that's an invasion at all. Should I elaborate more on that?\n\nYeah, um, alright. Well, um, hmm, it's a lot easier to express yourself a lot longer when you're writing, but alright, well, like what I was saying, it is a public thing, and with a student posting something on Myspace and not expecting to get in trouble, that's ridiculous. Um, everything, like, I'm worried to post stuff like even through emails. Um, like if I have something not good about somebody to say, I don't ever say that on an email because I'm afraid somebody somehow will pick that up, and you know, everything like everything nowadays comes back and, you know, bites you in the butt I guess you could say. Um, like, you know, if you do something while you're a college student, then you grow up to be some important guy, they will like find an email that you sent somehow, and like once it's on the internet, it's always on the internet, and, um, you know, if you do something like that there's no way of getting out of it; you will get in trouble. And I don't, it wasn't an invasion at all of privacy because, you know, like I said before, and well, that's basically all I've been saying was it's a public thing, and, um, I don't know, let's see here.\n\n Um, like I had said before, I don't feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students, but if they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place, then I feel as though that's perfectly fine for them, or um, other officials such as the police to go on, um, you know, when parents drop their students off at school, they feel as though they're dropping them off at a safe place. I've actually discussed that with a, um, a teacher of mine. I went to a public high school, and um, they say you know, we have to ensure stuff like this because like, we would do like lockdowns and stuff, and that's like in reference to the terrorist attacks. Uh, we had to be safe about that. We had like drill stuff, and even though that doesn't have anything to do with the well I mean it kind of does have something to do with the school shooting because um, that was in case people would come into the building I guess, um, so we, you know, we did practice that stuff um, in order to make the school a safer place, and that's just what the school officials were doing in this case; they were just making it a safer place, preventing anything bad from happening, like Columbine or something like that.

I was for going over there and causing as much havoc as they did here. I think because it was such an emotional event, we overlooked a lot of things and didn't really think about the long run. We kind of just went over there unprepared without a plan. And I really think that it backfired on us. Um, I don't know, I was for it, but now I'm very against it. I don't think it did anything. I think the people there, as long as they're fighting with each other, they can't be fighting with us too. Like, I don't think us being over there is going to do anything if they can't even get along with themselves. So, unfortunately, because of 9/11, I've almost just, I just don't care about what goes on over there with those people. I just don't care. I just think, I don't think they're human sometimes. I don't know, they fight with each other and they can't, they just can't do anything themselves. So I really don't care. Um, I don't know, we definitely went over there unprepared. We didn't know what we were going to face over there. Um, and it's also bad because war for them is very different than war for us. They're just like savage people when it comes to war, and I don't think they're looking to better their country. I just think they're looking to get us out of there. And I think that should be fine for us. I think we should just leave and that's really it. Um, we just, I think we were just more hyped up than anything. I don't think we were thinking rationally about what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle and, um, I just, we pretty much just went over there looking for revenge, I think, and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened. And um, also I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq. Um, but at the time I see where he was coming from. We really, I don't think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can't just do that and then us just say ok let's rebuild and that's it. So, um, I don't think we could have let it go. But I think we could have just had a better plan of what we were gonna do. I don't think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of, I guess, like creating order. And I don't know, I just think that they didn't, there was no like unity. They didn't know what they were going in there for. So I think that would have helped us out a lot more. But like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with. So that's what we created in turn in there. Um, and honestly, I don't, I don't think we're the ones to change those people. I honestly think they're always going to be like that. And um, I don't, I really don't have anything else to say.
