\nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did

I think gay marriage should be legalized because basically there's not a good reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but it's so different. There are so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same. It's just like two different sides of the same coin. Heads will never be tails, but it's like the same thing. And there are a bunch of civil rights that go along with it, like property taxes and the whole healthcare thing where your primary or your next of kin, I don't want to say next of kin because I'm not sure that that's what it is, but if you're in a gay couple then your partner can't be in the room with you if you're sick and can't visit because they're not technically family. And I think that's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. And a lot of scientific studies have been done because it's kind of a hot topic these days, and homosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success; they have the same factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do. It's just, it's a relationship, it's the same thing. And I think where a lot of people get hung up on is homosexuals aren't asking for the right to get married in a church; they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. And if there's not involvement with church and state then that shouldn't be an issue because I can't understand where people like Catholics can get hung up on oh well that's against our religion and that's morally wrong for us and we can't approve of that sort of thing, but in a legal sense, if you're allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage? It's like segregation: separate but unequal. Yeah, they are; they're the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that. And people worry about adoption issues and community issues like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community and especially about, um, children of gay couples and how they'll adjust to society and whether or not they'll be influenced by their parent's um, sexual orientation choices or not, but well again it's kind of new and stuff, but it's kind of hard to say, I'm not sure about the children aspect about adoption because I think the main drawback to that is um, how children get treated by their peers and by other adults in society like in New York City I know they um, they have special schools for children of gay parents because in public schools in New York City they get like beaten up, and stuff like that parents protest to get the child removed from their school and it's just a kid, I mean they're gonna have the same points of view and everything parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples and so they can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to; I mean it's just about personality choices. \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue making gay marriage legal in every state. I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But well I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion, well his um, his take on gay marriage actually um, I think it goes along with his take on abortion and stem cell research which um, I think most of the reasons I'm not sure about this because honestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot but the most of the reasons I've heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons and morality I don't want to say it's negotiable but it definitely differs from person to person and to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and um, morality concepts of all the rest is unethical to just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account to go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy considering I mean about um, under god in the pledge of allegiance and how people are so opposed to that but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country um, just one lots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged and the gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents or just a personality defect and that is also not a good reason because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is and if people listened to um, institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently.\n\n\n\n[/REWRITE]",

    "raw_output": "(lacht) \nUm \nZu Beginn war ich mit der Prämisse einverstanden, aber ich glaube, dass alle noch immer sehr unter den Anschlägen vom 11. September litten, und ich denke, dass wir in den Irak als Vorwand eingetreten sind, es gab Vorwände, die uns in den Irak führten. \nIch denke, dass die Bush-Regierung die Irakkrieg frühzeitig mit Osama bin Laden und den Anschlägen vom 11. September in Verbindung brachte und behauptete, Saddam Hussein habe Massenvernichtungswaffen, was sich alles als falsch erwiesen hat. \nUnd das hat mich sehr gestört, und im Allgemeinen kochen mir der Irak-Krieg nur noch das Blut. \n\nUm \nEs scheint mir nur, als hätte die Bush-Regierung das amerikanische Volk argwöhnisch belogen und ist noch immer nicht zu dieser Tatsache gestanden. \nSelbst Colin Powell \nIch meine, nachdem er diese große Präsentation vor den Vereinten Nationen abgegeben hat, sagt er jetzt, dass er zu dem Zeitpunkt nicht wirklich von den Beweisen überzeugt war, selbst als er sie präsentierte. \nUnd \nFür mich ist das gerade Amtsmissbrauch. Ich denke, es ist ein Vergehen, dem amerikanischen Volk so zu lügen.\nIch denke, dass die Bush-Regierung völligen Missachtung für die Verfassung hat und versucht, sie seit September 11. zumindest seitdem zu marginalisieren. \nNun, \nIch denke, dass sie \nUm \nSie sind mit der Absicht in die Amtszeit eingetreten, Krieg zu führen. \n\nUm \nDas letzte Teil \n\nIch vergesse den Namen des \nUm \nFinanzministers, der diese Behauptung in seinem Buch erhoben hat, nachdem er wahrscheinlich aus seinem Amt gedrängt wurde \nUm \nAber es scheint so, als hätte der jüngere Bush eine Art Blutrache gegen Saddam Hussein wegen der Regierung seines Vaters empfunden und ich denke, dass er langfristig auch unsere Energieversorgung ausweiten wollte. \nWas auch eine sehr hinterhältige Art ist, Dinge zu tun \n\nNun \nIch denke, es ist lange genug gegangen. \nIch glaube, es gäbe Probleme, wenn wir jetzt zurückziehen würden, denn es besteht eine gute Chance, dass das Land in einen Bürgerkrieg versinkt und noch mehr Menschen sterben würden. \nUm \nIch denke, die Alternative, die die Vereinten Nationen und die Vereinigten Staaten zu diesem Zeitpunkt anstreben, scheint ähnlich zu sein wie \nEine Koalition von Nationen aus der Umgebung, wie Syrien und Saudi-Arabien, die eintreten und versuchen, die Ordnung wiederherzustellen. \nAber ich weiß nicht unbedingt, ob das auch eine gute Idee ist, denn ich denke, dass das langfristig auch zu mehr Problemen führen wird, weil \nUm \nDie Souveränität des Irak ein großes Thema sein wird \nDenn es ist ziemlich klar, dass die Übergangsregierung zu diesem Zeitpunkt sich auflöst. \n\nNur aus den Nachrichtenberichten, die ich gehört habe, scheint es nicht so, als wäre das Parlament sehr effektiv. \nDas um \nAch, ich kann seinen Namen nicht erinnern, aber der Premierminister hat überhaupt keine Kontrolle über den politischen Prozess oder was passiert und selbst Mugtada al-Sadr, den Kerl, gegen den wir vor weniger als einem Jahr gekämpft haben \nSein Parteihält jetzt mindestens 20 Sitze im irakischen Parlament und ich meine, wir haben immer noch mit zersplitterten radikalen Elementen zu tun, die um die Kontrolle der Regierung ringen. \nUnd ich denke, dass der politische Prozess aufgrund dessen viel Reibung aufweist. \n\nUm \n(lacht) \nKeine, die ich in Gesellschaft artikulieren kann\n\n\n\n[REWRITE]\n(laughs)\nInitially I was okay with the premise, but I think that everyone was still reeling from the September 11th attacks, and I think we kind of went into Iraq as a pretext - there were pretexts that led us into Iraq. I think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama bin Laden and the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which has since proven false.\nAnd that's very much rubbed me the wrong way, and in general the Iraq war just boils my blood.\n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact.\nEven Colin Powell.\nI mean, coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it.\nAnd\nTo me that's just malfeasance in office. I think that's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that.\nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since, well, since September 11th at least. I mean,\nI think that they\nUm\nThey came into office with the intent to go to war.\n\nUm \nThat last part\n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office.\nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration, and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too, which is also a very underhanded way to do things.\n\nWell\nI do think it's gone on long enough. I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though because there's a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result.\nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like\nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order.\nBut I don't necessarily know that that's a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because\nUm\nIraq's sovereignty will come to be an issue.\nA major issue there because I think it's pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point.\n\nJust from the news reports I've heard it doesn't seem that the Parliament is very effective at all.\nThat um \nOh I can't remember his name, but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what's happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting\nI guess it was less than a year ago.\nHis party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we're still dealing with fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government.\nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that.\n\nUm \n(laughs)\nNone that I can articulate in polite company\n\n\n\n[/REWRITE]\n",

September ausgeführt? \nAlso ich habe das Gefühl, dass \nIch meine, ich bin kein großer Fan des Krieges im Irak \nAlso halte ich mich nicht damit auf dem Laufenden \nIch kenne die großen Details nicht \nAber zu diesem Zeitpunkt weiß ich, dass wir irgendwie einfach dort bleiben, um eine Demokratie aufzubauen, damit es wie eine weitere Sache der USA wird \nUnd dann auch, damit wir Öl und andere Dinge von ihnen bekommen können \nAber es ist kein Grund, dort zu bleiben, weil es alle aufbringt \nAlso \nUnd wenn wir dort bleiben, dann wird wahrscheinlich passieren, dass wir versuchen müssen, eine

\nKrieg im Irak \nOh, das ist schwer \nUh \nMmm \nUhh, ich weiß es nicht \nHast du noch etwas, worüber ich sprechen kann? \nOk \nDanke \nUm \nNun, äh \nEigentlich glaube ich, dass \nIch glaube, der Krieg sollte weitergehen, weil es unfair ist \nIch glaube nicht, dass wir es noch einen Krieg nennen sollten \nAber weil ich glaube, dass \nDu weißt \nIch glaube, der einzige Grund, warum wir Waffen verwenden müssen, ist, um zu zeigen, dass \nDu weißt \nDass wir groß sind und Amerikaner sind und so weiter und dass wir all diese großen Waffen haben \nAber ich habe das Gefühl, dass es keinen großen Grund gibt, warum wir es noch einen Krieg nennen sollten \nWeil wir es nicht einmal genannt haben \nEs sollte von Anfang an nicht einmal als Krieg bezeichnet worden sein \nWeil es nie von Kongress erklärt wurde \nIch glaube, das ist, wie das Ganze funktioniert \nDu musst einen Krieg vom Kongress erklären lassen \nUnd dann ist \nIch glaube einfach nicht, dass es ein großer Punkt ist, dort zu bleiben und zu versuchen \nEigentlich nein \nIch glaube schon, dass es ein Punkt ist, dort zu bleiben und zu versuchen, ihnen zu helfen \nAber es ist auch so, als würden wir unsere Ressourcen verschwenden \nUnd besonders jetzt fühle ich mich so schlecht für Bush, weil es so ist \nEs lässt ihn wie einen der schlechtesten Präsidenten der USA aussehen \nAufgrund dessen, was es tut und es ist so \nUnd was es mit \nDenke dran \nIch denke, mit dem ganzen Vietnam-Ding \nDer Vietnamkrieg war ein nicht erklärter Krieg und er wird jetzt als sinnloser Krieg bezeichnet \nUnd er sagt \nEr wird für

könnte auch sagen, dass es \nEs ist schwer zu sagen, dass ich den Krieg beenden möchte, weil es so viele Familien gibt, von denen ich weiß, dass sie \nDeren Söhne und Töchter im Irak sind und es ist so, dass ich es weiterlaufen lassen möchte, weil \nDiese Leute dort haben auch ein Leben und wir haben sie irgendwie zerstört, weil wir jetzt genommen haben \nIch wette, einige der Kinder haben nicht

of pointless because I mean it's not even a declared war actually\nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that's who we figured bombed the U.S.\nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven\nSo I don't feel like\nI mean I'm not a big person on the War on Iraq\nSo I don't like keep up with it\nI don't know the big details of it\nBut at this point I know that we're kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing\nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them\nBut it's no reason for staying over there because it's making everyone upset\nSo\nAnd then like if we stay over there then what's gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can't be built in just a day\nAnd then if we like leave they'll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves\nUm\nLet me see\nOhh this is so hard\nThis is the one topic I don't know anything about\nUm\nWar in Iraq\nOh this hard\nUh\nMmm\nUhh I don't know\nDo you have anything else I can go off of?\nOk\nThank you\nUm\nWell um\nActually I think\nI think the war should continue because it's not fair\nI don't think we should call it a war anymore\nBut because I don't think that\nYou know\nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that\nYou know\nThat we're big and we're American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns\nBut I don't feel like there's a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore\nBecause like we didn't even call it\nIt shouldn't have even been called a war in the first place\nBecause it never was declared a war by congress\nI think that's how the whole thing works\nYou have to declare a war by congress\nAnd then it's\nI just don't think that it's a real big point to still stay over there and try\nActually no\nI do think it's a point to stay over there and try to like help them\nBut it's also like wasting our resources\nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it's like\nIt's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now\nBecause of like what it's doing and it's like\nAnd what it's doing to like\nCause remember\nI think with the whole Vietnam thing\nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it's now called like a meaningless war\nAnd he's like saying\nHe'll be called like that president forever\nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff\nSo\nHuh\nYou have to make this a half an hour don't you?\nUh\nOk yeah\nUm\nHuh\nI guess you could also say that it is\nLike it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there's so many families that I know of that are in\nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it's like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like\nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took\nI bet some of the kids don't even have a place to go to school\nAnymore because it's so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other\nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have\nBut then again\nIt's like\nIt's hard to say\nI want them in there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States\nThat it's going to be even worse for them\nAnd it's going to be\nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we're now trying to change them\nAnd they've been going on this whole like\nUm\nTotalitarian\nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that\nYou know\nI feel like it's gonna\nThat it's kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there\nSo I think this whole thing

Ich denke, es liegt wirklich an den Kirchen, denn in der Verfassung steht sogar die Trennung von Kirche und Staat.\n\nEs ist klar, klar ausgedrückt und ich fühle, dass es, wenn man versucht, etwas damit zu tun, jegliche Art von Macht auszuüben, wirklich gegen das sein würde, was bereits in der Verfassung gesagt und festgehalten wurde. Also, was die Leute angeht, die versuchen, es zu verbieten, denke ich, dass sie die Überzeugung einer Kirche gegenüber einer anderen bevorzugen, denn wie wir sehen können, sind die meisten Katholiken und Christen dagegen und unterstützen es nicht, außer in Boston und einigen anderen Gebieten. Aber ich denke nicht, dass es Sache der Regierung ist, zu entscheiden, was die Kirchen dürfen und was ihnen nicht erlaubt ist.\n\nNun, die Trennung von Kirche und Staat ist in der Verfassung quasi ein Schlüsselfaktor und ermöglicht in den Vereinigten Staaten religiöse Toleranz. Und obwohl sie vorhatten, eine Änderung vorzunehmen, denke ich, dass selbst die Einführung einer Änderung darüber völlig falsch wäre und im Widerspruch zu dem steht, was bereits gesagt und geschrieben wurde. Außerdem denke ich auch, dass es eine der wenigen Änderungen wäre, die tatsächlich verwendet werden, um die Menschen einzuschränken, anstatt die Regierung einzuschränken. Daher glaube ich nicht, dass es richtig ist.\n\nNein, ich glaube nicht, dass die Bundesregierung oder irgendeine andere Regierung in dieses Thema eingreifen sollte. Ich verstehe nicht, warum er für diese Änderung drängt, außer dass es seinen eigenen persönlichen Überzeugungen als Katholik widerspricht. Und wie gesagt, sein Drang nach dieser Änderung zeigt einfach, dass er eine bestimmte Religion gegenüber allen anderen Religionen bevorzugt. Ich fühle mich also wirklich, dass es an den Kirchen liegt, diese Entscheidung zu treffen, nicht an den Präsidenten oder an irgendjemanden in der Regierung. Und es gibt wirklich keinen Grund dafür, warum es eine Änderung zur Verhinderung geben sollte, außer aus persönlichen Ansichten.\n\nDenn ich sehe nicht, wie es die Wirtschaft oder etwas anderes beeinflussen wird. Vielleicht könnte es sogar ein Aufschwung sein, denke ich, ich weiß nicht genau wie, aber ich denke, es könnte einen besseren Einfluss auf die Gesellschaft haben als es ohne es nicht würde.\n\n\n\n[REWRITE]\nI agree with you. I don't think it's right to make it legal or for a state to allow it to be legal. I think it really lies with the churches, because the constitution even says separation of church and state. \n\nIt's clear, clearly stated, and I feel that if we try to do anything with it, exert any kind of power over it, it would really be in defiance of what has already been said and written in stone in the constitution.  So, as for the people trying to make it illegal, I think that's really choosing one church's belief over another because, as we can see, most Catholics and Christians are really against it and don't support it, except for up in Boston and some of those areas. But I don't think it's really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal and legal.\n\nWell, separation of church and state is pretty much, uh, like a key aspect of the constitution and what's really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States. And even though they planned on making an amendment, I think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong and just contradictory to what's already been said and written there. Plus, I also think that it would be one of the only amendments that's actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government. So I don't feel that's right at all in that aspect.\n\nNo, I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue. I don't see why he's pushing for this amendment except that it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic and, as I said before, his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion. So I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this, not for the president or anybody in government in particular, and there isn't really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it. Because I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or anything else.

sind gestorben\n\nUnd das ist schrecklich und\nWas sie taten, was sie taten, war, dass sie die Regierung des Landes beseitigten und ich glaube wirklich nicht, dass die Regierung\nDie amerikanische

viele Vietnamesen den USA den Einmarsch wünschten, es wird eine große Anzahl von Aufständischen geben, und es ist schwierig, sie niederzuschlagen, wenn man\nWenn man nicht gegen\nEin tatsächliches

nicht so vorbereitet, wie sie hätte sein sollen\nIch meine am schlimmsten\nUnd\nEntweder für das, was\nWirklich nicht planen, was passieren würde, sobald sie die irakische Regierung entfernt hätten und\nIch meine, wir sind immer noch dort im Spätsommer 2006 und wir sind immer noch\nUm\nViele amerikanische Truppen sterben noch immer und\nUnd sie versuchen immer noch, die irakischen Truppen und die irakischen\nUnd die irakischen Polizeien zu trainieren, in der Lage zu sein, ihr eigenes Land zu polizeilieren, und es ist ein langer Prozess, und ich denke nur, dass\nDass die US-Regierung auf eine Weise versuchte\nNun, sie waren nicht selbst vorbereitet, aber auf eine Weise versuchte, das amerikanische Volk zu täuschen, indem sie ihnen das Gefühl gaben, es wäre ein\nEin\nEin kurzer

bei der Wahl\nWie bei der Präsidentschaftswahl 2004, wenn ich darüber nachdachte, für wen ich stimmen würde, wenn ich wählen könnte, und einer von\nUm\nEinem meiner Gründe, warum ich wahrscheinlich für George Bush gestimmt hätte, war, ihm zu erlauben, das zu beenden, was er angefangen hatte und\nUnd also meine ich einmal\nEs ist wirklich schwer, weil, sobald man dort ist und wir so lange dort sind, wie können wir diese Menschen verlassen\nIch meine, wir sind diejenigen, die ihnen ihre Regierung und\nUnd\nUnd ihren Lebensunterhalt genommen haben, wie können wir sie jetzt verlassen\nSie verlassen jetzt so\nDaher ist es wahrscheinlich etwas, das wir\n(Husten)\nEntschuldigung\nVersuchen sollten, zu beenden, aber gleichzeitig gibt es auch die Erwägung der astronomischen Anzahl

Right now that money's being spent to have some of our own citizens killed in a foreign country at a war that we've lost the cause for. I think that's it.",

Um, it was prevented because someone went online and found that there was like... O okay. Um, no, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. On sites like Myspace, if... I mean if you post information on the internet it's... It's pretty much available for everyone to see. And I understand on Myspace, you know, you have to have someone else be a member to see someone's profile. You might need to... You know, be their friend or something like that. But if that's the case, you've accepted that person as your \"friend\" so they can see it. You're giving them permission to see your profile. So... I mean, whenever you put information on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that. So if I think that was actually good that somebody saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost... Hum, um, that's tough because I mean obviously you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody's different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that. But then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, O let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything. Um, I mean I don't think it would really be right to go and have somebody's job be to look at people's profiles. But I guess it all depends on like what situation they came across that profile or was someone just randomly looking at people's and just randomly happened to see that or were they actually looking for... You know some sort of evidence that the student was planning something. So I don't really know. Sure, um, well, um like, I mean I I don't have a Myspace personally but I have a Facebook. I do. It bothers me that I know that there's creepy people out there who can see things about me. And I saw something on TV once that was about this um, this man who just... he was just trying to prove how he can get information so easily. And he went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in like you know less than a minute and got her to meet with him. And I mean personally I certainly wouldn't meet with someone like that. But I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names but they IM me and they know that it's me and it's hard because you think that they know your interests they know what you look like sometimes if you put your class schedule they know where you are during the day who your friends are they pretty much know a lot about you. All sorts of photos and I tried to limit what I put up there but at the same time the whole point I think the reason I have one is so you know I can communicate with some of my friends. I don't want to limit it too much so it's a tricky issue because I only accept people I know. I mean you never know really who can look at what so. Hum, uh, well, I heard my roommate was telling me that her um high school she there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school and that struck me as a little bit strange like I wasn't sure how how high school officials had the power to tell their students that they weren't allowed to have a Myspace and I don't know if that's really a privacy issue but I think I don't really know how they had the right to tell people that.

    "raw_output": "## German Translation:\n\nJa, ich glaube, dass Geschlechterdiskriminierung in den Vereinigten Staaten immer noch ein Problem ist.\nUnd nicht nur bei Frauen, ich denke, es hat auch mit dem jeweiligen Arbeitsbereich zu tun, mit dem man zu tun hat.\nIch meine, insgesamt glaube ich, dass es Frauen schwerer haben, weil es die gläserne Decke gibt, und obwohl es angeblich Gleichheit gibt, haben die meisten Schwierigkeiten, unter einer Frau arbeiten zu müssen, wenn sie Männer sind, nur weil die Gesellschaft so lange geprägt ist.\nUnd oft sehen Frauen am Arbeitsplatz einen Job, den sie erreichen können, und sie haben alle Qualifikationen dafür.\nAber vielleicht wird der Aufsichtsrat sie nicht auf diese Position befördern, nur weil historisch gesehen nicht erwartet wird, dass Frauen in den obersten Ebenen der Geschäftswelt sind.\nUnd ähm, ich denke das gleiche gilt auch für Männer.\nUnd in anderen Branchen wie Mode oder...\nähm\nAls Elternteil zu Hause zu sein ist sehr ungewöhnlich.\nEs ist ähm\nnicht üblich, dass ein männliches Elternteil zu Hause bleibt.\nUnd ähm, oft schauen die Leute herab, weil die Gesellschaft denkt: Oh, du bist der Mann, du solltest arbeiten gehen.\nDu solltest der Geldverdiener deiner Familie sein.\nWarum bleibst du zu Hause?\nUnd es kann wirklich schwer für sie sein, weil es vielleicht immer ihr Traum war, mit den Kindern zu sein und die Kinder aufzuziehen, und vielleicht hat die Frau den besseren Job.\nUnd es funktioniert für sie gut.\nAber die Gesellschaft sieht das abwertend.\nUnd dann in der Modebranche...\nähm\nDie Leute nehmen Männer nicht wirklich ernst, wenn sie hetero sind.\nIch weiß nicht, ob das wirklich Sinn macht.\nAber ich denke, es liegt daran, dass Männer, die sich für Mode interessieren...\nähm\nIch denke, haben unterschiedliche Lebensstile.\nUnd wenn du den typischen Lebensstil hast und du bist ein Mann und du bist in der Modebranche, dann denken die Leute: \"Na ja, wie kann ich wirklich wissen, ob du weißt, was Mode ist, für eine Frau?\"\n\"Du weißt nicht wirklich, was unsere Situation ist, wie diese anderen Typen.\"\nUnd also,\nje nachdem, in welchem ​​Arbeitsbereich du bist,\nIch denke, es gibt definitiv Geschlechterdiskriminierung in der Gesellschaft in den USA.\nUm sie zu ändern, ist es schwieriger, weil die Gesellschaft eine feste Denkweise hat und wir natürlich einen langen Weg von den 1800er Jahren zurückgelegt haben und große Fortschritte gemacht haben.\nAber der Wandel ist wirklich langsam, also glaube ich, dass, wenn wir mit dem Tempo weiterarbeiten, mit dem wir es jetzt tun, weil Frauen in höhere Positionen aufsteigen und CEO werden und in der Geschäftswelt mehr akzeptiert werden, ist es ein langsamer Prozess.\nAber es passiert, und die Menschen beginnen, es mehr zu akzeptieren.\nUnd genauso wie Männer, die Hausväter sind,\nwird es mehr akzeptiert, weil sie erkennen: \"Oh, vielleicht hat die Frau wirklich den besseren Job oder sie möchte diejenige sein, die arbeitet.\"\nUnd ähm\nDann für Mode-Menschen werden sie denken: \"Oh, vielleicht hören sie auf ihre Freundinnen oder ihre Frauen und so weiter.\"\nUnd so wissen sie, wo ich herkomme.\nAlso muss man es irgendwie fördern, indem man die guten Eigenschaften der Menschen hervorhebt, die normalerweise durch Stereotype diskriminiert werden, ohne zu aufdringlich zu sein.\nAber ähm, sagen Sie die Eigenschaften von ihnen,\nweil wenn Sie es erzwingen, werden die Leute widerstehen.\nUnd ich fühle, dass wir uns in einem guten Gleichgewicht befinden, wo es langsam wie durchgesetzt wird.\nAlso weiß ich nicht wirklich, ob es etwas gibt, das wir jetzt tun können, das nicht bereits getan wird, denn wenn man es zu schnell macht, werden die Leute widerstehen.\nWir sind einen langen Weg gekommen und Wandel braucht Zeit.\nJa\nähm\nNun, ich denke, sie werden wahrscheinlich auch gegenseitig diskriminiert, je nach dem Typ von Arbeit, den du hast, oder wo du herkommst.\nZum Beispiel, wenn du auf einem Bauernhof aufgewachsen bist und deine Grammatik vielleicht nicht die beste ist, aber du bist extrem intelligent und arbeitest dich hinauf zu einem CEO-Job.\nAuch wenn deine Grammatik nicht die beste ist, oder auch wenn du intelligent bist, aber deine Grammatik nicht die beste ist,\nDie anderen Männer könnten dich herunterblicken und sagen: \"Wie soll ich wissen, dass du wirklich das bist, was du sagst, wenn du nicht einmal Verben und Nomen richtig zusammensetzen kannst?\"\nAlso\nJa\nAlso manchmal kann der Ort, an dem du herkommst, dich diskriminieren.\nUnd von Geschlecht zu Geschlecht\nUnd ich weiß nicht\nIch denke, das wäre ein weiteres Beispiel.\nähm\nNicht wirklich.\n\n\n\n## English Translation:\n\n[REWRITE]Yes, I think that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States.\nAnd not only with women, I think it also has to do with the particular field of work that you're dealing with.\nI mean, overall, I think women have it harder because there's the glass ceiling, and even though there's supposed to be equality, most people have a hard time finding that they could have to work under a woman if they're a man, just because of how society has been raised for so long.\nAnd often women will see at the workplace a job that they can reach, and they have all the qualifications for it.\nBut maybe the board won't elect to promote them to that position just because historically it's not seen that women are usually in the upper hands of the business world.\nAnd um, I guess the same thing goes for men.\nAnd in other industries like fashion or\nUm\nBeing a parent at home is really uncommon.\nIt's ähm\nNot typical to have a male parent staying at home.\nAnd um\nOften people look down upon that because society thinks, oh well, you're the male, you should be out working.\nYou should be the money maker of your family.\nWhy are you staying at home?\nAnd it can be really hard on them because perhaps it's always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job.\nAnd like it's working out fine for them.\nBut society looks down upon that.\nAnd then in the fashion industry\nUm\nPeople won't really take males seriously if they're straight.\nI don't know if that really makes sense.\nBut I guess it's because typically males who are into fashion\nUm\nLike, I guess have different styles of life.\nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you're a male and you're in the fashion industry, people will be like, \"Well, wait, how do I really know if you know what fashion is for a woman?\nLike, you don't really don't know what our case is like.\nLike, these other guys.\"\nSo\nDepending on, like, what field of work you're in,\nI feel like there definitely is gender discrimination in society in the U.S.\nTo change it is kind of more difficult because the society like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds.\nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO's and they're getting more accepted in the business world and it's a slow process.\nBut it's happening and people are starting to accept it more.\nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads,\nIt's becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works.\nAnd um\nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they're listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff.\nAnd so they do know like where I'm coming from.\nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotyped against by not being too pushy.\nBut um saying like the qualities of them.\nBecause if you force it people are going to resist.\nAnd I feel that we're kind of at a good balance where it's starting to become enforced like that.\nSo I don't really know if there's anything that we can do right now that isn't already being done because if you do it too fast it's like people will resist.\nAnd we've come a long ways and change takes time.\nYes\nUm\nWell I guess they're probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you're from.\nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn't the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you work your way up into a CEO job.\nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and\nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don't have the best grammar in the world\nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you're really what you're saying if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right.\nSo\nYeah\nSo like sometimes just where you're from can discriminate against you.\nAnd like from gender to gender.\nAnd I don't know\nI guess that'd be another example.\nUm\nNot really.

Um, I don’t really know, um, I think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills, um, but I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle as opposed to just their decision making motor skills. I mean, but they, they both have their adverse effects and I mean they, I feel like when it comes to substances in general, like no two people really react the same way. I mean and then people, some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have and then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t. So it, I guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance when people react different ways, but I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects, um yeah, uh, no I don’t.",

Also, ich weiß nicht, ich denke, dass alle gleichberechtigten Lebensgemeinschaften, ich weiß nicht, ob die Ehe betrachtet werden sollte und von der Regierung definiert werden sollte, da sie wie ein Sakrament betrachtet wird. Nun, die Leute würden keine Steuererleichterungen erhalten oder auf irgendeine bestimmte Weise von der Regierung betrachtet werden, wenn sie getauft worden wären, und wenn Sie verheiratet sind, denke ich, dass sie es einfach als eine gleichberechtigte Lebensgemeinschaft betrachten sollten, weil das ist, was es ist, zwei Menschen. Sie sollten keine Trennung von Kirche und Staat haben, sie sollten nicht nach dem Typ der Ehe fragen. Zwei Menschen wurden vereint. Und die Tatsache, dass es eine Homo-Ehe gibt, meine ich, das würde nur zwei Menschen, die eine gleichberechtigte Lebensgemeinschaft haben.\n\nUm, nun, wenn alle Bundesstaaten zu einem logischen Schluss kommen können, sollten sie versuchen, es zu Bundesgesetz zu machen. Aber ein Verfassungszusatz zum Verbot der Homo-Ehe ist einfach lächerlich. Es ist etwas, das die Verfassung nicht einfach für etwas ändern sollte.

sehen\nWeil\nAuch wenn sie es nicht unter dem Namen der Schule getan hätten\nSie hätten es trotzdem noch über ihre Häuser erreichen können\nÄh\nAber äh\nJa, aber mit etwas, das eine Amokläuf  verhindern kann\nDu weißt \nSolange es das Leben von\nÄh\nSchülern rettet\nWas eine Verantwortung des Schulsystems ist\nIch denke, dass\nÄh\nDas völlig in Ordnung ist\nUm\nLass mich mal sehen hier\nWie\nUm\nDu weißt\nWenn sie im Internet gehen, zum Beispiel auf Myspace, nur um zu sehen, ob\nDu weißt\nSchüler trinken oder rauchen oder Dinge tun, die sie nicht tun sollen\nSie gehen dort einfach nur hin, um Schüler zu fangen\nUnd\nUm\nSie in Schwierigkeiten zu bringen\nUnd\nIch denke, dass das eine Verletzung der Privatsphäre ist\nAber\nUm\nIch denke, dass\nDu weißt\nSolange sie retten\nDu weißt\nRetten Leben oder die Schule zu einem besseren und sichereren Ort machen\nIch denke nicht, dass das eine Verletzung ist überhaupt\nUm\nSoll ich das noch genauer erklären?\n\nJa um\nAlso \nGut\nUm\nHmm\nEs ist viel einfacher, \nÄh\nDich auszudrücken\nUm\nSchriftlich viel länger\nAber\n\nGut\nAlso\nUm\nWie ich schon sagte\nEs ist eine öffentliche Sache\nUm\nUnd wenn ein Schüler etwas auf Myspace postet\nUnd\nNicht damit rechnen, in Schwierigkeiten zu geraten\nDas ist lächerlich\nUm\nAlles\nWie ich\nÄh\nIch mache mir Sorgen, Dinge zu posten, sogar per E-Mail\nUm\nWenn ich etwas Schlechtes über jemanden zu sagen habe, sage ich das niemals per E-Mail\nWeil\nIch habe Angst, dass irgendjemand das irgendwie abfangen wird\nUnd\nDu weißt\nAlles,\nAlles heutzutage kommt zurück\nUnd\nDu weißt\nBeißt dich in den Hintern, sagen wir mal so\n\nUm\nWie\nDu weißt\nWenn du etwas tust, während du ein College-Student bist, dann wirst du ein wichtiger Mann und sie werden irgendwo eine E-Mail von dir finden\nUnd\nWie\nSobald etwas im Internet ist, ist es für immer im Internet\nUnd\nUm\nDu weißt\nWenn du so etwas tust, gibt es keinen Weg, daraus auszusteigen\nDu wirst in Schwierigkeiten geraten\nUnd\nIch \nEs war überhaupt keine Verletzung der Privatsphäre\nWeil\nDu weißt\nWie ich schon sagte\nUnd\nNun, das ist im Grunde alles, was ich gesagt habe: Es ist eine öffentliche Sache\nUnd\nUm\nIch weiß nicht\nLass mal sehen hier\n\nUm\nWie ich schon sagte, glaube ich nicht, dass sie nur im Internet gehen sollten, um Schüler zu fangen\nAber\nWenn sie etwas haben, das sie zu dem Punkt führt, an dem sie das Schulsystem sicherer machen würden\nUm\nDann denke ich, dass das völlig in Ordnung ist für sie\nOder\nUm\nAndere Beamte, wie die Polizei, um dorthin zu gehen\nUm\nDu weißt\nWenn Eltern ihre Schüler zur Schule bringen, fühlen sie sich so, als würden sie sie\nDu weißt\nSie an einen sicheren Ort bringen\nIch habe darüber mit einem\nUm\n einem\nÄh\neinem Lehrer von mir gesprochen\nIch ging eine öffentliche High School\nUnd\nUm\nSie sagen\nDu weißt\nWir müssen dafür sorgen, dass so etwas passiert\nWeil\nWie\nWir hätten wie Sperrungen\nUnd\nSachen\nUnd\nUm\nDas hat mit den Terroranschlägen zu tun\nÄh\nWir mussten uns darum kümmern\nWir hatten so Übungsstunden\nUnd\nAuch wenn das nichts mit dem zu tun hat\nNun, ich meine, es hat irgendwie etwas mit dem Amoklauf zu tun\nWeil\nUm\nDas war für den Fall, dass Leute in das Gebäude kommen würden\nUm\nAlso wir\nDu weißt\nWir haben das geübt\nUm\nDie Schule sicherer zu machen\nUnd\nDas ist genau das, was die Schulleiter in diesem Fall getan haben\nSie haben es nur sicherer gemacht\nUm\nVor allem schlechtem zu hindern zu passieren\nWie\nColumbine oder so etwas\nUm\nJa, das ist im Grunde alles, was ich dazu beitragen kann\n\nÄh nein, das war's\n\n[REWRITE] It's not at all\nLet me see, I \nSo as I see it, Myspace is a public thing\nAnd\nA bulletin board\nYou know \nIf you look at that definition\nUm\nThen you know\nThat's basically to post for the public to see\nOr for others to see\nUm\nWhatever you're trying to get at\nAnd\nNow if you post that on the internet\nUm\nYou know\nYou have to realize that people will be seeing that\nWhether it be school officials or not\nUm\nSo in my opinion I feel as though the school officials seeing that\nThey had every right to see it\nBecause\nEven if they weren't doing it under the school's name\nThey could have still accessed that\nUh\nThrough their homes\nUm\nBut uh\nYeah but with something preventing a school shooting\nYou know\nAs long as it saves the lives of\nUh\nStudents\nWhich is a responsibility of the school system\nI think that\nUh\nThat's perfectly fine\nUm\nLet me see here\nLike\nUm\nYou know\nIf they go on to the internet like on Myspace just to see if\nYou know\nStudents are drinking or smoking or doing stuff that they’re not supposed to be doing\nThey go on there just specifically to catch students\nAnd\nTo get them in trouble\nAnd\nI feel as though that is an invasion of privacy\nBut\nUm\nI feel as though\nYou know\nAs long as they save\nYou know\nSave lives or make the school a better and safer place\nI don't think that that's an invasion at all\nUm\nShould I elaborate more on that\n\nYeah um\nAlright\nWell\nUm\nHmm\nIt's a lot easier to\nUh\nExpress yourself\nUm\nA lot longer when you're writing\nBut\n\nAlright\nWell\nUm\nLike what I was saying\nIt is a public thing\nUm\nAnd with a student posting something on Myspace\nAnd\nNot expecting to get in trouble\nThat's ridiculous\nUm\nEverything\nLike I’m\nUh\nWorried to post stuff like even through emails\nUm\nLike if I have something not good about somebody to say I don't ever say that on an email\nBecause\nI’m afraid somebody somehow will pick that up\nAnd\nYou know\nEverything like\nEverything nowadays comes back\nAnd\nYou know\nBites you in the butt I guess you could say\n\nUm\nLike\nYou know\nIf you do something while you're a college student then you grow up to be some important guy they will like find an email that you sent somehow\nAnd\nLike\nOnce it's on the internet it's always on the internet\nAnd\nUm\nYou know\nIf you do something like that there's no way of getting out of it\nYou will get in trouble\nAnd\nI don't\nIt wasn't an invasion at all of privacy\nBecause\nYou know\nLike I said before\nAnd\nWell that's basically all I've been saying was it's a public thing\nAnd\nUm\nI don't know\nLet's see here\n\nUm\nLike I had said before I don't feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students\nBut\nIf they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place\nUm\nThen I feel as though that's perfectly fine for them\nOr\nUm\nOther officials such as the police to go on\nUm\nYou know\nWhen parents drop their students off at school they feel as though\nYou know\nThey’re dropping them off at a safe place\nI've actually discussed that with a\nUm\nA\nUh\nTeacher of mine\nI went to a public high school\nAnd\nUm\nThey say\nYou know\nWe have to ensure stuff like this\nBecause\nLike\nWe would do like lock downs\nAnd\nStuff\nAnd\nUm\nThat's like in reference to the terrorist attacks\nUh\nWe had to be safe about that\nWe had like drill stuff\nAnd\nEven though that doesn't have anything to do with the\nWell I mean it kind of does have something to do with the school shooting\nBecause\nUm\nThat was incase people would come into the building I guess\nUm\nSo we \nYou know\nWe did practice that stuff\nUm\nIn order to make the school a safer place\nAnd\nThat's just what the school officials were doing in this case\nThey were just making it a safer place\nThey were just making it a safer place\nUm\nPreventing anything bad from happening\nLike\nColumbine or something like that\nUm\nYeah that's basically all I can come up with\n\nUh no that's

there is going to do anything if they're \nIf they can't even get along with themselves \nSo um \nLike unfortunately because of 9/11 I've almost just \nI just don't care about what goes on over there \nUm \nWith those people \nI just don't care \nI just think \nI don't think that \nSometimes I don't think they're human \nI don't know \nLike they fight with each other and they can't \nThey just
