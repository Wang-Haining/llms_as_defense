Like in New York City I know they have special schools for children of gay parents because in public schools in New York City they get beaten up and stuff like that, parents protest to get the child removed from their school and it's just a kid, I mean they're gonna have the same points of view and everything, parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. And so they can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to, I mean it's just about personality choices. I think the federal government should be very involved in this issue making gay marriage legal in every state, I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But well I think President Bush has very strong views of his own having to do with his religion. His take on gay marriage actually goes along with his take on abortion and stem cell research which I think most of the reasons I've heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons and morality I don't want to say it's negotiable but it definitely differs from person to person and to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and morality concepts of all the rest is unethical to just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account to go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy considering I mean about under god in the pledge of allegiance and how people are so opposed to that but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country. Um, a lot of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged and the gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents or just a personality defect. And that is also not a good reason because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is and if people listened to institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently.

    "transformed": "I think that gay marriage should be legalized because there isn't a good reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but it's just different and there are so many different aspects that it could never be considered the same. It's just like two different sides of the same coin, heads will never be tails but it's like the same thing. There are a lot of civil rights that go along with it, like property taxes and the whole healthcare thing where your primary or your next of kin can't be in the room with you if you're sick and can't visit because they're not technically family. And I think that's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. A lot of scientific studies have been done because it's a hot topic these days and homosexual couples have the same kind of rates of success, they have the same factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do. It's just, it's a relationship, it's the same thing. I think where a lot of people get hung up on is homosexuals aren't asking for the right to get married in a church, they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. And if there's no involvement with church and state then that shouldn't be an issue. If you're allowing someone a civil union, why not a marriage? It's like segregation, separate but unequal. Yeah, they're the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that. People worry about adoption issues and community issues like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community. And especially about children of gay couples and how they'll adjust to society and whether or not they'll be influenced by their parent's sexual orientation choices or not.

Ich ging in eine private Schule. \nUnd ich sah meine Freunde dort am Wochenende. \nUnd wir gingen einfach dorthin. \nAber jetzt, als ich älter geworden bin, haben sie wie eine Jugendmesse gemacht. \nUnd sie haben sie auf 30 Minuten reduziert. \nUnd Menschen tragen viel lockerer. \nBesonders im Sommer kommen Leute in ihren Strandkleidern wie direkt vom Strand. \nMan hat die Familien dort, die einfach spät dran sind. \nAlso denke ich, es ist viel lockerer geworden. \nAuch bei den morgendlichen Messen, wo ich immer geschminkt war, tragen die Leute Jeans und Khakis. \nDas sind auch nicht schlecht. \nAber es ist einfach viel lockerer als früher. \nWas andere Dinge angeht, \nDas ist das größte, was ich bemerkt habe. \nDas ist die Kirche, die ich kenne. \nIch weiß nicht die Politik innerhalb der Kirche und was nicht. \nAber \nJa, das ist alles. \n[OK, im Hinblick auf alle Anschuldigungen gegen katholische Priester, die mit Pädophilie zu tun hatten, denken Sie, dass diese eventuell verhindert werden konnten, wenn die Kirche zum Beispiel Frauenpriester zuließ oder Priester heiraten lassen würde?] \nIch denke, diese Dinge konnten nicht vermieden werden. \nWeil \nEs gibt Männer, die verheiratet sind. \nUnd \nSie werden trotzdem Pädophile. \nUnd \nSie haben \nUh \nEine Anziehung zu jungen Kindern. \nAlso \nIch denke, selbst wenn man sie heiraten lässt, ist es einfach der Mensch, nicht weil man sie heiraten lässt oder nicht. \nIch denke auch, wenn sie Priester werden, ist das ihre Entscheidung. \nEs gibt Religionen, die es ihnen erlauben zu heiraten, wo sie könnten \nWie zum Beispiel die Seventh Heaven. \nIch weiß nicht, was für \nEr ist ein Pastor oder ein Minister oder so was. \n[Mm hmm]\nAber \nSie erlauben es ihnen zu heiraten. \nAlso \nIch weiß, es ist ein bisschen anders. \nWenn sie aber wirklich heiraten und ihre Religion ausüben möchten, sollten sie vielleicht über eine andere Religion nachdenken. \n[OK, können Sie das ein bisschen ausführlicher erklären?] \nUm \nAuf welchen Punkt \nÜber \n[Um]\nDie Veränderungen \n[Dass es wirklich keinen Unterschied machen würde, ich denke.] \nOh, auf die Pädophilie \n[Mm hmm]\nIch denke, \nWie die ganze \nUm \nSexualität ist vorher \nUm \nGenetik ist \nIch denke, es ist auf Genetik basiert. \nIch denke, es sind Menschen, die geboren werden, so. \nIch denke, es hat nichts mit der Erziehung zu tun. \nVielleicht hat es ein bisschen in diesem Fall zu tun \nAber \nIch denke, es ist ihre Genetik. \nUnd \nMan kann das nicht verstecken durch eine Ehe. \nMan kann es versuchen \nAber \nDann würde es normalerweise rauskommen. \nAlso \nIch denke, die Kirche konnte nichts tun, um das zu verhindern. \nUm \nWenn sie es wussten und versuchten, es zu verstecken, dann schämen sie sich. \nAber \nIch denke, sie wussten es nicht in allen Fällen. \n[OK, haben Sie noch andere Gedanken zum katholischen Kirche?] \nIch nein.\n\nTranslation of the German text back to English:\n\n[REWRITE] I think the church has already adapted to the 21st century. \nI'm not as strict as I used to be. \nI know, even as I've grown older, when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday. \nAnd I would get cute little dresses. \nAnd matching shoes. \nAnd a matching purse. \nThat was what I always did.

September hat sie versucht, sie zu marginalisieren \nIch meine, sie \nUm \nSie kamen in das Amt mit dem Vorsatz, zum Krieg zu gehen \n\nUmw \nDie letzten Teile\n\nIch vergesse den Namen des \nUm \nDes Finanzministers, der in seinem Buch diese Anschuldigung vorgebracht hat, nachdem er wahrscheinlich aus seinem Amt gedrängt wurde \nUm \nAber es scheint mir so, dass der jüngere Bush ein Blutgeldgierigem Gefühl gegen Saddam Hussein hatte, weil er die Vorgängerverwaltung seines Vaters ablehnte und ich denke, dass er im Laufe der Zeit hoffte, unsere Energieversorgung zu erweitern \nDas ist auch eine unterhändische Art, Vorgänge zu machen \n\nNun \nIch denke, dass es langsam genug ist \nIch denke, dass es Probleme geben würde, wenn wir jetzt abziehen würden, denn es gäbe eine gute Chance, dass das Land in einen Bürgerkrieg zurückfallen würde und noch mehr Menschen als bisher sterben würden als Folge \nUm \nIch denke, dass das alternative, das die UN und die Vereinigten Staaten an diesem Punkt verfolgen, sich in einer Art von Koalition aus Ländern der Umgebung wie Syrien und Saudi-Arabien anhört, die in die Irak einkehren und versuchen, die Ordnung wiederherzustellen \nAber ich weiß nicht, ob das eine gute Idee ist, denn ich denke, dass das im Laufe der Zeit auch zu mehr Problemen führen würde, weil \nUm \nDie Souveränität des Irak wird zu einem großen Problem werden, weil ich denke, dass die Interimsregierung zu diesem Punkt bereits auseinanderfällt \n\nIn den Nachrichten habe ich gehört, dass das Parlament überhaupt nicht effektiv ist \nDas \nOh, ich kann seinen Namen nicht mehr erinnern, aber der Ministerpräsident hat überhaupt keine Kontrolle über den politischen Prozess oder was sich in dem Land abspielt und selbst Muktada al-Sadr, den Mann, den wir einst bekämpften \nIch denke, das war weniger als ein Jahr her \nSeine Partei hält jetzt mindestens 20 Sitze im irakischen Parlament und ich meine, wir sind immer noch mit lauten radikalen Elementen beschäftigt, die um die Regentschaft kämpfen \nUnd ich denke, dass der politische Prozess viel Friction erleidet, da \n\nUmw \n(lacht) \nNichts, das ich in zivilisierter Gesellschaft ausdrücken kann\n\nEnglish translation:\n[REWRITE]\n(laughs) Initially I was okay with the premise, but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went into Iraq as a pretext; there were pretexts that led us into Iraq. I think that the Bush administration early on connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which has since been proven false. And that really rubbed me the wrong way and in general, the Iraq war just boils my blood. \n\nUm... It just seems to me that the Bush administration was very openly lying to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact. Even Colin Powell, I mean, coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN, now says that he wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it. And that, to me, is a form of malfeasance in office, I think that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. I think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the Constitution, and has been trying to marginalize it since September 11th at least, I mean. I think that they... Um... They came into office with the intent to go to war. \n\nUm... That last part... I forget the name of the... Um... Secretary of the Treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office... Um... But it seems to me that the younger Bush had a blood vendetta kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration, and I think that in the long term, he was hoping to expand our energy supply too, which is also a very underhanded way to do things. \n\nWell, I do think it’s gone on long enough. I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now, though, because there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war, and even more people would die as a result. Um... I think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like a coalition of nations from the surrounding area, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, coming in to try to restore order. But I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either, because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because... Um... Iraq’s sovereignty will become an issue, a major issue, there, because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point. \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard, it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all. Um... Oh, I can’t remember his name, but the Prime Minister really has no control over the political process or what’s happening in the country, and even Muktada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting, I guess it was less than a year ago, his party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament, and I mean we’re still dealing with lots of radical elements that are vying for control of the government, and I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that.\n\nUm... (laughs) Not that I can articulate in polite company. [/REWRITE]",

September in Verbindung zu bringen, als in Wirklichkeit hatte man wirklich nicht viel miteinander zu tun \nAber die Regierung machte es so aussehen, als ob es so war, und spielte mit den Emotionen des amerikanischen Volkes aus, als sie sich gegen die Terroranschläge vom 11. September 2001 und die Invasion des Irak 2003 aussprach \nAh\nIch \nIch selbst bin gegen den Krieg und \nBesonders gegen einen vorbeugenden Angriff war ich dagegen \nAh \nUnd ich denke, dass der Krieg im Irak in vielen Aspekten \nEin \nEin Wiederholung ist von \nDer Vietnamkrieg und die Regierung sollte von den Fehlern gelernt haben, die sie gemacht hat \n\nIch meine, \nEin \nEin riesiger Teil der

\nDie amerikanische Regierung war vorbereitet auf den \nWas \nFür den Anfang und die Machtvakuum und die Chaos, das vorkommen würde \nAh \nUnd hier \nUnd die Regierung \nUnd so entfernt die Vereinigten Staaten die irakische Regierung und \n\nSie versuchen, eine demokratische Regierung einzuführen und es ist ein ähnliches Ding, was sie versuchten, in Vietnam \nSie versuchten, Kommunisten auszuschalten \nUnd \nUnd die Demokratie aufrechtzuerhalten oder einzuführen \nUnd \nUnd es \nUnd es \nUnd die Regierung \nUnd die US-Regierung sollte wissen, dass es eine lange und schwierige

Vietnamesen mögen haben gewollt, dass die US käme, es wird immer noch ein großer Teil Rebellen geben und es ist schwer, sie niederzuschlagen, wenn man nicht gegen eine Armee kämpft \n\nMan kämpft gegen die Bürger des Landes, die \nBesonderen Bürger im Land und \nSo \nSo denke ich, dass \nSo denke ich, dass die Regierung \nSo zum ersten Mal denke ich, dass wir nicht in den Krieg gegangen sein sollten, weil ich gegen den Krieg bin in fast allen Fällen und \nAber wenn man in den Krieg geht, muss man sich auf alle möglichen Ergebnisse vorbereiten \nIch denke, die Regierung war nicht so vorbereitet, wie sie sollte sein \nIch meine, am \nUnd \nEntweder für, was passieren würde \nEigentlich nicht planen, was passieren würde, nachdem sie die irakische Regierung entfernt haben \nIch meine wir sind immer noch dort heute und fast Ende 2006 und wir sind immer noch \nAh \nViele amerikanische Soldaten sterben immer noch und \nUnd sie versuchen, die irakischen Soldaten und die irakischen Polizei zu trainieren, um ihre eigene Nation zu schützen, und es ist ein langer Prozess und ich denke einfach, dass \nDas die US-Regierung auf eine Weise versuchte, \nNun sie waren nicht selbst vorbereitet, aber auf eine Weise versuchte, die amerikanische Bevölkerung zu täuschen, indem sie sie glauben machte, es wäre ein \nEin \nEin kurzer erfolgreicher Aufenthalt in Irak und \nIch meine wir sollten \nWir sind ein \nWir sind ein bisschen \nWir sind naive, weil wir glauben, dass es nicht lange dauern würde, weil es Jahre dauert, eine neue Regierungsform einzuführen und sie erfolgreich zu machen \nIch meine in unserem eigenen Land \nDie Demokratie war ein langer Kampf, um zu einer starken Regierung zu kommen, die wir heute sind, und es gab \nEs gab viel Tension und es gab Bürgerkrieg und \nAh \nEs ist einfach nicht eine einfache Sache zu tun, und ich denke, die Regierung \nDie US-Regierung machte es so aussehen, als wäre es eine relativ einfache Sache zu tun \nUnd \nAh \nSo \nUnd so \nLassen Sie uns sehen \nDer Krieg im Irak \n\nNun das \nNein, das \nNein, das ist \nDas ist eine schwierige Entscheidung, weil \nDas war \nNun war das so meine Meinung, glaube ich, in der Präsidentschaftswahl von 2004, als ich über die Person dachte, die ich wählen würde, wenn ich wählen könnte, und einer \nAh \nEiner meiner Gründe, dass ich wahrscheinlich George Bush gewählt haben würde, war, dass er das beenden sollte, was er begonnen hatte und \nUnd so meine ich \nEs ist wirklich schwierig, weil man sich einmal in den Krieg begibt und wir sind dort schon so lange, wie kann man jetzt diese Leute verlassen \nIch meine wir sind die, die ihre Regierung und \nUnd \nIhr Lebensstil haben weggenommen \nWie können wir sie jetzt verlassen \nVerlassen sie jetzt so \nSo ist es wahrscheinlich etwas, das wir \n(coughs)\nEntschuldigung \nVersuchen, es zu beenden, aber wiederum gibt es auch die Überlegung, die astronomische Anzahl an amerikanischen Verlusten und \nUnd \nUnd wie \nUnd wie viel ist zu viel, um weiterhin zu riskieren \nFür eine freie Demokratie im Irak \nIch meine \nZurück zur ganzen Gründe des Irak-Einmarsches \nIch meine wir \nWir \nWir \nWenn wir den Irak angreifen und ihn in eine Demokratie machen, warum machen wir es nicht in allen anderen Ländern? \nWarum machen wir es nicht in allen Ländern, die wir wollen? \nIch denke, der große Grund dafür ist \nIst der \nIst der Öl-Aspekt \nUnd wo wir unsere Ölquelle sind \nUnd es geht meistens um Geld und Ressourcen \nIch meine, weil eine andere Voraussetzung war, bevor wir in den Krieg gingen, dass der Irak Waffen der Massenvernichtung hatte \nUnd keine Waffen der Massenvernichtung wurden jemals gefunden \nWenn man dagegen bei Nordkorea wusste, dass sie Waffen der Massenvernichtung hatten, und wir greifen sie nicht an \nDann denke ich, die US-Regierung ist nicht ausreichend gründlich oder ehrlich bei ihren Entscheidungen\n\nLassen Sie uns sehen \nAh \nIch hoffe nur, dass es bald vorbei ist

And I understand on Myspace, you know, in order to see someone's profile, you have to have someone else be a member, you have to add them as a friend or something like that, so if that's the case, you've accepted that person as your \"friend\" so they can see it, you're giving them permission to see your profile. So, I mean, anytime you post information on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that, so if I think it was actually good that someone saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost.\n\nHum, um, that's tough because I mean, you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everyone's different profiles to prevent that, but then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, \"Let's just look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything.\" Um, I mean, I don't think it would really be right to have someone's job be to look at people's profiles, but I guess it all depends on the situation they came across that profile, or was someone just randomly looking at people's profiles and just happened to see that, or were they actually looking for some sort of evidence that the student was planning something, so I don't really know.\n\nYes, um, well, I mean, I personally don't have a Myspace, but I have a Facebook, I do, it bothers me that I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me, and I saw something on TV once that was about this man who just wanted to prove how easy it is to get information, and he went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away, and was talking to her on instant messenger in less than a minute and got her to meet with him and I mean, personally, I certainly wouldn't meet with someone like that, but I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names but they IM me and they know it's me, and it's hard because you think they know your interests, they know what you look like, sometimes if you put your class schedule they know where you are during the day, who your friends are, they pretty much know a lot about you, all sorts of photos, and I tried to limit what I post, but at the same time, I think the whole point of having one is so you can communicate with some of your friends, I don't want to limit it too much, so it's a tricky issue, because I only accept people I know, I mean, you never really know who can see what.\n\nHum, uh, well, I heard my roommate was telling me that her high school there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school, and that struck me as a little bit strange, like I wasn't sure how the high school officials had the power to tell their students that they weren't allowed to have a Myspace, and I don't know if that's really a privacy issue, but I think I don't really know how they had the right to tell people what they could and couldn't do.

And it's not just for women. I think it has to do with the specific field of work that one is in. I mean, in general, I feel that women have it harder because there's the \"glass ceiling\" where, even though it's supposed to be about equality, most people have a hard time finding someone to work under a woman if they're a man because the society has been raised for so long. And often, women in the workplace see that there's a job they can reach, and they have all the qualifications for it, but maybe the board won't promote them to that position because, historically, it's been shown that women are not usually in the upper levels of the business world. And I think the same thing goes for men. And in other fields like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent, it's really rare for a man to be at home. And often, people look down on that because society thinks, \"Oh, you're a man, you should be working. You should be the breadwinner of your family. Why are you staying at home?\" And it can be really hard for them because maybe it's always been their dream to be with the children and help raise them, and maybe the wife has a better job, and it's working out fine for them. But society looks down on that. And in the fashion industry, often people don't take men seriously if they're straight. I don't know if that makes sense. But I think it's because men who are typically into fashion... I think they have different lifestyles. And if a man has the typical lifestyle and is in the fashion industry, people will be like, \"Well, how do I really know if you know what fashion is for women? Like, you don't really know what our case is like? Like these other guys.\" And so, depending on the field of work you're in, I think there's definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. To change it is kind of difficult because society has a fixed mindset and, obviously, we've come a long way from the 1800s, but change is slow. So, I think that if we continue to work at the pace we are now because women are advancing to higher positions and becoming CEOs and they're getting more accepted in the business world, but it's a slow process, but it's happening, and people are starting to accept it more. And similarly, as men who are stay-at-home dads, it's becoming more accepted because they realize, \"Oh, maybe the woman has a better job or she wants to be the one who works.\" And then for people in fashion, it'll be like, \"Oh, maybe they're listening to their female friends or their wives, and so they know where I'm coming from.\" So, I guess you have to kind of promote it by showing the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotyped against, not being too pushy, but showing the qualities of them. Because if you force it, people will resist. And I think we're kind of at a good balance where it's starting to become enforced like that. So, I don't really know if there's anything we can do now that isn't already being done because if you do it too fast, people will resist, and we've come a long way, and change takes time. Yes. And I think they're also discriminated against each other, depending on the type of job you have or where you come from. Like if you grew up on a farm and your grammar isn't so good, but you're extremely intelligent and you work your way up to a CEO job, even though you might not have the best grammar in the world, or even though you might be intelligent, but you don't have the best grammar in the world, other men will look down on you and be like, \"How do I know you're really saying what you mean if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right?\" So, yeah, sometimes it's where you come from that discriminates against you, and from gender to gender.

It's good to be rooted in tradition, but it's also important to be adaptable to change. Many Catholics believe they have to go to church every week, and they're very strict about how things are done. Sometimes I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to the letter. They don't accept people who aren't exactly perfect Catholics, and they also don't accept people of other religions. For example, my mom was an Episcopalian, my dad was an Episcopalian, but my mom was a Catholic, and they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. That's not really being tolerant of other religions. We always learned to love others, that's a Catholic teaching, but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them like that.

It's just a different realm; it might be an issue, but I probably don't think that would be the case. Well, I guess people who molest children would probably do that regardless of whether they were married or not, because it's a child, which is different from a spouse.

gedacht haben\nUnd wir sind einfach dorthin gegangen, ohne vorbereitet und ohne einen Plan\nUnd also\nIch denke, dass es sich gegen uns ausgewendet hat\nAlso\nIch weiß nicht\nIch war für es\nAber

sind, ihr Land zu verbessern\nIch denke, dass sie nur uns aus dem Weg räumen möchten\nUnd ich denke, dass das für uns in Ordnung wäre\nIch denke, dass wir nur weggehen sollten und das ist es\nAlso\nIch denke, dass wir einfach nur aufgepeitscht waren, als wir dorthin gingen\nIch denke, dass wir nicht rational über die möglichen Folgen nachgedacht haben oder wie sie reagieren würden, wenn wir versuchten, ihr ganzes Leben zu ändern\nAlso\nIch denke, dass wir einfach dorthin gegangen sind, weil wir Rache suchten\nIch denke, dass Präsident Bush einfach dorthin gegangen ist, weil die Leute ihn dazu gedrängt haben, aufgrund von elf September\nAlso\nIch denke auch, dass er sich selbst entschieden hat, den Krieg gegen den Irak zu erklären\nAlso\nAber zu diesem Zeitpunkt verstehe ich, warum er das getan hat\nWir hatten wirklich\nIch denke, dass wir keine Wahl hatten, den Krieg gegen den Irak zu erklären, weil sie das nicht einfach tun konnten und wir dann einfach sagen würden:
