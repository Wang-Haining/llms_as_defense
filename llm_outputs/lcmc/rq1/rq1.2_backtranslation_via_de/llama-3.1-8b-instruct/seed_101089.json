heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would

ist nur ein Kind \nIch meine \nSie werden die gleichen Meinungen und alles haben \nElternkompetenz ist in schwulen Paaren genauso wie in heterosexuellen Paaren \n\nUnd \nAlso \nSie können in der Gemeinschaft involviert sein oder nicht wie heterosexuelle Paare wählen \nIch meine es geht nur um Persönlichkeitsmerkmale \n\nIch denke, der Bundesstaat sollte sich stark in diese Angelegenheit einmischen \nSchwulen Ehe geltend zu machen, in jedem Bundesstaat legal zu machen \nIch denke, die Änderung sollte einfach das Gegenteil sein \n\nAber \nNa gut, ich denke, Präsident Bush hat sehr starke Ansichten über seine Religion \n\nNa \nSeine \nSeine Meinung über die schwule Ehe, tatsächlich \nIch denke, sie passt zu seiner Meinung über die Abtreibung \nUnd \nStammzellenforschung, die \nUm \nIch denke, die meisten Gründe \nIch bin unsicher über das \nWeil \nEhrlich gesagt, versuche ich nicht viel mit Politik zu tun \nAber \nDie meisten Gründe, die ich gehört habe, zumindest im Fernsehen und so weiter, sind moralische Gründe \nUnd \nMoral ist nicht verhandelbar \nAber \nEs unterscheidet sich von Person zu Person \nUnd \nUm die Moral einer bestimmten Gruppe in Amerika anzuerkennen, während die Kultur und \nUm \nMoralbegriffe aller anderen zu ignorieren, ist unethisch \nWenn du mit der Regierung zusammenarbeitest, einen Gesetzesentwurf zu erstellen, der religiöse Standards auf den ganzen Staat anwendet, ist es völlig unehrenhaft für die Regierung, bedenkt man die kürzlich aufgetretenen Kontroversen \nBedenkt man den \"Unter Gott\" in der Erklärung der Treue \nUnd \nWie Menschen so sehr gegen das sind \nAber \nWenn sie Gesetze schaffen, die religiöse Standards auf den ganzen Staat anwenden, dann ist das, als ob sie sagen, ich kann, was ich möchte, aber du nicht \n\nNa \nViele Leute sind gegen schwule und schwule Ehen, weil sie glauben, dass Schwule irgendwie psychisch gestört sind \nUnd \nDie Schwulenheit ist das Ergebnis von Kindheitstraumata, weil man nicht nah an einem oder dem anderen Elternteil war \nOder \nNur eine Persönlichkeitsabweichung \n\nUnd \nDas ist auch kein guter Grund \nWeil \nDie Amerikanische Psychologische Gesellschaft hat ein Memo veröffentlicht, wie unecht das ist \nUnd \nWenn Leute zu \nUm \nInstitutionen, die tatsächlich Forschungen und Studien auf diesem Gebiet durchgeführt haben, zuhören \nAnstatt auf ihre

I don't think it's as strict as it used to be. I know even as I've grown up, I would always go to church every Sunday. And I would get these cute little dresses. And matching shoes. And a matching purse. That was just all I did in the church. I went to a private school. And I would see all my friends there on Sundays. And we would just go there.

Especially in the summer, people come in their beach clothes, straight from the beach. You'd have the families there who are just running in late. So I think it's become much more casual. Even at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up, people wear jeans and khakis. Well, khakis are nice too. But it's just much more casual compared to that. As for other things, that's the biggest thing I've noticed. Like, that's the church I know; I don't know the church politics and whatnot. But yes, that's it. [OK, regarding all the accusations against Catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?] I don't think these things could have been avoided. Because there are men who are married, and they still become pedophiles, and they still have... an attraction to young children. So I think even if you get them married, it's just the person; it's not because they're allowed to get married or not allowed to get married. I think also when they become a priest, it's their choice to become a priest. There are religions where they're allowed to get married. Like Seventh Heaven, I don't know what kind of... He's a reverend or a minister or something. [Mm hmm] They're allowed to get married. So I know it's a little different. But if they really want to practice their faith and get married at the same time, they should maybe consider a different faith. [OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?] Um, on which part... About... [Um] The changes... [That it really wouldn't make a difference I guess.] Oh, on pedophilia... [Mm hmm] I think... Like the whole... Um... Sexuality is primarily based on genetics. I think it's based on genetics. I think people aren't just born that way. I think they're born that way. I think it has nothing to do with how they were raised. Maybe it plays a role in this case. But I think it's their genetics. And you can't hide that by getting married. You can try, but it would usually come out. So I don't think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening. If they knew about it and were trying to cover it up, then shame on them. But I don't think they knew in all cases.

As for other things, that's the biggest thing I've noticed. Like, that's the church I know; I don't know the church politics and whatnot. But yes, that's it. [OK, regarding all the accusations against Catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?] I don't think these things could have been avoided. Because there are men who are married, and they still become pedophiles, and they still have... an attraction to young children. So I think even if you get them married, it's just the person; it's not because they're allowed to get married or not allowed to get married. I think also when they become a priest, it's their choice to become a priest. There are religions where they're allowed to get married. Like Seventh Heaven, I don't know what kind of... He's a reverend or a minister or something. [Mm hmm] They're allowed to get married. So I know it's a little different. But if they really want to practice their faith and get married at the same time, they should maybe consider a different faith. [OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?] Um, on which part... About... [Um] The changes... [That it really wouldn't make a difference I guess.] Oh, on pedophilia... [Mm hmm] I think... Like the whole... Um... Sexuality is primarily based on genetics. I think it's based on genetics. I think people aren't just born that way. I think they're born that way. I think it has nothing to do with how they were raised. Maybe it plays a role in this case. But I think it's their genetics. And you can't hide that by getting married. You can try, but it would usually come out. So I don't think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening. If they knew about it and were trying to cover it up, then shame on them. But I don't think they knew in all cases. [OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church?] I don't have any.",

are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s

\nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own

\nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of

September zu verbinden, als in Wirklichkeit hatte man nicht so viel mit dem anderen zu tun \nAber die Regierung machte es so aussehen, dass es so war, und spielte auf die Emotionen der Amerikaner in ihrer Entrüstung über die terroristischen Angriffe am 11.

denke, dass das \nDer Krieg im Irak ist in mancherlei Hinsicht \nEin \nEin Wiederholung in vielen Fällen von dem Krieg im Vietnam und die Regierung sollte aus den Fehlern lernen, die sie mit \nIch meine, eine \nEine enorme Anzahl von amerikanischen Soldaten starben \n\nUnd das ist \nDas ist furchtbar und \nWas sie \nWas sie taten, war, dass sie \nSie entfernten das Landesregierung und ich

auftreten \nHmm \nUnd hier \nUnd die Regierung \nUnd die Vereinigten Staaten entfernen die Regierung des Iraks und \n\nSie versuchen, eine demokratische Regierung einzusetzen und es ist ziemlich dasselbe, was sie versuchten, im Vietnam \nSie versuchten, die Kommunisten hinauszudrängen \nUnd \nUnd zu begründen oder \nUmzusetzen und zu begründen \nUnd \nUnd es \nEs \nEs \nEs ist \nUnd die

berücksichtigen \nDenke ich, dass die Regierung nicht so vorbereitet war wie sie es sein sollte \nIch meine, das \nWirklich nicht planen, was passieren würde, wenn sie die Regierung des Iraks entfernten und \nIch meine, wir sind immer noch dort heute, fast am Ende von 2006 und wir sind immer noch \nHmm \nViele amerikanische Soldaten sterben immer noch und \nUnd sie versuchen immer noch, die irakischen Truppen und die irakischen Polizei zu trainieren, um ihr eigenes Land zu polizieren, und das ist ein langer Prozess, und ich denke einfach, dass \nDas, dass die Regierung der Vereinigten Staaten auf eine Weise versuchte, \nNun sie war nicht bereit, aber auf eine Weise versuchte, die Amerikaner zu täuschen, indem sie sie glauben machte, es würde sich um einen \nEin \nEin kurzen erfolgreichen Aufenthalt im Irak handeln \nIch meine, wir sollten \nWir sollten uns nicht \nWir sollten uns nicht so leichtgläubig sein, weil es Jahre dauert, bis man eine neue Form der Regierung einführt und sie erfolgreich wird \nIch meine in unserem eigenen Land \nDemokratie war ein langer Kampf und um zu einer starken Regierung zu gelangen, die wir heute haben, war ein langer Kampf und es gab \nEs gab viel Tension und es gab einen Bürgerkrieg und \nHmm \nEs ist einfach nicht leicht, und ich denke, die Regierung \nDie Regierung der Vereinigten Staaten machte es so aus, als wäre es eine relativ leichtes Unterfangen \nUnd \nHmm \nAlso \nAlso \nAlso \nAlso, der Krieg im Irak \n\nNun, das \nDas ist \nDas ist eine schwierige Entscheidung, weil \nDas war \nNun, das war ziemlich meine Meinung, glaube ich, in der Präsidentschaftswahl von 2004, als ich über, wer ich wählen würde, wenn ich wählen könnte, und eines \nHmm \nEines meiner Gründe war, dass ich wahrscheinlich für George Bush stimmen würde, um ihn zu lassen, was er begonnen hatte und \nUnd so \nNun, es ist wirklich schwer, weil, wenn man hineingegangen ist und wir sind schon so lange dort, wie können wir diese Leute verlassen \nIch meine, wir sind die, die ihr Regierung und \nUnd \nUnd ihr Lebensstil weggenommen haben, wie können wir sie jetzt verlassen \nAbsenden sie jetzt so \nAlso ist es

sie denken\nO, lass uns schauen, wer die schlechten Kids sind und machen sicher, dass sie nichts Böses im Schilde führen\nUm, ich meine\nIch denke, es wäre nicht richtig\nVon jemanden, der die Aufgabe hat, sich durch die Profile zu trollen\nAber ich denke, es hängt alles davon ab\nWas für eine Situation sie in dem Profil gefunden haben\nOder war jemand einfach zufällig durch die Profile gelaufen\nUnd einfach zufällig einige Informationen gefunden\nOder suchten sie nach\nDu weißt\nEinige Art von Beweisen, dass der Schüler etwas plane\nDa ich nicht weiß\n\nJa, Um, also, also\nIch meine, ich habe keine Myspace, aber ich habe ein Facebook\nIch tue\nEs befällt mich, dass ich weiß, dass es Leute gibt, die seltsam sind\nWer Informationen über mich sehen können\nUnd ich sah einmal etwas auf dem Fernsehen, das war über diesen Mann\nUm, der einfach\nEr war einfach nur daran interessiert zu beweisen, wie leicht man Informationen bekommt\nUnd er ging auf das Profil dieser Frau und konnte ihren Benutzernamen sofort herausfinden\nUnd war in weniger als einer Minute mit ihr auf dem Instant Messenger\nUnd ich meine\nPersönlich wäre ich auch nicht dazu bereit, mich mit jemandem zu treffen\nAber ich kenne Leute aus meinen Klassen\nDie ich nicht kenne, wenn sie ihre Benutzernamen ändern\nAber sie schreiben mir und sie wissen, dass ich es bin\nUnd es\nEs ist schwer, weil du denkst, dass sie deine Interessen kennen\nSie kennen, wie du aussiehst\nManchmal, wenn du deine Stundenplan postest, wissen sie, wo du bist während des Tages\nWer deine Freunde sind\nSie wissen fast alles über dich\nAlles Arten von Fotos\nUnd ich versuchte, was ich postete, zu begrenzen\nAber gleichzeitig\nDer ganze Sinn\nIch denke\nDer Grund, warum ich eins habe, ist, damit ich mit einigen meiner Freunde kommunizieren kann\nIch will es nicht zu sehr einschränken\nAlso ist es ein schwieriges Problem\nWeil ich nur Leute akzeptiere, die ich kenne\nIch meine, man weiß nie wirklich\nWer etwas sehen kann\n\nHum, Uh, also\nIch hörte\nMeine Mitbewohnerin erzählte mir, dass\nUm\nIn ihrer Schule\nEs gab ein ganz großes Problem darüber, wie Schüler von der Schule verbannt wurden, weil sie MySpace hatten\nUnd\nDas berührte mich ein bisschen seltsam\nIch wusste nicht, wie\nWie Schulleiter die Befugnis hatten, ihren Schülern zu sagen, dass sie keinen MySpace haben dürfen\n\nUnd\nIch weiß nicht, ob das wirklich ein Privatsphäreproblem ist\nAber ich denke\nIch weiß nicht, wie sie das Recht hatten, es zu tun\n\nDas ist der einzige andere Gedanke, der mir einfällt\n\nJa\n\nEnglish translation:\n\n[REWRITE] I want to ask a question to clarify that it was prevented because someone went online and found out that it was like\n\nOh, okay, um, no, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy\nOn sites like Myspace, if\nI mean, if you post information on the internet, it's\nIt's pretty much available for everyone to see\nAnd I understand on Myspace you know you have to have\nSomeone else has to be a member in order to see someone's profile\nYou might need to\nYou know be their friend or something like that\nBut if that's the case you've accepted that person as your \"friend\" so they can see it\nYou're giving them permission to see your profile\nSo\nI mean anytime you put information on the internet\nYou pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that\nSo I think it was good\nThat someone saw that\nAnd was able to prevent a life from being lost\n\nHmm, um, that's tough\nBecause I mean obviously you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody's different profiles\nOf all the students in the school to prevent that\nBut then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think\nOh, let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything\nUm, I mean\nI don't think it would really be right\nTo have someone's job be to look at people's profiles\nBut I guess it all depends\nOn like what situation they came across that profile\nOr was someone just randomly looking at people's\nAnd just randomly happened to see that\nOr were they actually looking for\nYou know\nSome sort of evidence that the student was planning something\nSo I don't really know\n\nYes, um, well, um, like\nI mean I don't have a Myspace personally but I have a Facebook\nI do\nIt bothers me that I know that there are creepy people out there\nWho can see things about me\nAnd I saw something on TV once that was about this\nUm\nThis man who just\nHe was just trying to prove how he can get information so easily\nAnd he went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away\nAnd was talking to her on instant messenger\nIn like you know less than a minute and got her to meet with him\nAnd I mean\nPersonally I certainly wouldn't meet with someone\nBut I have had people in my classes\nWho I don't recognize their screen names\nBut they IM me and they know that it's me\nAnd it\nIt's hard because you think that they know your interests\nThey know what you look like\nSometimes if you post your class schedule they know where you are during the day\nWho your friends are\nThey pretty much know a lot about you\nAll sorts of photos\nAnd I tried to limit what I put up there\nBut at the same time\nThe whole point\nI think\nThe reason I have one is so you know I can communicate with some of my friends\nI don't want to limit it too much\nSo it's a tricky issue\nBecause I only accept people I know\nI mean you never really know\nWho can look at what\nSo\n\nHmm, uh, well\nI heard\nMy roommate was telling me that her\nUm\nHigh school she\nThere was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school\nAnd\nThat struck me as a little bit strange\nLike I wasn't sure how\nHow school officials had the power to tell their students\nThat they weren't allowed to have a Myspace\n\nAnd\nI don't know if that's really a privacy issue\nBut I think\nI don't really know\nHow they had the right to tell people\n\nThat's the only other thought I can think of\n\nYes [/REWRITE]",

Um. And it's not just with women, but I think it's because of the specific field that one deals with in their work. Um. I mean overall I feel like women have it harder because there's the \"glass ceiling\" where even though there's supposed to be equality, most people have a hard time working under a woman if they're a man. It's just how society has been since so long. And often in the workplace, women see that there's a job they can reach, and they have all the qualifications for it, but maybe the board won't elect to promote them to that position just because historically it's not seen that women are usually in the upper echelons of the business world. Um. I think the same thing applies to men, though. And like in other industries such as fashion or being a stay-at-home dad, it's really uncommon. Um. To have a stay-at-home dad who's a man, and um, many people look down upon that because society thinks: \"Oh, you're the man, you should be working,\" \"You should be the breadwinner of your family.\" Why are you staying home? And it can be really hard for them because maybe it's always been their dream to be with the children and to help raise them, and maybe the wife has the better job, and it's working out fine for them, but society looks down upon that. And in the fashion industry, um, many people don't take men seriously if they're straight. I don't know if that really makes sense, but I think it's because typically men who are into fashion, um, have different lifestyles. And so if you have the typical lifestyle and you're a man and you're in the fashion industry, people will be like: \"Well, how do I really know if you know what fashion is for women?\" Like you don't really know what our thing is like, like the other guys. And so, depending on the field of work you're in, I think there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. Um. To change it is a bit more difficult because society has a fixed mindset, and obviously we've come a long way since the 1800s, and leaps and bounds, but the change is slow, so I think that if we continue working at the pace we are now, because women are rising to higher positions and becoming CEOs and they're getting more accepted in the business world, and it's a slow process, but it's happening, and people are starting to accept it. And just like men who are stay-at-home dads, it's becoming more accepted because they realize: \"Oh, maybe the woman has the better job or she wants to be the one who works,\" and um, then for like people in the fashion industry, they'll be like: \"Oh, maybe they're listening to their female friends or their wives and stuff,\" and so they do know where I'm coming from. So I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotyped against, not by being too pushy, but by saying like the qualities of them, because if you force it people will resist, and I think that we're kind of at a good balance where it's starting to become enforced like that. So I don't really know if there's anything we can do right now that isn't already being done because if you do it too fast, people will resist, and we've come a long way, and change takes time, yes. Um. And I think they're also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or where you're from, like if you grew up on a farm and your grammar might not be so good, but you're extremely intelligent and you work your way up into a CEO job, even though you might not have the best grammar in the world, or even though you might be intelligent but you don't have the best grammar in the world, other men will look down upon you and be like: \"How do I know you're really saying what you're saying if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right?\" So, yeah, sometimes just where you're from can discriminate against you, and like from gender to gender, and I don't know, I guess that'd be another example.

September habe ich mich fast so\nIch interessiere mich nicht mehr für das, was dort passiert\nMit diesen Menschen\nIch interessiere mich nicht\nIch denke, dass\nManchmal denke ich, dass sie keine Menschen sind\nIch weiß nicht\nSie kämpfen untereinander und können nichts tun\nAlso interessiere ich mich nicht\nWir sind unvorbereitet dorthin gegangen\nWir wussten nicht, was uns dort erwarten würde\nUnd es ist auch schlimm, weil Krieg für sie etwas ganz anderes ist als für uns\nSie sind wie Wilde, wenn es um Krieg geht, und ich denke, dass sie nicht daran interessiert sind, ihr Land zu verbessern\nIch denke, dass sie nur wollen, dass wir weg sind\nUnd ich denke, das sollte uns recht sein\nIch denke, wir sollten einfach gehen und das ist es\nWir waren einfach nur aufgeheizt und nicht rational\nIch denke, wir haben nicht darüber nachgedacht, was das alles bewirken könnte oder wie sie reagieren würden, wenn wir dorthin gingen und versuchten, ihr ganzes Leben zu ändern\nIch denke, wir sind einfach dorthin gegangen, um uns zu rächen\nIch denke, Präsident Bush ist einfach dorthin gegangen, weil die Leute wollten, dass wir dorthin gehen, weil von dem 11. September\nUnd ich denke, er hat sich das Krieg gegen den Irak aufgedrängt\nAber damals verstehe ich, woher er kam\nWir hatten keine Wahl, den Krieg zu erklären, weil sie nicht einfach so etwas machen und dann würden wir sagen, 'Okay, wir bauen alles wieder auf und das ist es'\nAber ich denke, wir hätten uns besser darum kümmern sollen, was wir dort tun wollten\nIch denke, sie waren nicht klar darüber, was sie dort tun sollten, um Ordnung zu schaffen\nIch weiß nicht\nIch denke, sie hatten keine Einigkeit darüber, was sie dort tun sollten\nIch denke, das hätte uns helfen können\nAber ich sagte schon, dass wir aus Emotion und Wut dorthin gegangen sind\nAlso haben wir auch dort dasselbe geschaffen\nIch denke, dass wir nicht diejenigen sind, die diese Menschen ändern können\nIch denke, sie werden immer so bleiben\nIch denke, wir tun nichts\nIch denke, wir tun uns selbst nur weh, indem wir dort bleiben\nWir haben Fortschritte gemacht\nAber nicht genug, um zu bleiben\nUnd ich denke, egal wie lange wir dort bleiben, sobald wir weg sind, ist es einfach zusammengebrochen\nWir können nicht ewig dort bleiben\nAlso denke ich, wir tun uns selbst nur weh, wenn wir dort bleiben\n\nNow, I will translate the German text back to English:\n\n[REWRITE]\nAt first I was for it because I was personally affected by 11 September\nOn the other hand\nI was for it because I thought I should go there and cause as much chaos as they did here\nOn the other hand\nI think we reacted too emotionally and didn't think enough about the long-term consequences\nWe just went there without a plan\nAnd I think it backfired on us\nI don't know\nI was for it, but now I'm against it\nI think it didn't achieve anything\nI think the people there\nAs long as they're fighting each other, they can't fight with us too\nI think our presence there won't make a difference if they can't even get along with themselves\nSo unfortunately because of 11 September I've almost just\nI don't care about what happens there\nWith those people\nI don't care\nI think\nSometimes I think they're not human\nI don't know\nThey fight each other and can't do anything\nSo I don't care\nWe just went there unprepared\nWe didn't know what to expect there\nAnd it's also bad because war is something completely different for them than for us\nThey're like savages when it comes to war and I don't think they're interested in improving their country\nI think they just want us to leave\nAnd I think that should be fine for us\nI think we should just leave and that's it\nI think we were just hyped up and not rational\nI think we didn't think about what it could lead to or how they would react if we went there and tried to change their whole lifestyle\nI think we just went there to avenge\nI think President Bush just went there because the people wanted to go there because of what happened on 11 September\nAnd I think he kind of took it upon himself to declare war on Iraq\nBut at the time I understand where he was coming from\nWe didn't have a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can't just do that and then us just say 'let's rebuild and that's it'\nBut I think we could have had a better plan of what we were going to do\nI think they weren't clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of creating order\nI don't know\nI think they didn't have unity\nThey didn't know what they were going in for\nI think that would have helped us a lot more\nBut like I said I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with\nSo that's what we created there\nI think we're not the ones to change those people\nI think they're always going to be like that\nAnd I don't\nI really don't have anything else to say\nIt's gone on long enough\nI don't think we're making enough progress\nWe've made progress\nBut not enough to stay there\nAnd I think no matter how long we stay there\nOnce we leave, it's just going to collapse\nWe can't stay there forever\nSo I think we're just hurting ourselves by staying there\nNo\nOkay\n\n[/REWRITE]",
