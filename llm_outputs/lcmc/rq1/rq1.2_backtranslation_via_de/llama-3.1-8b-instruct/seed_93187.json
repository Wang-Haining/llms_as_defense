I think if they adapted to a more modern way of thinking, they wouldn't have to worry about losing their followers. I've heard that many people are starting to turn away from the Catholic Church because of their views on these situations and because people disagree with them on certain subjects.

    "original": "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the

\nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would

sollte\nWeil \nNun, es gibt einfach kein gutes Argument, warum nicht \nUm \nViele Leute denken, dass homosexuelle Paare eine Bedrohung für die heterosexuelle Familie darstellen \nAber \nEs ist so unterschiedlich \nUnd \nEs gibt so viele verschiedene Aspekte, die es nie als dasselbe betrachten lassen \nEs ist einfach \nEs ist wie zwei verschiedene Seiten der gleichen Münze \nUm \nKopf wird nie Schwanz sein \nAber \nEs ist wie dasselbe Ding \nUnd \nUm \nEs gibt viele Zivilrechte, die damit zusammenhängen \nWie \nEigentumssteuern und die ganze medizinische Versorgung, wo \nUm \nDein Hauptperson oder dein \nIch möchte nicht sagen nächsten Verwandte \n\nWeil ich nicht sicher bin, dass das genau ist \nAber \nWenn du in einer gleichgeschlechtlichen Beziehung bist, dann kann dein Partner nicht in der Nähe von dir sein, wenn du krank bist \nUnd \nKann nicht besuchen \nWeil sie nicht offiziell Familie sind \n\nUnd \nIch denke, das ist ziemlich absurd, wenn man in Betracht zieht, dass man sein ganzes Leben mit jemandem verbringt \nUnd \nViele wissenschaftliche Studien sind durchgeführt worden \nWeil \nEs ist ein heißes Thema derzeit \nUnd \nGleichgeschlechtliche Paare haben die gleichen Erfolgsraten wie heterosexuelle Paare \nSie haben die gleichen \nUm \nFaktoren in der Beziehung, die zu Zufriedenheit beitragen, wie heterosexuelle Paare \n\nEs ist einfach eine Beziehung, es ist dasselbe Ding \nUnd \nIch denke, wo viele Leute sich nur aufhalten, ist \nUm \nGleichgeschlechtliche sind nicht danach, das Recht zu haben, in einer Kirche geheiratet zu werden \nSie bitten um eine Eheurkunde \nEin rechtliches Dokument, das vom Staat ausgegeben wird \n\nUnd \nWenn es keine Beteiligung von Kirche und Staat gibt, dann sollte das nicht ein Problem sein \nWeil \nIch verstehe nicht, warum Menschen, die Katholiken sind, sich so aufregen, wenn sie sagen, das ist gegen unsere Religion und das ist moralisch falsch für uns und wir können es nicht billigen \nAber \nIn rechtlicher Hinsicht \nWenn du jemandem eine Zivilunion gestattest, warum nicht eine Ehe \n\nEs ist wie Segregation, getrennt aber ungleich \n\nJa \nSie sind \nSie sind in vielen Bereichen gleich, wie die Art der Beziehung, die durch verschiedene Partner gespielt wird, und so weiter \nUnd \nLeute haben Angst um \nUm \nAdoptionsfragen \nUnd \nGemeinschaftsfragen \nWie ein Paar homosexueller Eltern in ihrer Gemeinschaft die Gesellschaft beeinflussen wird \n\nUnd \nBesonders um \nUm \nDie Kinder von homosexuellen Paaren und wie sie sich in der Gesellschaft anpassen werden \nUnd \nOb sie \nUm \nVon ihren Eltern beeinflusst werden, \nUm \nSexuelle Orientierung \nOder nicht \nAber \nWeil wiederum ist es ein bisschen neu und so \nAber \nEs ist ein bisschen schwierig zu sagen \nIch bin nicht sicher, was die Kinder betroffen ist \nUmw die Adoption \nWeil \nIch denke, der Hauptvorteil ist \nUm \nWie Kinder von ihren Mitschülern \nUnd \nVon anderen Erwachsenen in der Gesellschaft behandelt werden \n\nWie in New York City weiß ich, dass sie \nUm \nSie haben besondere Schulen für Kinder von homosexuellen Eltern \nWeil \nIn öffentlichen Schulen in New York City werden sie wie geschlagen \nUnd \nStücke wie das \nEltern protestieren, um das Kind aus der Schule zu entfernen \nUnd \nEs ist nur ein Kind \nIch meine \nSie werden die gleichen Meinungen und alles haben \nElternskills sind in homosexuellen Paaren genauso wie in heterosexuellen Paaren \n\nUnd \nDeshalb \nKann man in der Gemeinschaft ja oder nein beteiligt sein, wie heterosexuelle Paare es wählen \nIch meine es ist einfach eine Frage der Persönlichkeitswahl \n\nIch denke, die Bundesregierung sollte sehr in diese Angelegenheit involviert sein \nDass homosexuelles Ehe in jedem Staat legalisiert wird \nIch denke, die Änderung sollte einfach die Gegenteil sein \n\nAber \nWeil ich denke, Präsident Bush hat sehr starke persönliche Ansichten, die mit seiner Religion zu tun haben \n\nWeil \nSeine \nSeine Meinung über die gleichgeschlechtliche Ehe ist eigentlich \nIch denke, sie stimmt überein mit seiner Meinung über die Abtreibung \nUnd \nStammzellenforschung, die \nUm \nIch denke, die meisten Gründe, die ich gehört habe, haben zumindest im Fernsehen und so, sind moralische Gründe \nUnd \nDie Moral ist nicht etwas, das man verhandeln kann \nAber \nEs ist etwas, das sich von Mensch zu Mensch unterscheidet \nUnd \nUm die Moral einer bestimmten Gruppe in Amerika anzuerkennen, während man die Kultur und \nUm \nMoralbegriffe aller anderen ignorieren ist unethisch \nUm \nZu gehen und sich den Moralbegriffen einer bestimmten religiösen Gruppe anzuschließen, ohne die Kultur und \nUm \nMoralbegriffe aller anderen zu berücksichtigen, ist in der Regierung eine Änderung zu machen, die gleichgeschlechtliche Ehe

Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but it's so different and there are so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same. It's just like two different sides of the same coin; heads will never be tails. But it's like the same thing, and there are a lot of civil rights that come with it, like property taxes and the whole healthcare thing, where your primary or next of kin can't even be in the room with you if you're sick. It's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone and lots of scientific studies have been done, and homosexual couples have the same kind of success rates as heterosexual couples. They have the same factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction. It's just a relationship, it's the same thing. I think where a lot of people get hung up is that homosexuals aren't asking for the right to get married in a church, they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. And if there's no involvement with church and state, then that shouldn't be an issue. I don't understand where people, like Catholics, get hung up on saying it's against our religion and that's morally wrong for us and we can't approve of that sort of thing. But in a legal sense, if you're allowing someone a civil union, why not allow them a marriage? It's like segregation, separate but unequal. Yes, they are the same in many ways, like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that. People worry about adoption issues and community issues, like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community. And especially about children of gay couples and how they'll adjust to society, and whether or not they'll be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation, or not. But again, it's kind of new and stuff, but it's kind of hard to say I'm not sure about the children aspect about adoption, because I think the main drawback to that is how children get treated by their peers and by other adults in society. Like in New York City, I know they have special schools for children of gay parents, because in public schools in New York City they get beaten up and stuff like that. Parents protest to get the child removed from their school, and it's just a kid, I mean they're going to have the same points of view and everything, parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. And so they can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to, it's just about personality choices. I think the federal government should be very involved in this issue, making gay marriage legal in every state, I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But I think President Bush has very strong views of his own to do with his religion. Well, his take on gay marriage actually goes along with his take on abortion and stem cell research, which I think most of the reasons I've heard at least in the news and stuff are moral reasons, and morality I don't want to say it's negotiable, but it definitely differs from person to person. And to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and morality concepts of all the rest is unethical. To just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account the culture and morality of all the rest is hypocritical of the government, considering the recent controversy, considering I mean about under God in the pledge of allegiance and how people are so opposed to that, but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country. Just one, lots of people are anti-gay and anti-gay-marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged, and the gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents, or just a personality defect. And that is also not a good reason, because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is, and if people listened to institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends, and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church, then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently. Nope. [/REWRITE]",

an denen ich immer aufgezogen war \nLeute tragen Jeans und Khakishosen \nNa, auch Khakishosen sind schön \nAber einfach viel lockerer im Vergleich dazu \nWas anderes ist \nDas ist das größte, was ich

angesprochen hat, die mit Pädophilie zu tun haben, denken Sie, dass dies hätte verhindert werden können, wenn die Kirche zum Beispiel weibliche Priester zulassen oder die Priester heiraten lassen würde?]\nIch denke, dass diese Dinge nicht vermieden werden konnten \nWeil es Männer gibt, die verheiratet sind \nUnd sie werden trotzdem Pädophile \nUnd sie haben trotzdem Eine Anziehung zu jungen Kindern \nAlso denke ich, selbst wenn man sie verheiratet, ist es einfach die Person, es ist nicht, weil sie verheiratet sind oder nicht verheiratet \nIch denke auch, dass, wenn sie Priester werden, es ihre Entscheidung ist, Priester zu werden \nEs gibt Religionen, bei denen sie heiraten können \nWie auf Seventh Heaven, ich weiß nicht, was für ein Typ, er ist ein Reverend oder ein Minister oder

September 2001 betäubt fühlte und ich denke, dass wir in den Irak als Vorwand gingen, es gab Vorwände, die uns in den Irak führten \nIch denke, dass die Bush-Administration zu Beginn die Irak-Krieg mit Osama Bin Laden und den Angriffen am 11. September 2001 in Verbindung brachte und behauptete, dass Saddam Hussein Massenvernichtungswaffen besaß, alles was sich als falsch erwies \nUnd das störte mich sehr, und im Allgemeinen boilt der Irak-Krieg in mir Blut \n\nZum \nEs scheint mir so, dass die Bush-Administration sich sehr offen gegenüber dem amerikanischen Volk belogen hat und noch immer nicht zugegeben hat \n Selbst Colin Powell, ich meine, nachdem er von seiner großen Präsentation bei den UN zurückgekehrt ist, sagt jetzt, dass er sich damals nicht von den Beweisen überzeugt war, selbst als er sie präsentierte \nUnd \nFür mich ist das Vorsatz im Amt, ich denke, das ist ein Abgeordnetenvergehen, das eine Amtsenthebung rechtfertigt, um sich so gegenüber dem amerikanischen Volk zu belügen \nIch denke, dass die Bush-Administration eine völlige Missachtung der Verfassung hat und sie seit dem 11. September immer daran gearbeitet hat, sie zu marginalisieren \nIch denke, dass sie \nZum \nSie kamen in das Amt mit der Absicht, Krieg zu führen \n\nZum \nDer letzte Teil \n\nIch vergesse den Namen des \nZum \nDes Finanzministers, der in seinem Buch diese Behauptung in der Tat aufgestellt hat, nachdem er wahrscheinlich aus seinem Amt geworfen wurde \nZum \nIch denke, der jüngere Bush hatte eine Art von Blutgier gegen Saddam Hussein, weil seine Vorgänger-Administration und ich denke, dass er hoffte, unsere Energieversorgung in der langen Frist zu erweitern \nWas auch eine sehr hinterhältige Art ist, Dinge zu machen \n\nAlso \nIch denke, sie hätten schon lange genug Zeit gehabt \nIch denke, es gäbe Probleme, wenn wir jetzt zurückziehen würden, denn es besteht eine gute Chance, dass das Land in einen Bürgerkrieg geraten würde und noch mehr Menschen würden sterben \nZum \nIch denke, dass die Alternative, die UN und die Vereinigten Staaten derzeit in Erwägung ziehen, sich so anhört wie \nEine Koalition von Nationen aus der Umgebung wie Syrien und Saudi-Arabien, um Ordnung wiederherzustellen \nAber ich weiß nicht unbedingt, dass das eine gute Idee ist, weil ich denke, dass das in der langen Frist auch zu mehr Problemen führen wird, weil \nZum \nIraq's Souveränität wird zu einem großen Problem werden, weil ich denke, dass es klar ist, dass die Übergangsregierung inzwischen auseinanderbricht \n\nAus den Nachrichten, die ich gehört habe, scheint es, dass das Parlament nicht sehr effektiv ist \nZum \nOh, ich vergesse den Namen, aber der Ministerpräsident hat überhaupt kein Kontrolle über den politischen Prozess oder über das, was passiert \nUnd sogar Muqtada al-Sadr, der Mann, mit dem wir uns weniger als ein Jahr zuvor geschlagen haben \nSeine Partei hält jetzt mindestens 20 Sitz im irakischen Parlament und ich meine, wir sind noch immer mit radikalen Elementen zu tun, die um die Kontrolle der Regierung kämpfen \nUnd ich denke, dass der politische Prozess sehr viel Widerstand leidet, weil das \n\nZum \n(lacht) \nKeine, die ich in gesellschaftlichen Kreisen ausdrücken kann.\n\nEnglische Übersetzung:\n\n[REWRITE] At the beginning I was okay with the idea, but I think everyone was still reeling from the 9/11 attacks and I think we went into Iraq as a pretext - there were pretexts that led us into Iraq. I think the Bush administration initially linked the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks and claimed that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which has since been proven false. And that really rubbed me the wrong way and in general the Iraq war still boils my blood. \n\nUm, It just seems to me that the Bush administration has been very openly lying to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact. Even Colin Powell, I mean, coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it. And to me that's just malfeasance in office, I think that's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. I think the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it since 9/11, at least. I think they came into office with the intent to go to war. Um, That last part I forget the name of the Secretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office. Um, But it seems to me that the younger Bush had a kind of bloodlust against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too, which is also a very underhanded way to do things. Well, I do think it's gone on long enough, I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now because there's a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result. Um, I think the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like a coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order, but I don't necessarily know that's a good idea because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because Iraq's sovereignty will become an issue, a major issue there because I think it's pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point.

\nOk \nDanke \nUm \nAlso, ich denke \nIch denke, der Krieg sollte weitergeführt werden, weil es nicht fair ist \nIch denke nicht, dass wir es nicht mehr als einen Krieg nennen sollten \nAber weil ich denke \nDu weißt, \nIch denke, der einzige Grund, warum wir Waffen und so einsetzen, ist, um zu zeigen, dass \nDu weißt, \nWir sind groß und wir sind Amerikaner und haben diese großen Waffen \nAber ich fühle mich nicht so, als ob es einen großen Grund gibt, ihn nicht mehr als einen Krieg zu nennen \nWeil wir es nicht einmal erklärt haben \nEs sollte nicht einmal ein Krieg genannt werden, weil es nie von dem Kongress erklärt wurde \nIch denke, das ist die ganze Sache \nMan muss einen Krieg mit dem Kongress deklarieren \nUnd dann ist \nIch denke, es ist nicht ein großer Punkt, noch länger dort zu bleiben und zu versuchen \nTatsächlich nicht \nIch denke, es ist ein Punkt, dort zu bleiben und ihnen zu helfen \nAber es ist auch wie das Verschwendung unserer Ressourcen \nUnd besonders jetzt fühle ich so schlecht für Bush, weil es ihm wie \nEs macht ihn zu einem der schlechtesten Präsidenten der USA aussehen, weil von dem, was es tut, und wie es ist \nUnd was es ist, weil es ihnen an \nDenk an \nIch denke, mit der ganzen Sache Vietnam \nDer Vietnamkrieg war ein nicht deklariertes Krieg und jetzt wird er als sinnloser Krieg bezeichnet \nUnd er sagt, dass er für immer als Präsident dieser sinnlosen Krieg gefühlt wird \nAlso \nHast du das in 30 Minuten gemacht? \nUh \nOk, ja \nUm \nHuh \nIch denke, man könnte auch sagen, dass es ist \nEs ist schwierig zu sagen, dass ich will, dass der Krieg endet, weil es so viele Familien gibt, deren Söhne und Töchter im Irak sind und es ist, als ob ich will, dass er weitergeht, weil ich weiß, dass \nDiese Leute dort haben Leben, und wir haben ihnen das Leben verdorben, weil wir jetzt \nIch denke, einige der Kinder haben vielleicht nicht einmal einen Ort, um zur Schule zu gehen, \nWeil es so gefährlich ist und diese verschiedenen kleinen Gruppen im Irak, die sich gegenseitig töteten, nur wegen der verschiedenen Überzeugungen, die sie haben \nAber dann wieder \nEs ist, als ob \nEs ist schwer zu sagen \nIch will sie dort, aber es ist, als ob sie eine so andere Kultur haben als wir, wenn wir dort bleiben, versuchen wir, sie mehr und mehr in eine zweite Vereinigte Staaten zu formen \nDann wird es noch schlimmer für sie werden \nUnd es wird sein \nAls ob ich fühle, dass der ganze Al-Kaida-Thing nur noch mehr wachsen wird und das Hass der Vereinigten Staaten werden wachsen, weil wir jetzt versuchen, sie zu ändern \nUnd sie waren schon so lange an diesem totalitären \nWie einem totalitären Regime \nSie haben sich so lange mit diesem Diktatorismus abgefunden \nDu weißt, \nIch fühle mich so, als ob es uns am Ende schaden wird, wenn wir versuchen, sie zu ändern \nAlso denke ich, diese ganze Sache wird noch Jahre und Jahre und Jahre andauern \nHmm \nDas ist alles \nOk \n\nNow, I'll translate the German text back to English:\n\n[REWRITE]I was thinking \nMmhmm \nShould I just talk about it?

\nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and it's a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd it's \nAnd it's \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn't \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn't like it wasn't a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there's going to be a large number of insurgents and it's hard to put them down when when you're not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou're fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn't have gotten into the war because I'm against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we're still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we're still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and the Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it's a long process and I just think that \nThat the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren't prepared themselves but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn't \nWe're kinda \nWe're naive for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIt's just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet's see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that's \nNo that's \nNo that's a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIt's really hard cause once you go in there and we've been in there for so long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we're the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbandon them now so \nSo it's probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to its finish but them again there's also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we're \nIf we're \nIf we're invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren't we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil factor\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it's usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don't think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet's see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not",

Yeah, I feel hypocritical talking about it, I mean, I hate to say it, you know. I hate joining the bandwagon of people who are like, \"I was against it from the beginning.\" I was against it, but it's not that important anymore because the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea, except within the administration because they don't want to admit that they were wrong. And you just have to look at the recent polls. They've done US polls, Iraqi polls, global polls, and I mean no, about seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population thinks that it was a bad idea. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of the troops that are over there, like the US troops that are over there right now, think it was a stupid idea and that we should pull out within the year. I don't know, it's just been a complete disaster from before we even came in. It was already a disaster and now pulling out is also going to be a disaster. There's really no easy way to go about anything involving the Middle East anymore. I mean, I think it's just the culture clash between the United States and the Middle Eastern states. I mean, it's just too big a gap and for this administration, or previous administrations, to understand. They think they can just bring democracy into an area where it shouldn't exist, like that's not the way that this totally different group of people would choose to run their lives. I mean, sure, Saddam was a bad guy, I don't think anyone's disputing that. But you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's going to turn into just a complete disaster, like quicksand from when we went over there. I don't even know what to say about it. I don't really see a reason at all to stay in there. I mean, I'm sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it's better to stay in there, and you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out, I don't agree with them. I've yet to hear a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should. I mean, if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year, I guess I wouldn't really have a problem with that. But, I just don't see a reason why we shouldn't just leave now. I mean, I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now. And these are the people that we're trying to save, that we're trying to help. They're telling us to leave. I think they might know better than that. And at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes, then we know it's not on us if something happens. If it completely goes to hell, we could be like, well, we were going to stay in, but you guys made the decision not to, and then we'll at least... I mean, if we decide to help out after that, we'll at least be the good guys. Kind of. Not really, no. We'll never be the good guys in the Middle East.

    "transformed": "It's just that we only have this and then one more time to talk about the Iraq War. Yeah, I feel hypocritical talking about it, I mean, I hate to say it, you know. I hate joining the bandwagon of people who are like, \"I was against it from the beginning.\" I was against it, but it's not that important anymore because the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea, except within the administration because they don't want to admit that they were wrong. And you just have to look at the recent polls. They've done US polls, Iraqi polls, global polls, and I mean no, about seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population thinks that it was a bad idea. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of the troops that are over there, like the US troops that are over there right now, think it was a stupid idea and that we should pull out within the year. I don't know, it's just been a complete disaster from before we even came in. It was already a disaster and now pulling out is also going to be a disaster. There's really no easy way to go about anything involving the Middle East anymore. I mean, I think it's just the culture clash between the United States and the Middle Eastern states. I mean, it's just too big a gap and for this administration, or previous administrations, to understand. They think they can just bring democracy into an area where it shouldn't exist, like that's not the way that this totally different group of people would choose to run their lives. I mean, sure, Saddam was a bad guy, I don't think anyone's disputing that. But you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's going to turn into just a complete disaster, like quicksand from when we went over there. I don't even know what to say about it. I don't really see a reason at all to stay in there. I mean, I'm sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it's better to stay in there, and you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out, I don't agree with them. I've yet to hear a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should. I mean, if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year, I guess I wouldn't really have a problem with that. But, I just don't see a reason why we shouldn't just leave now. I mean, I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now. And these are the people that we're trying to save, that we're trying to help. They're telling us to leave. I think they might know better than that. And at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes, then we know it's not on us if something happens. If it completely goes to hell, we could be like, well, we were going to stay in, but you guys made the decision not to, and then we'll at least... I mean, if we decide to help out after that, we'll at least be the good guys. Kind of. Not really, no. We'll never be the good guys in the Middle East.

They decriminalized it, which means they no longer considered it a crime. It got knocked down from a criminal offense to more like a traffic ticket; you know, something you get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all that. And I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it, you know, for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that, the types of ramifications which are usually the worst of having a drug charge would. I mean, usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge. Depending on the charge, at least for a marijuana charge, one thing that a lot of kids worry about, a lot of people worry about, are the future ramifications, and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized. But at the same time, there’s an argument that it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them, and to house them and then to let them go, and to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times, and appoint a public defender, and then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges. I mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do. When you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, I mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession, even if it would free up a lot of money for then. Like a lot of communities are rightfully against marijuana that they don’t want to do that. But in a place like Denver, where people tend to be more open-minded, I have to use the word liberal, but you know what I mean, kind of on the open-minded track, then I think it’s totally fine, and I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education, that they can spend on social programs for the elderly, and that they can spend on food programs for homeless people. I mean, so I think it’s important because marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and about everywhere. I mean, there are a lot of reasons why it shouldn’t necessarily be legalized, not just financial. Other reasons why it shouldn’t necessarily be legalized. Well no, I mean I, I don’t know how I would feel about, well, if it were totally legal, I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere. Then I mean, I guess a lot of people would be smoking and driving. And it’s still like taboo in our society, in a lot of places and a lot of contexts, uh, to smoke marijuana. So, to have it out in the open like that, I feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people. I mean, alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills, but I think marijuana has a more negative impact on a lot of people’s lives, as opposed to just their decision making and motor skills. I mean, but they both have their negative effects, and I mean, when it comes to substances in general, like no two people really react the same way, I mean, and then people, some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go with everything they have, and then some people know how to exercise moderation, and then some people don’t. So, I guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance, when people react differently. But I definitely think that they both have their own negative effects. Um, yeah, uh, no, I don’t. [/REWRITE]",

I mean, usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge. Depending on the charge, at least for a marijuana charge, one thing that a lot of kids worry about, a lot of people worry about, are the future ramifications, and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized. But at the same time, there’s an argument that it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them, and to house them and then to let them go, and to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times, and appoint a public defender, and then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges. I mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do. When you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, I mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession, even if it would free up a lot of money for then. Like a lot of communities are rightfully against marijuana that they don’t want to do that. But in a place like Denver, where people tend to be more open-minded, I have to use the word liberal, but you know what I mean, kind of on the open-minded track, then I think it’s totally fine, and I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education, that they can spend on social programs for the elderly, and that they can spend on food programs for homeless people. I mean, so I think it’s important because marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and about everywhere. I mean, there are a lot of reasons why it shouldn’t necessarily be legalized, not just financial. Other reasons why it shouldn’t necessarily be legalized. Well no, I mean I, I don’t know how I would feel about, well, if it were totally legal, I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere. Then I mean, I guess a lot of people would be smoking and driving. And it’s still like taboo in our society, in a lot of places and a lot of contexts, uh, to smoke marijuana. So, to have it out in the open like that, I feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people. I mean, alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills, but I think marijuana has a more negative impact on a lot of people’s lives, as opposed to just their decision making and motor skills. I mean, but they both have their negative effects, and I mean, when it comes to substances in general, like no two people really react the same way, I mean, and then people, some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go with everything they have, and then some people know how to exercise moderation, and then some people don’t. So, I guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance, when people react differently. But I definitely think that they both have their own negative effects. Um, yeah, uh, no, I don’t.",

Let's see how I see it. In my opinion, Myspace is a public thing, and a bulletin. You know, if you look at that definition, then you know that's just enough reason to post for the public to see or for others to see. Whatever you're trying to get at. And now if you post that on the internet, you know you have to realize that people will see that, whether it be school officials or not. So, in my opinion, I feel as though the school officials seeing that, they had every right to see it. Because even if they weren't doing it under the school's name, they could have still accessed that through their homes. But, uh, yeah, with something preventing a school shooting, you know, as long as it saves the lives of students, which is a responsibility of the school system, I think that's perfectly fine. Let me see here. Like, you know, if they go on to the internet like on Myspace just to see if students are drinking or smoking or doing stuff they're not supposed to be doing, they go there just specifically to catch students and get them in trouble. And I feel as though that is an invasion of privacy. But I feel as though, you know, as long as they save lives, or make the school a better and safer place, I don't think that's an invasion at all. Should I elaborate more on that?\n\nYeah, I mean, okay. Well, it's a lot easier to express yourself when you're writing. But\n\nOkay, well, I mean, like what I was saying, it is a public thing, and with a student posting something on Myspace and not expecting to get in trouble, that's ridiculous. I mean, everything, like I'm worried to post stuff like even through emails, like if I have something not good about somebody to say I don't ever say that on an email because I'm afraid someone will pick that up and you know, everything like everything nowadays comes back and bites you in the butt, I guess you could say.\n\nLike, you know, if you do something while you're a college student, then you grow up to be some important guy, they'll like find an email that you sent somehow, and like, once it's on the internet, it's always on the internet, and you know, if you do something like that, there's no way of getting out of it, you will get in trouble.

You know, when parents drop their students off at school, they feel as though they're dropping them off at a safe place. I've actually discussed that with a teacher of mine, I went to a public high school, and they said, you know, we have to ensure stuff like this because, like, we would do like lockdowns and stuff and, uh, that's in reference to the terrorist attacks, uh, we had to be safe about that, we had like drill stuff, and even though that doesn't have anything to that doesn't have anything to do with the school shooting, because, uh, that was in case people would come into the building, I guess. So we, you know, we did practice that stuff in order to make the school safer, and that's just what the school officials were doing in this case, they were just making it a safer place, preventing anything bad from happening, like Columbine or something like that.

Um, I think that since it was such an emotional thing that happened, we overlooked a lot of things and didn't really think about the long-term consequences. And we kind of just went over there unprepared, without a plan. Um, I think it backfired on us. Um, I don't know, I was for it, but now I'm very against it, I don't think it achieved anything. Um, I think the people over there, as long as they're fighting with each other, they can't be fighting with us as well.

So I really don't care, um, I don't know, we definitely went over there unprepared, we didn't know what we were going to face over there.

And I think that would be fine for us, I think we should just leave and that's it. Um, we just, I think we were just more hyped up than anything, I don't think we were thinking rationally about what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle and um, I just, we pretty much just went over there looking for revenge, I think and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened. And um, also I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq.
