Translation of the German text:\n[REWRITE] I think the Catholic Church needs to change in some ways, their views. Many people have talked about how the Catholic Church is losing some of its followers and I think it's because the Catholic Church isn't very accepting of many things. In the case of gay marriages, in the case of abortion, in the case of birth control, such things. I think the Catholic Church has very strong views on them, which is fine, but they have somewhat old-fashioned views in some ways. So I think if they would adapt to maybe a bit newer style of thinking, they wouldn't be worried about losing their followers. I've heard that many people are starting to turn away from the Catholic Church a bit because of their view on these situations. And many people are starting to disagree with them on certain subjects. So I feel that they feel the Catholic Church has the wrong view on things. Yeah, I mean the Catholic Church is against abortion, so if you are for abortion, you might not be happy in a community where that is taught as completely wrong and you are against it.

    "original": "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would

sind \nSie sind in vielen Hinsichten gleich, wie die Art der Beziehung, die verschiedene Partner spielen und so weiter \nUnd \nLeute befürchten, dass es Probleme mit der Adoption gibt \nUnd

werden \n\nWie in New York City weiß ich sie \nNun \nSie haben besondere Schulen für Kinder von homosexuellen Eltern \nWeil \nIn öffentlichen Schulen in New York City werden sie wie geprügelt \nUnd

Because many people believe that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but that's just so different, and there are so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same. It's just like two different sides of the same coin. Heads will never be tails, but it's like the same thing. And there are so many civil rights that go along with it, like property taxes and the whole healthcare thing where your partner can't be in the room with you if you're sick, and can't visit because they're not technically family. And I think that's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. And many scientific studies have been done because it's a hot topic these days, and homosexual couples have the same kind of rates of success, they have the same factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do. It's just it's a relationship, it's the same thing. And I think where a lot of people get hung up is that homosexuals aren't asking for the right to get married in a church, they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. And if there's no involvement with church and state, then that shouldn't be an issue. Because I don't understand how people like Catholics can get hung up on \"oh, well, that's against our religion and that's morally wrong for us and we can't approve of that sort of thing,\" but in a legal sense, if you're allowing someone a civil union, why not a marriage. It's like segregation, separate but unequal. Yes, they are, they're the same in many ways, like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that. And people worry about adoption issues, and community issues, like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community. And especially about children of gay couples and how they'll adjust to society, and whether or not they'll be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation choices or not, but well again it's kind of new and stuff, but it's kind of hard to say I'm not sure about the children aspect about adoption because I think the main drawback to that is how children get treated by their peers and by other adults in society. Like in New York City, I know they have special schools for children of gay parents because in public schools in New York City they get beaten up and stuff like that, parents protest to get the child removed from their school, and it's just a kid, I mean they're gonna have the same points of view and everything, parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. And so they can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to, I mean it's just about personality choices. I think the federal government should be very involved in this issue making gay marriage legal in every state, I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But well I think President Bush has very strong views of his own to do with his religion. Well, his take on gay marriage actually um is I think it goes along with his take on abortion and stem cell research which um I think most of the reasons I'm not sure about this because honestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot but most of the reasons I've heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons, and morality I don't want to say it's negotiable but it definitely differs from person to person and to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and morality concepts of all the rest is unethical to just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account to go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy considering I mean about under God in the pledge of allegiance and how people are so opposed to that but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country. Just one lots of people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged and the gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents or just a personality defect and that is also not a good reason because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is and if people listened to institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently.

Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there

mehr von einem \nVerlust in Vietnam, weil \nWeil \nUm \nWeil es \nEs weil es gibt es gibt \nUnabhängig davon, wie viele Menschen möglicherweise den US gewollt haben, in den Irak zu kommen und

nicht in den Krieg gegangen sein sollten, weil ich bin dagegen in fast allen Fällen und \nAber wenn Sie zu Krieg mit dem Land haben, müssen Sie sich auf alle möglichen Ergebnisse vorbereiten \nIch denke, dass die Regierung nicht so vorbereitet war wie sie sollte haben \nIch meine schlimmer \nUnd \nEigentlich für das, was \nEigentlich nicht vorhersehen, was passieren würde, wenn sie die irakische Regierung entfernt und \nIch meine, wir sind noch da heute und fast Ende 2006 und wir sind immer noch \nUm \nViele amerikanische Soldaten sterben immer noch und \nUnd es ist immer noch versuchen, die irakischen Truppen und die irakischen \nUnd die irakischen Polizeikräfte zu trainieren, damit sie ihre eigene Nation polizeieren können und es ist ein langer Prozess und ich denke einfach, dass \nDas die US-Regierung in einer Weise versucht, \nNicht vorbereitet waren, aber in einer Weise versucht, die amerikanischen Leute zu täuschen, sie zu glauben, es wäre ein \nEin \nEin

meine Meinung, ich vermute, in der Wahl \nWie der Präsidentschaftswahl 2004, als ich überlegte, wer ich wählen würde, wenn ich wählen könnte, und einer \nUm \nEiner der Gründe, warum ich wahrscheinlich George Bush wählen würde, war, ihm zu lassen, was er begonnen hatte und \nUnd also \nEs ist schwer, weil, sobald du hineingehst, sind wir da schon so lange und wie können wir diese Leute verlassen \nIch meine, wir sind diejenigen, die ihre Regierung und \nUnd \nUnd ihren Lebensstil genommen haben, also wie können wir sie jetzt verlassen \nVerlassen sie so \nAlso ist es wahrscheinlich etwas, das wir \n(coughs)\nEntschuldigung \nVersuchen, es zu Ende zu bringen, aber gleichzeitig gibt es die Erwägung des astronomischen Anteils an amerikanischen Verlusten und \nUnd \nUnd wie \nUnd wie viel ist zu viel zu riskieren für \nFür einen frei demokratischen Irak \nIch meine \nZurück zur ganzen Begründung für den Irak-Angriff \nIch meine, wenn wir \nWenn wir \nWenn wir den Irak angriffen und es zu einer demokratischen Nation machten, warum machen wir es nicht mit allen diesen anderen Ländern und ich denke, der große Grund dafür ist \nIst das \nIst das Öl \nUnd das ist unser Öl \nUnd es ist meistens alles über Geld und Ressourcen, \nIch meine, weil eine andere Voraussetzung vor dem Krieg war, dass der Irak Waffen von Massenvernichtungswaffen hatten \nUnd keine

It's a personal preference and something that's been proven to be biological rather than sociological, so people shouldn't have fewer rights just because something is not in their control. It's inhumane to do so. I've always been an advocate for gay marriage. \n\nI don't think there's any reason for politics and government to be involved in this. It's not even on the state level, it's a personal level, it's a family level. You know in my neighborhood at home, there are probably two or three openly gay couples, not married or anything because they're not allowed to. But they function the same way as any other family would. They walk their dogs down the street like anyone else would, and I think that with Bush trying to play God and interpret the words of marriage the way he wants to, it's ridiculous. \n\nYeah, sure. I mean I think I've read and heard from various publications and TV reports or newspapers that it's something chemical in the brain, it's something you might be predisposed to be homosexual. In contrast to growing up and you know maybe with four sisters and you're the only brother, you know you don't have a father, that has nothing to do with it. So that would be the biological side rather than sociological.\n\nWell, other than that, I guess the obvious thing is that you know in this, I think maybe because marriage is something that if a guy and a girl want to do it, they can without telling a single person run off to Las Vegas and do it, but if two gay people want to do it, it's going to be on the front page of the New York Times, you know.

On sites like MySpace, if I mean if you post information online, it's pretty much available to everyone.

If that's the case, you've accepted that person as your \"friend\" so they can see it. You're giving them permission to see your profile. So, I mean anytime you put information online, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that. So, I think it was good that someone saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost.\n\nHum, um, that's tough. Because I mean, obviously, you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everyone's different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that. But then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, \"Let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything.\" Um, I mean, I don't think it would really be right to have someone's job be to look at people's profiles. But I guess it all depends on like what situation they came across that profile or was someone just randomly looking at people's profiles and just randomly happened to see that or were they actually looking for some sort of evidence that the student was planning something. So, I don't really know.\n\nSure, um, well, like, I mean, I don't have a MySpace personally, but I have a Facebook. I do, it bothers me that I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me.

In less than a minute, and I mean, personally, I certainly wouldn't meet with someone, but I've had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names, but they IM me and they know it's me, and it's hard because you think that they know your interests, they know what you look like, sometimes if you put your class schedule, they know where you are during the day, who your friends are, they pretty much know a lot about you, all sorts of photos, and I tried to limit what I put up there, but at the same time, the whole point I think, the reason I have one is so you know I can communicate with some of my friends, I don't want to limit it too much, so it's a tricky issue because I only accept people I know, I mean, you never really know who can look at what.\n\nHum, um, well, I heard my roommate was telling me that her high school, there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having MySpace by the school, and I found that a little strange, like I wasn't sure how school officials had the power to tell their students they weren't allowed to have a MySpace.

\nUnd es kann sehr schwierig für sie sein, weil vielleicht immer ihr Traum war, bei den Kindern zu sein und sie zu erziehen und vielleicht hat die Frau eine bessere Position \nUnd es funktioniert alles in Ordnung für sie \nAber die Gesellschaft sieht das mit Verachtung \nUnd in der Modindustrie \nUm \nViele Menschen nehmen Männern nicht ernst, wenn sie heterosexuell sind \nIch weiß nicht, ob das wirklich Sinn ergibt \nAber ich denke, es ist, weil typischerweise Männer, die sich für Mode interessieren \nUm \nWie ich denke, haben andere Lebensstile \nUnd wenn du ein typischer Lebensstil hast und du ein Mann bist und du in der Modeindustrie bist \nDann sagen die Menschen, na bitte, wie kann ich wissen, ob du weißt, was Mode ist, wenn du dich um eine Frau kümmerst \nWie kannst du wissen, wie unsere Situation ist, wenn du mit diesen anderen Männern sprichst \nUnd so \nJe nach dem Bereich, in dem du arbeitest \nIch denke, dass es in der Gesellschaft in den USA definitiv eine Geschlechterdiskriminierung gibt. \nUnd es ist schwer, sie zu ändern, weil \nDie Gesellschaft hat eine vorprogrammierte Einstellung und offensichtlich haben wir uns von den 1800ern bis hin zu heute viel weiterentwickelt \nAber der Wandel ist langsam, also denke ich, dass wir weiterhin auf unserem Tempo bleiben müssen, weil Frauen in höhere Positionen aufsteigen und CEO werden und sie in der Geschäftswelt akzeptiert werden und es ist ein langsamer Prozess \nUnd es passiert, und Menschen beginnen, es mehr anzunehmen \nUnd wenn Männer zu Hause bleiben, um die Kinder zu betreuen \nDann wird es auch akzeptiert, weil sie merken, na ja, vielleicht hat die Frau eine bessere Position oder sie will diejenige sein, die arbeitet \nUnd um \nDann sagen die Leute, okay, vielleicht hören sie ihre Freundinnen oder ihre Frauen, und so wissen sie, woher ich komme \nUnd also musst du es auf eine Weise fördern, indem du die positiven Qualitäten der Menschen, die stereotyp gegenübergestellt werden, hervorhebst \nAber nicht zu sehr drängend \nAber indem du die Qualitäten von ihnen sagst \nWenn du es zu schnell machst, werden die Leute sich wehren \nUnd ich denke, wir sind auf einem guten Weg, wo es allmählich akzeptiert wird \nAlso weiß ich nicht, ob es etwas gibt, was wir tun könnten, was nicht schon getan wird, weil wenn du es zu schnell machst, wird man sich wehren \nUnd wir sind uns schon weit vorgearbeitet und der Wandel braucht Zeit \nJa \nUm \nDie Menschen werden vermutlich auch voneinander diskriminiert, je nachdem, welcher Job du hast oder woher du kommst \nWenn du auf einem Bauernhof aufgewachsen bist und deine Grammatik vielleicht nicht so gut ist, aber du sehr intelligent bist und du dich \nWenn du dich hinarbeitest und dich in eine CEO-Position hocharbeitest \nObwohl du vielleicht nicht die beste Grammatik hast \nOder obwohl du intelligent bist, aber du hast nicht die beste Grammatik \nDann sehen andere Männer dich herablassend an und sagen, na bitte, wie kann ich wissen, ob du wirklich weißt, was du sagst, wenn du Verb und Nomen nicht einmal richtig zusammenstellen kannst \nAlso \nJa \nAlso, manchmal wird man von dem Ort, wo man herkommt, diskriminiert \nUnd wie bei Geschlecht zu Geschlecht \nUnd ich weiß nicht \nIch denke, das wäre ein weiteres Beispiel \n\nEnglish Translation:  [REWRITE]\n\nYes, I think that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States. \nAnd it \nNot just with women, but \nI think it has to do with the specific field or type of work one does. \nI mean, in general, I think women have it harder because there's the so-called \"glass ceiling\" where even though there's supposed to be equality, most people have a hard time finding someone to put in a position of authority if they're a woman, just because society has been raised this way \nOnly because of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd often in the workplace, women see that there's a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all the qualifications for it, but maybe the board won't choose to promote them to that position because historically, it's not seen that women are usually in the upper echelons of the business world \nAnd I \nI think the same thing applies to men \nAnd in other industries like fashion or \nIf someone stays home to take care of the kids \nThat's really uncommon \nUm \nMen who stay home are often looked down upon because society thinks that they, the man, should be working \nHe should be the breadwinner of the family \nWhy is he staying home?

Let's see, I think that Myspace is a public thing. And a bulletin. You know, if you look at that definition, then you know, that's basically to post for the public to see or others to see, or whatever you're trying to get at. And now, if you post that on the internet, you have to realize that people will be seeing that, whether it be school officials or not. In my opinion, I feel like the school officials seeing that, they had every right to see it, because even if they weren't doing it underneath the school's name, they could have still accessed that through their homes. But, uh, yeah, with something preventing a school shooting, you know, as long as it saves the lives of students, which is a responsibility of the school system, I think that's perfectly fine. Let me see here, like, if they go on the internet like on Myspace just to see if students are drinking or smoking or doing things they're not supposed to be doing, they go there just specifically to catch students and to get them in trouble, and I feel like that's an invasion of privacy. But I feel like, you know, as long as they save you know, save lives or make the school a better and safer place, I don't think that's an invasion at all. Should I elaborate more on that? \n\nYeah, okay, well, it's a lot easier to express yourself when you're writing. Alright, well, like I was saying, it is a public thing, and with a student posting something on Myspace and not expecting to get in trouble, that's ridiculous. Everything like I'm worried to post stuff like even through emails, like if I have something not good about somebody to say I don't ever say that on an email because I'm afraid someone will pick that up and you know, everything like everything nowadays comes back and you know, it bites you in the butt, I guess you could say. \n\nLike, you know, if you do something while you're a college student then you grow up to be some important guy they will, like, find an email that you sent somehow, and once it's on the internet, it's always on the internet, and you know, if you do something like that there's no way of getting out of it, you will get in trouble, and I don't think it wasn't an invasion of privacy at all because, like I said before, and well, that's basically all I've been saying, it's a public thing, and I don't know, let's see here. \n\nLike I had said before, I don't feel like they should go on the internet just to catch students, but if they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place, then I feel like that's perfectly fine for them or other officials such as the police to go on, you know, when parents drop their students off at school, they feel like, you know, they're dropping them off at a safe place. I had actually discussed that with a teacher of mine, I went to a public high school, and they said, we have to ensure stuff like this because, like, we would do like lock downs and stuff, and that's in reference to the terrorist attacks, uh, we had to be safe about that, we had like drill stuff, and even though that doesn't have anything to do with the school shooting, I mean it kind of does have something to do with the school shooting because, uh, that was in case people would come into the building I guess, so we, you know, we did practice that stuff in order to make the school a safer place, and that's just what the school officials were doing in this case, they were just making it a safer place, preventing anything bad from happening, like Columbine or something like that, yeah, that's basically all I can come up with.

\nIch denke wirklich, dass es für uns misslungen ist \nUm \nIch weiß nicht \nIch war dafür \nAber jetzt bin ich sehr dagegen \nIch denke, dass es nichts gebracht hat \nUm \nIch denke, die Leute dort \nSolange sie sich gegenseitig bekämpfen, können sie nicht gegen uns kämpfen \nWie ich denke, dass wir dadurch dort zu sein, nichts bringt, wenn sie \nWenn sie sich selbst nicht einmal einigen können

nicht, dass sie menschlich sind \nIch weiß nicht \nWie sie sich gegenseitig bekämpfen und nicht \nSie können einfach nichts selbst tun \nAlso denke ich wirklich nicht daran, dass ich mich kümmern sollte \nUm \nIch weiß nicht \nWir sind einfach dorthin gegangen, ohne vorbereitet zu sein \nWir wussten nicht, was wir dort erwarten würden \nUm \nUnd es ist auch schlecht, weil der Krieg für sie sehr anders ist als der Krieg für uns \nSie sind einfach wie Wilde, wenn es um den Krieg geht, und ich denke nicht, dass sie daran interessiert sind, ihr Land zu verbessern \nIch denke, sie wollen nur, dass wir weg sind \nUnd ich denke, das sollte für uns okay sein \nIch denke, wir sollten einfach gehen und das ist es \nUm \nWir waren einfach nur \nIch denke, wir waren eher \nAls emotional als vernünftig, darüber nachzudenken, welche Konsequenzen dies haben könnte oder wie sie reagieren würden, wenn wir dorthin gehen und versuchen, ihr ganzes Leben zu ändern \nUm \nIch denke, wir sind

we had a clear plan or goal when we went in, and we didn’t know what we were gonna face over there \nWe definitely didn’t know what we were doing, and it’s also bad because war is a very different

their whole lifestyle \nWe pretty much just went over there looking for revenge, I think, and I think President Bush just declared war on Iraq because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened \nBut at the time I saw where he was coming from, we really didn’t have a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can’t just do that and then us just say, 'Let’s rebuild and that’s it' \nI don’t think we could have let it go, but I think we could have had a better plan of what we were gonna do, we just didn’t know what we were doing \nI don’t think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of creating order, and there was no unity, they didn’t know what they were going in there for, so I think that would have helped us out a lot more
