But President Bush has very strong views related to his religion. His views on gay marriage go along with his views on abortion and stem cell research, and most of the reasons I’ve heard are moral reasons. Morality is not always negotiable, but it differs from person to person. It’s not fair to embrace the morality of one group in America while ignoring the culture and morality of the rest. It’s not fair to go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account the whole country. It’s hypocritical for the government to create an amendment banning gay marriage considering the recent controversy over “under God” in the pledge of allegiance, and how people are opposed to that but will let laws be made that enforce religious standards on the whole country. Many people are against gay people and gay marriage because they believe they are somehow psychologically damaged. The American Psychological Association has just put out a memo saying that is untrue. If people listened to institutions that actually do research and studies on these subjects instead of their neighbors and friends, and maybe what’s popular opinion in their culture and church, then the world would be seen a little bit differently.

I think that the Bush administration completely disregards the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since September 11.

September \nAlso fühle ich mich nicht so, dass \nIch meine, ich bin nicht ein großer Anhänger des Krieges im Irak \nAlso kann ich mich nicht mit ihm beschäftigen \nIch weiß nicht die großen Details vor \nAber an diesem Punkt weiß ich, dass wir einfach nur dableiben und versuchen, dort Demokratie aufzubauen, damit es wie eine andere US-amerikanische Sache wird \nUnd dann auch, damit wir Öl und andere Ressourcen von ihnen erhalten können \nAber es gibt keinen Grund, dort zu bleiben, weil es allen Unmut bereitet \nAlso \nUnd dann, wenn wir dort bleiben, dann wird am Ende passieren, dass wir versuchen müssen, Demokratie aufzubauen, was ewig dauern wird, weil Demokratie in einem Tag nicht aufgebaut werden kann \nUnd wenn wir dann gehen, werden sie wütend auf uns sein, weil wir alles vermasselt haben und jetzt müssen sie alles wieder von vorne beginnen \nUm \nLass mich nachdenken \nAch, das ist so schwer \nDas ist das eine Themen, über das ich nichts weiß \nUm \nKrieg im Irak \nOh, das ist hart \nUh \nMmm \nIch weiß nicht \nHast du etwas anderes, worauf ich mich stützen kann? \nOkay \nDanke \nUm \nAlso, ich denke \nIch denke, der Krieg sollte weitergehen, weil es nicht fair ist \nIch denke, wir sollten ihn nicht mehr als Krieg bezeichnen \nAber weil ich denke, dass \nDu weißt \nIch denke, der einzige Grund, warum wir Waffen und so etwas benötigen, ist einfach nur, um zu zeigen, dass \nDu weißt \nDass wir groß und amerikanisch sind und so weiter und so weiter, und wir haben alle diese großen Waffen \nAber ich denke, es gibt keinen großen Grund, ihn noch als Krieg bezeichnen zu müssen \nWeil wir ihn auch nicht offiziell deklariert haben \nIch denke, das ist so, wie das ganze Ding funktioniert \nMan muss einen Krieg offiziell deklarieren \nUnd dann ist \nIch denke nicht, dass es ein größeres Problem ist, dort zu bleiben und zu versuchen, ihnen zu helfen \nAber es ist auch wie ein Verschwendung von Ressourcen \nUnd besonders jetzt fühle ich mich so schlecht für Bush, weil es ihm so aussehen lässt, als wäre er einer der schlechten Präsidenten der USA \nWeil es so \nWeil es so tut, und es ist wie \nUnd was es denen tut \nErinnere dich \nIch denke, mit dem ganzen Vietnam-Ding \nDer Vietnamkrieg war ein undeklarierter Krieg und ist jetzt ein sinnloser Krieg \nUnd er sagt, dass er so zu einem der schlechten Präsidenten werden wird \nDer diesen sinnlosen Krieg begonnen hat \nAlso \nHuh \nMuss das nicht noch eine halbe Stunde dauern? \nUh \nOkay, ja \nUm \nHuh \nIch denke, du könntest auch sagen, dass es ist \nWie es schwierig ist zu sagen, dass ich den Krieg beenden möchte, weil es so viele Familien gibt, deren Söhne und Töchter im Irak sind, und es ist so, dass ich es weiterführen möchte, weil Sie wissen, dass Sie möchten, dass sie \nDiese Menschen dort haben Leben, und wir haben sie wegen dem zerstört, weil wir jetzt \nIch wette, dass einige der Kinder nicht einmal einen Ort haben, an dem sie zur Schule gehen können \nMehr, weil es so gefährlich ist und diese verschiedenen kleinen Gruppen innerhalb des Irak, die einfach nur miteinander töten, weil sie unterschiedliche Überzeugungen haben \nAber dann wieder \nEs ist wie \nEs ist schwer zu sagen \nIch will sie dort haben, aber es ist wie, sie haben so eine andere Kultur als wir, und wenn wir dort bleiben, werden wir versuchen, sie noch mehr in eine zweite Vereinigte Staaten zu formen \nEs wird sogar noch schlimmer für sie werden \nUnd es wird \nIch denke, das ganze Al-Kaida-Ding wird einfach nur noch größer werden und ihre Hass gegen die USA wird einfach nur noch mehr wachsen, weil wir jetzt versuchen, sie zu ändern \nUnd sie haben so lange diese ganze \nEinen totalitären \nEinen ganzen Diktatur-Ding durchgeführt, dass \nDu weißt \nIch denke, es wird uns am Ende schaden, weiterhin dort zu bleiben \nAlso denke ich, das ganze Ding wird für Jahre und Jahre und Jahre weitergehen \nHmm \nDas ist es \nOkay\n\nText nach der Rückübersetzung in Englisch:\n\n[REWRITE] I was thinking \nI mean, let's just talk about this?

    "original": "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once

reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the

\nOder, was sie nicht \nEigentlich nicht Planen, was passieren würde, wenn sie die irakische Regierung ausgestoßen haben \nIch meine, wir sind immer noch da und fast am Ende von 2006 und wir sind immer noch \nErm \nViele amerikanische Soldaten sterben immer noch und \nUnd sie versuchen, die irakischen Soldaten und die irakische Polizei zu trainieren, um ihre eigene Nation zu polizieren und es ist ein langer Prozess und ich denke einfach, dass \nDass die US-Regierung auf eine Weise versucht hat \nNun, sie waren nicht vorbereitet selbst, aber auf eine Weise versucht, die amerikanischen Menschen zu täuschen, sie zu glauben, es wäre ein \nEin \nEin kurzer erfolgreicher Aufenthalt im Irak und \nIch meine wir sollten \nWir sind ein bisschen \nWir sind etwas naive, wenn wir glauben, dass es so ist, weil es braucht eine Anzahl von Jahren, um eine neue Form einer Regierung einzuführen und es zu einem Erfolg zu machen \nIch meine, in unserem eigenen Land \nDie Demokratie war ein langer

\n\nNun das \nNicht das \nNicht das ist \nNicht das ist eine schwierige Entscheidung, weil \nDas war \nNun das war so meine Meinung, ich glaube, in der Präsidentschaftswahl von 2004, als ich dachte, wer ich wählen würde, wenn ich wählen könnte und einer \nErm \nEiner meiner Gründe war, dass ich wahrscheinlich für George Bush wählen würde, um ihn zu lassen, was er begonnen hat und \nUnd so meine ich, es ist wirklich schwierig, weil man sich mal in das Land hat begeben und wir sind so lange dort, wie können wir diese Leute jetzt einfach verlassen \nIch meine wir sind die, die ihre Regierung und \nUnd \nUnd ihr Lebensstil genommen haben, wie können wir sie jetzt verlassen \nVerlassen sie jetzt so \nAlso ist es wahrscheinlich, dass wir sollten \n(coughs)\nEntschuldigung \nVersuchen, es zu

immer um Geld und Kontrolle über Ressourcen \nIch meine, weil ein weiterer Voraussetzung war, bevor wir in den Krieg eingingen, war, dass der Irak Waffen von massiver Zerstörung hatte \nUnd es wurden

Leben zu retten\n\nHum\nUm\nDas ist hart\nWeil ich meine, man kann nicht damit rechnen, dass man jemanden den ganzen Tag überwacht, um das zu verhindern\nVon jedem Schüler in der Schule\nAber dann

ich weiß nicht wirklich\n\nJa\nUm\nNun, äh\nIch meine, ich habe kein Myspace persönlich, aber ich habe ein Facebook\nIch tue\nEs ärgert mich, dass ich weiß, dass es unangenehme Leute gibt\nDie Dinge

würde ich niemals mit jemandem\nAber ich habe Leute in meinen Klassen\nDie ich ihren Benutzernamen nicht kennen\nAber sie IM mich und sie wissen, dass es ich bin\nUnd es \nEs ist schwer, weil man denkt, sie kennen ihre Interessen\nSie kennen, was man aussieht\nManchmal, wenn man seinen Zeitplan auf Myspace postet, kennen sie, wo man sich während des Tages aufhält\nWer deine Freunde sind\nSie wissen viel über dich\nAllsorten von Fotos\nUnd ich versuchte, es zu begrenzen\nAber gleichzeitig\nDie ganze Idee\nIch denke\nDer Grund, warum ich eins habe\nIst, damit ich mit einigen meiner Freunde

Privatsphäre ist\nAber ich denke\nIch weiß nicht wirklich\nWie sie die Rechte hatten, Leuten zu sagen, was sie tun dürfen\n\nDas ist die einzige andere Idee, die mir einfällt\n\nJa\n\nNow, translating this German text back to English:\n\n[REWRITE]Can I ask a question clarifying that it was prevented because someone went online and found out that it was like that\n\nO k, umm, no I don't think that's an invasion of privacy on sites such as Myspace if I mean if you post information on the internet it's pretty much available for everyone to see and I understand on Myspace you know you have to have someone else be a member in order to see someone's profile you might need to be their friend or something like that but if that's the case you've accepted that person as your \"friend\" so they can see it you're giving them permission to see your profile so I mean anytime you put information on the internet you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that so if I think that was actually good that someone saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost\n\nHum, um, that's tough because I mean obviously you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody's different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that but then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think O let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything um I mean I don't think it would really be right to go and have someone's job be to look at people's profiles but I guess it all depends on like what situation they came across that profile or was someone just randomly looking at people's and just randomly happened to see that or were they actually looking for some sort of evidence that the student was planning something so I don't really know\n\nYeah, um well, I mean I I don't have a Myspace personally but I have a Facebook I do it bothers me that I know that there are creepy people out there who can see things about me and I saw something on TV once that was about this this man who just he was just trying to prove how he can get information so easily and he went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in less than a minute and got her to meet with him and I mean personally I certainly wouldn't meet with someone but I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names but they IM me and they know that it's me and it's hard because you think that they know your interests they know what you look like sometimes if you put your class schedule they know where you are during the day who your friends are they pretty much know a lot about you all sorts of photos and I tried to limit what I put up there but at the same time the whole point I think the reason I have one is so you know I can communicate with some of my friends I don't want to limit it too much so it's a tricky issue because I only accept people I know I mean you never really know who can look at what so\n\nHum, uh, well I heard my roommate was telling me that her um high school she there was this whole issue about how students were banned from

    "transformed": "Can I ask a question clarifying that it was prevented because someone went online and found out that it was like that\n\nO k, umm, no I don't think that's an invasion of privacy on sites such as Myspace if I mean if you post information on the internet it's pretty much available for everyone to see and I understand on Myspace you know you have to have someone else be a member in order to see someone's profile you might need to be their friend or something like that but if that's the case you've accepted that person as your \"friend\" so they can see it you're giving them permission to see your profile so I mean anytime you put information on the internet you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that so if I think that was actually good that someone saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost\n\nHum, um, that's tough because I mean obviously you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody's different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that but then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think O let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything um I mean I don't think it would really be right to go and have someone's job be to look at people's profiles but I guess it all depends on like what situation they came across that profile or was someone just randomly looking at people's and just randomly happened to see that or were they actually looking for some sort of evidence that the student was planning something so I don't really know\n\nYeah, um well, I mean I I don't have a Myspace personally but I have a Facebook I do it bothers me that I know that there are creepy people out there who can see things about me and I saw something on TV once that was about this this man who just he was just trying to prove how he can get information so easily and he went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in less than a minute and got her to meet with him and I mean personally I certainly wouldn't meet with someone but I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names but they IM me and they know that it's me and it's hard because you think that they know your interests they know what you look like sometimes if you put your class schedule they know where you are during the day who your friends are they pretty much know a lot about you all sorts of photos and I tried to limit what I put up there but at the same time the whole point I think the reason I have one is so you know I can communicate with some of my friends I don't want to limit it too much so it's a tricky issue because I only accept people I know I mean you never really know who can look at what so\n\nHum, uh, well I heard my roommate was telling me that her um high school she there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school and that struck me as a little bit strange like I wasn't sure how high school officials had the power to tell their students that they weren't allowed to have a Myspace and I don't know if that's really a privacy issue but I think I don't really know how they had the right to tell people that's the only other thought I can think of \n\nYes",

    "raw_output": "Ich werde das Text in Deutsch übersetzen:\n\nJa, ich denke, dass Diskriminierung aufgrund des Geschlechts immer noch ein Problem in den USA ist. \n\nNicht nur bei Frauen, nein, ich denke, es hat auch mit dem bestimmten Bereich der Arbeit zu tun, in dem man sich befindet. \n\nIch meine, im Allgemeinen denke ich, dass Frauen es schwerer haben, weil es den \"Glashof\" gibt, wo auch noch die Gleichberechtigung vorgesehen ist, aber die meisten Menschen haben Schwierigkeiten, jemanden, der eine Frau ist, zu überblicken, wenn sie ein Mann ist. \n\nWeil die Gesellschaft so lange so aufgebaut ist. \n\nUnd oft, in der Arbeitswelt, sehen Frauen, dass es einen Job gibt, den sie erreichen können, und sie haben alle Qualifikationen dafür, aber vielleicht wird ihnen aufgrund der Geschichte nicht die Beförderung zu dieser Position gewährt, weil die Gesellschaft noch nicht daran gewöhnt ist, dass Frauen in der oberen Führungsebene der Geschäftswelt zu finden sind. \n\nUnd, ich denke, das gleiche gilt auch für Männer. \n\nIn bestimmten Branchen wie Mode oder bei der Aufzucht der Kinder zu Hause ist es wirklich ungewöhnlich, dass ein Mann zu Hause bleibt und sich um die Kinder kümmert. \n\nUnd oft wird man ihn runtermachen, weil die Gesellschaft denkt, dass ein Mann immer arbeiten und Geld verdienen sollte, warum bleibt er zu Hause? \n\nUnd das kann sehr schwierig für sie sein, weil vielleicht immer ihre Traum war, sich um die Kinder zu kümmern und sie zu erziehen, und die Frau hat eine bessere Arbeit. \n\nUnd es funktioniert, aber die Gesellschaft runtermacht es. \n\nIn der Modebranche ist es oft so, dass man nicht ernst nehmen wird, wenn ein Mann gerade ist und sich für Mode interessiert. \n\nIch weiß nicht, ob das Sinn ergibt, aber ich denke, es ist wegen der Tatsache, dass Männer, die sich für Mode interessieren, oft ein anderes Lebensstil haben. \n\nAlso, wenn du ein typischer Lebensstil hast und ein Mann bist und dich für Mode interessierst, dann denken die Leute, wie kann ich wissen, ob du wirklich weißt, was Mode ist, wenn es für Frauen ist? \n\nDu kannst sie nicht wirklich verstehen, wenn du nicht weißt, was unser Fall ist, wie der Fall der anderen Jungs. \n\nUnd abhängig davon, welcher Bereich der Arbeit du bist, denke ich, dass es in der Gesellschaft in den USA sicherlich Diskriminierung aufgrund des Geschlechts gibt. \n\nEs ist schwer, es zu ändern, weil die Gesellschaft eine festgefahrene Einstellung hat und wir haben es langsam aber sicher geschafft, seit den 1800er Jahren große Fortschritte zu machen. \n\nAber der Wandel ist langsam. \n\nWenn wir also weiterhin auf der gleichen Rate vorankommen, weil Frauen in höhere Positionen aufsteigen und als CEO's arbeiten und sie werden immer akzeptierter in der Geschäftswelt, ist es ein langer Prozess. \n\nAber es geschieht und die Leute beginnen, es mehr anzunehmen. \n\nUnd wie Männer, die zu Hause bleiben, um die Kinder zu erziehen, wird es auch immer akzeptierter, weil sie realisieren, dass die Frau vielleicht die bessere Arbeit hat oder die, die arbeiten möchte. \n\nUnd in der Modebranche werden sie vielleicht sagen, \"Oh, warten Sie, sie hören vielleicht ihren Freundinnen oder ihrer Frau zu, und also wissen sie, wovon ich spreche.\" \n\nAlso, man muss es vielleicht fördern, indem man die guten Eigenschaften der Menschen zeigt, die aufgrund der Stereotypen diskriminiert werden, ohne zu sehr aufdringlich zu sein. \n\nWenn man es zu sehr aufdringlich macht, werden die Leute sich wehren. \n\nUnd ich denke, wir sind jetzt in einem guten Gleichgewicht, wo es beginnt, auf diese Weise durchzudringen. \n\nAlso, ich weiß nicht, ob es jetzt etwas gibt, was wir tun können, ohne dass es bereits getan wird, weil wenn man es zu schnell macht, werden die Leute sich wehren. \n\nUnd wir haben es langsam aber sicher geschafft und der Wandel braucht Zeit. \n\nJa, und... \n\nWeitere Diskriminierung gibt es auch zwischen den Geschlechtern, je nachdem, welcher Bereich der Arbeit du bist oder woher du kommst. \n\nWenn du auf einem Bauernhof aufgewachsen bist und deine Grammatik nicht so gut ist, aber du extrem intelligent bist und dich durch harte Arbeit hochgearbeitet hast, um CEO zu werden, dann werden andere Männer dich runtermachen, weil sie sagen, dass sie nicht weiß, ob du wirklich, was du sagst, wenn du nicht einmal Verben und Nomen richtig kombinieren kannst. \n\nAlso, so ist es manchmal auch so, dass woher du kommst, dich diskriminiert. \n\nUnd zwischen den Geschlechtern. \n\nIch weiß nicht, ich denke, das wäre ein weiteres Beispiel.\n\nUnd hier ist die deutsche Übersetzung zurück ins Englisch:\n\n[REWRITE] I think that gender discrimination is still an issue in the US. \n\nNot just for women, I think it has to do with the specific field of work you're in. \n\nI mean, overall, I think women have it harder because of the \"glass ceiling\" where even with equal opportunities, most people have a hard time finding someone who works under a woman if they're a man. \n\nBecause society has been built this way for so long. \n\nAnd often in the workplace, women see that there's a job they can reach, and they have all the qualifications for it, but maybe the board won't promote them to that position just because historically, it's not seen that women are usually in the upper echelons of the business world. \n\nAnd, I think the same goes for men. \n\nIn certain industries like fashion or raising children at home, it's really uncommon for a man to stay at home and take care of the children. \n\nAnd often, people will look down on them because society thinks, \"Well, you're a man, you should be working and making money, why are you staying at home?\" \n\nAnd it can be really hard for them because maybe it's always been their dream to be with the children and help raise them, and the woman has a better job. \n\nAnd it's working out fine for them, but society looks down on it. \n\nIn the fashion industry, it's often the case that people won't take straight men seriously who are interested in fashion. \n\nI don't know if that makes sense, but I think it's because men who are interested in fashion often have a different lifestyle. \n\nSo if you have a typical lifestyle and you're a man and you're in the fashion industry, people will be like, \"Well, how do I really know if you know what fashion is for women, like you don't really know what our case is like, like the other guys.\" \n\nAnd depending on the field of work you're in, I think there's definitely gender discrimination in society in the US. \n\nIt's hard to change because society has a set mindset, and we've made huge progress since the 1800s, but it's a slow process. \n\nIf we continue at the same rate because women are rising to higher positions and becoming CEOs and getting more accepted in the business world, it's a long process. \n\nBut it's happening and people are starting to accept it more. \n\nAnd just like men who stay at home to raise their children, it's becoming more accepted because they realize, \"Oh wait, maybe the woman has the better job or she wants to be the one working.\" \n\nAnd in the fashion industry, people will be like, \"Oh wait, maybe they're listening to their female friends or wives and stuff, so they do know where I'm coming from.\" \n\nSo maybe you have to promote it by showing the good qualities of people who are stereotyped against without being too pushy. \n\nIf you force it, people will resist. \n\nAnd I think we're in a good balance where it's starting to permeate that way. \n\nSo I don't really know if there's anything we can do now that isn't already being done, because if you do it too fast, people will resist. \n\nAnd we've made progress, and change takes time. \n\nYes, and... \n\nThere is also discrimination between genders, depending on the field of work you're in or where you're from. \n\nIf you grew up on a farm and your grammar isn't that great, but you're extremely intelligent and you worked your way up to a CEO position, other men will look down on you because they'll say, \"I don't know if you really know what you're saying if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right.\" \n\nSo it's sometimes like where you're from discriminates against you. \n\nAnd between genders. \n\nI don't know, I think that would be another

Whatever you're trying to get at, and now if you post that on the internet, you have to realize that people will be seeing that, whether it's school officials or not. So in my opinion, I think that school officials seeing that, they had every right to see it, because even if they weren't doing it under the school's name, they could have still accessed that through their homes. But yeah, to prevent a school shooting, you know, as long as it saves the lives of students, which is a responsibility of the school system, I think that's perfectly fine. I mean, let me see here. Like, if they go on to the internet, like on MySpace, just to see if students are drinking or smoking or doing stuff they're not supposed to be doing, they go on there just specifically to catch students and get them in trouble, and I think that's an invasion of privacy.

If you do something while you're a college student, then you grow up to be some important guy, they'll find an email you sent somehow, and once it's on the internet, it's always on the internet, and you know, if you do something like that, there's no way of getting out of it, you will get in trouble, and I don't think that's an invasion of privacy at all because, like I said before, it's a public thing.

You know, when parents drop their students off at school, they feel like they're dropping them off at a safe place, and I've actually discussed that with a teacher of mine, I went to a public high school, and they say, you know, we have to ensure stuff like this because we would do like lockdowns and stuff and... that's in reference to the terrorist attacks, we had to be safe about that, we had like drill stuff, and even though that doesn't have anything to do with the school shooting, well, I mean it kind of does have something to do with the school shooting because, you know, that was in case people would come into the building, I guess. So we, you know, we did practice that stuff in order to make the school a safer place, and that's just what the school officials were doing in this case, they were just making it a safer place, preventing anything bad from happening, like Columbine or something like that.

September betroffen war \nUmfassend \nIch war für den Abzug in den Krieg und wollte so viel Chaos anrichten wie sie hier \nUmfassend \nDenke ich, dass wir wegen der emotionalen Wirkung von 11. September viele Dinge übersehen und nicht über die langfristigen Auswirkungen nachgedacht haben \nWir gingen einfach dorthin ohne einen Plan und wurden unvorbereitet \nUnd um \nIch denke, dass sich das gegen uns auswirkte \nUmfassend \nIch weiß nicht \nIch war für den Krieg \nAber jetzt bin ich sehr dagegen \nIch denke, dass wir nichts erreicht haben \nUmfassend \nIch denke, dass die Menschen dort \nSolange sie sich gegenseitig bekämpfen, können sie uns nicht auch bekämpfen \nIch denke, dass wir dort nicht helfen können, wenn sie sich selbst nicht untereinander auskämpfen können \nAlso um \nLeider wegen 11. September habe ich fast keine Gefühle mehr für das, was dort passiert \nUmfassend \nMit denen \nIch habe keine Gefühle mehr \nIch denke, dass \nManchmal denke ich, dass sie keine Menschen sind \nIch weiß nicht \nSie bekämpfen sich gegenseitig und können nichts erreichen \nAlso beschweren sie mich nicht \nUmfassend \nIch weiß nicht \nWir sind einfach dorthin gegangen, ohne vorbereitet zu sein \nWir wussten nicht, was wir dort erwartete \nUmfassend \nUnd es ist auch schlimm, dass Krieg für sie anders ist als für uns \nSie sind wie Wilde, wenn es um Krieg geht, und ich denke, dass sie nicht daran denken, ihr Land zu verbessern \nIch denke, dass sie nur wollen, dass wir weg sind \nUnd ich denke, das sollte für uns in Ordnung sein \nIch denke, wir sollten einfach abziehen und das ist es \nUmfassend \nWir gingen einfach nur \nIch denke, dass wir nur von der Rache getrieben waren \nIch denke, dass Präsident Bush einfach nur dorthin ging, weil die Leute wollten, dass er dorthin geht, weil von 11. September passiert war \nUmfassend \nAber ich denke, dass er sich selbst entschied, den Krieg gegen den Irak zu erklären \nUmfassend \nAber ich sehe, woher er kam \nWir hatten gar keine Wahl, den Krieg gegen den Irak zu erklären, weil sie das nicht einfach tun können und wir können einfach sagen: 'Ja, wir bauen es wieder auf und das ist es.' \nUmfassend \nIch denke, wir konnten es nicht lassen \nAber ich denke, wir hätten einen besseren Plan haben können, was wir dort tun würden \nIch denke, sie waren nicht sehr klar, was wir dort tun sollten, um Ordnung zu schaffen \nIch weiß nicht \nIch denke, sie wussten nicht, wofür sie dorthin gingen \nAlso denke ich, das hätte uns geholfen \nAber wie ich schon sagte, ich dachte, wir gingen dorthin aus Wut und Hass heraus \nAlso das Ergebnis war das, was wir dort schufen \nUmfassend \nUnd \nEhrlich gesagt, denke ich, wir sind nicht die richtigen, um die Menschen dort zu ändern \nEhrlich gesagt, denke ich, sie sind immer so \nUnd um \nIch denke, ich habe nichts mehr zu sagen \nEs ist schon lange genug \nUmfassend \nIch denke, wir machen nicht genug Fortschritte \nWir haben Fortschritte gemacht \nAber nicht genug, um dorthin zu bleiben \nUnd ich denke, egal wie lange wir dorthin bleiben \nWenn wir weg sind, ist es einfach zusammengebrochen \nUnd wir können nicht dauerhaft dort sein \nAlso denke ich, wir tun uns selbst weh, wenn wir dorthin bleiben \nNein \nOkay\n\nEnglish translation of the German text:\n\n[REWRITE] \nOkay, let's talk about war. At first, I was all for it because I was personally affected by 9/11. I was for going over there and causing as much chaos as they caused here. I think that since it was such an emotional thing that happened, we overlooked a lot of things and didn't really think about the long-term consequences. We went there without a plan and were unprepared. I think that ultimately backfired on us. I don't know, I was for it, but now I'm very against it. I don't think we accomplished anything. I think the people over there, as long as they're fighting with each other, they can't fight with us as well. Like, I don't think us being there is going to do anything if they can't even get along with themselves. Unfortunately, because of 9/11, I've almost lost all feelings for what's going on over there. I just don't care about them. I don't think they're human, I don't know. They're just fighting with each other and can't get anything done, so I really don't care. We went over there completely unprepared, we didn't know what we were going to face over there. It's also bad because war is different for them than it is for us. They're like savage people when it comes to war and I don't think they're looking to better their country, I think they're just looking to get us out of there. And I think that should be fine for us. I think we should just leave and that's really it. We were just hyped up, I don't think we were thinking rationally about what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle. We pretty much just went over there looking for revenge, I think, and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened. But also, I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq. At the time, I see where he was coming from, we really didn't have a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can't just do that and then us just say, 'Okay, let's rebuild and that's it.' So, I don't think we could have let it go, but I think we could have had a better plan of what we were going to do. I don't think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of creating order. I don't know, I just think that they didn't have any unity, they didn't know what they were going in there for. So I think that would have helped us out a lot more. But like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with, so that's what we created in turn in there. Honestly, I don't think we're the ones to change those people, I honestly think they're always going to be like that. And I don't, I really don't have anything else to say. It's gone on long enough. I don't think we're making enough progress. We've made progress, but not enough to stay in there. And I think no matter how long we stay in there, once we leave, it's just going to collapse. And we can't stay over there forever, so I think we're just hurting ourselves by staying over there. No, okay. [/REWRITE]",
