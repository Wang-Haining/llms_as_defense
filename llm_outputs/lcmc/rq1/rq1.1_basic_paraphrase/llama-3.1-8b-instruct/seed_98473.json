that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve

same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple

\nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special

\nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are

    "raw_output": "[REWRITE]\n\nI think the church has already undergone significant changes to adapt to the 21st century, becoming less strict than it once was. As I look back on my own experiences, I remember attending church every Sunday as a child and dressing up in matching outfits with my friends, who I would see at the private school I attended. However, the church has introduced a more casual atmosphere, with a 30-minute teenager mass and people dressing down, especially during summer, when some even wear beach clothes. This shift to a more relaxed environment is evident even in morning masses, where people now wear jeans and khakis instead of formal attire.\n\nAs for other noticeable changes, I believe the most significant one is the church's modernization. Although I'm not familiar with the church's internal politics, my observations suggest that this is the main change I've noticed. \n\nRegarding the allegations of pedophilia among Catholic priests, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these incidents. It's essential to note that some married individuals can still develop pedophilic tendencies, and the desire to engage in such behavior is rooted in their inherent nature, rather than their marital status.

    "transformed": "I think the church has already undergone significant changes to adapt to the 21st century, becoming less strict than it once was. As I look back on my own experiences, I remember attending church every Sunday as a child and dressing up in matching outfits with my friends, who I would see at the private school I attended. However, the church has introduced a more casual atmosphere, with a 30-minute teenager mass and people dressing down, especially during summer, when some even wear beach clothes. This shift to a more relaxed environment is evident even in morning masses, where people now wear jeans and khakis instead of formal attire.\n\nAs for other noticeable changes, I believe the most significant one is the church's modernization. Although I'm not familiar with the church's internal politics, my observations suggest that this is the main change I've noticed. \n\nRegarding the allegations of pedophilia among Catholic priests, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these incidents. It's essential to note that some married individuals can still develop pedophilic tendencies, and the desire to engage in such behavior is rooted in their inherent nature, rather than their marital status.

2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many

prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s

\nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there

The speaker was initially inclined to support George Bush in the 2004 presidential election to allow him to complete his term, but the prolonged occupation and high casualties have raised concerns. The war has also raised questions about the motivations behind the invasion, with some suggesting that oil interests were a primary factor.\n\nThe lack of evidence for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, despite the administration's claims, and the fact that countries like North Korea, which were known to possess such weapons, were not targeted, has further eroded trust in the government's decision-making process. The speaker hopes for a swift resolution to the conflict and a peaceful resolution, but it seems unlikely.",

The US should have weighed the pros and cons before invading Iraq, considering the disastrous consequences that followed.\n\nI don't see a compelling reason to continue the occupation, and I'm skeptical of the administration's arguments for staying.

The idea of imposing democracy in areas where it's not wanted is a significant issue, and Saddam Hussein's regime was just one aspect of the complex situation. The US should have weighed the pros and cons before invading Iraq, considering the disastrous consequences that followed.\n\nI don't see a compelling reason to continue the occupation, and I'm skeptical of the administration's arguments for staying. If the US were to withdraw gradually over a year or more, I wouldn't be opposed. However, I fail to see why we shouldn't leave immediately. The Iraqis themselves are telling us to leave, with 80% wanting us to depart within a year and a quarter wanting us to leave now. It's likely that the people we're trying to help know better than we do, and if we ask them, they say leave, then it's not our fault if the situation deteriorates. By listening to the Iraqis, we can at least maintain a moral high ground, even if we're not the \"good guys\" in the Middle East.",

George W. Bush's stance on gay marriage is not something I agree with, and I think it's up to individual states to decide their own laws and policies. As it stands, the ban on gay marriage is likely to change with a shift in the presidency, so it's better to let each state decide its own path.\n\nUltimately, I think some issues should be left to the discretion of each state, rather than being decided by a single authority figure. States will have to live with the consequences of their decisions, so it's better to give them the freedom to make their own choices.",
