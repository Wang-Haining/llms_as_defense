I think they've been talking about how the Catholic Church is losing some of its following, and I think it's because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn't very accepting of a lot of things. For example, gay marriage, abortion, birth control. I feel like the Catholic Church has very strong views on these things, which is fine, but their views are a little bit old-fashioned in some ways. So I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they wouldn't be worried about losing their following. I've heard that a lot of people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of the way they see these situations. People are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects, and I feel that they feel that the Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things.\n\nI mean, the Catholic Church is against abortion, so if you were for abortion, you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong and that you were going against it. And the same I guess with gay marriage and things like that, where if that was something that you believed in and that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about, you might not want to be in a following where they didn't agree with that. \n\nI don't see any reason why they can't have female priests or that priests can't be married. But I don't know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened. I mean, I don't know. I don't know if they might not have just done that if they... I mean, you're right, they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests, but I don't know if that would have necessarily changed it.  Well, I mean, that was something they did, and that was something that... I don't know, that was something they did, and it might not have really seemed to be affected. I mean, if they were married, would they have done it differently? It's hard to really tell.\n\nI don't see why priests can't be married. I mean, the Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God and they're devoted their complete life. But I don't see, everyone else who has a job in the world has their job, then they also have their family life, and the other people they are devoted to, so I don't see why priests can't have both.

that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state

same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple

their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community

\nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did

I'm not sure about the children aspect about adoption because I think the main drawback to that is how children get treated by their peers and by other adults in society, like in New York City I know they have special schools for children of gay parents because in public schools in New York City they get like beaten up and stuff like that, parents protest to get the child removed from their school and it's just a kid, I mean they're gonna have the same points of view and everything, parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples and so they can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to, I mean it's just about personality choices.

Um just one, lots of people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged and that the gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents or just a personality defect and that is also not a good reason because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is and if people listened to um institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently.

    "transformed": "I think that gay marriage should be legalized because basically there's not a good reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but it's so different. There are so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same. It's just like two different sides of the same coin. Heads will never be tails, but it's like the same thing. And there are a bunch of civil rights that go along with it, like property taxes and the whole healthcare thing where, um, your primary or your next of kin, I don't want to say next of kin because I'm not sure that that's what it is, but if you're in a gay couple then your partner can't be in the room with you if you're sick and can't visit because they're not technically family. And I think that's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. A lot of scientific studies have been done because it's kind of a hot topic these days, and homosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success; they have the same factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do. It's just a relationship, it's the same thing. And I think where a lot of people get hung up on is that homosexuals aren't asking for the right to get married in a church; they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. And if there's not involvement with church and state, that shouldn't be an issue because I can't understand where people like Catholics can get hung up on, oh well that's against our religion and that's morally wrong for us and we can't approve of that sort of thing, but in a legal sense, if you're allowing someone a civil union, why not allow them a marriage? It's like segregation, separate but unequal. Yeah, they are, they're the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that, and people worry about like adoption issues and community issues like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community, especially about the children of gay couples and how they'll adjust to society and whether or not they'll be influenced by their parent's sexual orientation choices or not, but well again it's kind of new and stuff, but it's kind of hard to say.

    "original": "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

Before invading Iraq, I think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, when in reality one really didn't have that much to do with the other. But the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003.\nUm, I\nI myself am pretty much against war, especially to make a preemptive strike. I was against that.\nUm, and I think that the war in Iraq is kind of a repeat in many ways of the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made.\n\nI mean, a tremendous amount of American soldiers have died. And that’s horrible, and what they were doing was that they were taking out, they were removing the country’s government, and I really don’t think the government, the American government was prepared for the um, what, for the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur.\nUm, and here, and the government, and so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and they are trying to implant a democratic government, and it’s kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam. They were trying to push out Communists, and and to uphold or implement, implement and uphold democracy, and and it’s, and it’s, and the government, and the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t going to be a clear, clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear, I mean, it was more of a, it was more of a loss in Vietnam because because, um, because there, because there are there are, no matter how many people may have supported, no matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in, and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in, there’s going to be a large number of insurgents, and it’s hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting an actual army.\nYou’re fighting the citizens the specific citizens in the country, and so so, I think that the government, so first of all, I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into, into war because I’m against it in pretty much all cases, and but if you are going to go to war with a country, you need to be, you need to plan for all possible outcomes. I think the government was not as prepared as it should have been. I mean, worst and either for what would really not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government, and I mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006, and we’re still um, many American troops are still dying, and they’re still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi and the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country, and it’s a long process, and I just think that that the US government in a way tried to, well they weren’t prepared themselves, but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a a short successful stay in Iraq, and I mean we shouldn’t we’re kinda we’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful. I mean in our own country democracy was a long struggle, and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle, and there was lots of tension and there was civil war, and um, it’s just not an easy thing to do, and I think the government the US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do and um, so so, let’s see, the war in Iraq. Well that’s, no, that’s a difficult decision to make because that was well, that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election like the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote, and one of um, one of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started, and so I mean once it’s really hard because once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so long how can we abandon these people, I mean we’re the ones that took away their government and and and their way of life so how can we abandon them now so so it’s probably something that we should (coughs) excuse me, try to see to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and and and how and how much is is too much to to to keep risking for for a free democratic Iraq, I mean going back to the whole reason for invading Iraq I mean if we’re if we’re if we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq why aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is is the is the oil issue and this is where we are getting our oil from and it’s usually all about money and controlling resources I mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found and yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them so I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions. \nLet’s see, um, I just hope that it ends soon and there will be peace there soon, but probably not.

Uh, it was prevented because someone went online and found that, like, okay. Um, no, I don’t think that’s an invasion of privacy. On sites like MySpace, I mean, if you post information on the internet, it’s pretty much available for everyone to see. I understand on MySpace, you know, you have to have someone else be a member in order to see someone’s profile. Maybe you need to, you know, be their friend or something like that. But if that’s the case, you’ve accepted that person as your “friend” so they can see it. You’re giving them permission to see your profile. So, I mean, anytime you put information on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that. So if I think that was actually good, that somebody saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost.  Um, that’s tough, because I mean obviously you can’t have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody’s different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that. But then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, “Let’s look at the bad kids and make sure they’re not up to anything.” Um, I mean, I don’t think it would really be right to go and have somebody’s job be to look at people’s profiles. But I guess it all depends on like what situation they came across that profile. Or was someone just randomly looking at people’s and just randomly happened to see that, or were they actually looking for, you know, some sort of evidence that the student was planning something? So I don’t really know. Sure, um, well, um, like, I mean, I I don’t have a MySpace personally but I have a Facebook. I do. It bothers me that I know that there’s creepy people out there who can see things about me. And I saw something on TV once that was about this, um, this man who just, he was just trying to prove how he can get information so easily, and he went onto this girl’s profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in like you know, less than a minute and got her to meet with him. And I mean, personally, I certainly wouldn’t meet with someone, but I have had people in my classes who I don’t recognize their screen names but they IM me and they know that it’s me, and it’s hard because you think that they know your interests, they know what you look like, sometimes if you put your class schedule they know where you are during the day, who your friends are, they pretty much know a lot about you, all sorts of photos, and I tried to limit what I put up there, but at the same time, the whole point I think, the reason I have one is so you know, I can communicate with some of my friends. I don’t want to limit it too much, so it’s a tricky issue, because I only accept people I know, I mean, you never know really who can look at what, so.

It's not just about women; it relates to the specific field of work you're in. For example, I feel women generally face more challenges, because of the “glass ceiling” where even though equality is supposed to exist, many people have a hard time accepting a woman as a leader, especially men. This is due to how society has been raised for so long.\n\nA lot of times in the workplace, women see a job they can qualify for, but maybe the board won’t promote them because historically, women aren’t seen as typically being in leadership positions in business. This also applies to men, like in the fashion industry or for stay-at-home dads. \n\nIt’s not common for a man to stay at home and be the primary caregiver. People often look down on this because society believes men should be the ones working and providing for the family. It can be difficult for these men because maybe it’s always been their dream to be with their children and raise them, and maybe their wife has the better job, and it’s working well for them, but society doesn't approve.\n\nIn fashion, straight men aren't always taken seriously. I don’t know if that makes sense, but maybe it's because people associate fashion with being feminine. If a man doesn't fit the typical \"masculine\" mold and he's in the fashion industry, people might question if he truly understands fashion because it's traditionally seen as a woman's domain.  \n\nBased on the field you work in, I feel like gender discrimination is definitely still present in US society. Changing it is difficult because society has a set mindset. We have come a long way since the 1800s, but change is slow.\n\nI feel that if we continue at this pace, with women rising in positions of power, becoming CEOs, and gaining more acceptance in the business world, things will gradually change. The same goes for stay-at-home dads. As people realize that maybe the female earns more or wants to work, societal attitudes will shift.\n\nIt takes time, but there’s progress.\n\nI also think people discriminate against each other based on where they’re from or their background.

Um, which knocked it down from a criminal offense to, uh, more like a traffic ticket. You know, something you just get cited for rather than having to be booked and arrested and brought in and all of that. Um, and I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it, then you know, for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that, those types of ramifications, which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge, I mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge, well, depending on the charge. At least for a marijuana charge, one thing that a lot of kids worry about, a lot of people worry about are the future ramifications, and those don't necessarily go away when it's decriminalized. But at the same time, there is an argument that, uh, I mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them and to house them and then to let them go, and then it costs a lot, you know, to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times, and then appoint a public defender and then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney's office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges. I mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do. And um, I mean, so when you're looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, I mean a lot of them just philosophically aren't willing to make that kind of concession even if it would free up a lot of money for them. Like a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don't want to do that. But in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open, I have to use the word liberal, but you know what I mean, kind of uh, kind of thought track, then I think it's totally fine, and I'm sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education, that they can spend on like social programs for the elderly, and that they can spend on, you know, food programs for the homeless people. Um, I mean so, I think it's, it's important because I mean marijuana isn't something that you just want out and out to be everywhere, all over the streets and stuff. Um, I mean for a variety of reasons, but there's this whole like financial element to it as well. Other reasons like? Why it shouldn't necessarily, well no, I mean I, I don't know how I would feel about, well because if it were totally like legalized, I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere. Then I mean, I guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving. And um, it still is like taboo in our society, in a lot of places and a lot of contexts, uh, to smoke marijuana. So, to have it out in the open like that, I feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people. Um, and sorry what? The volume on the microphone is kind of low. Um, I don't really know, um, I think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills, um, but I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle as opposed to just their decision-making motor skills. I mean, but they, they both have their adverse effects, and I mean they, I feel like when it comes to substances in general, like no two people really react the same way. I mean, and then people, some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have, and then some people know how to exercise moderation, and then some people don't.

Because I have a lot of gay friends. Um, I think that I don't necessarily agree with that lifestyle, but I think that it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue. However, I feel as though it should be something that each state decides on their own rather than, um, like the president deciding for the entire country.\n\nUm, well, like a lot of states are democratic and a lot of states are republican.

I think that it should be up to the, um, individual states as to whether they want to legalize it.

And we kind of just went over there unprepared without a plan. And um, I really think that it backfired on us. Um, I uh, I don't know. I was all for it, but now I'm very against it. I don't think it did anything. Um, I think the people over there, as long as they're fighting with each other, they can't be fighting with us as well. Like, I don't think us being over there is going to do anything if they're if they can't even get along with themselves.

Um, I don't know, we definitely went over there just unprepared. We didn't know like what we were going to face over there. Um, and it's also bad because war for them is very different than war for us. They're just like savage people when it comes to war, and I don't think that they're looking to better their country. I just think they're looking to get us out of there. And I think that should be fine for us. I think we should just leave, and that's really it. Um, we just, I think we were just more like hyped up than anything. I don't think we were thinking rationally about like what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle, and um, I just, we pretty much just went over there looking for revenge, I think, and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened. And um, also I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq. Um, but at the time, I see where he was coming from. We really, I don't think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can't just do that and then us just say okay, let's rebuild, and that's it. So, um, I don't think we could have let it go. But I think we could have just had a better plan of what we were going to do. I don't think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of I guess like creating order. And I don't know, I just think that they didn't, there was no like unity. They didn't know what they were going in there for. So I think that would have helped us out a lot more.

I just think, I don't think that sometimes I don't think they're human. I don't know, like they fight with each other, and they can't, they just can't do anything themselves. So I really don't care. Um, I don't know, we definitely went over there just unprepared. We didn't know like what we were going to face over there. Um, and it's also bad because war for them is very different than war for us. They're just like savage people when it comes to war, and I don't think that they're looking to better their country. I just think they're looking to get us out of there. And I think that should be fine for us. I think we should just leave, and that's really it. Um, we just, I think we were just more like hyped up than anything. I don't think we were thinking rationally about like what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle, and um, I just, we pretty much just went over there looking for revenge, I think, and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened. And um, also I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq. Um, but at the time, I see where he was coming from. We really, I don't think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can't just do that and then us just say okay, let's rebuild, and that's it. So, um, I don't think we could have let it go. But I think we could have just had a better plan of what we were going to do. I don't think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of I guess like creating order. And I don't know, I just think that they didn't, there was no like unity. They didn't know what they were going in there for. So I think that would have helped us out a lot more. But like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with, so that's what we created in turn in there. Um, and honestly, I don't, I don't think we're the ones to change those people. I honestly think they're always going to be like that. And um, I don't, I really don't have anything else to say. It's gone one definitely long enough. Um, I don't think we're making enough progress. Like we've made progress, but not enough to stay in there. And I think no matter how long we stay in there, once we leave, it's just going to collapse. And we can't stay over there forever. So I think we're just hurting ourselves by staying over there. No, okay.",
