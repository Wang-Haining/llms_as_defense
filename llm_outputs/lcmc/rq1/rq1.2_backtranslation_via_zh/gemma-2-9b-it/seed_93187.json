    "transformed": "I think that gay marriage should be legalized because basically there's not a good reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but it's so different, and there are so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same. It's just like two different sides of the same coin; heads will never be tails, but it's like the same thing. And there are a bunch of civil rights that go along with it, like property taxes and the whole healthcare thing where, if you're in a gay couple, your partner can't be in the room with you if you're sick and can't visit because they're not technically family. And I think that's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. A lot of scientific studies have been done because it's kind of a hot topic these days, and homosexual couples have the same kind of success rates; they have the same factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do. It's just a relationship, it's the same thing. And I think where a lot of people get hung up on is that homosexuals aren't asking for the right to get married in a church; they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. And if there's not involvement with church and state, then that shouldn't be an issue. Because I can't understand where people like Catholics can get hung up on, \"Oh, well, that's against our religion, and that's morally wrong for us, and we can't approve of that sort of thing,\" but in a legal sense, if you're allowing someone a civil union, why not allow them a marriage? It's like segregation, separate but unequal. They are the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that. And people worry about like adoption issues and community issues, like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community, especially about the children of gay couples and how they'll adjust to society and whether or not they'll be influenced by their parent's sexual orientation choices or not. But well, again, it's kind of new and stuff, but it's kind of hard to say. I'm not sure about the children aspect about adoption because I think the main drawback to that is how children get treated by their peers and by other adults in society. Like in New York City, I know they have special schools for children of gay parents because in public schools in New York City, they get beaten up and stuff like that. Parents protest to get the child removed from their school, and it's just a kid. I mean, they're going to have the same viewpoints and everything. Parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. And so they can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to. I mean, it's just about personality choices. I think the federal government should be very involved in this issue, making gay marriage legal in every state. I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But well, I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion. Well, his um, his take on gay marriage actually um, I think it goes along with his take on abortion and stem cell research, which I think most of the reasons, I'm not sure about this because honestly, I try not to pay attention to politics a lot, but most of the reasons I've heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons, and morality I don't want to say it's negotiable, but it definitely differs from person to person, and to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and um morality concepts of all the rest is unethical.

you?\nUh\nOk yeah\nUm\nHuh\nI guess you could also say that it is\nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in\nWhose sons and

If anything, it could possibly boost it, I think, by I don't know how, but I think it might have a better impact on the society than it would not. \n\nUmm, not quite.

are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still

\nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of

the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for

Um, it was prevented because someone went online and found that there was like... Oh, okay. Um, no, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. On sites like MySpace, I mean, if you post information on the internet, it's pretty much available for everyone to see. And I understand on MySpace, you know, you need to have someone else be a member in order to see someone's profile. You might need to, you know, be their friend or something like that. But if that's the case, you've accepted that person as your \"friend\" so they can see it. You're giving them permission to see your profile. So, I mean, anytime you put information on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that. So if I think that was actually good that somebody saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost. Hum, um, that's tough because I mean obviously you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody's different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that. But then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, \"Oh, let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything.\" Um, I mean, I don't think it would really be right to go and have somebody's job be to look at people's profiles. But I guess it all depends on like what situation they came across that profile or was someone just randomly looking at people's and just randomly happened to see that or were they actually looking for you know some sort of evidence that the student was planning something. So I don't really know. Sure, um, well, um, like, I mean, I don't have MySpace personally but I have a Facebook. I do. It bothers me that I know that there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. And I saw something on TV once that was about this, um, this man who just, he was just trying to prove how he can get information so easily and he went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in like you know less than a minute and got her to meet with him. And I mean personally I certainly wouldn't meet with someone like that, but I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names but they IM me and they know that it's me and it's hard because you think that they know your interests they know what you look like sometimes if you put your class schedule they know where you are during the day who your friends are they pretty much know a lot about you all sorts of photos and I tried to limit what I put up there but at the same time the whole point, I think the reason I have one is so you know I can communicate with some of my friends. I don't want to limit it too much so it's a tricky issue because I only accept people I know. I mean you never know really who can look at what so. Hum, uh, well, I heard my roommate was telling me that her, um, high school she there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having MySpace by the school and that struck me as a little bit strange like I wasn't sure how high school officials had the power to tell their students that they weren't allowed to have a MySpace and I don't know if that's really a privacy issue but I think I don't really know how they had the right to tell people that that's the only other thought I can think of.

Hum, um, that's tough because I mean obviously you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody's different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that. But then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, \"Oh, let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything.\" Um, I mean, I don't think it would really be right to go and have somebody's job be to look at people's profiles. But I guess it all depends on like what situation they came across that profile or was someone just randomly looking at people's and just randomly happened to see that or were they actually looking for you know some sort of evidence that the student was planning something. So I don't really know. Sure, um, well, um, like, I mean, I don't have MySpace personally but I have a Facebook. I do. It bothers me that I know that there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. And I saw something on TV once that was about this, um, this man who just, he was just trying to prove how he can get information so easily and he went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in like you know less than a minute and got her to meet with him. And I mean personally I certainly wouldn't meet with someone like that, but I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names but they IM me and they know that it's me and it's hard because you think that they know your interests they know what you look like sometimes if you put your class schedule they know where you are during the day who your friends are they pretty much know a lot about you all sorts of photos and I tried to limit what I put up there but at the same time the whole point, I think the reason I have one is so you know I can communicate with some of my friends. I don't want to limit it too much so it's a tricky issue because I only accept people I know. I mean you never know really who can look at what so. Hum, uh, well, I heard my roommate was telling me that her, um, high school she there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having MySpace by the school and that struck me as a little bit strange like I wasn't sure how high school officials had the power to tell their students that they weren't allowed to have a MySpace and I don't know if that's really a privacy issue but I think I don't really know how they had the right to tell people that that's the only other thought I can think of.

    "raw_output": "Here is the translated text:\n\n我认为性别歧视在美国仍然是一个问题。\n不仅仅是针对女性，也与你所从事的特定工作领域有关。总的来说，我认为女性更难，因为存在着玻璃天花板，即使理论上存在平等，大多数人仍然难以接受在女性领导下工作。 这是因为社会长期以来就是这样。因此，在职场中，女性常常看到自己能够胜任的职位，并且拥有所有必要的资格，但董事会可能不会选拔他们担任该职位，仅仅因为历史上女性通常不掌握商业世界的上层。\n\n我认为男性也面临着同样的问题。例如，在时尚或其他行业，男性在家中抚养子女并不常见。很多人会对这种现象表示鄙视，因为社会认为男性应该在外工作，成为家庭的经济支柱。为什么你要待在家里？这对他们来说可能非常困难，因为也许他们一直梦想陪伴孩子，帮助抚养孩子，也许妻子拥有更好的工作，他们生活得很幸福。但社会对此表示轻视。\n\n在时尚行业，如果男性直，人们往往不会认真对待他们。我不知道这是否说得通顺，但我认为这是因为通常从事时尚产业的男性拥有不同的生活方式。如果你拥有典型的男性生活方式，并且从事时尚行业，人们会觉得，‘你怎么知道你真的懂时尚？你不知道我们的情况，不像其他那些男人。’\n\n所以，我认为无论你从事哪种工作领域，在美国社会中都存在性别歧视。要改变这种情况比较困难，因为社会已经形成了固定的思维模式。当然，我们已经从19世纪取得了长足进步，但是改变还是非常缓慢的。我认为，只要我们继续以现在的速度努力，因为女性正在步入更高的职位，成为CEO，并在商业世界获得更多认可，这是一个缓慢的过程，但它正在发生，人们开始更加接受它。\n\n并且像在家带孩子的男性，这种模式也越来越被接受，因为他们意识到，也许女性拥有更好的工作，或者她更想工作。对于时尚产业，人们会说，‘哦，也许他们是在听取女性朋友或妻子的建议。’所以他们明白我的意思。\n\n所以，我认为你必须以一种方式去推广它，通过展现那些通常被刻板印象所 stereotyping 的人的优秀品质，但不要过于强硬。但要强调他们的优点，因为如果你强迫它，人们就会抗拒。我认为我们正处于一种良好的平衡点，它开始变得越来越自然。\n\n我不知道我们现在还能做什么，因为如果做得太快，人们就会抗拒。我们已经走得很远了，改变需要时间。\n\n当然，他们可能也会相互歧视，这取决于你所从事的行业或你的背景。例如，如果你在农场长大，你的语法可能不太好，但你非常聪明，并最终成为CEO。即使你的语法可能不是最好的，或者即使你很聪明，但你的语法可能不是最好的，其他男性可能会瞧不起你，说：‘我怎么知道你说的都是真的，如果你连动词和名词都弄不好？’\n\n所以，有时候你的背景也会歧视你，从性别到性别，我不知道，也许那就是另一个例子。\n\n\n\n[REWRITE]I feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States, and it's not just against women.

Like, in industries like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent, it's really uncommon for a male to be the one staying at home. And a lot of times, people look down on that because society thinks, 'Oh, you're the male, you should be out working, you should be the breadwinner of your family. Why are you staying at home?' And it can be really hard on them because perhaps it's always been their dream to be with the children and raise them, and maybe the wife has the better job, and it's working out fine for them, but society looks down on that.\n\nAnd then in the fashion industry, a lot of times people won't really take men seriously if they're straight. I don't know if that really makes sense, but I guess it's because typically males who are into fashion have different lifestyles. And so if you have the typical lifestyle and you're a male and you're in the fashion industry, people will be like, 'Well, how do I really know if you know what fashion is for a woman? Like you don't really know our case like these other guys.' \n\nSo, depending on the field of work you're in, I feel like there's definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S.  To change it is kind of more difficult because society has a set mindset, and obviously, we've come a long way from the 1800s and leaps and bounds. But change is really slow, so I feel that if we continue working at the pace we are now, because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEOs and they're getting more accepted in the business world and it's a slow process, but it's happening, and people are starting to accept it more.

Um, which took it down from a criminal offense to, uh, to more of like a traffic ticket. You know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that. Um, and I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it then you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that, um, those types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would, I mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well, depending on the charge, at least for a marijuana charge, one thing that a lot of kids worry about, a lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized. But at the same time there is an argument that, um, I mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them and to house them and then to let them go and then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times and then appoint a public defender and then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges. I mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do, and um, I mean, so, when you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, I mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession, even if it would free up a lot of money for them. Like a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that, but in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open, I have to use the word liberal, but you know what I mean, kind of uh, kind of thought track, then I think it’s totally fine, and I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education, that they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on, you know, food programs for the homeless people. Um, I mean, so, I think it’s, it’s important because I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere, all over the streets and stuff. Um, I mean for a variety of reasons, but there’s this whole like financial element to it as well. Other reasons like? Why it shouldn’t necessarily, well no, I mean I, I don’t know how I would feel about, well because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere, then I mean, I guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving, and um, it still is like taboo in our society, in a lot of places and a lot of contexts, uh, to smoke marijuana, so, to have it out in the open like that, I feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people. Um, and, sorry, what? The volume on the microphone is kind of low, um, I don’t really know, um, I think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills, um, but I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle as opposed to just their decision making motor skills. I mean, but they, they both have their adverse effects, and I mean they, I feel like when it comes to substances in general, like no two people really react the same way, I mean, and then people, some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have, and then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t, so it, I guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance when people react different ways, but I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects, um, yeah, uh, no I don’t.
