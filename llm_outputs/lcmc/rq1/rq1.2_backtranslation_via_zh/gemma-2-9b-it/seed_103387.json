heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did

There were pretexts that led us into Iraq.\nI think that early on, the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which has since proven false.\nAnd that really rubs me the wrong way, and in general, the Iraq war just boils my blood.\n\nUm\nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration lied to the American people very openly and has yet to own up to that fact.\nEven Colin Powell\nI mean, coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it.\nAnd\nTo me, that's just malfeasance in office. I think that's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that.\nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the Constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since.

\nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there

    "raw_output": "好吧。伊拉克战争。 嗯，从头讲，我认为政府对美国人民关于战争原因的解释并不完全诚实。在入侵伊拉克之前，我认为试图将伊拉克的入侵与2001年9月11日的恐怖袭击联系起来，而实际上两者之间并没有太多关系。但政府制造了这种感觉，利用了美国人民对2001年9月11日恐怖袭击的愤怒情绪，从而开始了2003年的伊拉克入侵。嗯，我本人很反对战争，尤其是在战争前发动攻击，我反对这种做法。嗯，我认为伊拉克战争在很多方面都类似于越南战争，政府应该从过去的错误中吸取教训。 我指的是大量的美国士兵死亡。这太可怕了，他们所做的是推翻伊拉克政府，我真不认为美国政府准备好了伊拉克政府被推翻之后会出现的混乱局面。 嗯，政府撤走了伊拉克政府，试图建立一个民主政府，这与他们在越南的做法很相似。他们试图驱逐共产主义者，并维护和实施民主。政府应该知道这将是一场漫长而艰苦的斗争，很可能不是像他们那样清晰的胜利。我指的是就像在越南一样，不是一个清晰的胜利。更像是越南的失败，因为无论有多少人支持美国介入，无论有多少伊拉克人和越南人希望美国介入，都会有大量的叛乱分子，当你与他们作战时很难压倒他们，因为你没有与一个实际的军队作战。你是在与该国特定公民作战。因此，我认为政府首先，我认为我们不应该介入战争，因为我几乎在所有情况下都反对战争。但是，如果你要与一个国家开战，你需要为所有可能的结果做好计划。我认为政府没有做好应有的准备，比如在他们推翻伊拉克政府之后会发生什么。我们仍然在那里，在2006年末，仍然有许多美军士兵在牺牲，他们仍在试图训练伊拉克军队和伊拉克警察部队，让他们能够管理自己的国家，这是一个漫长的过程，我只是认为美国政府在某种程度上试图，嗯，他们自己没有做好准备，但他们试图欺骗美国人民，让他们认为这将是一个短暂而成功的伊拉克停留。我们不应该天真地相信这一点，因为实施一种新的政府形式并使其成功需要很多年。想想我们自己的国家，民主是一个漫长的斗争，为了获得我们今天所拥有的强大的政府，经历了漫长的斗争，充满了紧张局势，甚至内战。 它不是一件容易的事，我认为美国政府让它看起来像是件容易的事。 嗯，所以，让我们看看伊拉克战争。 这的确是一个艰难的决定，因为这是我当时的感受，就像是在2004年的总统大选中。 当我考虑谁能得到我的选票时，其中一个原因，我可能会投票给乔治·布什，就是让他完成他所开始的事情。因此，一旦我们介入其中，我们已经在那里呆了这么久，我们怎么能放弃这些人呢？我们是那些剥夺他们政府和他们生活方式的人，怎么能现在放弃他们呢？因此，这可能是我们应该尝试完成的事情，然后再考虑天文数字的美国伤亡人数，以及我们为一个自由的民主伊拉克继续冒险付出多少代价。我还记得，关于入侵伊拉克的原因，如果我们入侵伊拉克并使其成为一个民主国家，为什么只是伊拉克？为什么我们不把这做给其他国家？我认为主要原因是石油问题，这是我们获取石油的地方。 通常都是关于金钱和控制资源。 另一个入侵伊拉克前的前提是伊拉克拥有大规模杀伤性武器，但实际上从未发现过大规模杀伤性武器。而像朝鲜这样的国家，我们确实知道他们拥有大规模杀伤性武器，而我们并没有对他们采取任何行动。因此，我认为美国政府在做出决定时没有足够彻底或真诚。让我们看看，我只是希望这一切能尽快结束，那里也能尽快迎来和平，但可能不会。\n\n\n\n[REWRITE]\nOkay, the war in Iraq.

Uh, it was prevented because someone went online and found that there was like… okay, okay. Um, no, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. On sites like Myspace, I mean, if you post information on the internet, it's pretty much available for everyone to see. And I understand on Myspace, you know, you have to have someone else be a member in order to see someone's profile. You might need to, you know, be their friend or something like that. But you've, if that's the case, you've accepted that person as your “friend” so they can see it. You're giving them permission to see your profile. So, I mean, anytime you put information on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that. So if I think that was actually good, that somebody saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost. Hum, um, that's tough because I mean obviously you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody's different profiles, of all the students in the school to prevent that. But then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, \"Let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything.\" Um, I mean, I don't think it would really be right to go and have somebody's job be to look at people's profiles. But I guess it all depends on, like, what situation they came across that profile. Or was someone just randomly looking at people's and just randomly happened to see that, or were they actually looking for, you know, some sort of evidence that the student was planning something? So I don't really know. Sure, um, well, um, like, I mean, I I don't have a Myspace personally but I have a Facebook. I do. It bothers me that I know that there's creepy people out there who can see things about me. And I saw something on TV once that was about this, um, this man who just, he was just trying to prove how he can get information so easily. And he went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in like you know less than a minute and got her to meet with him. And I mean, personally, I certainly wouldn't meet with someone like that. But I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names but they IM me and they know that it's me. And it is hard because you think that they know your interests, they know what you look like. Sometimes if you put your class schedule they know where you are during the day, who your friends are, they pretty much know a lot about you. All sorts of photos. And I tried to limit what I put up there, but at the same time, the whole point, I think, the reason I have one is so you know I can communicate with some of my friends. I don't want to limit it too much. So it's a tricky issue because I only accept people I know. I mean, you never know really, who can look at what, so. Hum, uh, well, I heard, my roommate was telling me that her, um, high school, there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school, and that struck me as a little bit strange, like I wasn't sure how, how high school officials had the power to tell their students that they weren't allowed to have a Myspace.

    "raw_output": "是的，我确实觉得美国仍然存在性别歧视。\n\n并且，这不仅仅针对女性。我认为这与你从事的特定工作领域有关。\n\n总的来说，我觉得女性更难，因为即使在理论上存在平等，大多数人也很难接受他们可能需要在女性领导下工作。仅仅因为社会长期以来就是这样。\n\n因此，在职场中，女性经常会看到自己能够胜任的职位，并且具备所有资格，但董事会可能不会选择晋升她们，仅仅是因为历史上女性通常不在商业世界的顶端。\n\n嗯，我想男士也面临同样的情况。在像时尚或其他行业中，例如在家带孩子的家长，这非常罕见。\n\n嗯，一个男性在家带孩子的情况非常少见。而且很多时候人们会看低这种情况，因为社会认为，你是男性，你应该出去工作，你是家庭的赚钱者。为什么你要待在家里？这对他们来说可能会很难，因为也许照顾孩子和抚养孩子一直是他们的梦想，而妻子可能拥有更好的工作，这对他们来说运作良好。但社会对此表示不屑。\n\n然后在时尚行业，嗯，很多时候，如果男性是直的，人们不会认真对待他们。我不知道这是否说得通，但我认为这是因为通常对时尚感兴趣的男性，嗯，可能会有不同的生活方式。因此，如果你有典型的生活方式，你是男性，你从事时尚行业，人们会说，等等，我怎么知道你是否真正懂得时尚？你并不真正知道我们的情况，就像其他那些家伙一样。\n\n因此，取决于你从事的行业，我觉得在美国社会中存在着性别歧视。改变它更困难，因为社会已经形成了固定的思维方式，当然，我们已经从 19 世纪走了很长一段路，并且取得了长足的进步，但改变非常缓慢。我觉得，如果我们按照现在的速度继续努力，因为女性正在担任更高的职位，成为首席执行官，他们在商业世界获得更多认可，这是一个缓慢的过程，但正在发生，人们开始更加接受。\n\n就像居家照顾孩子的男士一样，这种现象也变得越来越被接受，因为他们意识到，哦，也许女性拥有更好的工作，或者她想成为工作的那个人。\n\n嗯，然后对于像时尚的人来说，他们会说，哦，也许他们在听取来自女性朋友或妻子等人的意见。所以他们知道我的意思。所以我想，你需要以某种方式通过展现那些通常被刻板印象所束缚的人的优良品质来促进它，而不至于过于强硬。但嗯，说出他们的优点。因为如果你强迫它，人们会抗拒。我觉得我们正处于一个很好的平衡点，它开始变得越来越被强制执行。\n\n所以我不知道我们现在还能做些什么，因为如果你做得太快，人们会抗拒。我们已经走了很长一段路，改变需要时间。是的。嗯，我想，他们可能也会互相歧视，这取决于你从事的类型工作或者你来自哪里。\n\n就像如果你在农场长大，你的语法可能不太好，但是你非常聪明，你想让自己，例如你努力工作，成为了一位首席执行官。即使你可能没有最好的语法，或者即使你很聪明，但你的语法不是最好的，其他男性可能会看低你，说，我不知道你说的到底是什么意思，如果你连动词和名词都无法正确拼写。\n\n所以，是的，所以有时你来自哪里会歧视你。就像性别之间一样，我不知道，我想这将是另一个例子。嗯，并不是。\n\n\n\n[REWRITE]\n\nYes, I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States. \n\nAnd it's not just against women. I think it has to do with the particular field of work that you're dealing with. \n\nOverall, I feel that women have it more difficult because there's the glass ceiling, where even though equality is supposed to exist, most people have a hard time accepting that they might have to work under a woman if they're a man, just because of how society has been raised for so long. \n\nSo, a lot of times in the workplace, women will see a job they can reach, and they have all the qualifications for it, but maybe the board won't elect to promote them to that position just because historically it's not seen that women are usually in the upper hands of the business world.\n\nAnd I guess the same thing goes for men. And in other industries like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent, it's really uncommon to have a male staying at home. \n\nAnd a lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks, oh well, you're the male, you should be out working, you should be the money maker of your family. Why are you staying at home? And it can be really hard on them because perhaps it's always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children, and maybe the wife has the better job, and it's working out fine for them, but society looks down upon that.\n\nAnd then in the fashion industry, um, a lot of times people won't really take males seriously if they're straight. I don't know if that really makes sense, but I guess it's because typically males who are into fashion, um, like I guess have different lifestyles. And so if you have the typical style of life and you're a male and you're in the fashion industry, people will be like, well wait, how do I really know if like you know what fashion is for a woman? Like you don't really know what our case is like, like these other guys.\n\nSo, depending on like what field of work you're in, I feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S.\n\nTo change it is kind of more difficult because society like has a set mindset, and obviously, we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds. But change is really slow, so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now, because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEOs and they're getting more accepted in the business world, it's a slow process, but it's happening, and people are starting to accept it more.\n\nAnd just as men who are stay-at-home Dads, it's becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait, maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works.\n\nAnd um, then for like fashion, people will be like, oh wait, maybe they're listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff.

So I don't really know if there's anything that we can do right now that isn't already being done because if you do it too fast it's like people will resist. And we've come a long ways and change takes time.\n\nYes. Um, well, I guess they're probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you're from. Like if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn't the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself, like you work your way up into a CEO job, even though you might not have the best grammar in the world, and even though you might be intelligent, but you don't have the best grammar in the world, other men might look down upon you and be like, well, how do I know you're really what you're saying if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right.

Um, and I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it, then you know, for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that, those types of ramifications, which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would, I mean, usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge, well, depending on the charge. At least for a marijuana charge, one thing that a lot of kids worry about, a lot of people worry about are the future ramifications, and those don't necessarily go away when it's decriminalized. But at the same time, there is an argument that, um, I mean, it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them and to house them and then to let them go. And then it costs a lot, you know, to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times, and then appoint a public defender, and then you have to pay the judge, and then the state attorney's office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges. I mean, all of that stuff costs a lot to do. And um, I mean, so when you're looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, I mean, a lot of them just philosophically aren't willing to make that kind of concession, even if it would free up a lot of money for them.

Why it shouldn't necessarily, well, no, I mean, I, I don't know how I would feel about, well, because if it were totally like legalized, I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere.

Um, I don't really know, um, I think in general, alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills. Um, but I think in general, marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle as opposed to just their decision-making motor skills. I mean, but they, they both have their adverse effects, and I mean, I feel like when it comes to substances in general, like no two people really react the same way.
