The Catholic Church has very strong views on them, which is fine, but their views are a little bit old-fashioned in some ways. So I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a newer style of thinking, they wouldn't be worried about losing their following.\n\nI've heard that people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of the way they see these situations, and people are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects.

\nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community

    "transformed": "I think that gay marriage should be legalized because basically there's not a good reason not to. Um, many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but it's so different. And there are so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same. It's just like two different sides of the same coin, um, heads will never be tails, but it's like the same thing. And um, well there's a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it, like property taxes and the whole health care thing where um, your primary or your, I don't want to say next of kin because I'm not sure that that's what it is, but if you're in a gay couple then your partner can't be in the room with you if you're sick and can't visit because they're not technically family. And I think that's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. And a lot of scientific studies have been done because it's kind of a hot topic these days and homosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success, they have the same um, factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do. It's just it's a relationship it's the same thing. And I think where a lot of people like get hung up on is um, homosexuals aren't asking for the right to get married in a church, they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. And if there's not involvement with church and state then that shouldn't be an issue because I can't understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that's against our religion and that's morally wrong for us and we can't approve of that sort of thing, but in a legal sense if you're allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage. It's like segregation, separate but unequal. Yeah, they are, they're the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that.

I think it's really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state. It's a clear, it's a clear, uh, it's clearly stated, and I feel that trying to do anything with it, trying to enforce any kind of power over it would really be in defiance of what has already been said and written in stone in the constitution. So, uh, in terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal, I think that's really choosing one church's belief over another because as we can see most of the Catholics, uh, Catholics and Christians are really against it and don't support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas. But um, I don't think that it's really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal and legal. Uh, well, separation of church and state is pretty much like been a key aspect of the constitution and what's really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States. And even though they did plan on making an amendment I think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong and just in contradictory to what's already been said and written there. And plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment, probably I think maybe one of the only amendments that's actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government. So I don't feel that's its right at all in that aspect. Uh, no, I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue. I don't see why he's pushing for this amendment except that's it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic and as I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion. So I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this, not for the president or anybody in government in particular and there isn't really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it because I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or anything else.

So, uh, in terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal, I think that's really choosing one church's belief over another because as we can see most of the Catholics, uh, Catholics and Christians are really against it and don't support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas. But um, I don't think that it's really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal and legal. Uh, well, separation of church and state is pretty much like been a key aspect of the constitution and what's really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States. And even though they did plan on making an amendment I think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong and just in contradictory to what's already been said and written there. And plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment, probably I think maybe one of the only amendments that's actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government. So I don't feel that's its right at all in that aspect. Uh, no, I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue. I don't see why he's pushing for this amendment except that's it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic and as I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion. So I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this, not for the president or anybody in government in particular and there isn't really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it because I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or anything else. If anything, it could possibly boost it, I think by I don't know how but I think it might have a better impact on the society, society than it would not. Umm, not quite, I think I pretty much said it all.",

    "raw_output": "好的。\n伊拉克战争\n嗯，从一开始，我认为政府对美国人民关于战争原因的解释并不完全诚实。在入侵伊拉克之前，我认为他们试图将入侵伊拉克与 911 年的恐怖袭击联系起来，尽管实际上两者没有太多关联。但政府故意制造了这种印象，并利用美国人民对 911 年恐怖袭击的愤怒情绪发动了入侵伊拉克。入侵伊拉克始于 2003 年。\n嗯，我本人极力反对战争，特别是预emptive strike，我对此表示反对。我认为伊拉克战争在很多方面都像越南战争一样，政府应该从过去犯下的错误中吸取教训。\n\n我的意思是，大量的美国士兵死亡了，这太可怕了。他们所做的是推翻伊拉克政府，但我认为美国政府没有为随之而来的权力真空和随之而来的混乱做好准备。\n因此，美军推翻了伊拉克政府，试图建立一个民主政府。这与他们在越南所做的一样，试图驱逐共产主义者并维护或实施民主。政府应该知道，这是一场漫长而艰苦的斗争，很可能不会像越南战争那样取得清晰的胜利。我的意思是，越南战争更像一场失败，因为无论有多少人支持美国介入，无论是伊拉克人还是越南人，始终会有大量的游击队员，而当你面对的是一群平民而不是正规军队的战斗时，很难打败他们。\n\n所以，我认为政府首先不应该介入战争，因为我几乎在所有情况下都反对战争，但如果你要去与一个国家开战，你需要为所有可能的结果做好计划。我认为政府没有做好应有的准备， 也没有真正计划好在推翻伊拉克政府后会发生什么。现在是 2006 年年底，我们仍然在那里，许多美国军人仍在死亡，他们仍在训练伊拉克军队和伊拉克警察，以便他们能够自己治理自己的国家，这是一个漫长的过程。我认为美国政府试图误导美国人民，让他们相信这将是一次短暂而成功的行动。\n\n我们应该意识到建立新的政府制度并使其成功需要很多年。想想我们自己的国家，民主是一个漫长的斗争，成为了今天强大国家的民主制度，也是一个漫长的斗争，充满了紧张局势和内战。这并不容易。我认为美国政府把它描绘成一件容易的事。\n\n所以，让我们来谈谈伊拉克战争吧。这是一个艰难的决定，因为这是我的感受，就像 2004 年的总统选举，当我考虑应该投票给谁时，其中一个原因是我可能会投票给乔治·布什，让他完成他开始的事。一旦我们介入，我们已经在那里很久了，我们怎么能放弃这些人呢？我们是他们政府和生活方式的破坏者，我们怎么能现在抛弃他们呢？所以这可能是一件我们应该尽力完成的事情，但另一方面，我们还要考虑美国军人的伤亡人数，以及为了一个自由民主的伊拉克，我们是否愿意继续冒这个风险。\n\n回到入侵伊拉克的最初理由，如果我们要让伊拉克成为一个民主国家，为什么只针对伊拉克呢？我们为什么不把这种做法应用于其他国家呢？我认为主要原因是石油问题，这里是我们的主要石油来源，这通常都是关于金钱和控制资源的问题。还有，战争前的一个主要理由是伊拉克拥有大规模杀伤性武器，但实际上并没有发现任何大规模杀伤性武器，而像朝鲜这样的国家，我们知道他们拥有大规模杀伤性武器，我们并没有对他们采取任何行动。我认为美国政府在做出决策时不够彻底和真实。\n\n我希望这一切能尽快结束，那里能尽快迎来和平。但很可能不会。\n\n[REWRITE]\nThe Iraq War\n\nWell, to start from the beginning, I don't think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for the war.

have someone else be a member in order to see someone's profile.\n\nYou might need to,\n\nYou know, be their friend or something like that.\n\nBut if that's the case, you've accepted that person as your “friend” so they can see it.\n\nYou're giving them permission to see your profile.\n\nSo,\n\nI mean any time you put information on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that.\n\nSo if I think that was actually good, that somebody saw that, and was able to prevent a life from being lost.\n\nHmm,\n\nUm, that's tough,\n\nBecause I mean obviously you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody's different profiles\n\nOf all the students in the school to prevent that.\n\nBut then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, “Let’s look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything.”\n\nUm,\n\nI mean, I don't think it would really be right\n\nTo have somebody's job be to look at peoples' profiles.\n\nBut I guess it all depends\n\nOn like what situation they came across that profile,\n\nOr was someone just randomly looking at peoples'\n\nAnd just randomly happened to see that,\n\nOr were they actually looking for\n\nYou know, some sort of evidence that the student was planning something?\n\nSo I don't really know.\n\nSure.\n\nUm, well, um like,\n\nI mean, I don't have MySpace personally but I have a Facebook.\n\nI do.\n\nIt bothers me that I know that there are creepy people out there\n\nWho can see things about me.\n\nAnd I saw something on TV once that was about this,\n\nUm, this man who just,\n\nHe was just trying to prove how he can get information so easily,\n\nAnd he went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away\n\nAnd was talking to her on instant messenger\n\nIn like, you know, less than a minute and got her to meet with him.\n\nAnd I mean, personally, I certainly wouldn't meet with someone like that.\n\nBut I have had people in my classes\n\nWho I don't recognize their screen names,\n\nBut they IM me and they know that it's me.\n\nAnd it's hard because you think that they know your interests,\n\nThey know what you look like.\n\nSometimes if you put your class schedule they know where you are during the day,\n\nWho your friends are.\n\nThey pretty much know a lot about you.\n\nAll sorts of photos.\n\nAnd I tried to

And it's not only with women though. I feel it has to do with like the particular field of work that you're dealing with. Um, I mean, for overall, I feel that women have it more difficult because there's the glass ceiling where even still that there is supposed to be equality, most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they're a man just because of how society has been raised for so long. And so a lot of times in the workplace, women will see that there's a job that they can reach, and they have all of the qualifications for it, but maybe the board won't elect to promote them to that position just because historically it's not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world. And um, I guess the same thing goes for men, though, and like other industries like fashion or um, being a parent at home. It's really uncommon to have a parent staying at home who's the male. And um, a lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks, oh well, you're the male, you should be out working, you should be the money maker of your family. Why are you staying at home? And it can be really hard on them because perhaps it's always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children, and maybe the wife has the better job, and like, it's working out fine for them, but society looks down upon that. And then in the fashion industry, um, a lot of times people won't really take males seriously if they're straight. I don't know if that really makes sense, but I guess it's cause typically males who are into fashion um, like I guess have different styles of life, and so if you have the typical style of life and you're a male and you're in the fashion industry, people will be like, well wait, how do I really know if like you know what fashion is for a woman? Like you don't really don't know what our case is like, like these other guys. And so, depending on like what field of work you're in, I feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. Um, to change it is kind of more difficult because society like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long way from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds, but change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEOs and they're getting more accepted in the business world, and it's a slow process, but it's happening, and people are starting to accept it more. And just as men who are stay-at-home dads, it's becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait, maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works, and um, then for like fashion people will be like, oh wait, maybe they're listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff, and so they do know like where I'm coming from. So I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically stereotyped against by not being too pushy, but um, saying like the qualities of them because if you force it people are going to resist, and I feel that we're kind of at a good balance where it's starting to become enforced like that, so I don't really know if there's anything that we can do right now that isn't already being done because if you do it too fast it's like people will resist, and we've come a long way and change takes time. Yes, um, well I guess they're probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you're from. Like if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn't the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself like you work your way up into a CEO job, even though you might not have the best grammar in the world and or even though you might be intelligent, but you don't have the best grammar in the world, other men might look down upon you and be like, well how do I know you're really what you're saying if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right, so yeah, so like sometimes just where you're from can discriminate against you and like from gender to gender, and I don't know, I guess that'd be another example, um, not really. \n\n\n[/REWRITE]",

And then in the fashion industry, um, a lot of times people won't really take males seriously if they're straight. I don't know if that really makes sense, but I guess it's cause typically males who are into fashion um, like I guess have different styles of life, and so if you have the typical style of life and you're a male and you're in the fashion industry, people will be like, well wait, how do I really know if like you know what fashion is for a woman? Like you don't really don't know what our case is like, like these other guys. And so, depending on like what field of work you're in, I feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. Um, to change it is kind of more difficult because society like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long way from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds, but change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEOs and they're getting more accepted in the business world, and it's a slow process, but it's happening, and people are starting to accept it more. And just as men who are stay-at-home dads, it's becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait, maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works, and um, then for like fashion people will be like, oh wait, maybe they're listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff, and so they do know like where I'm coming from. So I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically stereotyped against by not being too pushy, but um, saying like the qualities of them because if you force it people are going to resist, and I feel that we're kind of at a good balance where it's starting to become enforced like that, so I don't really know if there's anything that we can do right now that isn't already being done because if you do it too fast it's like people will resist, and we've come a long way and change takes time. Yes, um, well I guess they're probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you're from. Like if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn't the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself like you work your way up into a CEO job, even though you might not have the best grammar in the world and or even though you might be intelligent, but you don't have the best grammar in the world, other men might look down upon you and be like, well how do I know you're really what you're saying if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right, so yeah, so like sometimes just where you're from can discriminate against you and like from gender to gender, and I don't know, I guess that'd be another example, um, not really.",

Seeing as it is a sacrament, like considered, well people wouldn't get tax breaks or looked at any specific way by the government if they were baptized, and so if you're married, I think they should just look at it as a civil union because that's what it is, it's two people.

But I do believe this is the trickiest topic we're facing today because something so close between separation of church and state and how to define marriage is very tricky to do without offending anyone. So I don't know, I think that all civil unions, I don't know whether marriage should be looked at and defined by the government. Seeing as it is a sacrament, like considered, well people wouldn't get tax breaks or looked at any specific way by the government if they were baptized, and so if you're married, I think they should just look at it as a civil union because that's what it is, it's two people. They shouldn't have separation of church and state, they shouldn't look into like well what kind of marriage was it? Two people got unioned together. So and the fact that gay marriage, I mean that would just, oh two people you got a civil union.\n\nUm, well, if all the states can come to a logical conclusion then they should push to make it federal law, but a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just ridiculous. It is something like the constitution shouldn't just be amended for something. I mean it is a very big cause for certain people, but it's not large enough that it should be a constitutional amendment.

I wanted to go over there and create as much havoc as they did here. I think because it was such an emotional event, we overlooked a lot of things and didn't think about the long term. We just kind of went in unprepared and without a plan, and I really think it backfired on us. I don't know, I was all for it, but now I'm very against it. I don't think it accomplished anything. I think the people over there, as long as they're fighting amongst themselves, they can't be fighting us too. Like, I don't think us being there is going to do anything if they can't even get along with themselves. So, unfortunately, because of 9/11, I've almost just stopped caring what goes on over there with those people. I just don't care. I think, I don't think they're human sometimes. I don't know, they fight with each other and can't just do anything themselves. So I really don't care. We definitely went over there unprepared. We didn't know what we were going to face over there. It's also bad because war for them is very different than war for us. They're just savage when it comes to war, and I don't think they're looking to better their country. I just think they're looking to get us out of there, and I think that should be fine for us. I think we should just leave and that's really it. We were just hyped up, I think. I don't think we were thinking rationally about what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle and... I just think we went over there looking for revenge, and I think President Bush just went over there because the people wanted to go over there because of what happened. And also, I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq. But at the time, I see where he was coming from. We really didn't have a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can't just do that and then us just say, \"Okay, let's rebuild,\" and that's it. So I don't think we could have let it go. But I think we could have just had a better plan of what we were going to do. I don't think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of, I guess, creating order. And I don't know, I just think that they didn't have unity. They didn't know what they were going in there for. So I think that would have helped us out a lot more. But like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with, so that's what we created in turn. And honestly, I don't think we're the ones to change those people. I honestly think they're always going to be like that. And um, I really don't have anything else to say. It's gone on long enough. I don't think we're making enough progress.

We just kind of went in unprepared and without a plan, and I really think it backfired on us. I don't know, I was all for it, but now I'm very against it. I don't think it accomplished anything. I think the people over there, as long as they're fighting amongst themselves, they can't be fighting us too. Like, I don't think us being there is going to do anything if they can't even get along with themselves. So, unfortunately, because of 9/11, I've almost just stopped caring what goes on over there with those people. I just don't care. I think, I don't think they're human sometimes. I don't know, they fight with each other and can't just do anything themselves. So I really don't care. We definitely went over there unprepared. We didn't know what we were going to face over there. It's also bad because war for them is very different than war for us. They're just savage when it comes to war, and I don't think they're looking to better their country. I just think they're looking to get us out of there, and I think that should be fine for us. I think we should just leave and that's really it. We were just hyped up, I think. I don't think we were thinking rationally about what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle and... I just think we went over there looking for revenge, and I think President Bush just went over there because the people wanted to go over there because of what happened. And also, I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq. But at the time, I see where he was coming from. We really didn't have a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can't just do that and then us just say, \"Okay, let's rebuild,\" and that's it. So I don't think we could have let it go. But I think we could have just had a better plan of what we were going to do. I don't think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of, I guess, creating order. And I don't know, I just think that they didn't have unity. They didn't know what they were going in there for. So I think that would have helped us out a lot more. But like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with, so that's what we created in turn. And honestly, I don't think we're the ones to change those people. I honestly think they're always going to be like that. And um, I really don't have anything else to say. It's gone on long enough. I don't think we're making enough progress. Like, we've made progress, but not enough to stay there. And I think no matter how long we stay there, once we leave, it's just going to collapse. And we can't stay over there forever. So I think we're just hurting ourselves by staying over there. No, okay.",
