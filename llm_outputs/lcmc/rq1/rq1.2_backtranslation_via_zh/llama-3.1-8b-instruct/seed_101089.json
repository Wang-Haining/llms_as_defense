It's just it's a relationship, it's the same thing. I think where a lot of people get hung up is homosexuals aren't asking for the right to get married in a church, they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. And if there's no involvement with church and state, then that shouldn't be an issue. Because I can't understand where people like Catholics can get hung up on, \"oh well that's against our religion and that's morally wrong for us and we can't approve of that sort of thing.\" But in a legal sense, if you're allowing someone a civil union, why not allow them a marriage? It's like segregation, separate but unequal. They are the same in many ways, like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that. People worry about adoption issues and community issues, like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community. And especially about kids of gay couples and how they'll adjust to society and whether or not they'll be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation or not. But well again, it's kind of new and stuff, but it's kind of hard to say I'm not sure about the children aspect about adoption because I think the main drawback to that is how kids get treated by their peers and by other adults in society. Like in New York City, I know they have special schools for kids of gay parents because in public schools in New York City they get beaten up and stuff like that. And parents protest to get the kid removed from their school. And it's just a kid, I mean they'll have the same viewpoints and everything, parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. So they can be community involved or not, like heterosexual couples choose to. I mean it's just about personality choices. I think the federal government should be very involved in this issue, making gay marriage legal in every state, I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But well I think President Bush has very very strong views on his own having to do with his religion. Well his take on gay marriage actually um I think it goes along with his take on abortion and stem cell research which I think most of the reasons I'm not sure about this because honestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot but most of the reasons I've heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons and morality I don't want to say it's negotiable but it definitely differs from person to person and to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and morality concepts of all the rest is unethical to just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account to go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy considering I mean about under God in the pledge of allegiance and how people are so opposed to that but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country. Um just one lots of people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged and the gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents or just a personality defect. And that is also not a good reason because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is and if people listened to institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently.

And, to me that’s just malfeasance in office, I think that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. I think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since, well since September 11th at least, I mean. I think that they, um, they came into office with the intent to go to war. Um, that last part, I forget the name of the, um, Secretary of the Treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office, um, but it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too, which is also very underhanded way to do things. Well, I do think it’s gone on long enough, I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result, um, I think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like a coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order, but I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because, um, Iraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue, a major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point. Just from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all, that um, oh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happening and even Muqtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting, I guess it was less than a year ago, his party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government and I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that.

Okay, cool. Um, I'm sorry. Okay. Let's talk about the war in Iraq. Let me think. At this point, I feel it's kind of pointless because it's not even a declared war, actually. I feel like it was just a big revenge against Iraq because that's who we thought bombed the U.S. on 9/11. Like, who did the terrorist attacks? So I don't feel like I'm a big supporter of the War in Iraq.

So, and then like, if we stay there, then what's gonna happen is we have to try and create democracy, which is gonna take forever because democracy can't be built in just a day, and then if we like leave, they'll be mad at us because we messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves. Um, let me see. Oh, this is so hard. This is the one topic I don't know anything about. Um, war in Iraq. Oh, this is hard. Uh, I don't know. Do you have anything else I can go off of? Okay, thank you. Um, well, actually I think the war should continue because it's not fair, I don't think we should call it a war anymore, but because I don't think that's fair, you know, I think the only reason we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that, you know, we're big and American and stuff like that, and we have all these big guns, but I don't feel like there's a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore because like we didn't even call it a war. It shouldn't have even been called a war in the first place because it was never declared by Congress. I think that's how the whole thing works, you have to declare a war by Congress, then it's, I just don't think that it's a real big point to still stay over there and try. Actually, no, I do think it's a point to stay over there and try to help them, but it's also like wasting our resources, and especially like right now, I feel so bad for Bush because it's like, it's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now because of like what it's doing and it's like, and what it's doing to like, remember, I think with the whole Vietnam thing, the Vietnam War was like an undeclared war and it's now called a meaningless war, and he's like saying he'll be called like that president forever, that he started this meaningless war and stuff, so. You have to make this a half an hour don't you? Uh, okay, yeah, um, huh, I guess you could also say that it is, like, it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there's so many families that I know of whose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it's like, I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know, you want them to like, these people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took, I bet some of the kids don't even have a place to go to school anymore because it's so like unsafe and all these different little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other just because of like the different beliefs that they have.

It was prevented because someone went online and found that there was like... Oh, okay, um, no, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. On sites such as Myspace, if you post information on the internet, it's pretty much available for everyone to see. And I understand on Myspace, you know, you have to have another member to see someone's profile, you might need to be their friend or something like that. But if that's the case, you've already accepted that person as your friend so they can see it; you're giving them permission to see your profile. So, I mean, anytime you put information on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that, so if I think that was actually good, that someone saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost. Hum, um, that's tough because I mean obviously you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody's different profiles for all the students in the school to prevent that from happening, but then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, \"Oh, let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything.\" Um, I mean, I don't think it would really be right to have someone's job be to look at people's profiles, but I guess it all depends on like what situation they came across that profile or was someone just randomly looking at people's profiles and just randomly happened to see that or were they actually looking for some sort of evidence that the student was planning something? So, I don't really know. Sure, um, well, um, like, I mean, I don't have a Myspace personally, but I have a Facebook. I do, it bothers me that I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. And I saw something on TV once that was about this man who just tried to prove how he can get information so easily. He went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in like under a minute and got her to meet with him. And I mean, personally, I certainly wouldn't meet with someone like that, but I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names but they IM me and they know it's me, and it's hard because you think that they know your interests, they know what you look like, sometimes if you post your class schedule they know where you are during the day, who your friends are, they basically know a lot about you, all sorts of photos, and I tried to limit what I put up there, but at the same time, the whole point I think, the reason I have one is so you know I can communicate with some of my friends, I don't want to limit it too much, so it's a tricky issue because I only accept people I know, I mean, you never know really, who can look at what.

    "raw_output": "原文翻译为中文：\n\n我认为在美国，性别歧视仍然是一个问题。 \n并不是只有女性面临这种问题，我觉得它与你所从事的特定领域有关。 \n我觉得女性面临更大的困难，因为即使在理论上有平等，很多人还是很难找到一个可以接受女性领导的人。 \n这主要是因为社会的习惯性的问题。 \n而工作场合中的女性可能会看到一个适合她们的工作机会，并具备了其中所需的所有资格，但是董事会会拒绝册选她担任这一职位，因为历史上女性通常不被认为是商界的领导人。 \n而且同样地，男性也可能面临这种问题，特别是在时尚或家庭照顾领域。 \n在这些领域，男性居家照顾孩子的情况非常罕见，而人们往往视之为耻辱，因为社会认为男人应该是工薪阶层，应该是家庭的主要收入来源。 \n这对那些希望留在家中照顾孩子并帮助孩子成长的男性来说是很困难的，尤其是如果妻子有着更好的工作并且他们的生活状况良好的话。 \n在时尚界，人们往往不太重视男性，因为通常情况下，男性对时尚并不感兴趣。 \n我认为这也许是因为人们通常认为男性和时尚是矛盾的，所以如果一个男性对时尚感兴趣，人们会怀疑他的同性恋倾向。 \n我也不确定这句话是有道理的。 \n但我认为这是因为人们通常认为男性和时尚不太配。 \n因此，如果一个男性在时尚界工作，人们会怀疑他真正了解女性的审美观。 \n这就像人们在不知道一个女性在时尚界的经历时会怎么想一样。 \n而且，人们的性别偏见会在不同的职业领域有所不同。 \n我认为美国的社会中仍然存在性别歧视。 \n要改变这种现象很难，因为社会有着固有的观念，而且我们已经取得了很大的进步。 \n但是，这些进步还是很慢。 \n我认为如果我们继续以当前的速度，女性继续进入高层管理层并成为CEO，人们对他们的接受度会逐渐提高。 \n同样，人们对家中的男性照顾者也越来越接受了。 \n人们开始意识到，女性可能在事业上更成功。 \n而且，人们开始接受女性和男性在时尚界的合作。 \n因此，人们需要通过展示那些经常被歧视的人的优点而非强迫性别平等，并尝试在平等的基础上展示他们的优点。 \n如果强迫人们，人们就会抵制。 \n我认为我们正处于一个平衡点，性别平等正在得到逐渐的承认。 \n所以，我不确定我们现在能做些什么，因为如果我们太快推进，人们会对此产生抵制。 \n我们已经取得了很大的进步，改变需要时间。 \n是的。 \n我也认为不同的人可能会对彼此产生歧视，取决于他们所在的职业领域或他们的出身。 \n例如，如果有人在农村长大，他们的文法可能不太好，但他们非常聪明，他们可以通过自己的努力成为CEO。 \n即使他们的文法不太好，其他男性可能也会怀疑他们的能力。 \n同样，如果有人从事任何其他领域，他们可能也会因为他们的性别而受到歧视。 \n这可能是另一个例子。 \n不知道，不太清楚。\n\n翻译回英语：\n\n[REWRITE] I think that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States. It's not just women who face this problem, I think it's related to the specific field you're working in. I think women face more difficulties because even though there's supposed to be equality, many people still have a hard time accepting a woman as a leader. This is mainly due to societal habits. In the workplace, women may see a job that suits them and has all the qualifications, but the board will refuse to promote them to that position because historically, women are not seen as leaders in the business world. The same goes for men, especially in the fashion industry or taking care of the family at home. It's really uncommon for men to stay at home and take care of the children, and people look down on them because society thinks that men should be working to make a living, not staying at home. It's hard for men who want to stay at home and take care of their children, especially if their wives have better jobs and they're doing well. In the fashion industry, people don't take men seriously because they think it's not masculine to be interested in fashion. I'm not sure if this makes sense, but I think it's because people think men and fashion don't go well together. So if a man is in the fashion industry, people will think, \"How do I know if you really know about fashion if you're a man?\" Like, they don't really know what our case is like, like other guys. Depending on the field of work you're in, I think there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. It's hard to change because society has a set mindset, and we've made a lot of progress, but it's slow. I think if we continue at the pace we are now, and women are becoming CEOs and getting more accepted in the business world, it's a slow process, but it's happening, and people are starting to accept it more. And similarly, as men become stay-at-home dads, it's becoming more accepted because people realize, \"Oh, maybe the woman does have the better job, or she wants to be the one working.\" And for fashion, people will be like, \"Oh, wait, maybe they're listening to their female friends or their wives, and they do know where I'm coming from.\" So I guess you kinda have to promote it by showcasing the good qualities of the people who are stereotyped against without being too pushy, because if you force it, people will resist. And I think we're at a good balance where it's starting to be enforced like that. So I don't really know if there's anything we can do right now that isn't already being done because if you do it too fast, people will resist and we've made a lot of progress, and change takes time. Yes. And I guess people are also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or where you're from, like if you grew up on a farm and your grammar isn't the best, but you're extremely intelligent and you work your way up to a CEO job, even though you might not have the best grammar in the world, or even though you might be intelligent, but you don't have the best grammar in the world, other men might look down upon you and be like, \"How do I know you're really what you're saying if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right?\" So yeah, sometimes just where you're from can discriminate against you, and like from gender to gender, and I don't know, I guess that's another example.

So, when you're looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, they're not willing to make that kind of concession even if it would free up a lot of money for them.
