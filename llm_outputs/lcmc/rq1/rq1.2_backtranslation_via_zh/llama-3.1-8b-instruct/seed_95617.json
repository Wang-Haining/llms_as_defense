They have a lot of views that I think the Catholic Church isn't very accepting of a lot of things, which is why they're losing some of their followers. The Catholic Church has very strong views on things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which I think is fine, but they're a bit old-fashioned in some ways. So I think if they were to adapt to some newer styles of thinking, they wouldn't be worried about losing their followers. I've heard that a lot of people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a bit because of their views on these issues. Some people are starting to disagree with the Catholic Church on certain subjects, so they feel that the Catholic Church has the wrong views on things. I mean, the Catholic Church is against abortion, so if you're for abortion you might not feel comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong and something you were against. It's similar with gay marriage, where if that's something you believe in and want to do or feel strongly about, you might not want to be in a following where they disagree with that. I don't see any reason why they can't have female priests or that priests can't be married, but I'm not sure if that would have necessarily prevented these problems. I don't think it would have changed anything, actually. I don't think they would have done anything differently if they were allowed to be married or if there were female priests. The Catholic Church says that priests are married to God and devoted to their whole life, but I don't see why regular people can't have both a job and a family life, so I don't see why priests can't have both.

And a lot of scientific studies have been done because it's a hot topic these days, and homosexual couples have the same kind of rates of success, they have the same factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do. It's just it's a relationship, it's the same thing. And I think where a lot of people get hung up is homosexuals aren't asking for the right to get married in a church, they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. And if there's no involvement with church and state then that shouldn't be an issue. Because I don't understand where people like Catholics can get hung up on oh well that's against our religion and that's morally wrong for us and we can't approve of that sort of thing. But in a legal sense, if you're allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage. It's like segregation, separate but unequal. Yeah, they are, they're the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that. And people worry about like adoption issues and community issues, like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community. And especially about, um, children of gay couples and how they'll adjust to society and whether or not they'll, um, be influenced by their parent's, um, sexual orientation choices or not. But well again it's kind of new and stuff, but it's kind of hard to say I'm not sure about the children aspect about adoption. Because I think the main drawback to that is, um, how children get treated by their peers and by other adults in society. Like in New York City, I know they um, they have special schools for children of gay parents, because in public schools in New York City they get, um, beaten up. And stuff like that, parents protest to get the child removed from their school, and it's just a kid, I mean, they're gonna have the same points of view and everything, parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. And so they can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to, I mean it's just about personality choices. I think the federal government should be very involved in this issue, making gay marriage legal in every state, I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But well I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion. Well, his um, his take on gay marriage actually um, I think it goes along with his take on abortion and stem cell research which, um, I think most of the reasons I'm not sure about this, because honestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot, but most of the reasons I've heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons, and morality I don't want to say it's negotiable, but it definitely differs from person to person, and to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and um, morality concepts of all the rest is unethical. To just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account to go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy, considering I mean about um, under god in the pledge of allegiance and how people are so opposed to that, but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country. Um, just one, lots of people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged, and the gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents, or just a personality defect. And that is also not a good reason, because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is, and if people listened to um, institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently.

I think early on the Bush administration linked the Iraq War to Osama bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which has since been proven false. And that really rubbed me the wrong way and in general, the Iraq War just boils my blood.\n\n(um) It just seems to me that the Bush administration has been openly lying to the American people and has yet to own up to it. Even Colin Powell, I mean after he came back from that big presentation he gave at the UN, now says that he wasn't entirely convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it. And to me, that's just a dereliction of duty, I think it's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. I think the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the Constitution and has been trying to erode it since at least 9/11, I mean they came into office with the intent to go to war.\n\n(um) That last part... I forgot the name of the Secretary of the Treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office...

    "transformed": "(laughs) I was just wondering, I was initially okay with the premise, but I think everyone was still reeling from the 9/11 attacks and this pretext brought us into Iraq, all sorts of pretexts got us into Iraq. I think early on the Bush administration linked the Iraq War to Osama bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which has since been proven false. And that really rubbed me the wrong way and in general, the Iraq War just boils my blood.\n\n(um) It just seems to me that the Bush administration has been openly lying to the American people and has yet to own up to it. Even Colin Powell, I mean after he came back from that big presentation he gave at the UN, now says that he wasn't entirely convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it. And to me, that's just a dereliction of duty, I think it's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. I think the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the Constitution and has been trying to erode it since at least 9/11, I mean they came into office with the intent to go to war.\n\n(um) That last part... I forgot the name of the Secretary of the Treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office...

implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t

dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and

Well, to start from the beginning, I don't think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war. Before invading Iraq, I think they tried to link the invasion of Iraq to the 9/11 terrorist attacks when in reality there wasn't much of a connection between the two. However, the government made it seem like there was a connection and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003. Um, I'm against war, especially a preemptive strike, I was against that. And I think the war in Iraq is kind of a repeat of the Vietnam War in many ways. The government should have learned from past mistakes that they made with the Vietnam War. I mean, a tremendous amount of American soldiers have died and that's horrible. What they were doing was removing the countries government and I really don't think the government was prepared for the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur. Um, and the government and so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and trying to implant a democratic government, which is kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam. They were trying to push out Communists and uphold or implement democracy. And I think that the government, the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn't going to be a clear victory like it wasn't a clear victory in Vietnam because no matter how many people may have supported the invasion or no matter how many Iraqis may have wanted the US to come in there's going to be a large number of insurgents and it's hard to put them down when you're not fighting an actual army. You're fighting the citizens of the country. So I think that the government, the US government should have planned for all possible outcomes. I think the government was not as prepared as it should have been, I mean, they didn't really plan for what would happen once they removed the Iraqi government. I mean, we're still there today, almost the end of 2006 and we're still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it's a long process. And I just think that the US government in a way tried to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a short successful stay in Iraq. I mean, we shouldn't be naive in thinking that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to have it become successful. I mean, in our own country, democracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was lots of tension and there was civil war. Um, it's just not an easy thing to do and I think the government, the US government made it seem like it was a relatively easy thing to do. And so, the war in Iraq, well, that's a difficult decision to make because once you go in there and we've been in there for so long, how can we abandon these people? I mean, we're the ones that took away their government and their way of life so how can we abandon them now? So, it's probably something that we should try to see to its finish but again, there's also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and how much is too much to keep risking for a free democratic Iraq. I mean, going back to the whole reason for invading Iraq, I mean, if we're invading Iraq and making it a democratic nation, why is it just Iraq? Why aren't we doing this to all these other countries?

But if it's brought to the attention of the school officials, then there's no invasion of privacy there. And if there's danger, they have to take it seriously. Like I said, I don't think they should be monitoring phone conversations and texts and IMs. If it's brought to their attention, then it's something completely different. Uh, yeah, don't. Like a teacher shouldn't make a Facebook or a Myspace account under a different name and friend their students. That's the same thing. I wouldn't friend my residents because frankly, I don't want to know if they're going out drinking and then posting their pictures on Facebook. Then that pops up and I have to see that and I have to do something about it. It's not my place, so I don't even want that connection there. Uh, not really.",

Uh, it was prevented because someone went online and found out that there was like some activity happening. O, okay, um, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. Like on a site such as Myspace, if you post information online, it's pretty much available for everyone to see. And I understand on Myspace, you know you have to have someone else be a member in order to see someone's profile, you might need to know them or something like that, but if that's the case, you've accepted that person as your \"friend\" so they can see it, you're giving them permission to see your profile. So, I mean, anytime you put information online, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that, so if I think that was actually good, that someone saw it and was able to prevent a life from being lost. Hmm, um, that's tough because I mean obviously you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody's different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that, but then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, \"Let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything,\" um, I mean, I don't think it would really be right to go and have somebody's job be to look at people's profiles, but I guess it all depends on like what situation they came across that profile or was someone just randomly looking at people's and just randomly happened to see that or were they actually looking for some sort of evidence that the student was planning something, so I don't really know. Sure, um, well, um, like I mean I don't have a Myspace but I have a Facebook, I do, it bothers me that I know that there are creepy people out there who can see things about me, and I saw something on TV once that was about this, um, this man who just was just trying to prove how he can get information so easily and he went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in like you know less than a minute and got her to meet with him, and I mean, personally I certainly wouldn't meet with someone but I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names but they IM me and they know that it's me, and it's hard because you think that they know your interests, they know what you look like, sometimes if you put your class schedule they know where you are during the day, who your friends are, they pretty much know a lot about you, all sorts of photos, and I tried to limit what I put up there, but at the same time, the whole point, I think, the reason I have one is so you know I can communicate with some of my friends, I don't want to limit it too much, so it's a tricky issue because I only accept people I know, I mean you never know really who can look at what, so. Hmm, uh, well, I heard my roommate was telling me that her high school she was there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school, and that struck me as a little bit strange, like I wasn't sure how high school officials had the power to tell their students that they weren't allowed to have a Myspace, and I don't know if that's really a privacy issue, but I think I don't really know how they had the right to tell people, that's the only other thought I can think of.

I've yet to hear a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should. I mean, if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year, I guess I wouldn't really have a problem with that. But, I just don't see a reason why we shouldn't just leave now. I mean, I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now. And like these are the people that we're trying to save, like we're trying to help telling us to leave. I mean, I think they might know better than that. And at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes, then you know it's not on us if something happens. You know, if it completely goes to shit, we could be like, well, we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision not to. And then you know at least we'll be the good guys, kind of.

A lot of Catholics believe they have to go to church every week and they're very strict on how things are done and sometimes I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to a tee and they don't accept people who aren't exactly perfect Catholics and they also don't accept people of other religions. For example my mom was an Episcopalian no I'm sorry my dad was an Episcopalian my mom was a Catholic and they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion.

Um, should I elaborate more on that? \n\nYes, uh, alright, well, um, hmm, it's a lot easier to express yourself, um, a lot longer when you're writing, but, alright, well, um, like what I was saying, it is a public thing, um, and with a student posting something on Myspace, and not expecting to get in trouble, that's ridiculous, um, everything, like I'm uh, worried to post stuff like even through emails, um, like if I have something not good about somebody to say I don't ever say that on an email because I'm afraid somebody somehow will pick that up, and you know, everything like, everything nowadays comes back, and you know, bites you in the butt, I guess you could say. \n\nUm, like, you know, if you do something while you're a college student then you grow up to be some important guy they will like find an email that you sent somehow, and, like, once it's on the internet it's always on the internet, and, um, you know, if you do something like that there's no way of getting out of it, you will get in trouble, and I don't, it wasn't an invasion at all of privacy, because, you know, like I said before, and, well, that's basically all I've been saying was it's a public thing, and, um, I don't know, let's see here. \n\nUm, like I had said before I don't feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students, but, if they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place, um, then I feel as though that's perfectly fine for them, or, um, other officials such as the police to go on, um, you know, when parents drop their students off at school they feel as though, you know, they're dropping them off at a safe place, I've actually discussed that with a, um, a teacher of mine, I went to a public high school, and, um, they say, you know, we have to ensure stuff like this, because, like, we would do like lock downs, and stuff, and, um, that's like in reference to the terrorist attacks, uh, we had to be safe about that, we had like drill stuff, and, even though that doesn't have anything to do with the, well, I mean it kind of does have something to do with the school shooting, because, um, that was in case people would come into the building I guess, um, so we, you know, we did practice that stuff, um, in order to make the school a safer place, and, that's just what the school officials were doing in this case, they were just making it a safer place, um, preventing anything bad from happening, like, Columbine or something like that, um, yeah that's basically all I can come up with. \n\nUh, no, that's about it",

I was all for going over there and pretty much creating as much chaos as they did over here. I think that since it was such an emotional thing that happened, I think we overlooked a lot of things and didn't really think about the long run. We kind of just went over there like unprepared without a plan. And I really think that it backfired on us. I uh, I don't know. I was all for it, but now I'm very against it. I don't think it did anything. I think the people over there, as long as they're fighting with each other, they can't be fighting with us as well. Like I don't think us being over there is gonna do anything if they're, if they can't even get along with themselves. So um, like unfortunately because of 9/11 I've almost just, I just don't care about what goes on over there. I just don't care, I just think they're not human, they fight with each other and they can't, they just can't do anything themselves. So I really don't care. Um, I don't know. We definitely went over there just unprepared, we didn't know like what we were gonna face over there. And it's also bad because war for them is very different than war for us, they're just like savage people when it comes to war, and I don't think they're looking to better their country, I just think they're looking to get us out of there. And I think that should be fine for us, I think we should just leave and that's really it. Um, we just, I think we were just more like, just hyped up than anything, I don't think we were thinking rationally about like what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle and um, I just, we pretty much just went over there looking for revenge, I think, and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened, and um, also I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq. Um, but at the time I see where he was coming from, we really, I don't think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can't just do that and then us just say okay let's rebuild and that's it. So um, I don't think we could have let it go, but I think we could have just had a better plan of what we were gonna do, I don't think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of, I guess like creating order, and I don't know, I just think that they didn't have a plan, there was no, no like unity, they didn't know what they were going in there for, so I think that would have helped us out a lot more. But like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with, so that's what we created in turn in there. Um, and honestly I don't, I don't think we're the ones to change those people, I honestly think they're always going to be like that, and um, I don't, I really don't have anything else to say, it's gone on for definitely long enough, um, I don't think we're making enough progress, like we've made progress, but not enough to stay in there, and I think no matter how long we stay in there, once we leave, it's just gonna collapse, and we can't stay over there forever, so I think we're just hurting ourselves by staying over there, no.
