They have strong views which are fine but a bit outdated. They have been talking about how the Catholic Church is losing some of its followers and I think it's because the Catholic Church isn't very accepting of a lot of things. For example, gay marriages, abortion, birth control, etc. They have a very strong viewpoint on these things which is understandable. But the problem is if they were to adapt to a bit of a newer way of thinking they wouldn't be worried about losing followers. Some people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church because they see their stance on these issues as old-fashioned and so some people are starting to disagree with them on certain subjects. They feel that the Catholic Church has the wrong view on things. The Catholic Church is against abortion, so if you're for abortion you might not be comfortable following a church that teaches it's completely wrong and that you're against it. The same goes for gay marriage, etc. If you believe in it and want to do it or feel strongly about it, you might not want to be in a church that doesn't agree with that. I don't see any reason why women can't be priests or why priests can't be married. But I don't know if that would have prevented what happened. I don't know if they would have done things differently if they were allowed to be married or have women priests. But I don't know if that would have changed things. They did what they did and that didn't seem to be affected. I mean, if they were married would they have done things differently? It's hard to really tell. I don't see why priests can't be married, the Catholic Church says that priests are married to God and devote their whole life to God, but everyone else who has a job in the world has their job and also has their family life and other people they're devoted to, so I don't see why priests can't have both.

I believe the Bush administration at the time tied the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, and claimed that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, which was later proven to be false. That really got under my skin, and overall, the Iraq war has been a real sore spot for me. \n\nI think the Bush administration was very openly lying to the American people and still hasn't owned up to it. Even Colin Powell has come out and said that he wasn't entirely convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he presented it at the UN. To me, that's a serious malfeasance in office, and I think it's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. I think the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it since at least the 9/11 attacks. They came into office with the intention of going to war, I believe. \n\nThat last part, I forget the name of the Secretary of the Treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was likely fired from his office. It seems to me that the younger Bush came in with a bloodlust feeling towards Saddam Hussein due to his dad's administration, and I think he was hoping to expand our energy supply in the long run, which is also a very underhanded way to do things. \n\nWell, I think it's gone on long enough. I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now, though, because there's a good chance the country would lapse into civil war, and more people would die as a result. I think the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving towards now seems to be like a coalition of nations from the surrounding area, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, coming in to try to restore order. But I'm not entirely sure that's a good idea either because I think in the long term it will also cause more problems because Iraq's sovereignty will become a major issue. \n\nAs it stands, the interim government is dissolving, and from the news reports, I've heard that the Iraqi Parliament is not very effective at all. The Prime Minister doesn't really have control over the political process, and even Muqtada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting less than a year ago, his party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament, and we're still dealing with these fractious radical elements vying for control of the government.

want to say something.\nMmhmm\nJust say anything?\nOkay\nOkay, that's cool\nUmum\nI'm sorry\nOkay\nLet's talk about how I feel about the Iraq War.\nLet me think\nAt this point, I think it's pointless because it wasn't even declared a war.\nI think it's just to get back at Iraq because we think they did the 9/11 attack.\nSo I don't think it's a reason for anything.\nI mean, I'm not a big person on the War in Iraq.\nSo I don't really keep up with it.\nI don't know the details of it.\nBut I do know that we're staying there to try to build a democracy, so it can become like another U.S. thing.\nAnd also to get oil and resources from them.\nBut that's no reason to stay there because it's just making everyone mad.\nSo if we stay there, what's going to happen is we have to try to build a democracy, which takes forever because you can't build a democracy in just a day.\nAnd then if we leave, they'll be mad at us because we messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves.\nUm let me think\nThis is a really hard topic\nThis is one topic I don't know anything about\nUm Iraq War\nOh this is hard\nUh I don't know\nDo you have anything else I can go off of?\nOkay thanks\nUm Well actually I think\nI think the war should continue because it's not fair\nI don't think we should call it a war anymore\nBecause I don't think\nYou know\nThe only reason we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that\nYou know\nThat we're big and we're American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns\nBut I don't think there's a huge reason for us to call it a war anymore\nBecause like we didn't even call it\nIt shouldn't have even been called a war in the first place\nBecause it was never declared a war by Congress\nI think that's how it works\nYou have to declare a war by Congress\nAnd then it's\nI just don't think it's a big point to still stay over there and try\nActually no\nI do think it's a point to stay over there and try to help them\nBut it's also like wasting our resources\nAnd especially right now I feel so bad for Bush because it's like\nIt's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now\nBecause of like what it's doing and it's like\nAnd what it's doing to like\nRemember\nI think with the whole Vietnam thing\nThe Vietnam War was like an undeclared war and it's now called like a meaningless war\nAnd he's like saying\nHe'll be called like that president forever\nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff\nSo\nYou have to make this a half an hour don't you?\nUh\nOkay yeah\nUm\nI guess you could also say that it is\nLike it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there's so many families that I know of that are in\nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it's like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like\nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took\nI bet some of the kids don't even have a place to go to school\nAnymore because it's so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other\nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have\nBut then again\nIt's like\nIt's hard to say\nI want them in there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States\nThat it's going to be even worse for them\nAnd it's going to be\nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we're now trying to change them\nAnd they've been going on this whole like\nTotalitarian\nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that\nYou

    "original": "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of

It's completely public. You can't control people's opinions about you. As an RA, I've already had to deal with this kind of situation. When you put something out there, it affects your image. Especially if you're talking about explosions or shootings, people will say something. You can't just let that out and expose it to the public. The internet is open to everyone. If you're friends with someone on Myspace, you'll get that bulletin from them. If it wasn't the school that sent the bulletin, then someone went to the school and they have to take action. They can't just let it sit there because then God forbid something happens, they might be able to prevent it. [Right] On the other hand, you don't know what to take seriously because some people just mess around like that. Maybe it could be like the situation we had at school where the experiment went terribly wrong. Maybe it's just a sociology class experiment that didn't go well. I think I forgot the word for a minute. It could be something serious or something very dangerous. What happened here was that something happened and someone overheard someone saying something in the school, then they reported it, and when we finally figured out who the person was, they looked through their Facebook and got worried because there were some things on there that he might have meant as a joke but became serious in the situation. When you put something out on the internet, there's no invasion of privacy. If you don't want it out there, don't put it out. If you don't want someone to find it, don't post it. If you don't want someone to think something about you, you can't control their thoughts. You can't control people's perceptions of what's serious or not. I think school officials shouldn't be friending their students on Myspace and Facebook and monitoring them, and looking through their Facebooks and Myspaces and all those things and Xangas and Live Journals.

    "transformed": "When you put something on the internet, it becomes a public forum. It's completely public. You can't control people's opinions about you. As an RA, I've already had to deal with this kind of situation. When you put something out there, it affects your image. Especially if you're talking about explosions or shootings, people will say something. You can't just let that out and expose it to the public. The internet is open to everyone. If you're friends with someone on Myspace, you'll get that bulletin from them. If it wasn't the school that sent the bulletin, then someone went to the school and they have to take action. They can't just let it sit there because then God forbid something happens, they might be able to prevent it. [Right] On the other hand, you don't know what to take seriously because some people just mess around like that. Maybe it could be like the situation we had at school where the experiment went terribly wrong. Maybe it's just a sociology class experiment that didn't go well. I think I forgot the word for a minute. It could be something serious or something very dangerous. What happened here was that something happened and someone overheard someone saying something in the school, then they reported it, and when we finally figured out who the person was, they looked through their Facebook and got worried because there were some things on there that he might have meant as a joke but became serious in the situation. When you put something out on the internet, there's no invasion of privacy. If you don't want it out there, don't put it out. If you don't want someone to find it, don't post it. If you don't want someone to think something about you, you can't control their thoughts. You can't control people's perceptions of what's serious or not. I think school officials shouldn't be friending their students on Myspace and Facebook and monitoring them, and looking through their Facebooks and Myspaces and all those things and Xangas and Live Journals. But if it's brought to their attention, there's no invasion of privacy because it's brought by someone you gave access to. And if there's danger, they have to take it seriously.

Because generally, everyone agrees it was a bad idea, except within the administration, because they don't want to admit they were wrong. And, um, you just have to look at recent polls.

    "raw_output": "首先，我將英文文本翻譯成中文：\n\n我覺得美國社會中仍然存在著性别歧视問題。雖然不是只有女性受到影響，只是女性在某些特定的領域會較為困難。例如，即使在理想上應該有平等的環境下，許多人仍難以找到願意與女性合作的職位。這是因為社會觀念已經深深植根。許多時候，女性會發現自己有資格擔任某個職位，但是委員會不會選擇將她提升到那個職位，因為歷史上女性在事業世界中不常見。同樣地，同樣的問題也出現在男性身上，例如時尚界或家庭照顧。通常情況下，男性不會在家裡照顧孩子。許多人會歧視這樣的情況，因為他們認為男人應該工作賺錢。這樣會對男性造成很大的壓力，因為他可能是他孩子和妻子的夢想照顧孩子和幫助妻子事業蓬勃。雖然事實上這樣的家庭生活理想地運行著，但是社會仍會歧視它。另外，在時尚界，許多人會拒絕認真對待男性，因為他們覺得時尚與男性不符。許多時尚界的人認為，如果你是一個典型的男性，跟時尚沒有關係。有時會有人問，那我們怎麼知道你對時尚的看法是正確的，如果你只是個男人，跟時尚沒有關係。這樣的時尚界對男性的歧視跟女性很相似。所以，身在不同領域的人都會因為性别而受到歧視。\n\n然後，我用相同的中文文本再翻譯回英文：\n\n[REWRITE] I think there is still gender discrimination in American society. Although it's not just women who are affected, women will find it more difficult in certain specific fields. For example, even though there should be an equal environment, many people still have a hard time finding a job where they can work together with a woman. This is because the social concept has deeply taken root. Many times, women will find they have the qualifications for a certain job, but the board won't choose to promote them to that position because historically women are not often seen in the upper echelons of the business world. The same thing is true for men, such as in the fashion industry or taking care of the family. It's very rare for a man to stay at home and take care of the children. Many people stigmatize this because they think men should be working to make money. This can be very hard on men because they may have always dreamed of staying at home to take care of the children and help their wives' careers thrive, and it's working out fine for them, but society stigmatizes it. In the fashion industry, many people won't take males seriously if they're straight. I'm not sure if that makes sense, but I think it's because males who are into fashion typically have different lifestyles. So if you have the typical male lifestyle and you're in the fashion industry, people will be like, \"Wait, how do I really know if you know fashion if it's for a woman? You don't really know what our case is like.\" Depending on the field of work you're in, I feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. To change it is kind of more difficult because society has a set mindset and we've come a long way from the 1800s and made leaps and bounds, but change is slow. So I feel that if we continue at the pace we are now, because women are rising to higher positions and becoming CEOs and getting more accepted in the business world, and it's a slow process, but it's happening and people are starting to accept it more. Just like how men who are stay-at-home dads are becoming more accepted because they realize, \"Oh, wait, maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works,\" and um, then for like fashion people will be like, \"Oh, wait, maybe they're listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff,\" and so they do know like where I'm coming from. So I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotyped against by not being too pushy but saying like the qualities of them. Because if you force it people are going to resist. And I feel that we're kind of at a good balance where it's starting to become enforced like that. So I don't really know if there's anything that we can do right now that isn't already being done because if you do it too fast it's like people will resist, and we've come a long way and change takes time. Yes, um, well, I guess they're probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you're from. Like if you grew up on a farm and your grammar may not be the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you work your way up into a CEO job, even though you may not have the best grammar in the world or even though you may be intelligent but you don't have the best grammar in the world, other men might look down upon you and be like, \"Well, how do I know you're really what you're saying if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right?\" So, yeah, so like sometimes just where you're from can discriminate against you and like from gender to gender.

Which knocked it down from a serious criminal offense to more like a traffic ticket. You know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that. I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it, then you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that, those types of ramifications which are usually the worst of having a drug charge would. I mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge. Well, depending on the charge. At least for a marijuana charge, one thing that a lot of kids worry about, a lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don't necessarily go away when it's decriminalized. But at the same time, there is an argument that it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them, and to house them and then to let them go, and then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times, and then appoint a public defender, and then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney's office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges. I mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do. And um, I mean so, when you're looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, I mean a lot of them just philosophically aren't willing to make that kind of concession, even if it would free up a lot of money for then. Like a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don't want to do that. But in a place like Denver, where people tend to be more on the kind of open, I have to use the word liberal, but you know what I mean, kind of thought track, then I think it's totally fine, and I'm sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education, that they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on, you know, food programs for the homeless people. Um, I mean so, I think it's, it's important, I mean marijuana isn't something that you just want out and out to be everywhere all over the streets and stuff, I mean for a variety of reasons, but there's this whole like financial element to it as well, other reasons, like, why it shouldn't necessarily be totally legalized, well no, I mean I, I don't know how I would feel about, well because if it were totally like legalized, I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere, then I mean, I guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving, and um, it still is like taboo in our society, in a lot of places and a lot of contexts, uh, to smoke marijuana, so, to have it out in the open like that, I feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people. Um, and, sorry what? The volume on the microphone is kind of low, um, I don't really know, um, I think in general, alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills, um, but I think in general, marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle, as opposed to just their decision-making motor skills, I mean, but they, they both have their adverse effects, and I mean they, I feel like when it comes to substances in general, like no two people really react the same way, I mean, and then people, some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have, and then some people know how to exercise moderation, and then some people don't, so, it, I guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance, when people react differently, but I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects, um, yeah, uh, no I don't.

    "transformed": "My understanding is that they didn't completely legalize it, but rather decriminalized it. Which knocked it down from a serious criminal offense to more like a traffic ticket. You know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that. I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it, then you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that, those types of ramifications which are usually the worst of having a drug charge would. I mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge. Well, depending on the charge. At least for a marijuana charge, one thing that a lot of kids worry about, a lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don't necessarily go away when it's decriminalized. But at the same time, there is an argument that it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them, and to house them and then to let them go, and then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times, and then appoint a public defender, and then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney's office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges. I mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do. And um, I mean so, when you're looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, I mean a lot of them just philosophically aren't willing to make that kind of concession, even if it would free up a lot of money for then.

It's good to be rooted in tradition, but it's also important to be adaptable to change. Many Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week, and they're very strict on how things are done. Sometimes I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to a tee, and they don't accept people who aren't exactly perfect Catholics. They also don't accept people of other religions. For example, my mom was an Episcopalian, my dad was an Episcopalian, my mom was a Catholic, and they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. And that's not really like being tolerant of other religions. We always learned to know that you have to love others, that's a Catholic teaching, but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in a way like that. So I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things, but then the Catholic practice goes against it because it's so outdated, but they continue to stick with it anyway. I don't think that would necessarily influence it, I mean I personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry, but as I don't think that would necessarily deter them from their, like, pedophilic behavior, so because it's just a different realm, it might, but I probably don't think that that would be an issue. Well, I guess like people who molest children, probably would do that regardless of whether they have a spouse or not, because it's a child which is different than a spouse, so if you're going to do something like that, you're probably going to do it whether or not you're married, like I don't think, allowing priests to be married would prevent, uh, those things from happening, I think that would probably happen regardless.
