Their views are a bit outdated. The Catholic Church has been talking about how they are losing some of their followers. I think this is because the Catholic Church is not very open to many things. For example, gay marriage, abortion, birth control - they have very strong views on them. Their views on these things might be reasonable, but some are outdated. If they could adapt to some more modern ways of thinking, they wouldn't be afraid of losing followers.\n\nMany people are starting to feel disenchanted with the Catholic Church because of their views on these things. Some people are starting to disagree with them on these issues. So, I think the Catholic Church's views are probably wrong. The Catholic Church is against abortion, so if you support abortion, you might not want to join a church that teaches it's completely wrong and you're going against it.\n\nSimilarly, if you support gay marriage, you might not want to join a church that doesn't agree with that. The Catholic Church doesn't allow women to be priests, so if you support that change, you might not want to join a church that opposes women priests.\n\nI don't think there's any reason why priests can't get married or women can't be priests. They say priests are already married to God and have completely dedicated their lives to God. But almost everyone has their job and family life, and they care about other things. So, I don't think priests can't have both their work and family life.\n\n[/REWRITE]",

Um just one lots of people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged and the gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents or just a personality defect. And that is also not a good reason because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is and if people listened to institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently.

But I don't necessarily know that that's a good idea either, because I think in the long term, that will also cause more problems, because, um, Iraq's sovereignty will come to be an issue, a major issue, there, because I think it's pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point. \n\nJust from the news reports I've heard, it doesn't seem that the Parliament is very effective at all. That um, oh I can't remember his name, but the Prime Minister really has no control over the political process, or what's happening, and even Muqtada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting, I guess it was less than a year ago, his party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament, and I mean we're still dealing with these fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government. And I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that. \n\nUm, (laughs) none that I can articulate in polite company.",

    "original": "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big

I'll translate the Chinese version back to English:\n\n[REWRITE]The war in Iraq\n\nOkay\nThe war in Iraq\nWell\nI don't think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war\nBefore invading Iraq, I think they\nI think they tried to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, when in reality, they didn't have much to do with each other\nHowever, the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003\nUh\nI\nI myself and pretty much against war so\nEspecially to make a preemptive strike, I was against that\nUh\nAnd I think that the war in Iraq is kind of\nA repeat in many ways of the Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with\n\nI mean the tremendous amount of American soldiers have died\n\nAnd that's horrible and what they were doing is that they were taking out the country's government and I really don't think the government, the American government was prepared for the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur\nUh\nAnd the government and the United States is removing the Iraqi government and they are trying to implant a democratic government and it's kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam\nThey were trying to push out the Communists and implement and uphold democracy\nAnd it's and it's and the government and the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn't going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn't like it wasn't a clear loss in Vietnam because\nBecause there were there are no matter how many people may have supported no matter how many Iraqis have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in, there's going to be a large number of insurgents and it's hard to put them down when you're not fighting an actual army\n\nYou're fighting the citizens of the country and the specific citizens in the country and so I think the government should have been more prepared for all possible outcomes I think the government was not as prepared as it should have been I mean it's not planning for what would happen once they removed the Iraqi government and we're still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we're still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it's a long process and I just think that the US government in a way tried to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a short successful stay in Iraq and I mean we shouldn't have been so naive because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to have it become successful\n\nI mean in our own country democracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was lots of tension and there was civil war and it's just not an easy thing to do and I think the government the US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do and uh so so let's see the war in Iraq\n\nWell that's no that's no that's a difficult decision to make because that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election like the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and so I mean once you go in there and we've been in there for so long how can we abandon these people I mean we're the ones that took away their government and their way of life so how can we abandon them now so it's probably something that we should try to see to its finish but then again there's also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and how much is too much to keep risking for a free democratic Iraq I mean going back to the whole reason for invading Iraq I mean if we're invading Iraq and making it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq why aren't we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is the oil issue and this is where we are getting our oil from and it's usually all about money and controlling resources I mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found and yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them so I don't think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions\n\nLet's see uh I just hope that it ends soon and there will be peace there soon but probably not [/REWRITE]",

I was, but it's not really important anymore because everyone in the world thinks it was a bad idea, except within the administration, because they don't want to admit they were wrong. And, I mean, just look at the recent polls. They've done United States polls, Iraqi polls, and global polls, and I mean, no, about seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population thinks it was a bad idea. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of troops stationed there. It's like the US troops stationed there now think it was a dumb idea and we should pull out within a year. I don't know, it's just been a complete disaster from before we even went in. It was already a disaster, and now pulling out is also going to be a disaster. There's really no easy way to deal with the Middle East anymore. I mean, I think it's just the cultural clash between the United States and the Middle Eastern states. I mean, it's just too big of a gap for this administration, or any administration, to understand. They think they can just bring democracy into an area where it shouldn't exist. Like that's not the way that this totally different group of people would choose to run their lives. I mean, sure, Saddam was a bad guy, no one's arguing that. But, I mean, you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's going to turn into just a complete disaster, like quicksand when we went in. I don't even know what to say about it. I don't really see a reason to stay in there. I mean, I'm sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas about why it's better to stay in there, and the problems that might arise from us pulling out, I don't agree with them. I haven't heard a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should. I mean, if they want to gradually pull out over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year, I guess I wouldn't have a problem with that. But, I just don't see a reason why we shouldn't just leave now. I mean, I read a statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year, and at least a quarter of them think we should just leave now. And like these are the people we're trying to save, we're trying to help, telling us to leave. I think they might know better than that. And at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes, then you know it's not on us if something happens. You know, if it completely falls apart, we could say, \"We wanted to stay in, but you guys made the decision to leave.\" Then, you know, at least we'll be the good guys, kind of. Not really, no.

I was, but it's not really important anymore because everyone in the world thinks it was a bad idea, except within the administration, because they don't want to admit they were wrong. And, I mean, just look at the recent polls. They've done United States polls, Iraqi polls, and global polls, and I mean, no, about seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population thinks it was a bad idea. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of troops stationed there. It's like the US troops stationed there now think it was a dumb idea and we should pull out within a year. I don't know, it's just been a complete disaster from before we even went in. It was already a disaster, and now pulling out is also going to be a disaster. There's really no easy way to deal with the Middle East anymore. I mean, I think it's just the cultural clash between the United States and the Middle Eastern states. I mean, it's just too big of a gap for this administration, or any administration, to understand. They think they can just bring democracy into an area where it shouldn't exist. Like that's not the way that this totally different group of people would choose to run their lives. I mean, sure, Saddam was a bad guy, no one's arguing that. But, I mean, you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's going to turn into just a complete disaster, like quicksand when we went in. I don't even know what to say about it. I don't really see a reason to stay in there. I mean, I'm sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas about why it's better to stay in there, and the problems that might arise from us pulling out, I don't agree with them. I haven't heard a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should. I mean, if they want to gradually pull out over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year, I guess I wouldn't have a problem with that. But, I just don't see a reason why we shouldn't just leave now. I mean, I read a statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year, and at least a quarter of them think we should just leave now. And like these are the people we're trying to save, we're trying to help, telling us to leave. I think they might know better than that. And at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes, then you know it's not on us if something happens. You know, if it completely falls apart, we could say, \"We wanted to stay in, but you guys made the decision to leave.\" Then, you know, at least we'll be the good guys, kind of. Not really, no. We'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, but, you know, it'll be better than where we stand right now.",

    "raw_output": "首先将英文翻译为中文：\n\n我觉得美国仍然存在性别歧视问题，尤其是在某些特定的工作领域。虽然不是所有的女性都面临着这样的问题，但我认为女性在某些领域比男性更容易受到歧视。因为，即使社会已经推崇平等，很多人仍然难以接受在女性领导下工作。社会长期以来培养的价值观使得人们无法接受女性在职场中担任领导职务。有时女性会看到适合自己的工作，并具备必要的资格，但却因为历史原因被拒绝提升为高级职位。同样，男性也会受到歧视，尤其是在时尚行业和家庭主妇领域。社会往往要求男性成为家庭的主要收入来源，并且当男性决定成为家庭主妇时会受到歧视，因为人们认为他们应该在职场上工作。这会使男性感到很难，因为他们的梦想是陪伴孩子成长并帮助照顾孩子，而妻子可能有更好的工作而且情况良好。但是，社会会因为他们的选择而看不起他们。同样，男性在时尚行业的同事可能会因为是男性而不被认真对待。通常，男性会因为他们的生活方式而被人怀疑是否真正了解时尚界。人们可能会认为，如果你是一个典型的男性，并且在时尚界工作，那么你很难了解女性的时尚需求。\n\n经过翻译后，我们可以看到一些歧视的例子。例如，人们可能会因为你的社会背景、性别或家庭地位而对你产生偏见。这些偏见可以使你难以在职场上成功。然而，我们也看到一些积极的变化，人们开始接受女性在职场中担任领导职务，男性成为家庭主妇的现象也变得更加普遍。\n\n现在，将翻译的中文再翻译回英文：\n\n[REWRITE] I think there is still a problem of gender discrimination in the United States, especially in certain specific fields of work.  Although it's not just women who face these problems, I think women face more difficulties in certain fields because, even if society promotes equality, a lot of people have a hard time accepting a woman in a leadership position.  The values that have been cultivated in society for a long time make it difficult for people to accept women in leadership positions in the workplace.  Sometimes women will see a job that is suitable for them and have the necessary qualifications, but are refused promotion to a higher position because of historical reasons.  The same thing happens to men, especially in the fashion industry and as stay-at-home dads.  Society tends to expect men to be the main breadwinners of the family and looks down on them when they decide to be stay-at-home dads, because they think they should be working.  This makes it difficult for men because their dream is to be with their kids and help raise them, and maybe their wife has a better job and it works out fine for them.  However, society looks down on them for their choice.  Also, men in the fashion industry may not be taken seriously because they are men.  Typically, men who are into fashion have different lifestyles, so if you have a typical lifestyle as a man and you're in the fashion industry, people will be like, \"Well, how do I really know if you know what fashion is for women?  You don't really know what our case is like.  Like those other guys.\"  Depending on the field of work you're in, I think there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S.  To change it is kind of more difficult because society has a set mindset, and we've made great progress from the 1800s, but change is slow.  So I feel that if we continue working at our current pace because women are rising to higher positions, becoming CEOs, and getting more accepted in the business world, and it's a slow process, but it's happening, and people are starting to accept it more, and just as men who are stay-at-home dads, it's becoming more accepted because they realize, \"Oh, wait, maybe the female does have the better job, or she wants to be the one who works.\"  And, um, then for like fashion, people will be like, \"Oh, wait, maybe they're listening to like their female friends or their wives, and stuff,\" and so they do know where I'm coming from.  So I guess you kinda have to, in a way, promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotyped against by not being too pushy, but um, saying like the qualities of them.  Because if you force it, people will resist.  And I feel that we're kind of at a good balance where it's starting to become enforced like that.  So I don't really know if there's anything that we can do right now that isn't already being done, because if you do it too fast, it's like people will resist, and we've come a long way, and change takes time.  Yes.  Um.  Well, I guess they're probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you're from.  Like if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn't the best, but you are extremely intelligent, and you work your way up into a CEO job, even though you might not have the best grammar in the world, or even though you might be intelligent, but you don't have the best grammar in the world, other men might look down on you and be like, \"Well, how do I know you're really saying what you mean if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right?\"  So, yeah.

\nBecause \nEven if they weren't doing it under the school's name \nThey could still access that through their homes \nUh \nBut \nYes, that's to prevent school shooting \nYou know \nAs long as it saves the lives of \nUh \nStudents \nWhich is the responsibility of the school system \nI think that \nUh \nThat's perfectly fine \nLet me see here \nFor example \nUh \nYou know \nIf they go on the internet, like on Myspace, just to see if \nYou know \nStudents are drinking or smoking or doing things they're not supposed to be doing \nThey go there just specifically to catch students \nAnd \nTo get them in trouble \nAnd \nI think that's an invasion of privacy \nBut \nUh \nI think \nYou know \nAs long as they save \nYou know \nSave lives or make the school a better and safer place \nI don't think that's an invasion at all \nUh \nShould I elaborate more on that \n\nYes, uh \nAlright \nWell \nUh \nIt's a lot easier to \nUh \nExpress yourself \nUh \nA lot longer when you're writing \nBut \n\nAlright \nWell \nUh \nLike what I was saying \nIt is a public thing \nUh \nAnd with a student posting something on Myspace \nAnd \nNot expecting to get in trouble \nThat's ridiculous \nUh \nEverything \nLike I'm \nUh \nAfraid to post stuff like even through emails \nUh \nLike if I have something not good about somebody to say I don't ever say that on an email \nBecause \nI'm afraid someone will see it \nAnd \nYou know \nEverything nowadays comes back \nAnd \nYou know \nIt bites you in the butt I guess you could say \n\nUh \nLike \nYou know \nIf you do something while you're a college student then you grow up to be some important guy they will find an email that you sent somehow \nAnd \nLike \nOnce it's on the internet it's always on the internet \nAnd \nUh \nYou know \nIf you do something like that there's no way of getting out of it \nYou will get in trouble \nAnd \nI don't \nIt wasn't an invasion of privacy at all \nBecause \nYou know \nLike I said before \nAnd \nWell that's basically all I've been saying was it's a public thing \nAnd \nUh \nI don't know \nLet's see here \n\nUh \nLike I had said before I don't think they should go on the internet just to catch students \nBut \nIf they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place \nUh \nThen I think that's perfectly fine for them \nOr \nUh \nOther officials such as the police to go on \nUh \nYou know \nWhen parents drop their students off at school they feel like \nYou know \nThey're dropping them off at a safe place \nI've actually discussed this with a \nUh \nA \nUh \nTeacher of mine \nI went to a public high school \nAnd \nUh \nThey said \nYou know \nWe have to ensure things like this \nBecause \nLike \nWe would do like lockdowns \nAnd \nOther things \nAnd \nUh \nThat's in reference to the terrorist attacks \nUh \nWe had to be careful about that \nWe had like drills \nAnd \nEven though that doesn't have anything to do with the \nWell I mean it kind of does have something to do with the school shooting \nBecause \nUh \nThat was in case people would come into the building I guess \nUh \nSo we \nYou know \nWe did practice that stuff \nUh \nIn order to make the school a safer place \nAnd \nThat's just what the school officials were doing in this case \nThey were just making it a safer place \nUh \nPreventing anything bad from happening \nLike \nColumbine or something like that \nUh \nYeah that's basically all I can think of \n\nUh no that's about it [/REWRITE]",

I thought we should go over there and cause just as much chaos as they did here. But I think since it was such an emotional thing that happened, we overlooked a lot of things and didn't really think about the long run. We kind of just went over there unprepared without a plan. I really think that it backfired on us. I was all for it, but now I'm very against it. I don't think it did anything. I think the people over there, as long as they're fighting with each other, they can't be fighting with us as well. Like, I don't think us being over there is going to do anything if they're fighting with themselves. So, unfortunately, because of nine eleven, I've almost just stopped caring about what goes on over there. I just don't care. I think sometimes I don't even think they're human. I don't know, they fight with each other and they can't do anything themselves, so I really don't care. We definitely went over there unprepared. We didn't know what we were going to face over there. And it's also bad because war for them is very different from war for us. They're just like savage people when it comes to war, and I don't think they're looking to better their country. I just think they're looking to get us out of there, and I think that's fine for us. I think we should just leave and that's really it. We just, I think we were just more hyped up than anything. I don't think we were thinking rationally about what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle, and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened. I also think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq. But at the time, I see where he was coming from. We really didn't have a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can't just do that and then us just say, \"Okay, let's rebuild and that's it.\" So, I don't think we could have let it go, but I think we could have had a better plan of what we were going to do. I don't think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of, I guess, creating order. And I don't know, I just think that they didn't have unity. They didn't know what they were going into for, so I think that would have helped us out a lot more. But like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with, so that's what we created in turn in there. Honestly, I don't think we're the ones to change those people. I honestly think they're always going to be like that. And, honestly, I don't have anything else to say. Our discussion has definitely gone on long enough. I don't think we're making enough progress.
