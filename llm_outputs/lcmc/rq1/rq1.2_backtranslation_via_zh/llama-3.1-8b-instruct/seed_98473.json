They've been talking about how the Catholic Church is losing some of its followers, and I think it's because the Catholic Church isn't accepting enough of many things. They have very strong views on issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which is fine, but some of their views are a bit outdated in certain ways. If they were to adapt to some newer ideas, they wouldn't worry about losing followers. I've heard that many people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church because of their views on these issues. People are starting to disagree with the Catholic Church on certain matters, so they feel that the Catholic Church has the wrong views. The Catholic Church opposes abortion, so if you're for abortion, you might not feel comfortable in a following that teaches it's completely wrong. The same goes for gay marriage and related issues - if you believe in or want to practice them, you might not want to be in a following that disagrees with it. I don't see any reason why priests can't be married or why there can't be female priests. However, I'm not sure if that would have prevented what happened. It's unclear if they would have acted differently if they could get married or have female priests. It's hard to say. I don't see why priests can't have both a family and a job, as everyone else does. The Catholic Church says that priests are essentially married to God and devoted to their complete lives, but I don't see why they can't have both like everyone else. [/REWRITE]",

And same-sex couples have the same kind of success rates, they have the same factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do.\n\nIt's just a relationship, it's the same thing. And I think where a lot of people get hung up on is that homosexuals aren't asking for the right to get married in a church; they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government.\n\nAnd if there's no involvement with church and state, then that shouldn't be an issue. Because I don't understand why some Catholics can get hung up on, \"Oh, that's against our religion, that's morally wrong for us, and we can't approve of that sort of thing.\" But in a legal sense, if you're allowing someone a civil union, why not allow them to get married?\n\nIt's like segregation, separate but unequal.\n\nYes, they're the same in many ways, like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that. And people worry about adoption issues and community issues, like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community.\n\nAnd especially about children of gay couples and how they'll adjust to society, and whether or not they'll be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation or not. But well, again it's kind of new and stuff, but it's kind of hard to say, I'm not sure about the children aspect about adoption because I think the main drawback to that is how children get treated by their peers and by other adults in society.\n\nLike in New York City, I know they have special schools for children of gay parents because in public schools in New York City, they get beaten up. And stuff like that, parents protest to get the child removed from their school, and it's just a kid. I mean, they're gonna have the same points of view and everything. Parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples.\n\nAnd so, they can be community involved or not like straight couples choose to. I mean, it's just about personality choices.\n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue, making same-sex marriage legal in every state. I think the amendment should just be the opposite.\n\nBut well, I think President Bush has very strong views on this, his take on gay marriage actually, I think it goes along with his take on abortion and stem cell research which I think most of the reasons I've heard, at least like in the news and stuff, are moral reasons, and morality I don't want to say is negotiable, but it definitely differs from person to person. And to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and morality concepts of all the rest is unethical. To just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account the fact that the government is creating a law to ban gay marriage is completely hypocritical, considering the recent controversy about \"under God\" in the Pledge of Allegiance and how people are so opposed to that, but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country.\n\nUm, just one, a lot of people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged, the gayness resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents or just a personality defect.\n\nAnd that's also not a good reason, because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is, and if people listened to institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church, then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently.",

    "raw_output": "First, I'll translate the provided text into Chinese:\n\n后来我又想了点事儿，我觉得教堂已经适应了二十一世纪了。以前它不是那么严格了。即使我长大了，我小时候每周都去教堂，穿着可爱的衣服，配上一双配套的鞋子和一只配套的包包。这些都是我每次去教堂的固定套装。而且我去的是私立学校，每个周末都能在教堂里见到我的朋友们，我们一起去，然后就这样。然而现在随着我长大，他们在教会组织了青少年弥撒，并且缩短了到30分钟。大家现在都穿着比较随意的衣服，夏天人们经常穿着刚刚从海边回来的泳装。有时候会看到有些家庭迟到来祷告。所以我觉得教堂变得比较随意了，甚至早上的弥撒 ceremony 也变得更加随意了，我以前总是穿着正式的衣服，但现在大家都穿着牛仔裤和卡尔卡斯裤。卡尔卡斯裤也很好，但是和以前相比还是比较随意。至于其他事情，这是教堂中变化最大的地方。关于教会内部的政治，反正我也不清楚。关于所有针对天主教神父的性侵儿童指控的反应，我觉得如果教会允许女性当神父，或者允许神父结婚，这些事情就能被避免吗？我不这么认为，因为有很多已婚的男人还是会变成性侵犯者，他们仍然会有对年幼儿童的欲望。即使他们能结婚，还是会有这种欲望。所以我觉得这不是因为他们可以结婚或者不能结婚的问题。另外我认为当人们选择成为神父时，这是一个个人选择，并且在一些宗教中，神父可以结婚。比如在第七天的主日教会，他们的神父可以结婚。所以我知道它有一些不同。然而，如果他们想同时遵循他们的信仰和结婚，那么他们可能应该考虑一下不同的宗教。关于我的答案的具体部分，你可以谈谈哪个方面？关于性侵犯的部分？我认为性侵犯更多是基于遗传的，而不是因为环境。遗传特征决定了人们的性取向，我觉得这不是因为他们被教育得怎样而变得如此。它可能有一点和他们的环境有关，但我认为这是他们的遗传特征。他们的性取向无法通过婚姻来改变。你可能会尝试，但最终还是会暴露出来。因此，我不认为教会可以通过改变来预防这些事情发生。如果他们知道这些事情发生了，正在试图隐藏它们，那么他们就该感到耻辱。但我认为并不是所有情况都是这样。\n\nAnd here's the English translation back to the original text with some variations in expression:\n\n[REWRITE] I was just thinking about the church and I think they've adapted to the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be. Even though I've grown older, I still remember when I was younger I'd always go to church every Sunday, wearing cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a matching purse. This was my usual outfit whenever I went to church, and I went to a private school, so I'd see all my friends there on the weekends, and we'd just go together. However, as I've gotten older, they've introduced these teenager masses, and they've reduced it to 30 minutes. People dress a lot more casually now, especially during summer, people would come in their beach clothes straight from the beach. You'd see families rushing in late. I think it's become a lot more casual, even at the morning masses where I used to always dress up. People are wearing jeans and khakis now; khakis are nice too, but it's just a lot more casual. As for other things, that's the biggest change I've noticed. I don't know much about the politics within the church, though. Regarding all the accusations against Catholic priests for pedophilia, I think it wouldn't have made a difference if the church allowed female priests or allowed priests to get married. There are married men who still become pedophiles, and they still have an attraction towards young kids, so I don't think it's because they're allowed to get married or not. I think it's also because when they choose to become priests, it's their personal choice, and there are religions that allow priests to get married, like Seventh Heaven, I think their reverend or minister can get married. So, I know it's a bit different, but if they want to follow their faith and get married at the same time, they should maybe consider a different faith. As for my answer, can you elaborate on which part? About the pedophilia? I think pedophilia is more based on genetics, rather than being influenced by environment. I think people are born with it, it's not because of how they're raised. It might have a little something to do with their environment, but I think it's their genetics. You can't change that through marriage; you might try, but it would usually come out eventually. So, I don't think the church could have done anything to prevent it from happening. If they knew about it and were trying to cover it up, they should be ashamed, but I don't think that was the case in all situations. [/REWRITE]",

just talked into it, okay, okay, it's good, uh, yeah, okay, I'm sorry, okay, how I feel about the war in Iraq, let me see, at this point I feel it's kind of pointless, because it's not even a declared war actually, and I feel like it was just a big get back at Iraq thing because that's who we figured bombed the U.S., like who had done the terrorist attacks on nine eleven, so I don't feel like, I mean I'm not a big person on the War on Iraq, so I don't keep up with it, I don't know the big details of it, but at this point I know that we're kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing, and then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them, but it's no reason for staying over there because it's making everyone upset, so and then like if we stay over there then what's gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can't be built in just a day, and then if we like leave they'll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves, um, let me see, ohh this is so hard, this is the one topic I don't know anything about, um, war in Iraq, oh this hard, uh, mmm, uhh I don't know, do you have anything else I can go off of, okay, thank you, um, well um, actually I think I think the war should continue because it's not fair, I don't think we should call it a war anymore, but because I don't think that, you know, I think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that, you know, that we're big and we're American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns, but I don't feel like there's a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore, because like we didn't even call it it shouldn't have even been called a war in the first place because it never was declared a war by congress, I think that's how the whole thing works, you have to declare a war by congress, and then it's I just don't think that it's a real big point to still stay over there and try, actually no I do think it's a point to stay over there and try to like help them, but it's also like wasting our resources, and especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it's like it's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now because of like what it's doing and it's like, and what it's doing to like cause remember I think with the whole Vietnam thing Vietnam War was like undeclared war and it's now called like a meaningless war and he's like saying he'll be called like that president forever that he started this meaningless war and stuff so you have to make this a half an hour don't you, uh, okay yeah um, huh, I guess you could also say that it is like it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there's so many families that I know of that are in whose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it's like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like these people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took I bet some of the kids don't even have a place to go to school anymore because it's so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other just because of like the different beliefs that they have but then again it's like it's hard to say I want them in there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States that it's going to be even worse for them and it's going to be like I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we're now trying to change them and they've been going on this whole like um totalitarian like a whole dictatorship thing for so long that you know I feel like it's gonna that it's

    "original": "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

OK. To start from the beginning I don't think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war before invading Iraq and I think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn't have that much to do with the other. But the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003. Um I myself and pretty much against war especially to make a preemptive strike I was against that.

But in light of the situation, it became very serious.  When you put stuff out into the public forum of the internet, there's really no invasion of privacy that happens.  If you don't want it out there, don't put it there.  If you don't want someone to find it, if you don't want someone to think something of you, you can't tell them what to think.  You can't tell people what to take seriously or not.  I mean, I don't think school officials should be friending their students on Myspace and Facebook and stalking them, and going through Facebooks and Myspaces and all those things and Xangas and Live Journals.  But if it is brought to the attention of the school officials, there's really no invasion of privacy there because it's brought by someone who you gave access to it.  And if there's danger, they have to take it seriously.  I mean, like I said, I don't think they should be monitoring phone conversations and texts and IMs.  If it's brought to their attention, then it's something completely different.  Uh, yeah, don't think, like, a teacher should not make a Facebook or a Myspace account under a different name and friend their students because then that's just the same thing.  I wouldn't friend my residents because, frankly, I don't want to know if they're going out and drinking and then posting their pictures on Facebook.  Then that pops up and I have to see that and I have to do something about it.  It's not my place, so I don't even want that connection.  Um, not really.",

And on Myspace, if you want to see someone's profile, you have to be their friend or have someone else be your friend so that you can see it. So, if you're friends with someone, you've given them permission to see your profile. So, when you put information online, you have to know that a lot of people are going to see that.

So, I'm not really sure.\n\nWell, like, I don't have a Myspace, but I have a Facebook. I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me, and I saw a news report about a guy who was trying to show how easy it was to get information online.

I personally wouldn't agree to meet someone I didn't know, but I've had people in my class who I don't recognize their screen names, but they IM me and they know it's me. It's hard because you think they know your interests, they know what you look like, and sometimes if you post your class schedule, they know where you are during the day, who your friends are, and they know a lot about you, including photos. I try to limit what I post, but at the same time, the whole point of having one is to be able to communicate with my friends, so I don't want to limit it too much.

Yeah, I feel hypocritical talking about it, I mean I hate to say you know I hate to join the bandwagon of people that are like oh I was against it from the beginning. I was but like it’s not really important anymore because just the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea except within the administration because they don’t want to admit that they were wrong. And, I mean you just have to look at like the recent polls. They've done United States polls, they've done Iraqi polls, they've done global polls. And, I mean no, about seventy-five to eighty percent of the population of the world thinks that it was a bad idea. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of the troops that are over there, like the U.S. troops that are over there right now think it was a dumb idea and that we should pull out within the year. I don’t know, it’s just been a complete disaster from before we even came in. It was already a disaster and now pulling out is also going to be a disaster. There's really no easy way to go about really anything involving the Middle East anymore. I mean I think it's just the culture clash between like the United States and the Middle Eastern states. I mean it’s just too big a gap and for like this administration to understand or previous administrations and they think that they can just like bring democracy into an area where it shouldn’t exist. Like that's not the way that this totally different group of people would choose to run their lives. I mean sure Saddam was a bad guy, I don’t think anyone’s like arguing that he’s not. But, I mean you have to weigh the pros and cons before you invade a country that’s going to turn into just a complete disaster just like quicksand from when we went over there. I don’t even know what to say about it. I don't really see a reason at all to stay in there. I mean I’m sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it’s better to stay in there and you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out, I don’t agree with them. I’ve yet to hear like a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should. I mean if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year, I guess I wouldn’t really have a problem with that. But, I just don’t see a reason why we shouldn’t just leave now. I mean I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now. And like these, these are the people that we’re trying to save, like that we’re trying to help, telling us to leave. You know I think they might know better than that.

I was but like it’s not really important anymore because just the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea except within the administration because they don’t want to admit that they were wrong. And, I mean you just have to look at like the recent polls. They've done United States polls, they've done Iraqi polls, they've done global polls. And, I mean no, about seventy-five to eighty percent of the population of the world thinks that it was a bad idea. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of the troops that are over there, like the U.S. troops that are over there right now think it was a dumb idea and that we should pull out within the year. I don’t know, it’s just been a complete disaster from before we even came in. It was already a disaster and now pulling out is also going to be a disaster. There's really no easy way to go about really anything involving the Middle East anymore. I mean I think it's just the culture clash between like the United States and the Middle Eastern states. I mean it’s just too big a gap and for like this administration to understand or previous administrations and they think that they can just like bring democracy into an area where it shouldn’t exist. Like that's not the way that this totally different group of people would choose to run their lives. I mean sure Saddam was a bad guy, I don’t think anyone’s like arguing that he’s not. But, I mean you have to weigh the pros and cons before you invade a country that’s going to turn into just a complete disaster just like quicksand from when we went over there. I don’t even know what to say about it. I don't really see a reason at all to stay in there. I mean I’m sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it’s better to stay in there and you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out, I don’t agree with them. I’ve yet to hear like a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should. I mean if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year, I guess I wouldn’t really have a problem with that. But, I just don’t see a reason why we shouldn’t just leave now. I mean I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now. And like these, these are the people that we’re trying to save, like that we’re trying to help, telling us to leave. You know I think they might know better than that. And at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes then you know it’s not on us if something happens, you know if it completely goes to shit we could be like well we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision not to. And then you know at least we’ll mean if we decide to help out after that we’ll at least be the good guys, kind of not really, no we’ll never be the good guys in the Middle East but you know it’ll be better than you know where we are, where we stand right now. Yeah, uh, no",

I think it's not just a women's issue. Different fields of work have different levels of gender discrimination. I feel that women face more difficulties in many areas. For example, even in a society that strives for equality, many people find it hard to accept women as their superiors. This is because society's attitude towards women has been shaped over time. If a woman has the qualifications for a certain position, but her superiors still won't promote her due to a historical lack of women in top business positions, that's a problem. The same thing happens to men, especially in industries like fashion. Generally, men don't stay home to take care of the kids, and society mocks this choice. People think that men should be the primary breadwinner, not stay home to take care of the kids. However, in some cases, it's the opposite – the wife has a better job, and the husband stays home to take care of the kids, yet society still mocks this choice.\n\nIn the fashion industry, people don't take men seriously. They think that if a man is into fashion, he's somehow different from women. They assume that men who are into fashion must have different tastes or lifestyles, and that they can't truly understand women's needs. They think that other men are different, and that they can't possibly understand women's needs. This is why people are discriminated against based on where they're from or their gender. Changing this is difficult because society has formed its own set of stereotypes. We've made a lot of progress, especially with women rising to top business positions and becoming CEOs, but change is slow. If we continue at our current pace, women will keep rising to the top, and people will start to accept this. Similarly, men staying home to take care of the kids is becoming more accepted because people are starting to realize that women might have better jobs. People in the fashion industry are also starting to realize that people's needs might not be what they think they are. So, we need to promote the qualities of people who are often discriminated against without being too pushy. If you try to force it, people will resist. If we're doing everything we can already, we don't need to do anything else because if we do it too quickly, people will resist the change. We've made a lot of progress, and change takes time.\n\nIt's also possible that our society will discriminate against you because of where you're from or your gender.

It's good to be rooted in tradition, but it's also important to adapt to change. I think many Catholics believe they have to go to church every week and are very strict about how things are done, and look down on those who don't follow the doctrine to the letter. They don't accept people who aren't strict Catholics, and they also don't accept people of other religions. For example, my parents were both Episcopalian, but my mom was Catholic, and they wouldn't get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion.\n\nThat's not really being tolerant of other religions. We were always taught to love others, which is a Catholic teaching, but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in that way. So I feel like many Catholic teachings tell you to do things, but the Catholic practice goes against it because it's outdated, but they continue to stick with it anyway.\n\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would influence their behavior. I personally think it would be a good idea, but I don't think it would necessarily deter them from doing pedophilic behavior. It's a different realm, you know? It might, but I probably don't think that would be an issue.\n\nWell, I guess people who molest children will probably do it regardless of whether they're married or not, because a child is different from a spouse, you know? So if you're going to do something like that, you're probably going to do it whether or not you're married. I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent those things from happening; I think that would probably happen regardless.\n\n[/REWRITE]",

Um  \n73. 每件事\n74. 就像我\n75. 想要在电子邮件中表达坏话\n76. 我从不这样做\n77. 因为\n78. 我害怕有人会发现\n79. 并且\n80. 你知道吗\n81. 现在几乎所有东西都会被追踪\n82. 并且\n83. 会让你后悔\n84. 我们可以说\n85. 如果你在大学时做了什么事\n86. 而后来成为某个重要人物\n87. 他们会找到你曾经发送的电子邮件\n88. 并且\n89. 如果内容被发布在互联网上\n90. 就算你想消除也无法消除\n91. 你会被惩罚\n92. 不，不是侵犯个人隐私\n93. 因为\n94. 我之前已经说过了\n95. 并且\n96. 当然那就是我一直在说的事\n97. 它是一个公开的东西\n98. 且\n99. 我不知道\n100. 让我们看看\n\n101. 我之前已经说了，我不认为他们应该去互联网上抓学生\n102. 但是\n103. 如果他们有证据\n104. 证明他们的目的在于使学校更安全\n105. 我觉得那是完全可以接受的\n106. 或者其他官员\n107. 在学校的安全措施上\n108. 当父母把孩子送到学校\n109. 他们会觉得\n110. 他们把孩子送到一个安全的地方\n111. 我曾经讨论过这个问题\n112. 与我的老师\n113. 我去过一所公立高中\n114. 他们说\n115. 我们必须确保这样的事情\n116. 因为\n117. 我们会做校内封锁\n118. 并且\n119. 其他事情\n120. 类似于恐怖袭击\n121. 我们必须小心\n122. 我们做了演练\n123. 为了使学校更加安全\n124. 并且\n125. 那就是学校官员在这个案例中做的\n126. 他们只是为了使学校更加安全\n127. 预防坏事发生\n128. 等于哥伦拜恩事件\n129. 或类似的事情\n130. 是的，那就大概是所有我可以想到的了\n\n131. 呃，不是了\n\nNow, I will translate the Chinese text back to English.\n\n[REWRITE] \nNo, I don’t agree at all. \nLet me think about it. \nI think, Myspace is a public thing. \nAnd, bulletin board. \nYou know. \nIf you look at that definition, then you know, that basically it’s to post for the public to see or for others to see. \nNo matter what you’re trying to get at. \nAnd now if you post that on the internet, you have to realize that people will see it, whether it be school officials or not. \nIn my opinion, I think school officials seeing that they had every right to see it. \nBecause, even if they weren’t doing it under the school’s name, they could have still accessed it through their homes. \nBut uh, yeah, with something preventing a school shooting, you know, as long as it saves the lives of students, which is a responsibility of the school system, I think that’s perfectly fine. \nLet me see here, like, if they go on to the internet like on Myspace just to see if students are drinking or smoking or doing stuff that they’re not supposed to be doing, they go on there just specifically to catch students and to get them in trouble, and I feel as though that is an invasion of privacy. \nBut, I feel as though, you know, as long as they save, you know, save lives or make the school a better and safer place, I don’t think that’s an invasion at all. \nShould I elaborate more on that? \n\nYes, uh, alright, well, uh, it’s a lot easier to express yourself a lot longer when you’re writing. \nAlright, well, uh, like what I was saying, it is a public thing, and with a student posting something on Myspace, and not expecting to get in trouble, that’s ridiculous. \nEverything, like I’m worried to post stuff like even through emails, like if I have something not good about somebody to say I don’t ever say that on an email because I’m afraid somebody somehow will pick that up, and you know, everything like everything nowadays comes back, and you know, bites you in the butt I guess you could say. \nLike, you know, if you do something while you’re a college student then you grow up to be some important guy they will like find an email that you sent somehow, and like, once it’s on the internet it’s always on the internet, and you know, if you do something like that there’s no way of getting out of it, you will get in trouble, and I don’t, it wasn’t an invasion at all of privacy, because you know, like I said before, and well, that’s basically all I’ve been saying was it’s a public thing, and I don’t know, let’s see here. \n\nLike I had said before I don’t feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students, but if they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place, then I feel as though that’s perfectly fine for them, or other officials such as the police to go on, you know, when parents drop their students off at school they feel as though, you know, they’re dropping them off at a safe place, I’ve actually discussed that with a teacher of mine, I went to a public high school, and, uh, they say, you know, we have to ensure stuff like this, because, like, we would do like lock downs, and stuff, and, uh, in reference to the terrorist attacks, uh, we had to be safe about that, we had like drill stuff, and even though that doesn’t have anything to do with the, well, I mean it kind of does have something to do with the school shooting, because, uh, that was incase people would come into the building I guess, uh, so we, you know, we did practice that stuff, uh, in order to make the school a safer place, and that’s just what the school officials were doing in this case, they were just making it a safer place, uh, preventing anything bad from happening, like, Columbine or something like that, uh, yeah that’s basically all I can come up with. \n\nUh, no, that’s about it [/REWRITE]",
