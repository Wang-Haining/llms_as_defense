\nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in

on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt

just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is

\nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are

    "raw_output": "[REWRITE]\n\nTo be honest, I think the church has made some adjustments to fit into the 21st century. It's not as traditional as it used to be. Growing up, I used to go to church every Sunday, and it was a big deal - I'd get dressed up in matching outfits, including a cute little dress, shoes, and a purse. It was a big part of my private school experience, where I'd see all my friends every weekend. However, as I've gotten older, I've noticed some changes. They've introduced a shorter, 30-minute mass for teenagers, and it's become more casual. People often dress down, especially in the summer, and even families who run late still show up. It's become a more relaxed atmosphere, even during morning masses where people used to dress up. I've noticed that people now wear jeans and khakis, which is still nice, but it's a more casual vibe overall.\n\nOne thing that stands out to me is the shift in the church's atmosphere. I'm not familiar with the church's politics, but that's my observation. As for the recent scandals involving Catholic priests and pedophilia, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these incidents.

    "transformed": "To be honest, I think the church has made some adjustments to fit into the 21st century. It's not as traditional as it used to be. Growing up, I used to go to church every Sunday, and it was a big deal - I'd get dressed up in matching outfits, including a cute little dress, shoes, and a purse. It was a big part of my private school experience, where I'd see all my friends every weekend. However, as I've gotten older, I've noticed some changes. They've introduced a shorter, 30-minute mass for teenagers, and it's become more casual. People often dress down, especially in the summer, and even families who run late still show up. It's become a more relaxed atmosphere, even during morning masses where people used to dress up. I've noticed that people now wear jeans and khakis, which is still nice, but it's a more casual vibe overall.\n\nOne thing that stands out to me is the shift in the church's atmosphere. I'm not familiar with the church's politics, but that's my observation. As for the recent scandals involving Catholic priests and pedophilia, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these incidents. There are married men who are still pedophiles, and it's not about the marriage or lack thereof - it's about the individual's attraction to young kids.

are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s

\nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own

\nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of

the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there

    "raw_output": "[REWRITE]\n\nI wanted to clarify a point, but I'm not sure if I should even bring it up. Apparently, someone online discovered that there was a reason certain information was being kept from the public. Okay, so here's my question: if you post stuff on the internet, like on Myspace, for instance, you have to accept that a lot of people are going to see it. I mean, if you want to be friends with someone on Myspace, you basically give them permission to view your profile, right? So, anytime you put info on the internet, you have to understand that it's out there for anyone to see.\n\nIt's a bit of a tough situation because, on one hand, you can't have someone sitting around all day monitoring everyone's profiles to prevent something bad from happening, but on the other hand, it's like, what if they're just looking for evidence of someone doing something wrong? It's not clear-cut. I mean, I don't think it's right to have someone's job just to snoop through people's profiles, but I guess it depends on the circumstances.\n\nPersonally, I don't have a Myspace account, but I do have a Facebook one. It's a bit unsettling to think that there are people out there who can see things about me just by looking at my profile. I saw this thing on TV once where this guy was showing how easy it is to get information about someone online. He went onto this girl's Myspace profile and got her screen name in like a minute and started talking to her on instant messenger. It's pretty scary.\n\nIt's hard to balance the fact that you want to be able to communicate with your friends online, but at the same time, you don't want to put too much information out there that could be used against you. I've noticed that some of my classmates can IM me without even knowing my screen name, which is a bit unnerving.

    "transformed": "I wanted to clarify a point, but I'm not sure if I should even bring it up. Apparently, someone online discovered that there was a reason certain information was being kept from the public. Okay, so here's my question: if you post stuff on the internet, like on Myspace, for instance, you have to accept that a lot of people are going to see it. I mean, if you want to be friends with someone on Myspace, you basically give them permission to view your profile, right? So, anytime you put info on the internet, you have to understand that it's out there for anyone to see.\n\nIt's a bit of a tough situation because, on one hand, you can't have someone sitting around all day monitoring everyone's profiles to prevent something bad from happening, but on the other hand, it's like, what if they're just looking for evidence of someone doing something wrong? It's not clear-cut. I mean, I don't think it's right to have someone's job just to snoop through people's profiles, but I guess it depends on the circumstances.\n\nPersonally, I don't have a Myspace account, but I do have a Facebook one. It's a bit unsettling to think that there are people out there who can see things about me just by looking at my profile. I saw this thing on TV once where this guy was showing how easy it is to get information about someone online. He went onto this girl's Myspace profile and got her screen name in like a minute and started talking to her on instant messenger. It's pretty scary.\n\nIt's hard to balance the fact that you want to be able to communicate with your friends online, but at the same time, you don't want to put too much information out there that could be used against you. I've noticed that some of my classmates can IM me without even knowing my screen name, which is a bit unnerving.
