    "original": "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would

are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that

\nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

    "raw_output": "[REWRITE]\n\nSo, I wanted to clarify how the law has changed on this issue. They've made some changes, apparently decriminalizing it, which means it's not as serious of an offense as it used to be. It's more like getting a traffic ticket, where you might get fined, but you won't be arrested and charged like before. Now, I know some people might worry about the future consequences of having a marijuana charge, even if it's decriminalized - it can still impact things like job interviews and other opportunities. On the other hand, there's a argument that arresting people, prosecuting them, and putting them through the system is really expensive. When you think about it, it adds up - arresting, booking, housing them, and then going through the court process, just to let them go. Plus, there's the cost of appointing a public defender, paying the judge, and having the state attorney's office handle the case. It all adds up, and it's not a small expense.\n\nIn places that are struggling financially, some officials might not be willing to make this change, even if it would free up a lot of money for other important things. But in cities like Denver, where people tend to be more open-minded, it makes sense to decriminalize marijuana. I think it's a good idea because it can free up funds for things like education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. It's not just about making marijuana freely available; it's about the financial benefits and the potential to use that money for good.\n\nOf course, there are still concerns about making marijuana widely available. Some people might worry that it would be too easily accessible, like cigarettes sold in gas stations. That could lead to people smoking and driving, which is a problem. Marijuana is still stigmatized in many places, and having it out in the open might make people uncomfortable. \n\nI think in general, alcohol has more severe effects on motor skills, but marijuana can have a bigger impact on people's lifestyles. However, it's hard to make generalizations because everyone reacts differently to substances. Some people can handle them well, while others struggle with moderation. It's complex, and it's hard to make blanket statements about marijuana or any other substance.\n\n[/REWRITE]",

When you think about it, it adds up - arresting, booking, housing them, and then going through the court process, just to let them go. Plus, there's the cost of appointing a public defender, paying the judge, and having the state attorney's office handle the case. It all adds up, and it's not a small expense.\n\nIn places that are struggling financially, some officials might not be willing to make this change, even if it would free up a lot of money for other important things. But in cities like Denver, where people tend to be more open-minded, it makes sense to decriminalize marijuana. I think it's a good idea because it can free up funds for things like education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. It's not just about making marijuana freely available; it's about the financial benefits and the potential to use that money for good.\n\nOf course, there are still concerns about making marijuana widely available. Some people might worry that it would be too easily accessible, like cigarettes sold in gas stations. That could lead to people smoking and driving, which is a problem. Marijuana is still stigmatized in many places, and having it out in the open might make people uncomfortable. \n\nI think in general, alcohol has more severe effects on motor skills, but marijuana can have a bigger impact on people's lifestyles. However, it's hard to make generalizations because everyone reacts differently to substances. Some people can handle them well, while others struggle with moderation. It's complex, and it's hard to make blanket statements about marijuana or any other substance.",

I think we rushed into the situation without a thorough plan, and that's exactly what backfired on us. \n\nNow, I'm strongly against the war. I don't think it's done anything meaningful, and I believe that as long as the people over there are fighting amongst themselves, they won't be a threat to us. But, unfortunately, 9/11 changed my perspective, and I've become somewhat apathetic towards their struggles. I sometimes feel like they're not even human, the way they wage war, and it's like they're not really trying to better their country. I think they just want us out, and that's it.\n\nIn hindsight, I think we went into this war with a lot of emotional baggage and a desire for revenge. President Bush's decision to declare war on Iraq was, at the time, somewhat understandable. We couldn't just let the attack go unpunished, but I do think we could have come up with a better plan. There was a lack of unity and a clear direction, which made things worse.\n\nIt's my honest opinion that we're not the ones to change those people. They're always going to be the way they are, and I don't think we're making enough progress to justify staying there. In fact, I believe that once we leave, everything will collapse, and we'll just be causing harm to ourselves by prolonging our stay. We can't stay there indefinitely, so it's better to just pull out and focus on our own issues.\n\n[/REWRITE]",
