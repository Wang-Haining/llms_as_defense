heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did

Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s

the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there

    "raw_output": "[REWRITE]\n\nTo clarify, I have a question. It's a bit of a sensitive topic, but I wanted to bring it up. Someone recently found out about a situation because they looked at someone's online profile on a site like Myspace. I think it's kind of a gray area, to be honest. If you post information online, it's pretty much available for anyone to see. On Myspace, for example, you have to add someone as a friend in order to see their profile, but by doing so, you're giving them permission to see your information. So, if someone looks at your profile, it's not really an invasion of privacy, per se.\n\nI mean, I think it's actually a good thing that they were able to see that information and potentially prevent a bad situation from happening. However, it raises some questions about whether it's right for someone to be constantly monitoring people's profiles to prevent something like that from happening. It's not feasible for one person to be watching everyone's profiles all the time, and it could lead to discrimination if they're only focusing on certain individuals.\n\nIt's a complicated issue, and I'm not really sure what the right answer is. I have a Facebook account, and it's a bit unsettling to know that there are people out there who can see information about me. I've heard stories about people getting information about others online and using it to contact them, which can be really creepy. It's hard to know who can see what, and it's a bit of a trade-off between sharing information and keeping it private.\n\nI've been thinking about this a lot lately, especially after hearing about a guy on TV who was able to get a girl's screen name and contact information online and meet up with her in a short amount of time. It's a bit disturbing to think about how easy it is for people to get that kind of information.

I'm not sure if that's a privacy issue or not, but it seems like the school shouldn't have had the authority to tell students what they can and can't do online.\n\nI'm not really sure what the solution is, but it's definitely something to think about.

    "transformed": "To clarify, I have a question. It's a bit of a sensitive topic, but I wanted to bring it up. Someone recently found out about a situation because they looked at someone's online profile on a site like Myspace. I think it's kind of a gray area, to be honest. If you post information online, it's pretty much available for anyone to see. On Myspace, for example, you have to add someone as a friend in order to see their profile, but by doing so, you're giving them permission to see your information. So, if someone looks at your profile, it's not really an invasion of privacy, per se.\n\nI mean, I think it's actually a good thing that they were able to see that information and potentially prevent a bad situation from happening. However, it raises some questions about whether it's right for someone to be constantly monitoring people's profiles to prevent something like that from happening. It's not feasible for one person to be watching everyone's profiles all the time, and it could lead to discrimination if they're only focusing on certain individuals.\n\nIt's a complicated issue, and I'm not really sure what the right answer is. I have a Facebook account, and it's a bit unsettling to know that there are people out there who can see information about me. I've heard stories about people getting information about others online and using it to contact them, which can be really creepy. It's hard to know who can see what, and it's a bit of a trade-off between sharing information and keeping it private.\n\nI've been thinking about this a lot lately, especially after hearing about a guy on TV who was able to get a girl's screen name and contact information online and meet up with her in a short amount of time. It's a bit disturbing to think about how easy it is for people to get that kind of information. I've had people I don't know contact me on my Facebook and IM me, which can be a bit unnerving.\n\nI've tried to limit what I share online, but at the same time, I want to be able to stay in touch with my friends.

At first, I was all for the decision to go to war, mainly because it was a personal issue for me following 9/11. I felt a strong desire to take action and make a difference, even if it meant causing some chaos in the process. However, looking back, I think we overlooked a lot of things and didn't think about the long-term consequences. We just kind of rushed in without a clear plan, and it backfired on us.\n\nNow, I'm not just against the war; I think it actually did more harm than good. I believe the people over there are more focused on fighting each other than on working with us. It's like they're stuck in a never-ending cycle of conflict, and our presence isn't doing anything to change that. I've kind of lost interest in what's going on over there because of the way things have played out.\n\nSometimes, I feel like they're not even human, the way they conduct themselves in war. It's like they're more savage than civilized, and I don't think they're looking to improve their country; they just want us out. I think we should have left them to their own devices a long time ago.\n\nTo be honest, I think we went to war on a whim, driven by emotions and a desire for revenge, rather than a clear plan. The President might have thought he was doing the right thing, but looking back, I'm not so sure. We couldn't just let the situation go, but we could have handled it better. We didn't have a clear idea of what we were trying to achieve, and it showed.

    "transformed": "Honestly, I'm still trying to wrap my head around the situation. At first, I was all for the decision to go to war, mainly because it was a personal issue for me following 9/11. I felt a strong desire to take action and make a difference, even if it meant causing some chaos in the process. However, looking back, I think we overlooked a lot of things and didn't think about the long-term consequences. We just kind of rushed in without a clear plan, and it backfired on us.\n\nNow, I'm not just against the war; I think it actually did more harm than good. I believe the people over there are more focused on fighting each other than on working with us. It's like they're stuck in a never-ending cycle of conflict, and our presence isn't doing anything to change that. I've kind of lost interest in what's going on over there because of the way things have played out.\n\nSometimes, I feel like they're not even human, the way they conduct themselves in war. It's like they're more savage than civilized, and I don't think they're looking to improve their country; they just want us out. I think we should have left them to their own devices a long time ago.\n\nTo be honest, I think we went to war on a whim, driven by emotions and a desire for revenge, rather than a clear plan. The President might have thought he was doing the right thing, but looking back, I'm not so sure. We couldn't just let the situation go, but we could have handled it better. We didn't have a clear idea of what we were trying to achieve, and it showed. The lack of unity and a clear plan made things much harder for us.\n\nI don't think we're the right people to change those countries.
