    "raw_output": "首先，我翻译为中文：\n\n由于我住在一个大城市，我所在的社区非常多样化。住宅区之间散布着广告牌，似乎随机地分布在商业区，各种企业在此经营。其中一些企业由办公室组成，其他的是各式各样的商店、餐馆和娱乐场所。餐馆和商店的数量绝不胜数。虽然有些商店是大型知名品牌，隶属于大型公司的控股，但也越来越受欢迎的小型精品店。它们不仅设在各种购物中心，还沿着大街排列，往往在那些不受众多景点影响的安静宁静的社区中步行范围内。附近还设有几个公园，我注意到人们带着年幼的孩子常去参观这些公园。谈到社区的居民，我发现这里的社区和我所在的社区一样多样化。我们在小型场所设有一个显眼的LGBTQ+社区，一个正统犹太教社区，以及来自前苏联的难民和移民的群体。稍微扩大范围，更多来自不同种族和起源的人们也聚集在这座城市里，尽管他们有时会被分散到各自的小社区里。我们有被称为韩国镇、中国镇、Little Armenia等的地方，离我居住的社区只有几英里。然而，仅仅几英里就可能是一个漫长的行程。由于交通拥堵，尤其是早高峰时段，开车10英里就可能需要2个小时。几乎没有人在我的城市步行。虽然某些有趣的地方离我家很近，但这座城市很大，人们普遍不愿步行。结果，我们也拥有世界上最糟糕的交通状况，而且几乎到处都找不到停车位。讽刺的是，近年来，我们不断地进行了大量的建筑项目，建造了大量的公寓楼。它似乎是人气极旺的目的地，但许多居民因担心有更多的人到来和更多的车辆在路上行驶而感到失望。我的城市里有各种类型的房屋。并不是每个人住在大公寓楼里，也不是每个人都希望住在大公寓楼里。住宅区由各种大小houses和小型公寓楼和公寓组成。一些房产包含单层家庭住宅，而其他则包含双层住宅。即使在我的亲属社区里，这也很有代表性，所以在住房选项方面也不会缺乏多样性。同样，社区的人口年龄多样，坦率地说，我并不熟悉大多数邻居。尽管如此，我们的社区并不像以前那样紧密联系，虽然我有很多儿童时期的回忆，和一些年纪相仿的好友在街对面玩耍。\n\n然后我翻译回英语：\n\n[REWRITE] Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse.

My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house.

This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can.

The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request.

    "original": "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",

She finally felt a sense of understanding about me and where I came from in that moment. Continuing down the two-lane country road, you'll see a quarry filled with water, followed by the small community I live in. The houses here are mostly made of brick and stucco and are situated on large plots of land, which everyone takes pride in maintaining. In the spring, the garden beds bloom with flowers native to the Midwest, which change colors with the seasons. The driveways are lined with high-end Mercedes-Benz luxury cars, which sparkle in the sunlight after a thorough car wash. Along the way, I'll point out my neighbor, a Korean man who always greets me with a warm smile. He spends most of his day mowing the lawn and singing along to the sound of his John Deere zero-turn mower. He's a well-respected member of the community, though having aged, he has lost some of his wit. In his past, he was a doctor, but now he blends into the grass as he mows, singing along the way. The rest of the neighborhood loves him, and he's an amazing person with an incredible history. Eventually, you'll arrive at my house. The backyard is home to a large number of geese, which are chased by our Terrier. A small stream runs through the yard, feeding into the quarry. The sounds of frogs, the stream, and the occasional mooing from the nearby farms fill the air. On the other side of the wooden bridge, a tranquil oasis awaits, filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This is where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to 'hunting' (which mostly consisted of chasing), there was always something to do and a neighbor to play with. The winters in my small town can be brutal, yet they're also breathtakingly beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green to a barren wasteland. The trees that were once adorned with vibrant flowers turn into skeletal branches. When snow falls, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The yard is filled with snow angels and snowmen made by my little sister, and snowball fights. My sister and I were always at odds as kids, but in the winter, snowballs were our go-to weapon.

To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time.

No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",

    "original": "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",

Public transportation is very convenient and is one of the most popular transportation methods in New York City. Bensonhurst is a relatively urbanized residential area, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, you should be prepared to see various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurst has received a large influx of Asian immigrants. As a result, you will see at least one Asian-owned store on every block as you walk. The most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these stores are very popular among local residents, as the quality of food in the supermarkets is excellent, the prices are much cheaper, and most importantly, they are very convenient. Just nearby my home, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walking distance from each other. This further enhances the convenience of grocery shopping. I am not saying that Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian residents, though. It is quite diverse throughout, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian-owned. In addition to these Asian-owned businesses, a recently renovated park is nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a children's playground, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course, the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren't many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you'd find are those for co-op living or condominium apartments. The majority of residential spaces here are two-family houses. Most people are quite friendly, however, very noisy. Every day, you'll hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars, which will wake you up in the morning. If you're planning on visiting during nighttime, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies, and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but that was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package theft. Although it's a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don't follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog's feces on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean! [/REWRITE]",

It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year.

Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",

I don't think this is based on any official demographics, but I think it's because this city is still not very developed and there are still many open spaces to be built on. This scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left the big city and I'm not keen on going back. Talking about construction, this is where my full-time job is located, I am a drywall and T-bar installer. What I like about my home is the variety of animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, including the stark beauty of the desert itself. The high desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems that need to be protected, and they are the homes of many different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who live in this environment in order to coexist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children, and they are all obsessed with lizards and desert bugs, as I am writing this, they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As for attractions, there are some here. Victorville is also a good place for families to experience the desert. It can provide a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with the annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Visit the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish off your visit. If you are interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem, the Victor Valley Museum is a good place to visit. The museum has geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry in Victorville. [/REWRITE]",

    "original": "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",

However, there are only a few of these types of houses scattered throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Third, there are the standard dormitories, housing hundreds of students. In these, sometimes two people share a room, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. Having discussed housing, we can move on to the residents of my neighborhood. My school prides itself on diversity, and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages living in my neighborhood.

Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school.

I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers!

They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it.

But thanks to some money from the city, the road was repaved last summer, so there's a good big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the road, and now the area is a little nicer. However, my apartment building is surrounded by trees. They cut some down, leaving some stumps, but there are a lot more trees here than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street, but right behind it is 43rd Street, and that one isn't as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and crumbling, and most of the buildings look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but I think that's to hide how bad the buildings look. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I don't blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there's plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance, and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.",

    "original": "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",

Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food.

Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things.

    "original": "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home.

It's situated on a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical significance. I live in a 7-story apartment building right across from the old theater, and a block away is this cool little arcade bar that attracts various kinds of people on warm summer nights. Often, especially on weekends in June and July, you can see a long line of people waiting to get in. Just a few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's quite large, especially considering the area it's in. The park is surrounded by concrete, with tall stairs integrated into the wall. During the cold winter months, homeless people set up their tents along the sidewalk and the wide steps. Although it doesn't snow much, it rains a lot, and the heavy rain in mid-winter often makes it difficult to stay warm. By setting their tents close together, in the center of town rather than in the outskirts, they stay warmer. They are also within walking and transit distance to the only family center in the area, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city isn't the beauty of its historic nature—the tall, proud buildings, the architecture that's scattered throughout the different levels of the hills that slope down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. Hilltop was once the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, and even to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard to keep it cleaned up, even though it's still considered one of the rougher neighborhoods in the entire city, to care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill at night. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it's tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it's because I'm just dark enough to pass for not entirely a \"white girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who's just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that's supposed to be a cultural melting pot utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had nowhere to escape from the rain.
