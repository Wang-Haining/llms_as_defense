Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",

Wohngebiete sind verstreut, scheinbar zufällig, zwischen Gewerbegebieten, in denen sich verschiedene Unternehmen befinden. Einige dieser Unternehmen bestehen aus Büros, während andere verschiedene Geschäfte, Restaurants und Einrichtungen für Unterhaltung sind. Es mangelt es nicht an neuen Restaurants, in denen man essen kann, oder Geschäften, in denen man einkaufen kann. Während einige Geschäfte große, bekannte Marken sind, die von großen Konzernen besessen werden, sind kleine Boutiquen auch immer beliebter. Sie befinden sich nicht nur in verschiedenen Einkaufszentren, sondern auch an den Straßen, die oft in Sichtweite von Nachbarschaften liegen, die andernfalls ruhig und idyllisch wären, wenn sie nicht von so vielen Punkten des Interesses umgeben wären. Es gibt auch ein paar nahe gelegene Parks, und ich habe festgestellt, dass Menschen diese Parks mit ihren jungen Kindern frequentieren. Wenn man von den Menschen spricht, besteht tatsächlich eine erhebliche Vielfalt in meiner Nachbarschaft. In einer kleinen Gegend haben wir eine prominente LGBTQ+-Community, eine orthodox-jüdische Gemeinde und eine Sammlung von Flüchtlingen und Einwanderern aus der ehemaligen Sowjetunion. Ein bisschen weiter außerhalb meiner Nachbarschaft befinden sich viele mehr Individuen verschiedener Rassen und Herkunft, obwohl sie manchmal in eigenen kleinen Gemeinschaften innerhalb der Stadt aufgeteilt sind. Wir haben Viertel wie Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia und viele mehr, die nur ein paar Meilen entfernt liegen. Einige Meilen können jedoch eine sehr lange Fahrt sein, insbesondere während der Rushhour. Die meisten Menschen in meiner Stadt gehen nirgendwohin zu Fuß. Obwohl bestimmte Orte des Interesses in der Nähe liegen, ist die Stadt riesig, und Menschen bevorzugen es nicht, zu Fuß zu pendeln. Als Ergebnis haben wir auch einige der schlimmsten Verkehrsstaus der Welt, und es kann schwierig sein, Parkplätze in der Nähe zu finden. Ironischerweise gibt es in den letzten Jahren viel Baufortschritt, da große Wohngebäude hinzugefügt werden. Es scheint ein beliebtes Ziel zu sein, aber viele Einwohner sind enttäuscht von der Aussicht, dass noch mehr Menschen einziehen und noch mehr Fahrzeuge auf den Straßen sind. Es gibt viele verschiedene Arten von Häusern in meiner Stadt. Nicht jeder lebt oder möchte in einem großen Wohngebäude wohnen. Wohngebiete bestehen aus Häusern, die verschiedenen Größen entsprechen, und kleineren Wohnungen und Konzernen. Einige Grundstücke enthalten Einfamilienhäuser, während andere Doppelhäuser enthalten. Dies ist auch in meiner unmittelbaren Nachbarschaft der Fall, also besteht auch keine Mangel an Vielfalt in Bezug auf Wohnoptionen. Ebenso besteht die Nachbarschaft aus Menschen verschiedener Altersgruppen, und ich bin so frei zu sagen, dass ich nicht mit der Mehrheit meiner Nachbarn vertraut bin. Es ist nicht wirklich eine enge Gemeinschaft mehr, obwohl ich viele Erinnerungen von meiner Kindheit habe, als ich mit meinem Nachbarn von nebenan draußen spielte, und ein paar anderen Freunden aus der Nachbarschaft, die alle meiner Altersgruppe angehörten.\n\nTranslated English text:\n\n[REWRITE] Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is quite diverse.

The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood.

There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request.

Die meisten Häuser sind Einfamilienhäuser, aber es gibt einige Häuser, die in zwei geteilt wurden, aber noch miteinander verbunden sind, wenn das Sinn macht. Mein Zuhause hat einen kleinen Vorgarten vorne und einen kleinen Einfahrt zu seiner linken Seite. Ebenso wie die meisten anderen erinnert es an eine Zeit nicht so lang her, in der das Leben in den Vororten der amerikanische Traum war. Der Traum schien damals die Menschen dieses Landes zu umarmen, aber jetzt zieht er sich zurück. Aber meine Nachbarschaft und viele andere sind noch da, rufen uns und den Besuchern zu, dass der Traum noch am Leben ist und wir ihn noch so gut wie möglich halten. Die Menschen fühlen sich nicht mehr so optimistisch, wie sie früher gefühlt haben, die Pflege der kleinen Vorgärten ist nicht mehr, was sie früher waren, aber es gibt noch ein Auto oder zwei in jeder Einfahrt, die Jugendlichen spielen, als wäre die Welt um sie herum das ganze ihrer Existenz. Die öffentliche Schule, die seit fast 90 Jahren hier ist, steht immer noch, scheint den Jugendlichen von heute eine Zukunft zu weisen, während sie bei den älteren Einwohnern Nostalgie weckt. Die Kirchen sind selten und weit auseinander, meist leer, aber die Basketballplätze sind immer noch voll. Alle Häuser sehen anders aus, aber fühlen sich gleich. Es gibt ein großes Supermarkt namens \"Super A\", der von einer großen jemenitischen Familie gehört wird, die wahrscheinlich die einzige arabische Familie im Viertel ist. Die meisten Bewohner sind Afro-Amerikaner. Die Straßen sind breit und die Kinder spielen Fußball, stoppen nur, um den Autos Platz zu machen. Die meisten Menschen in meiner Nachbarschaft haben hier seit Generationen gelebt und die meisten können Geschichten von einer Vergangenheit erzählen, in der jeder jeden kannte. Es gab ein Karate-Schulgebäude, aber als HollywoodKarate Kid-Filme aufhörte, wollten die Kinder nicht mehr Karate Kid sein, also ist es jetzt ein Apotheken, weil Medikamente alles besser machen, oder so habe ich gehört. Es gibt auch ein kleines Kino, das alte Filme preisgünstig zeigt, geschont von der Jugend durch ihren Spott für die fehlenden neuesten Titel, aber gefürchtet von den Älteren, die es für einen kleinen Preis halten, für eine Nacht auszugehen, ohne die Kinder natürlich. Es gibt eine einzelne Autobahn, die durch meine Stadt führt. Auch wenn die An- und Abfahrt in der Stadt neben der unseren sind. Es gab einmal eine Petition, um in unserer Stadt eine An- und Abfahrt zu haben. Die Jugend unterstützte es, während die Älteren ablehnten. Es scheint, dass die Autobahn in unserer Stadt es ruinieren würde, so sagten die Älteren, die letztendlich den Stadtrat überzeugten, die Anfrage abzulehnen. Sie bauen ein neues Gymnasium und wir versuchen, eine Mascotte für unsere Stadt zu finden.

Oder zumindest nicht Orte, an denen die meisten Menschen leben möchten. Aber wenn man hinter der alten, verlassenen Whole Foods geht und dann zurück hinter den Hotels geht, die außerhalb der Sommerferienzeit nur von einigen Familienbesuchen bewohnt sind, findet man eine ganze lebendige Gemeinschaft. In diesen Gemeinschaften, auf diesen Straßen, befinden sich eine Handvoll Wohnkomplexe - nebeneinander liegend wie russische Schnitzelfiguren, die sorgfältig auseinandergenommen und nebeneinander in einem Streifen entlang der Straße platziert wurden. Die ersten Wohnanlagen, die Sie treffen, sind die, die in den Nachrichten für einige weniger angenehme Geschäfte in Erscheinung getreten sind, also konzentrieren wir uns darauf nicht zu sehr - die Erscheinung kann täuschen, nach allen Regeln der Kunst. Aber die Wohnanlagen neben der Anlage und die zwei Anlagen neben jener haben eine ganze andere Welt, von der fast niemand in dieser Gegend weiß. Gegenüber jenen Anlagen befindet sich ein Campus der Community College - ein ruhiges, einschläferndes Ensemble von Gebäuden, das die Straße bewacht, wo Studenten mit Kaffee in der Hand herumlungern und morgens um 7 Uhr gähnen, um ihre einschläfernden Tage zu beginnen. Die Eisentore öffnen sich langsam, um sie einzulassen, während die Pendler aus dem Fenster schreien und ihnen vorwerfen, den Verkehr aufzuhören zu lassen, wenn die Hinzugänge zu den Kursen höher sind. Die Straße trifft auf eine weitere Wohnstraße, die von einer Parkanlage auf einer Seite und einer Reha-Klinik auf der anderen Seite begrenzt ist, wo Menschen, die in unglücklichen Umständen Knochen gebrochen haben, behandelt werden. Die Klinik verfügt über sonnige Terrassenmöbel und einen schläfrig schwingenden Ventilator, der den warmen, dicken Sommerluftströmungen zielgerichtet zusetzt. Kinder rennen hin und her im Gras auf der Parkanlage gegenüber, cartwheelen und pinwheelen über die scharfen grünen Stängel, während Bienen in den Blumenbeeten entlang der Straße faul herumfliegen. Ältere Menschen gehen mit ihren Hunden auf dem Fußweg spazieren, schauen verächtlich zu den Teenagern auf ihren Skateboards hinüber und nicken höflich gegenüber den Teenagern, die sich am Spielplatz versammelt haben, über Jungs und die neuesten YouTube-Sensationen geredet haben. Es gibt einen Sushi-Laden in einem Einkaufszentrum neben dem Park, der günstige Lebensmittel anbietet, aber nie zu voll ist - ein Schwimmwassershop direkt neben dem und ein Nagelstudio in der Mitte. Man könnte dort sein Schwimmbad für die Saison füllen, während man sich eine Maniküre und Hachimchi-Essen lässt, alles auf einmal - die Schönheit eines Einkaufszentrums. Es gibt auch ein gefrorenes Jogurtshop dort, eines der DIY-Arten, und man sieht oft die Teenager auf der Parkanlage mit kalten, schweißgebadeten Tüten gefrorenem Jogurt, der mit Belag bedeckt ist, während sie Stunts auf ihren Skateboards machen und Dampfmaschinen paffen, weil sie es für das coole halten.

She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",

Sie kam aus einer Stadt, in der das Einkaufszentrum nur fünf Minuten zu Fuß von ihrem Haus entfernt war – sie hatte in ihrem Leben noch nie so viel offenes Gelände gesehen. Durch die Ubiquität der Maisfelder schockiert, teilte ich ihr mit, wie es war, in ländlichen Ohio aufzuwachsen, und in diesem Moment wusste sie schließlich, wer ich bin und woher ich komme. Wenn man entlang einer Zwei-Spur-Staatsstraße fährt, erreicht man ein Steinbruch, der mit Wasser gefüllt ist. Etwas weiter ist die kleine Siedlung, in der ich wohne. Die Häuser sind größtenteils aus Backstein und Stuck erbaut. Jedes Haus hat mindestens einen halben Hektar Grundstück, das jeder mit Stolz pflegt. Im Frühjahr sind die jährlich gepflanzten Blumen und die mittelamerikanischen Bäume, die sich mit jeder Jahreszeit ändern, reichlich vorhanden. Die Einfahrten sind alle mit den teuersten Mercedes-Benz-Luxuswagen gefüllt, die im Mittagssonnenschein nach einem guten, alten Fahrzeugbad glänzen. Wenn man weiter entlang der Straße fährt, Richtung meinem grauen Stuckhauste, ist mein koreanischer Nachbar immer draußen mit einem freundlichen Gesicht. Er verbringt den ganzen Tag damit, seinen Rasen zu mähen und kann manchmal über dem Lärm seines Mähbodens singen hören. Jeder im Viertel findet ihn lustig, aber er ist immer ehrlich und ein unglaublicher Mensch mit einer einzigartigen Vergangenheit. Er ist älter geworden und hat einiges von seinem Witz verloren, als er älter wurde. In seiner Vergangenheit war er Arzt und mischt sich normalerweise mit der Grasnarbe und seinem John Deere Zero Turn Mähboden ein. Schließlich erreicht man mein Zuhause. Im Seitenhof sind Gänse reichlich vorhanden und werden von unserem Terrier verfolgt. Im Garten hinter dem Haus ist ein kleiner Bach, der in den Steinbruch fließt. Hier kann man den Quaken der Frosche, den Bach und das gelegentliche \"Muu\" von den nahegelegenen Bauernhöfen hören. Jenseits der handgefertigten Holzbrücke liegt ein unberührter Oasen, der mit natürlichen Wächsern und Wildblumen bewachsen ist. Hier verbrachte ich den größten Teil meiner Kindheit. Von dem Bau von Baumfestungen bis zu \"Jagden\" (die meisten bestanden aus der Verfolgung) war immer etwas zu tun und es gab normalerweise einen Nachbarskind für Freundschaft verfügbar. Die Winter in meinem kleinen Städtchen können schmerzhaft brutale sein, doch es gibt nichts Schöneres. Der Garten verwandelt sich von einem Meer aus Grün in ein leeres Wildnis. Die Bäume, die einst lebhafte rosa, lila und oranger Blüten beherbergten, verwandeln sich in kahle Knochen von Borke. Wenn einem das gelegentliche Schneefall beschenkt, erscheint eine Winterwonderland über Nacht. Der Hinterhof ist mit Schneemännern von meiner kleinen Schwester und Schneemännern gesäumt, und Schneebälle waren unsere Waffe der Wahl. Wir bauten riesige Igloos, um unsere Waffen zu beherbergen, normalerweise mit Zweigen, wie ein Arsenal. In unserem eigenen kleinen Wunderland spielten wir im Kostüm, während es in einer Zeit gab, in der nichts anderes zählte. Wir waren einfach junge Kinder ohne Sorgen.\n\nThe translation back to English is:\n\n[REWRITE] Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past the corn fields that filled the horizon. \"This is it!\" I said, knowing she'd be shocked by the sparseness of the open landscape.

Die unoffizielle Stadtdevise, auf dem Hintergrund einer Gebäude, das als Pizzeria, Bar, Musikclub, Striplokal und illegal auf mindestens der Hälfte dieser Aktivitäten agiert, lautet \"Keep Portland Weird\". Für einige ist das ein kleiner Aufruf, sich an die Portland der 90er und frühen 2000er zu erinnern, eine Portland, die weniger bekannt und weniger teuer war und kreative und einzigartige Subkulturen hervorbrachte. Für andere ist es eine lockende Einladung – kommen Sie nach Portland, wo Sie immer noch als \"weird\" bezeichnet werden, diesmal aber als Kompliment. Trotz des Zustroms von wohlhabenden Kaliforniern und der ständigen Errichtung von Apartmentkomplexen, um diese Kalifornier zu beherbergen, ist Portland immer noch \"weird\". Weird bedeutet nicht immer akzeptierend, aber es bedeutet die Akzeptanz von Dingen, die normalerweise nicht akzeptiert werden. Weird bedeutet nicht, dass wir keine modernen Annehmlichkeiten und keine modernen Kämpfe haben. Wie der Rest des Landes kaufen wir die meisten Dinge aus China. Es gibt eine Million Möglichkeiten, \"weird\" zu sein, aber Portland hat auch viel Normalität. Portland hat Yoga, Hipster und Geschäftsleute. Vielleicht bedeutet \"weird\" nur, dass wir all das weniger ernst nehmen. In meinem Viertel, wie in vielen anderen Portland-Vierteln, haben wir farbenfrohe Häuser, Gärten mit Blumen, Kräutern und Gemüse entlang der Straßen und kostenlose Kisten im Sommer. Free Kisten sind traditionell Kartons, die Dinge enthalten, die jemand entsorgt, aber sie können auch Plastiktüten oder Kisten sein. Sie enthalten etwas Magisches, ein Schatz, der perfekt für den Passanten ist, ein überraschendes Mal. Free Kisten enthalten in der Regel Kleidung und Bücher, aber sie können alles enthalten. Die magische Potenz, durch ein Südosten-Portland-Viertel zu schlendern, ist, was Portland alles umgibt. Das ist, was Portland für mich umgibt, aber ich bin nur eine von Tausenden von \"weird\" Varietäten. Einige Leute, die ich um mich herum habe, träumen nie davon, ihre Kleidung aus einer Kiste auf der Straße zu holen. Diese Leute gehen ins Goat Yoga (ja, Yoga mit lebenden Ziegen) oder zu Timbers-Matches (der Fußballverein der Stadt). Portland ist voller Leute, die alle möglichen Dinge lieben. Portland ist voller Leute, die ihre Träume verfolgen oder darüber träumen, ihre Träume zu verfolgen, während sie zu viel Zeit im Bar verbringen. Ja, Portland hat ein Drogenproblem. Drogenprobleme neigen dazu, (in ihrem Kern) Gesundheitsprobleme zu sein, und der ständige Regen über einen großen Teil des Jahres, plus die grauen Wolken, scheint ein Beitrag zu sein. Portland hat auch ein Obdachlosenproblem, das niemand weiß, was zu tun ist. Die Bevölkerung der Obdachlosen wird von den Sozialdiensten Portland anzieht, die besser sind als in den meisten Teilen des Landes, aber unsere Dienste sind unzureichend, wie in allen Teilen des Landes. Die nicht-Obdachlosen-Bevölkerung schwankt zwischen Mitgefühl und Hass. In diesem Aspekt sind wir nicht \"weird\" im Geringsten.\n\nEnglish translation back from German:\n\n[REWRITE]The first thing you need to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\".

No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",

Ob ich sie vergessen habe oder von Arbeit und Leben so sehr beschäftigt bin, dass ich sie gar nicht wahrnehme – sie sind immer da, unerschütterlich, unbeugsam und unbeeindruckt von den Widrigkeiten des Lebens. An Tagen, an denen ich mich am stressigsten und am schmerzlichsten fühle, fordern sie meine Aufmerksamkeit, und wenn ich mich ihnen zuwendet, erlauben sie mir, meine angespannte Seele zu beruhigen und mir Kraft für den nächsten Tag zu geben. Ich bin hier, als ich mein Studium begonnen habe, und die Berge nördlich des Campus haben mich zuerst fasziniert. Sicher, die Universität hat ihre eigenen atemberaubenden Sehenswürdigkeiten in Gebäuden, Teichen und Bäumen, die auch ihren eigenen Teil meines Herzens haben, aber es sind die Berge, die ihren Thron behaupten. Der Rest der Stadt ist in eigener Recht schön. Es gibt unzählige Cafes, in denen ich viele Stunden mit Kaffee und Geschäftigkeit verbracht habe. Man kann zu Fuß oder mit dem Bus nur ein kleines Stück weiter in das Zentrum der Stadt gehen und in eine Aura der Antiquität von den abgenutzten Farben umgeben sein, die die Restaurants und Bürogebäude umgeben. Hier zeigt sich diese suburbane Stadt in ihrer ganzen Begeisterung und Vitalität, genau wie ihre benachbarte Großstadt. Dies bleibt jedoch nicht für viele Blocks anhalten, da man leicht entfliehen kann, indem man sich wieder einmal in die ruhige Kleinstadt zurückzieht, indem man die Bibliothek passiert. Diese Dichotomie von Atmosphären in solcher Nähe gibt dieser Stadt eine wunderbare Note, als ob sie einladen würde, sie zu erkunden. Mit diesem Geheimnis ist es leicht, viele lieb gewordene Erinnerungen zu schaffen, jede in Verbindung mit einem bestimmten Teil der Stadt. Ob es geht darum, vorbei an den verrosteten Schaukeln im Park mit Freunden nach einem Alleinunterhalter zu schlendern oder durch das hektische Zentrum zu laufen, um den Film im luxuriösen Theater für den Film zu sehen, für den die Universität die Tickets bereitgestellt hat. Ach, es ist auch Heimat für viele harte Erinnerungen, wie es mit jedem Ort in dem Leben ist. Die Teiche, insbesondere, sind ein passender Ort für Reflexionen, aber auch für Tränen in der Mitte der Nacht an einem existenziellen Krisen. Letztere habe ich mehr Erfahrung darin. Während ich die Schlangen, Enten und Insekten beobachtet habe, die ihr Leben in der Stadt ausleben, jeder mit einem Beitrag oder einer Rolle, konnte ich nicht umhin, mich über meinen eigenen Sinn für das Leben zu wundern, während ich mich bemühte, dieses Rätsel namens Leben zu navigieren. Also ging ich vorbei am Teich, vorbei am Park und den kleinen Häusern, die die Suburbanität verkörpern, bis ich auf eine Hauptstraße gelangte. Es war dann, dass die Sonne ihre strahlenden Strahlen auf die Palmenbäume legte, die Himmel entlang malte und als ich nach oben schaute, realisierte ich, dass ich nach Norden ging. Genau wie es immer war, standen die massigen Berge, die das graue und gelbliche Himmel mehr als jedes Gebäude im Horizont umgaben, und als ob sie ohne Worte sprächen, erweckten sie in mir die Kraft zum Durchhalten.\n\nBack to English:\n\n[REWRITE] The mountains are always there.

Whether I forget about them or am so busy with work and life that I don't even notice them - they are always there, unshakeable, unyielding, and unmoved by the hardships of life. On days when I feel the most stressed and miserable, they demand my attention, and when I turn to them, they allow me to calm my anxious soul and give me the strength to carry on, one day at a time. I moved here when I started my studies, and the mountains north of the campus were the first to captivate me. Of course, the university has its own breathtaking views in buildings, ponds, and trees, which also have their own share of my heart, but it's the mountains that hold their throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafes where I spent many hours fueled by coffee and hustle. You can walk or take the bus a little further to the city center and be surrounded by an aura of antiquity with the faded colors that surround restaurants and office buildings. Here, this suburban town shows as much fervor and vitality as its neighboring big city. This doesn't last for many blocks, as one can easily escape and retreat again to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity gives this city a wonderful vibe as if it was inviting to be explored. With this secret, it's easy to create many cherished memories, each associated with a particular part of town. Whether it's strolling past the rusty swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or rushing through the busy city center to catch the movie at the fancy theater which the university provided tickets for. Alas, it's also home to many harsh memories, just like every place in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a fitting place for reflection as well as tearful sessions in the middle of the night during an existential crisis. The latter, I have more experience with. While watching the snakes, ducks, and insects living out their lives, each contributing or playing a role, I couldn't help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, past the park and the little houses that scream suburban, until I reached a main street. It was then that the sun shone its brilliant rays on the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Just as it always was, the imposing mountains towered over the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building on the horizon, and as if speaking without words, it stirred in me the strength to persevere.",

Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket.

Öffentliche Verkehrsmittel sind sehr zugänglich und stehen unter den beliebtesten Verkehrsmitteln in New York City. Bensonhurt ist ein ziemlich städtisches Viertel, sodass Sie sich immer noch so fühlen, als ob Sie sich in New York City befinden. Während Ihres Besuchs werden Sie sich auf die verschiedenen asiatischen Läden um Sie herum vorbereiten müssen. Im Laufe der letzten zwei Jahrzehnte hat Bensonhurt einen starken Zuzug asiatischer Einwohner erfahren. Deshalb werden Sie in der Regel einen asiatisch besitzenen Laden auf jeder Straße entlanglaufen sehen. Am beliebtesten sind Einkaufszentren und Waschsalons. Zufällig ist, dass diese Unternehmen sehr beliebt bei den Einheimischen sind, da die Lebensmittelqualität in den Einkaufszentren sehr hoch ist, die Preise sehr viel günstiger sind und es sehr bequem ist. Etwas in der Nähe, wo ich bin, gibt es vier asiatische Einkaufszentren in zweiminütiger Fußgängerentfernung voneinander. Das fügt sich einfach zu der Bequemlichkeit der Zugänglichkeit von Lebensmitteln hinzu. Ich sage nicht, dass Bensonhurst von ausschließlich asiatischen Einwohnern bewohnt ist, obwohl. Es ist um mich herum sehr vielfältig, mit Einwanderern und ihren ersten- und zweiten Generationen amerikanischen Kindern hier. Die meisten großen und beliebten Unternehmen im lokalen Bereich sind asiatisch besitzt. Neben diesen asiatisch besitzenen Unternehmen gibt es auch ein kürzlich renoviertes Parkgebiet in der Nähe, das etwa zehn Basketballplätze, einen großen Sportplatz für Fußball oder Baseball, vier Handballplätze, Seilspringen, ein Spielplatz für Kinder und sogar eine Wasserspielfontäne für Kinder, um Wasser im Sommer zu genießen. Da wir uns in New York City befinden, ist es natürlich, dass die Parks sehr vielfältig sind. Sie werden alle Arten von Vielfalt hier sehen, die sich gut unterhalten. In diesem Viertel gibt es nicht viele große Konzerngebäude. Die einzigen Gebäude, die Sie finden würden, sind solche für Co-op-Wohnung, oder Condominium-Appartments. Die meisten Wohnungen hier sind zu zweifamilienhäusern. Die meisten Leute sind jedoch sehr nett, aber sehr lauten. Jeden Tag hören Sie Autos, die ihre Musik laufen lassen, als sie vor Ihrem Haus vorbeifahren, oder konstanten Fuß auf Gas geben an ihren Autos, die Sie in der Morgengrausamkeit wecken. Wenn Sie sich entscheiden, bei Nacht zu besuchen, sollten Sie sich auf der Hut sein. Dieses Viertel ist ziemlich sicher, aber die Leute sind unvorhersehbar. Sie können auf Leute treffen, die zu nichts darauf eingerichtet sind, Ärger zu verursachen, Bullen und Diebe. Ich selbst wurde in diesem Viertel in der Vergangenheit physisch angegriffen, aber das war viele Jahre her. Ein weiteres neuerliches Zwischenfall ging um die Diebstahl von Paketen. Obwohl dies ein häufiges Phänomen ist, gibt es in diesem Viertel Paketdiebe. Zuletzt jedoch, obwohl New York City eine Strafe für Leute hat, die nicht hinter ihren Hunden nachkommen, tun sie es hier nicht. Jeden Morgen werden Sie mindestens einmal Hundekot vor dem Zugbahnhof oder auf dem Weg zum Einkaufszentrum sehen. Mein größter Ärger ist der Hundekot auf dem Boden, überall, wohin ich gehe in diesem Viertel. Seien Sie vorsichtig und hüten Sie Ihre Schuhe sauber!\n\nEnglish translation back to English:\nWhen you decide to visit Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you won't have any trouble finding it.

Alles scheint sich nach unten abzusinken, und mein Haus sitzt direkt am höchsten Punkt des steilsten Hügels in der Nachbarschaft. Die Leute nennen ihn den \"Trainingshügel\" wegen der vielen Jogger, die sich während ihres täglichen Trainings auf ihn hochlaufen. Da es überhaupt keine Gehwege auf meiner Straße gibt, gehen die Leute auf der Straße. Die Straße ist in ein paar Stellen ausgesackt und kann gefährlich zu fahren sein. Einige der Telefon- und Stromleitungen, die um den Block herum gespannt sind, sehen zerrissen aus. Es regnet und stürmt oft in unserer Gegend, also fallen Äste und andere Abfälle oft auf die Stromleitungen und die ständigen Reparaturen machen sie aussehen wie ein Mosaik. Es gibt viele hohe, immergrüne Bäume überall herum, aber die Leute hier hasst sie. Sie streben danach, so viele wie möglich zu fällen, weil die Bäume die Aussicht auf das Meer behindern. Deshalb werden viele der Häuser so hoch auf den Hügel gebaut, mit riesigen Glasfronten im zweiten Stock, die sich nach oben erheben, um die Aussicht auf die Bucht zu genießen. Es ist atemberaubend bei Sonnenuntergang, wenn das Wasser von unten beleuchtet wird und der Himmel orange wird. Es ist oft bewölkt, also sieht man den größten Teil der Sonnenbeleuchtung durch Nebel. Die meisten Tage sind bewölkt und feucht. Moos wächst auf alles, was es erreichen kann: Dächer, Autos und Geländer. Ich habe einmal meinen Wagen einen Monat in meinem Einfahrt geparkt und als ich ihn wieder herausnehmen wollte, war er grün und pelzig mit Moos bedeckt. Es dauerte mich drei Stunden, um das alles abzuschaben. Es gibt nicht viele Kinder in der Nähe, wo ich wohne, obwohl es ein Schulhaus nur ein paar Häuserblocks entfernt gibt. Die meisten Leute in meiner Nachbarschaft sind älter, viele von ihnen sind pensioniert. Stattdessen haben die Leute Hunde. Es ist üblich, sie auf den Vorgärten sitzen zu sehen oder sie sich auf der Straße nach dem anderen jagen. Wenn du eine Tür oder ein Fenster offen lässt, riskierst du, dass sie in dein Haus schlüpfen. Ich habe einmal einen in meinem Wohnzimmer gefunden und musste ihn mit dem Hintern vor die Tür jagen. Hasen laufen wild herum in der Gegend. Einige von ihnen sind groß genug und die Gärtner hasst sie wegen der Wurzeln der Pflanzen, die sie aufgraben, und weil sie in die Vorgärten der Leute bauen. Meine Katzen lieben sie jedoch und haben die meisten von ihnen aus unserem Viertel vertrieben.

    "original": "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year.

Es ist eine Verbindungsstraße zwischen zwei Bundesstraßen, also haben wir hier ein bisschen mehr Verkehr als ich mir wünschen würde, aber abgesehen davon ist es ein ruhiger Wohngebiet. Es gibt nicht allzu viele Leute, die einziehen oder ausziehen, also bin ich an den meisten Leuten, die in unserem Viertel leben, gewöhnt. Die Leute beschäftigen sich im Wesentlichen mit dem Gartenarbeit und anderen täglichen Aufgaben. Im Winter fahren wir auf der Seite unserer Straße den Hügel herunter. Wir wohnen in einem Haus am vorderen Winkel unserer Straße, also sehen wir jeden Tag, wie Leute kommen und gehen, und sind mit den Autos vertraut, die hier herumfahren. Wenn wir ein unbekanntes Fahrzeug sehen, nehmen wir uns das meistens merkwürdig vor. Einige Nachbarn gehen spazieren, um sich zu bewegen oder um ihre Hunde auszuführen. Die Kinder spielen auf ihren Fahrrädern und all das, was man von einem solchen Ort erwarten würde. Wir sind oft zu Hause, da wir von unserem Haus arbeiten. Es sind vier von uns: mein Mann und ich und unsere beiden Töchter im Alter von elf und vierzehn Jahren. Also kann ich sagen, dass jeder andere sich an uns, wie wir kommen und gehen, gewöhnt hat. Wir gehen raus und spielen, manchmal sogar im Regen. Manchmal grillen wir auch auf unserer Rückseite auf der Terrasse und es riecht immer nach einem leckeren Grillgeruch und dem Barbecue. Es scheint, dass jemand immer den Rasen umgräbt und man hört fast jeden Tag ein Rasenmähen von März bis etwa Oktober, wenn der Rasen schließlich aufhört zu wachsen. Wir haben in unserem Viertel viele Bäume, da es ursprünglich ein bewaldetes Gebiet war, also gibt es viel Schatten, aber auch immer viel Laub im Herbst. Das bedeutet, dass wir fast jedes Jahr Laub räumen müssen und das brennen. Ich mag den Geruch von brennendem Laub auch, also ist das immer ein schöner Hinweis, dass der Herbst angebrochen ist. Laut der letzten Zeit haben wir nicht viel Winter erlebt, also fühlt es sich nur so an, als würde der Herbst sich endlos hinziehen. Unser Garagen ist am Ende unseres Hauses, also nutzen wir die Vordertür unseres Hauses nur selten, es sei denn, jemand klopfen an der Tür, was selten vorkommt. Ich mag es, in der Garage an meinem Truck oder an anderen Projekten zu arbeiten, wenn ich die Garagentore offen habe, fühlt sich an, als ob ich mehr in das Nachbarschaft eingebunden bin. Bei Feiertagen ist es hier ziemlich ruhig. Der Thanksgiving sieht einige Nachbarschaftsfamilien, die Leute aus der Stadt besuchen, und es gibt mehr Autos geparkt als normal während dieser Zeit des Jahres. Es ist das Gleiche bei anderen Feiertagen wie Muttertag und Weihnachten. Insgesamt gefällt es mir hier zu leben. Wenn es keine Durchgangsstraße wäre, wäre es perfekt.\n\nEnglish translation:\n\n[REWRITE] I live in a typical suburban area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There aren't too many people moving in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people who live in the neighborhood. People mostly occupy themselves with yard work and other daily chores. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see an unfamiliar vehicle, we take note of it. Some neighbors go for a walk to get exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that one would expect from a place like that. We're home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us: myself and my wife, and our two daughters aged eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is accustomed to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. We occasionally grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone mowing the lawn around here and you can hear a lawn mower almost every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's plenty of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the fall as well. This means raking and burning leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much winter at all, so it just feels like an extended fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we rarely use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it's pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect. [/REWRITE]",

Es sei denn, jemand hat es persönlich erlebt, lebt hier, dann versteht man nicht, wie es ist, ständig braunes zu sehen und wenn man ein Gras sieht, weiß man, dass derjenige, der es hat, einen Haufen Geld für die Bewirtschaftung des Rasens ausgibt. Als ich hier in den 90ern wohnte, waren die Häuser weit auseinander gestellt. Jetzt ist es fast gleich geblieben, aber es gibt viele neue Bebauungen. Ehrlich gesagt, sieht dieser Ort immer mehr wie eine Stadt aus, aber die meisten Orte ändern sich auf ähnliche Weise. Die Menschen hier sind meist sehr freundlich, aber wie in jeder Stadt hast du deine guten und schlechten Seiten. In meinem Viertel bin ich umgeben von freundlichen alten Leuten. Ich denke, es ist ein angenehmes Viertel. Die Geschäfte hier sind fast alle Kettengeschäfte, wie Food 4 Less, Smart und Final. Wenn du Bio-Kost willst, musst du ausreisen. Ich sehe nie welche ganze Geschäfte oder ähnlichen Geschäfte. Die meisten Jobs in meiner Stadt, ich würde sagen, basierend auf keiner offiziellen Demografie, sind in der Baubranche. Ich denke, das liegt daran, dass diese Stadt noch nicht sehr entwickelt ist, es gibt immer noch viel offenes Gelände, das bebaut werden kann. Das ist mir ein bisschen unheimlich, ich mag die Dinge so, wie sie jetzt sind. Ich kam aus einer großen Stadt und ich bin nicht begeistert, wieder dorthin zurückzukehren. Die Rede ist von der Baubranche, das ist auch meine volle Zeitbeschäftigung, ich bin Drywall- und T-Balkenmonteur. Das, was ich an meiner Heimat mag, sind die verschiedenen Tiere. Menschen kommen in die Wüste dafür, dass es so schön ist. Die Wüstenklimate und -landschaften haben herausfordernde Ökosysteme geschaffen, die geschützt werden müssen, in denen verschiedene Arten von Wildtieren leben. Die menschlichen Bewohner der Wüste sollten sich mit den nichtmenschlichen Bewohnern dieser Umgebung vertraut machen, um sicher und harmonisch miteinander zu koexistieren. Mein Familien und ich haben uns sehr gut an die Wildtiere angepasst. Ich habe drei Kinder und sie sind alle von Eidechsen und Dessert-Heuschrecken besessen, als ich das jetzt schreibe, sind sie draußen und versuchen, verschiedene Exemplare zu fingieren. Was die Attraktionen angeht, haben wir einige. Victorville ist auch ein gutes Ort für Familien, um die Wüste zu erleben. Es kann eine andere Erfahrung bieten. Wenn du kannst, plane deinen Besuch so, dass du zu dem jährlichen Ereignis, dem San Bernardino County Fair, kommst. Die Messe wird deinen Besuch mit der richtigen Mischung an Aktivitäten und Spaß bereichern, in Victorville-Manier.

Während andere, die auf diese Frage antworten, wahrscheinlich Eigentümer sind, die ihre eigenen Leben führen, ist meine Situation ein bisschen anders. Ich betrachte meine Nachbarschaft als den Universitätscampus, auf dem ich bin, und die Menschen, die in meinem Studentenwohnheim leben, als meine Gemeinschaft. Ich betrachte auch den umliegenden Campus als meine Nachbarschaft, wenn auch in geringerem Umfang. Trotz dieser Besonderheit teilt meine Nachbarschaft einige Gemeinsamkeiten mit den konventionelleren Ideen über eine Nachbarschaft. Wie jede konventionelle Nachbarschaft hat auch die Nachbarschaft, in der ich bin, Häuser, Menschen, Geschäfte und Parks. Lassen Sie uns beginnen, indem wir über die \"Häuser\" sprechen, die meine Nachbarschaft bilden. Bevor ich mich den Häusern in meiner Nachbarschaft widme, wäre es am besten, die Arten von Häusern zu klären, die in meiner Nähe zu finden sind. Es gibt drei Arten von Unterkünften in meiner unmittelbaren Umgebung, die Studentenwohnungen, die tatsächlichen Häuser und die Studentenhauswohnungen. Zuerst sind es die Studentenwohnungen, in denen normalerweise 2-4 Personen in jedem Raum wohnen und es gibt etwa 4-6 Räume auf jedem Stockwerk. Das am häufigsten vorkommende Bautyp kann etwa 2 Stockwerke beherbergen, sodass durchschnittlich 20 oder so Menschen in jedem Gebäude leben. Zweitens sind die tatsächlichen Häuser, die von jedem mit einer Verbindung zur Schule gemietet werden können. Typischerweise sind dies 2-4-Zimmer-Einheiten, die normalerweise von Alumni bewohnt werden. Es gibt jedoch nur eine Handvoll dieser Arten von Häusern im gesamten Viertel, da sie weniger effizient sind. Schließlich gibt es die typischen Studentenzimmer, die hunderte von Studenten beherbergen. In diesen teilen sich zwei Personen einen Raum mit Ausnahme, und es ist der am häufigsten vorkommende Typ von Unterkunft in meiner Nachbarschaft. Die Menschen in dieser Nachbarschaft können nicht gerecht werden, indem man nur über sie spricht, also ist es am besten, einfach zu der nächsten Sache überzugehen, nämlich die Geschäfte und Parks in meiner Nachbarschaft. Da meine Schule wirklich ihr eigenes, selbstständiges Viertel ist, verfügt sie über eine Vielzahl von Geschäften und einen einzigen Park. Die Geschäfte sind eine Mischung aus Essensoptionen, die man in jeder anderen Nachbarschaft finden würde, und dem eigenen einzigartigen Markenartikel der Schule und Lebensmittelgeschäften. Daher kann in meiner Nachbarschaft alles, was benötigt wird, innerhalb ihrer Grenzen gefunden werden!

I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",

Ich habe mich nie wirklich mit meinen Nachbarn angefreundet, außer Mr. Glen und seinen Kindern, sowie Dennis für ein bisschen, die beide direkt neben uns wohnen. Sie sind angenehme Leute, die ich fast als Familie betrachten kann auf eine Weise und ich schätze sie wirklich. Ich erinnere mich, wie ich, meine Mutter, mein Vater und meine Schwester zu Mr. Glens Hochzeit gegangen sind (Sie heirateten sich wieder) Es war wirklich lustig und angenehm, um es so auszudrücken, und etwas, auf das ich mich eines Tages freue, als ich mein Vermögen aufbauen und meiner zukünftigen Frau das Leben einer Königin geben werde. Als Mr. Glens Frau, Ms. Veda, das weiße kleine Band um ihren Bein abnahm und es weggeworfen hat, habe ich es aufgefangen! Leider habe ich die Blumen nicht aufgefangen! Wir tänzten die ganze Nacht durch und ich genoss es, eine gute Zeit mit Marsharii, einer ihrer Töchter, zu haben. Ich habe sie seitdem nicht mehr gesehen. Ich hoffe, sie ist an größerem und Besseres herangewachsen. Das Viertel selbst ist wie ein Labyrinth, obwohl ich jetzt einen GPS habe, damit ich mich besser auskenne und es erkunde kann. Ich bin nur so weit gegangen, als ich mich mit meinen Freunden Kason und Curtis getroffen habe. Wir spielten früher viel damit Videospiele und genossen das Leben zu seiner vollen Ausprägung, so gut wir konnten. Manchmal ging ich in den Park, um Natur zu genießen, was mein Gemüt beruhigt. Es gibt mir ein Gefühl von Ruhe und Frieden in diesen Tagen. Ich werde auch einige Stangen, die ich in der Heimwerker-Fachhandlung gekauft habe, mitnehmen und meine Balance üben, und wenn ich kann, auch meinen Bokken-Schwert mitbringen. Ich genieße es, das zu tun, was ich liebe. Es gibt auch ein Basketball- und Tennishof, obwohl ich Tennis oder Basketball schon lange nicht mehr gespielt habe, es ist schön, sie zu haben, falls ich es mal wieder aufnehmen und es erneut probieren möchte. Mein Vater hat mich und meinen besten Freund auf Tennis mit Mr. Graves aufgezogen, und wir hatten immer eine großartige Zeit. Sie machten uns hart arbeiten! Aber wir hatten immer Spaß. Ich denke, es gibt viele Male, an denen ich mich in diesem Viertel amüsiert habe, und es gibt viele Geschichten, aber diese sind mir besonders in Erinnerung geblieben und ich glaube, dass das Beste noch kommt!\n\nNow, I will translate the German version back to English:\n\n[REWRITE] \nAlso, since I've been here for about 10 years, I think I can say what I know. First, I was very sad when I came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge and I must be honest, I cried because I missed them and I loved them... but my mom and my dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better neighborhood, a better school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Over the years, I got used to it and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really got to know my neighbors, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both living right next to us. They are pleasant people that I almost can consider as family in some way and I really appreciate them. I remember when my mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen's wedding (They remarried) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I'm looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a queen. When Mr. Glen's wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Unfortunately, I didn't catch the flowers! We all danced the night through and I enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven't seen her since though. I hope she's grown up to greater and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can explore it better and get to know it. I've only gone so far, and that's when I've hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We used to play video games a lot and enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which calms my soul. It gives me a feeling of calmness and peace these days. I'll also take some sticks that I bought at the hardware store and practice my balance, and bring my bokken wooden sword if I can. I have fun doing what I love. There's also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven't played tennis or basketball in a long time, it's nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and try it again. My dad brought me and my best friend up on tennis with Mr. Graves, and we always had a great time. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I think there are many times I've had fun in this neighborhood, and there are plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best is yet to come! [/REWRITE]",

They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it.

Es gibt hauptsächlich Wohngebäude, aber ein paar Restaurants und Bars, die Spaß machen und nicht besonders teuer sind. Eine dieser Bars wurde kürzlich umbenannt und ist nun teurer, aber der Service und die Getränke sind nicht schlecht. Die meisten Leute sind nett. Sie sind entweder Studenten oder sie haben ein niedriges Einkommen, da die Mietwohnungen nicht besonders teuer sind. Es gibt viele Kinder in der Nähe, da eine Grundschule in Gehweite von meinem Apartment liegt. Ich kenne meine Nachbarn nicht, aber ich möchte sie nicht wirklich kennenlernen. Sie rauchen sehr viel Marihuana und das Management unseres Gebäudes hat daher ein Luftreiniger-System direkt vor ihrer Tür installiert, was mein Freund und ich sehr lustig fanden, aber fast beleidigend ist. Die Gebäude, die in meiner Nähe stehen, sehen normalerweise ziemlich alt aus, aber möglicherweise haben sie renovierte Innenräume. Etwas weiter die Straße hinunter gibt es brandneue Apartments, aber ich mag sie nicht, weil ich weiß, dass die Bauqualität nicht besonders gut war. Sie sind preiswert gebaut, aber der Mietzins ist teuer, was ich als eine sehr große Enttäuschung empfinde, weil die Mieter wegen der Nähe zur Universität haben wegkommen. Es gibt ein sehr günstiges Restaurant etwa fünf Minuten von meinem Wohnort entfernt, das nur auf Papier serviert und die meisten Gerichte sind auf dem Mikrowellenherd zubereitet. Dann gegenüber befindet sich ein Autogas-Station, die ich hörte, ist kein sehr guter Ort zum Arbeiten. Doch dank Geld von der Stadt wurde die Straße im letzten Sommer neu asphaltiert, so dass es gibt einen großen Fußweg, viel Gras auf den Mittelstreifen und den Seitenstraßen, und das Gebiet ist ein bisschen hübscher geworden. Aber das Apartmenthaus, in dem ich wohne, wird von Bäumen umgeben. Sie haben einige von ihnen gefällt, also sind einige Baumstümpfe übrig, aber da ich wohne, gibt es viel mehr Bäume als in der Nähe. Hinter meinem Apartmentkomplex gibt es einen Baumrain und dann ein weiteres Apartmenthaus. Ich wohne auf der 42. Straße, aber direkt dahinter ist die 43. Straße und diese ist nicht so nett. Die Fußwege sind sehr schlecht und fallen auseinander, und die meisten Gebäude sehen heruntergekommen aus. Es gibt viele Bäume auf dieser Straße, aber das ist wahrscheinlich nur, um die Häuser zu verstecken. Die meisten Verbrechen in meiner Gegend geschahen in einem Apartmentkomplex, aber ich kann sie nicht einfach nur beschuldigen. Es gibt Apartments gegenüber von mir, die auch viele Verbrechen und eine eher wanderruhende Bevölkerung haben. Aber ich glaube, dass ich, wo ich wohne, gerne bin. Ich kann es mir leisten, und es gibt viele nützliche Einrichtungen in der Nähe.

We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",

Sie sind abwechselnd platziert und angeordnet, sodass sie wie einzelne Häuser aussehen. Der einzige Unterschied ist, dass jeder mit gelben Farbe gestrichen ist, weißen Vordächern und grünen Metalldächern. Beinahe jeder, aber nicht alle, sind miteinander befreundet. Wir stehen manchmal am Ende einer nicht bestimmen Auffahrt abends und plaudern, während die kleinen Kinder der Nachbarschaft mit ihren Spielsachen, Asphaltfarben oder mit ihren Drachen spielen. Es ist sehr erfrischend in dieser modernen, alles zur Maschine/Computer gefüllten Welt. Es ist fast, als ob wir uns in der Vergangenheit befinden. Wir werden von Feldern und Bäumen umgeben, die durch blaue Himmel und wehende Wolken noch erhöht werden. Die einzige Schwäche? Diese Saison erleben wir Tornados und zum ersten Mal haben wir letzten Abend tatsächlich Tornadosirenen gehört, so dass wir uns in einen sicheren Raum begeben mussten. Natürlich fand ihr mich in der Badewanne, umklammert mit meinem kleinsten Hund, meiner Handtasche und ein paar Kissen. Mein großer Hund interessierte sich nicht für das Badezimmer und blieb im Wohnzimmer, nervös und bellen, nervös wegen der seltsamen Umstände. Die Nachbarschaft war ruhig, außer dem Geräusch des großen Hagels, der überall auf dem Boden fiel. Nach dem Sturm war die Straße tatsächlich dampfend aufgrund der Temperaturänderung. Wir gingen von 92 auf 75 Grad in wenigen Minuten. Der Hagel schmolz sofort, als er auf die heiße Straße traf. Als ich hinauf zu den klaren Himmeln blickte, kam die Sonne heraus und begann es zu regnen. Ein doppelter Regenbogen erschien. Ich lief in das Haus und nahm mein Kamera. Schnell machte ich Fotos, um sie mit meinen Facebook-Freunden und Verwandten zu teilen. Sie waren beeindruckt, so wie ich. Die Straßen blieben still für weitere eine Stunde, bevor einige Leute endlich von woanders heimkamen, als der Unwettersturm traf. Dann war es wieder Geschäft wie gewohnt, Mütter und Kinder draußen, während das Abendessen kochte. Eine so freundliche Nachbarschaft für diese Frau, die kürzlich von NH nach NC gezogen ist. Ich bin süchtig nach dem südlichen Akzent, den die Leute sprechen. Ich habe ein zwei-Zimmer- und zwei-Badezimmer-Apartment, genauso wie alle anderen. Obwohl alle Häuser von außen gleich aussehen, sind nicht alle Apartments von innen gleich. Einige sind tatsächlich sehr klein. Es ist mir nicht klar, warum. Ich liebe es, entlang des größten Feldes hinter meinem Haus zu laufen und hinunter zum See zu gehen, der nicht zum Baden gedacht ist. Ich habe Hirsche gesehen und am Morgen kann man den Riesenfrosch hören, der sein Lied singt. Es ist ein fantastisches Ort, um zu leben, nur 40 Minuten außerhalb der Stadt Charlotte. Jeden Morgen wird man begrüßt vom Läuten der Hähne von den umliegenden Bauernhöfen. Es ist fast, als ob man in einer kleinen Dorfgemeinschaft lebt. Wir haben sogar einen Esel auf einer nahegelegenen Farm, den man in der Abenddämmerung hören kann, der uns wissen lässt, dass er da ist. Ich war glücklich, diesen Schatz einer Nachbarschaft zu finden.\n\nTranslated German text back to English:\n\n[REWRITE] My neighborhood consists of duplexes on a ring road.

    "original": "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",

Ich fühle mich so, als könnte ich mich auf meine Nachbarn verlassen. Es gibt einen Park etwa eine Minute oder zwei von meinem Haus entfernt. Ich habe viele Erinnerungen dort. Ich habe dort Basketball, Fußball und Baseball mit den anderen Jungs im Viertel gespielt. Ich habe auch mit dem Fußball einen meiner schlimmsten Erinnerungen dort gemacht, als ich mir in die Nase geboxt wurde, aber die guten Erinnerungen überschlagen sich. Wenn ich jetzt einmal zu dem Park gehe, ist es, um Zeit mit den Enkelkindern meines Cousins zu verbringen. Sie sind viel jünger als ich und mögen noch immer aufs Rutschen und auf Schaukeln. Die Vorstellung, zum Park zu gehen, macht sie aufgeregt. Der Park macht mich an viele verschiedene Gründe nostalgisch. Das Viertel ist sehr vielfältig. Man findet in der Nähe allerlei Essen. In einem Radius von einem Meilenradius kann man chinesische, indische, mexikanische und italienische Restaurants finden. Allerdings verwenden viele Leute jetzt Apps wie GrubHub und DoorDash, um Essen direkt an ihre Haustür geliefert zu bekommen. Die bekanntesten Essensorteen sind die Schnellrestaurants, aber man kann die in fast jedem Vorortviertel finden. Es gibt auch genügend Pizzastuben. Die Geschäfte enthalten alles, was man je brauchen könnte. Es gibt mehrere Saunen in der Nähe. Es gibt ein Walgreens und ein CVS auf der gleichen Straße sowie ein Jewel-Osco-Supermarkt, der in der Mitte des Landes beliebt ist. Einige der Geschäfte sind sogar vielfältig, da es ein indisches eigenes Geschäft gibt, falls man mal in der Stimmung ist, einige heimisches indisches Essen zu machen oder einige fertiges indisches Essen zu kaufen. Insgesamt bin ich ein Fan meines Viertels. Wenn ich mich auf sozialen Medien und in den Nachrichten über die Horror-Geschichten anderer Menschen mit ihren Nachbarn lese, wird ich dankbar für meines.\n\nEnglish translation:\n\n[REWRITE]I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was difficult for me to make friends at first but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other kids in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park brings back memories for me. The neighborhood is very diverse. You can find all kinds of food nearby. In a one-mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays a lot of people just use food delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.[/REWRITE]",

Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants.

Er fällt nicht auf, wenn man ihn mit anderen in South Carolina vergleicht, aber er hat einen erheblichen Einfluss auf den Agrarsektor. Johnston wird als die Weltpeach-Hauptstadt bekannt, etwas, was der Ort stolz auf dem Willkommensschild präsentiert. Die Gemeinde besteht hauptsächlich aus landwirtschaftlich genutzten Flächen, die von Apfelbäumen oder Rindern dominiert werden. Die Häuser, die nicht im Hauptteil des Ortes liegen, sind weit voneinander entfernt; die meisten sind zweistöckig, haben entweder Metalldächer, um den schmelzenden Sommerhitze zu widerstehen, oder graue Schieferdächer. Häufig sind diese Häuser nicht in der Nähe der Straße, sondern liegen weiter hinten, sodass die vorderen Felder für Tiere/Vieh verwendet werden können. Im Hauptteil des Ortes befindet sich ein einziges Stoplight, das an einer Kreuzung hängt. Hier sind auch die einzigen Geschäfte des gesamten Ortes zu finden. Es gibt drei Orte, an denen man \"Fast Food\" bekommen kann: Hongkong, ein kleines chinesisches Restaurant, das von einer einzelnen Familie geführt wird, Fiesta Mexikanisches Restaurant oder Gary's, ein kleiner Burger-Chain. Es gab einmal eine Pizzeria, aber es ist vor einiger Zeit geschlossen worden. Es gibt eine sehr kleine, von einer Familie betriebene Apotheke namens Maxwell and Halford Drug, und bei ihr ist es merkwürdig genug, dass sie für die Cherry Coca-Cola bekannt sind, die sie verkaufen. Es gibt einen kleinen, aber teuren Supermarkt namens Independent Grocers Alliance, auch bekannt als IGA. Obwohl es der einzige Supermarkt im gesamten Ort ist, kaufen viele Menschen nur ein oder zwei Artikel um; die meisten bevorzugen es, zum Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville zu fahren, um die meisten ihrer Lebensmittel zu kaufen. Das beliebteste Geschäft im gesamten Ort ist Dollar General, das eine Vielzahl von Alltagsartikeln verkauft und oft sehr frequentiert ist, vom Moment, als es öffnet, bis zum Schließen. Es gibt eine sehr kleine Möbelgeschäft genannt Possibilities Furniture & More, das von einer freundlichen Frau geführt wird, die in der Gemeinde bekannt ist. Das Geschäft besteht seit einer Vielzahl von Jahren im Ort und beschäftigt sogar zwei Möbelpacker, die die gekauften Möbel liefern. Zu dem Möbelgeschäft angeschlossen ist ein kleines Tierpensionsgeschäft namens Clarks Cuts and Kennels. Sie bieten eine Vielzahl von Dienstleistungen an, wie z.B. Hunde-Tagespflege, Tierpension, Fellpflege, Nagelgrinden, Baden usw. Die Praxen von Arzt und Tierarzt liegen außerhalb des Hauptteils des Ortes; es sind beide sehr kleine Praxen, aber gut ausgestattet, um die Bewohner von Johnston zu unterstützen. Es gibt eine einzelne Grundschule namens Johnston Elementary School. Sobald die Schüler den fünften Schulklassen abschließen, müssen sie sowohl Mittelschule als auch Highschool im nächsten Dorf besuchen. Es gibt inoffiziell keine Spielplätze im Dorf, aber sie arbeiten derzeit an einem 2,5 Hektar großen Freizeitgelände, um den Familien mehr Gelegenheiten zu bieten, Ausflüge zu machen und mehr Besucher/Aufnahmekandidaten anzuziehen. Zugegeben, es gibt nicht viel zu tun; es gibt keine Kinos, Bowlingbahnen, \"Hängenout\"-Spots, Spielplätze für Kinder, Plätze, um Hunde auszuführen, oder eine große Auswahl an Restaurants. Trotzdem ist es ein netter Ort, so klein, dass man ihn im Augenblick übersehen könnte, ohne es zu bemerken!\n\nEnglish translation of the German text:\n\n[REWRITE] My neighborhood is a small, charming town.

Es war ein bisschen überraschend. Fast jedes Apartment in der Umgebung kostet über tausend Dollar im Monat. Ich hatte nie davon gehört und auch meine Freunde nicht. Vielleicht ist das der Kampf. Ich kenne einige meiner Freunde, die sich in der Nacht weinen. Dinge sind teuer, aber wir haben gelernt, sparsam zu sein. Du fängst an, den staubigen Geruch von Flohmarkt-Spielzeug und eingelagerten Kleidern zu mögen. Du riechst in der Erwachsenenwelt weniger. Du fängst vielleicht an, zu rauchen, oder du bist einfach zu vertraut mit der Situation. Aber der Flohmarkt behauptet sich immer. Der Geruch der Erwachsenenwelt ist staubige Magazine, die auf einem geschlossenen Klavier gestapelt sind. Er bohrt sich in das Leder ein und bleibt, auch wenn man es waschen würde. Hier gibt es drei Second-Hand-Läden in laufender Entfernung. Wenn du am weitesten entfernten Beginn startest, kannst du zwei Wohltätigkeits-Second-Hand-Läden, eine Bibliothek, einen seltenen Buchladen und einen Antiquitätenladen aufsuchen. Das Zentrum ist dicht besiedelt, Autos und Menschen füllen die Straßen jeden Morgen, aber man hört es im Second-Hand-Laden nie. Unabhängig davon, wie viele Menschen oder Autos vorbeikommen, ist der Laden still. Es ist ein schönes Plätzchen, um einen Nachmittag zu verstreichen zu lassen. Jedes Jahr gibt es immer mehr davon. Autos und Menschen überfluten es. Es ist eine wachsende Stadt, sagen sie. Eine der größten Online-Imperien für E-Commerce und Lieferung hat hier ihren Hauptsitz, und es zeigt noch immer Wachstumswehen. Es erinnert mich an New York. Alles und jeder verfolgt seine eigenen Ziele, und niemand fragt viel von dir. Du kannst allein, still und unabhängig sein, und die Leute lassen dich in Ruhe. Es ist nicht wie im Süden, wo eine kleine Sorge bedeutet, dass du dich um jemanden kümmerst. Man prüft hier nicht in die anderen Leute Leben, wirklich. Du kannst deine Schale behalten, solange du willst, und die Stadt wird sich wieder zurückrollen wie Wellen am Strand. Es ist ein lebendiger Ort. Zwischen dem Pianisten nebenan und den zwei Amateur-Sängern oben ist immer etwas los. In einer Weise haben wir weniger ein Apartment von Fremden und mehr eine Gemeinschaft von Freunden. Wir kommen zusammen für unsere Bedürfnisse, feiern Geburtstage, trauern um Beerdigungen und helfen uns gegenseitig, wenn wir können. In einer Weise bin ich glücklich, hier zu sein. Ich mag die meisten meiner Nachbarn und sie behandeln mich nett. Ich versuche, mich sauber zu machen und ihnen Essen zu hinterlassen, und sie tun das genauso. Ich bringe ihnen Briefe und sie mir auch. Es ist schön, sie zu sehen, und ich glaube, sie genießen meine Anwesenheit genauso wie ich ihre. Ich wohne in einem riesigen, entmenschen deinen modernistischen Vorort, aber es sind Menschen wie meine Nachbarn, die mich so fühlen lassen, als ob ich mein Leben nicht vollkommen ruiniert hätte.\n\nTranslation back to English:\n\n[REWRITE]I first heard about my place when I was listening to a podcast about people who had gone missing.

    "original": "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",

There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n\nGerman translation:\n\nDas allgemeine Gebiet, in dem ich wohne, kann als typisches Vorort-Archetypus beschrieben werden. Für meinen Bezirk ist die Präsenz einer Hausverwaltung sehr offensichtlich. Wenn man hereinkommt, sieht man nichts als gut gepflegte Einfamilienhäuser, für die wir die Hausverwaltung danken können. Die vorderen Gärten sind alle sehr ähnlich. Es gibt einen kleinen Pflanzbereich mit Gras, einige Dekorative Kieselsteine und relativ kurze Einfahrten. Man sieht ab und zu kleine Bäume. Jeder hat einen zweistelligen Garage. Wenn man sich weiter durch den Bezirk fahren lässt, sieht man neu asphaltierte Straßen. Trotz der vielen verschiedenen Familien, die hier leben, sind die Straßen in ausgezeichneter Zustand. Man findet keine Pothöhlen oder ähnliche Dinge. Die meisten Häuser haben eine einstöckige Architektur, manchmal sieht man aber auch zwei Stockwerke. Wir haben keine typische Briefkastenanordnung, wie man sie für Einfamilienhäuser erwarten würde. Es gibt keine persönlichen Briefkästen vor jedem Haus. Stattdessen ist es mehr wie in einem Apartmentkomplex, wobei es am Ende der Straße einen großen Briefkastenblock gibt. Jeder benutzt einen Schlüssel, um Zugriff auf seinen Briefkasten zu erhalten. Es gibt auch zwei größere Abstellkästen für Pakete. Wieder einmal können wir der Hausverwaltung und ihrer Obsession mit Uniformität dafür danken. Das Haus, in dem ich wohne, liegt am äußersten Rand der nahegelegenen Stadt, sodass mein Bezirk als Teil ländlich, Teil Vororten beschrieben werden kann. Als Ergebnis haben wir viel Land für, na, alles. Es gibt mehrere Gemeinschaftspools, auf die jeder, der hier lebt, Zugang hat. Sie sind gut gepflegt und gesichert. Und dann gibt es verschiedene Wanderrouten, auf denen man seinen Hund spazieren führen oder einfach mal allein spazieren gehen kann. Man muss nicht in einen Park gehen, um etwas zu tun. Der Bezirk ist groß genug, dass man einfach drumherum laufen und genug Bewegung bekommen kann. Die meisten Menschen in der Gemeinschaft sind pensionierter Alters. Es ist ein sehr sicheres Gebiet, und jeder schaut auf jeden auf. Gemischt dazu haben wir jedoch auch einige mittelalte und junge Berufstätige. Was die Stadt betrifft, so ist sie erstaunlich groß - zumindest im Bevölkerungsvergleich - aber auch hat einen kleinstädtischen Charakter. Wir haben die Mehrheit aller Einrichtungen, die Sie erwarten und sich aneignen können. Zum Beispiel haben wir genau einen Einkaufszentrum. Es ist nicht riesig, aber es reicht aus. Für mich dauert es etwa 15 Minuten, um zu einem relevanten Ziel zu kommen, aber wenn ich das tue, bin ich mit vielen verschiedenen Geschäften konfrontiert. Wir haben alles von hochwertigen Supermärkten, in denen Sie organische Lebensmittel kaufen können, bis hin zu Discount-Centern, die nur eine kleine Auswahl an Artikeln führen und mit minimaler Personalbesetzung stehen, um Kosten zu senken. Insgesamt ist mein Bezirk sicher, gut gepflegt und recht typisch. Wir haben viele schöne Dinge, wie Pools und Wanderwege. Und obwohl wir nicht direkt neben irgendeiner Art von Einkaufsmöglichkeit wohnen, können wir einfach in ein Auto steigen und zu jedem größeren Laden fahren, den wir wollen.\n\nBack-translation \n\nThe general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia.

Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town.

Meine direkte Nachbarschaft, auf der östlichen Seite des Ortes, könnte als die wirtschaftlich benachteiligste Gegend des Ortes beschrieben werden. Die Eigentumswohnungen haben tatsächlich niedrige Werte, und die meisten Häuser werden entweder an oder von Menschen mit niedrigem Einkommen vermietet oder besessen. Dennoch ist sie nicht unattraktiv oder unangenehm. Meine Nachbarn sind im Allgemeinen freundliche Leute, die mich mit einem Lächeln und einem \"Hallo\" begrüßen, wenn ich die Straße entlang gehe. Die Kriminalitätsraten sind, obwohl sie leicht höher sind als in anderen Teilen des Ortes, im Allgemeinen noch niedrig. Es gab in den vergangenen zehn Jahren innerhalb von ein paar Blöcken von meinem Zuhause einige gewalttätige Verbrechen, darunter einige Schüsse und mindestens einen Mord. Unsere Nachbarn haben den Sohn verloren, der vor einem Jahr vor einem lokalen Bar außerhalb des Stadtgebietes erschossen wurde. Glücklicherweise wurde unsere Familie nicht direkt von der Kriminalität betroffen, abgesehen von dem, dass manchmal ein Gegenstand von unserer Veranda verschwand, wenn wir ihn nicht ins Haus gebracht haben. Allerdings wurde der Ort, in dem ich lebe, stark von der \"Opioid-Epidemie\" betroffen, die viele Teile der Vereinigten Staaten getroffen hat. Viele Menschen wurden durch Fentanyl-Überdosen verloren. Glücklicherweise gibt es in meinem Ort viele Ressourcen, um diese Epidemie zu bekämpfen, darunter mehrere Drogenabhängigkeitsrehabilitationszentren und Narcan-Trainings-Sitzungen für Familien und Freunde von Menschen, die von der Abhängigkeit betroffen sind. Trotz dieser Herausforderungen hat dieser Ort viele positive Eigenschaften. Mein Sohn besucht eine hervorragende Grundschule mit einem großen Personal, von dem Leiter bis hin zu den Lehrern und dem Unterstützungspersonal. Trotz seiner besonderen Bedürfnisse hat er noch keine Mobbing Erfahrungen gemacht, da die schulische Atmosphäre sehr positiv ist und er dort sehr gerne ist. Wir haben eine aktive PTO, die mehrere Veranstaltungen im Laufe des Jahres plant, um die Familienbeteiligung und die Bildungsnachhaltigkeit zu fördern. Da mehr als 20% unserer Ortsgemeinschaft unter der Armutsgrenze lebt, bietet die Grundschule kostenlose Frühstück und Mittagessen allen Schülern an, so dass kein Kind jemals hungrig sein muss. Niemand, sei es ein Kind oder eine Familie, wird aufgrund seiner Unfähigkeit, zu zahlen, als \"weniger wert\" behandelt, und die Kosten für Schulgebühren, Schulbedarf und Exkursionen sind sehr angemessen. Die Stadtverwaltung und das Personal haben viele Verbesserungen für den Auftritt unseres Ortes vorgenommen, einschließlich der Reparatur von Straßen, Landschaftsbau und der Wiederherstellung von Stadtgärten. Leider wurden die meisten dieser Verbesserungen im Zentrum des Ortes und auf der westlichen Seite durchgeführt, wo sich die Einkaufsgebiete befinden und die meisten Verkehrsbewegungen stattfinden. Die östliche Seite, auf der ich lebe, wird oft vernachlässigt, was ein Streitpunkt für diejenigen in meiner Nachbarschaft ist. Insgesamt genieße ich es, in diesem Ort zu leben. Die Leute sind im Allgemeinen freundlich, die Schulen sind großartig, es gibt ausreichend Einkaufsmöglichkeiten (beide kleine Unternehmen und größere Einzelhandelsgeschäfte) um die Bedürfnisse meiner Familie zu decken, und unser Zuhause mag zwar nicht viel wert sein, aber es ist bequem und ausreichend. Unsere Familie lebt seit über 16 Jahren hier, und wir können uns nicht vorstellen, anderswo zu leben.\n\nEnglish translation:\n\n[REWRITE] I live in a small Midwestern town that's just outside the suburban areas of a major city.

I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",

Ich wohne in einem 7-stöckigen Wohnhaus direkt gegenüber dem alten Theater und ein Block weiter unten die Straße hinunter ist diese coole kleine Arcade-Bar, die verschiedene Arten von Menschen an warmen Sommerabenden anzieht. Oftmals, vor allem am Wochenende im Juni und Juli, sieht man eine Schlange von Menschen, die auf Einlass warten. Ein paar Blöcke weiter oben ist der nächste Stadtgarten. Er ist ziemlich groß, wenn man bedenkt, in welcher Gegend er liegt. Die Gärten werden von Beton umgeben, mit hohen Treppen, die in den Mauern vermauert sind. Während der kalten Wintermonate ziehen obdachlose Menschen ihre Zelte in ordentlichen Reihen entlang der Gehwege und entlang der breiten Stufen auf. Es schneit nicht viel, aber es regnet, und der heftige Winterregen in den mittleren Wintermonaten macht es oft schwierig, warm zu bleiben. Durch die Nähe miteinander, in der Mitte der Stadt und nicht im Dschungel, bleiben sie viel wärmer. Sie sind auch in einer vernünftigen Geh- und Verkehrsdistanz zum einzigen Familienzentrum in der Umgebung, wo sie duschen und sich waschen können. Was ich an meiner Stadt lieben, ist nicht die Schönheit der historischen Natur - die hohen stolzen Gebäude, die Architektur, die durch die verschiedenen Ebenen der Hügel hindurch verstreut ist, die sich hinunter zur Küste winden. Was ich an meiner Nachbarschaft liebe, ist die Kultur der Menschen selbst. Sieh mal, Hügelhöhe war einst das berüchtigtste Viertel an der Westküste für Gewalt durch Gangs. Man hört noch Geschichten darüber, sogar drei Jahrzehnte später, über die Bundesbeamten und die DEA, die durch die Straßen schlichen, um sie zu reinigen. Die Menschen vergessen das nicht. Geschichten werden von Generation zu Generation weitergegeben, bis hin zu Neuankömmlingen wie mir, von jenen Tagen. Die Menschen arbeiten hart, obwohl es immer noch eines der raueren 'Viertel' in der gesamten Stadt ist, um es sauber zu halten. Sie kümmern sich immer noch um, was in ihrer Stadt, auf ihrem Block passiert. Sie sagen, dass, wenn man weiß ist, man sich nach Einbruch der Dunkelheit nicht durch die Hügel hinuntertragen sollte. Tatsächlich glaube ich, dass diese Warnung an die alten Tage erinnert und mit dem bitteren Geschmack der sozialen Einbindung getränkt ist. Vielleicht ist es, dass ich dunkel genug bin, um als nicht ganz 'weiße Mädchen' durchzugehen, oder vielleicht erkennt Hügelhöhe mich als eine von ihnen an, als jemanden, der so sehr mit den ständigen Erinnerungen vertraut ist, die unsere Nation immer wieder plagen. Erinnerungen, dass Rassismus, kulturelle Einbindung und Annahmen aus Ignoranz und Angst gemacht werden, selbst in einer Stadt, die als kultureller Melting-Pot-Utopia gilt. Ich weiß eines: egal wie weit ich mich bewege, Hügelhöhe ist mein Zuhause. Ich fühle mich lebendig, wenn ich durch die Straßen gehe, Abende, um Leute zu treffen, die mir rasch und selten skrupellos ein Jackett anbieten als mich auszurauben. Es ist ein Ort, an dem Laundromatbesitzer geöffnet haben, um mich nur ein paar Minuten länger zu lassen, um mein Handy aufzuladen, wenn ich nirgendwo anders hin konnte, um mich vor dem Regen zu verstecken. Es ist ein Ort, an dem ich mich, glaube, unsichtbar zu sein, gegen die Betonfassaden der Geschäfte gelehnt habe, an den grauen und tristen Abenden, nur um jemanden zu haben, der mich anblickt und mir 5 $ gibt und mir sagt, ich sei schön und wertvoll.\n\n[REWRITE] My neighborhood is full of culture.

It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had nowhere to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believed myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete storefronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.

    "transformed": "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical significance. I live in a 7-story apartment building right across from the old live theater, and a block down the hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Circling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the cold winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential downpour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. By being close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, they keep themselves much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historical nature - the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is scattered throughout the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the bitter taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had nowhere to escape from the rain.

    "original": "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",

Es gibt keine großen Stadtzentren, keine Walmart, Target oder sogar ein Applebee's. Wo immer du hingehst, musst du fahren, um dorthin zu gelangen. Trotzdem lebe ich in einem der schönsten Orte der Welt, umgeben von Wasser. Meine \"Stadt\" ist von Wasser umgeben. Schönster Lake Michigan auf der einen Seite und Lake Charlevoix auf der anderen. Überall findest du einen Strand, an dem du deine Zehen ins Wasser tauchst. Meine Nachbarschaft, spiegelt die Idee eines kleinen Dorfes wider. Die Häuser sind nicht übereinander gestapelt. Sie sind nicht identische Häuser, die auf dieselbe Weise gebaut sind. Sie sind ältere Häuser, von denen einige modernisiert und umgebaut wurden, während andere älter sind. Die meisten Häuser haben Keller. Voller Keller, die man von der Straße aus sehen kann. Viele Häuser in der Nachbarschaft haben älteren Aluminium-Verkleidungen. Wir haben Häuser in allen Farben, die du dir vorstellen kannst, in den Blöcken um mein Haus herum. Die meisten Häuser haben Gärten. Gärten mit Trampolins und Spielplätzen. Einige Leute haben Gärten und Zäune für ihre Tiere. Die Häuser ähneln dem mittleren Amerika. Hart arbeitende Menschen, die sich abrackern, um ein Auskommen zu erwerben, oder Familien aufziehen oder bereits aufgezogen haben. Bei jedem gegebenen Tag siehst du Kinder, die auf und ab der Straße rennen. Du siehst auch Leute, die Hunde spazieren führen, Fahrrad fahren und Inline-Skaten. Nachbarn kennen sich gegenseitig und man kann erkennen, wer sich hineinpasst und wer nicht. Du siehst jemanden, der draußen grillt und winkt, oder sogar jemanden, der mit seinem Hund von ein paar Blöcken entfernt spazieren geht und freundlich lächelt. Die Rasenflächen werden in einem annehmbaren Zustand gehalten. Niemand hat Blätter gestapelt, nach der Herbstzeit. Gras ist in grüner Farbe und hat eine kontrollierte Größe. Wenn Leute Pflanzen und Büsche in ihren Gärten haben, sind diese gepflegt und geschnitten. Es ist kein schönes Viertel, das man einfährt und denkt, wow, das sind die schönen Häuser. Es ist ein Viertel, in das man einfährt und denkt, das wäre ein guter Ort, um eine Familie zu gründen. Es ist ruhig, friedlich und sicher. Während es nur durchschnittlich aussieht, ist es für den Umstand, dass es das Darstellt, was die Leute in der Welt wollen, nämlich einen sicheren Ort, an dem man am Ende des Tages ankommen kann. In wenigen Gehminuten Entfernung ist die Bezirksbehörde und das Gefängnis. Die Gesundheitsbehörde ist direkt nebenan. Die Stadt-Recycling-Anlage liegt nur ein kurzer Fußweg entfernt, und die Nachbarn und Einwohner aus der ganzen Stadt nutzen die von ihnen angebotenen Dienste. Wir haben Baseball- und Softballplätze in der Nähe, wo du die Announcer hören kannst, die die Ergebnisse ablesen und die Namen der Spieler nennen. Unsere kleine Stadtflugplatz liegt nebenan. Du kannst draußen spielen oder auch drinnen sein und die Rums der kleinen Flugzeuge hören, die starten und landen. Du kannst zu Fuß Eiscreme von dem lokalen Eiscreme-Shop holen, und wenn du es wirklich gerne tust, kannst du das Stadtzentrum von unserem Viertel aus erreichen. Meine Kinder können auf ihrem Fahrrad zum Park fahren, der nur etwa 8 Blöcke entfernt ist. Es ist ein wirklich großartiger Ort, um zu leben.\n\nEnglish translation back to the original text:\n\n[REWRITE] I live in rural America, specifically a small town in Michigan.
