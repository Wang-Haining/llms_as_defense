Wohngebiete sind zufällig, scheinbar zufällig, zwischen kommerziellen Gebieten verteilt, wo eine Vielzahl von Unternehmen betrieben wird. Einige dieser Unternehmen bestehen aus Büros, während andere verschiedene Läden, Restaurants und Unterhaltungsstätten beinhalten. Es mangelt es nicht an neuen Restaurants, an denen man essen kann, oder Geschäften, in denen man einkaufen kann. Während einige Geschäfte große, bekannte Marken sind, die großen Konzernen gehören, sind kleinere Boutiquen auch zunehmend beliebt. Sie befinden sich nicht nur in verschiedenen Einkaufszentren, sondern auch entlang der Straßen, die oft in Gehdistanz von Vierteln liegen, die ansonsten ruhig und idyllisch wären, wenn sie nicht von so vielen Sehenswürdigkeiten umgeben wären. Es gibt auch ein paar nahe gelegene Parks, und ich habe bemerkt, dass Menschen diese Parks mit ihren jungen Kindern frequentieren. Über die Menschen gesprochen, gibt es tatsächlich eine erhebliche Vielfalt in meinem Viertel. In einer kleinen Location haben wir eine prominente LGBTQ+-Community, eine orthodox-jüdische Gemeinschaft und eine Sammlung von Flüchtlingen und Einwanderern aus der ehemaligen Sowjetunion. Ein Stück weiter außerhalb meines Viertels gibt es viele weitere Individuen verschiedener Rassen und Herkunft, obwohl sie manchmal in kleine Gemeinschaften innerhalb der Stadt getrennt sind. Wir haben Orte wie Korea town, China town, Little Armenia und viele mehr, die nur ein paar Meilen entfernt sind. Allerdings können nur ein paar Meilen zu einer sehr langen Fahrt werden. Bei einer Entfernung von nur 10 Meilen kann es manchmal zwei Stunden dauern, wegen des Verkehrs, besonders während der Stoßzeit. Fast niemand in meiner Stadt geht überhaupt irgendwohin. Während bestimmte Orte von Interesse unweigerlich in der Nähe liegen, ist die Stadt riesig, und die Menschen bevorzugen es generell nicht, zu Fuß zu pendeln. Als Ergebnis haben wir auch einige der schlechtesten Verkehrssituationen der Welt und es kann schwierig sein, Parkplätze überall zu finden. Ironischerweise gab es in den letzten Jahren ein großes Bautätigkeitsprogramm, da große Wohngebäude zur Stadt hinzugefügt werden. Es scheint ein beliebtes Ziel zu sein, aber viele Bewohner sind enttäuscht von der Vorstellung, dass noch mehr Menschen einziehen und noch mehr Fahrzeuge auf die Straßen kommen. Es gibt viele verschiedene Arten von Häusern in meiner Stadt, jedoch. Nicht jeder lebt, oder möchte leben, in einem großen Wohngebäude. Wohngebiete bestehen aus Häusern, verschiedener Größe, und kleineren Wohngebäuden und Condominiums. Einige Eigentümer besitzen Einfamilienhäuser, während andere Duplexe beinhalten. Dies ist wahr auch in meinem direkt angrenzenden Viertel, also gibt es auch kein Mangel an Vielfalt in Bezug auf Wohnmöglichkeiten. Ebenso besteht das Viertel aus Menschen verschiedener Altersgruppen, und um ehrlich zu sein, kenne ich nicht die Mehrheit meiner Nachbarn. Es ist nicht wirklich eine enge Gemeinschaft derzeit, obwohl ich viele Erinnerungen von meiner Kindheit habe, über mich mit meinem Nachbarn, der mir gegenüber wohnt, und ein paar anderen Freunden aus dem Viertel, die alle in meiner Nähe lebten.\n\nGerman to English translation back:\n\n[REWRITE]Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse.

The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood.

There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request.

Ebenso wie die meisten anderen erinnert es an eine Zeit, die nicht allzu lange her ist, in der das Leben in den Vororten das amerikanische Traum war. Dieser Traum schien sich ursprünglich um die Menschen dieses Landes zu schließen, aber jetzt zieht er sich zurück. Aber meine Nachbarschaft und viele andere bleiben noch, rufen uns und all denen, die uns besuchen, immer noch zu, dass der Traum noch am Leben ist und wir ihn so gut wir können festhalten. Die Leute fühlen sich nicht mehr so optimistisch wie früher, der Gartenpflege der kleinen Vorgärten sind nicht mehr so wie zuvor, aber es gibt immer noch ein Auto oder zwei in jeder Einfahrt, die Jugend spielt immer noch, als wäre die Welt um sie herum der ganze Inhalt ihrer Existenz. Die öffentliche Schule, die fast 90 Jahre alt ist, steht immer noch, scheint in den jungen Leuten noch immer eine Zukunft zu verhehlen, während sie bei den älteren Bewohnern Nostalgie weckt. Die Kirchen sind selten und weit auseinandergetreten, meist leer, aber die Basketballplätze sind immer noch voll. Alle Häuser sehen anders aus, aber fühlen sich gleich. Es gibt einen großen Supermarkt namens \"A\" Supermarkt, der von einer großen Familie der Yemni gehört wird, die wahrscheinlich die einzige arabische Familie in der Nachbarschaft ist. Die Mehrheit der Bewohner sind Afroamerikaner. Die Straßen sind breit und die Kinder spielen normalerweise Fußball, nur um die Autos zu passieren. Die meisten Leute in meiner Nachbarschaft haben hier seit Generationen gelebt und die meisten können Geschichten von einer Zeit erzählen, in der jeder jeden kannte. Es gab ein Karate-Studio, aber als Hollywood die Karate-Kid-Filme nicht mehr produzierte, wollten die Kinder nicht mehr Karate-Kid sein, daher ist es jetzt ein Apothekenladen, weil Medikamente alles besser machen, oder so habe ich gehört. Es gibt auch ein kleines Kino, das alte Filme zu einem reduzierten Preis zeigt, geschont vor der Menge durch die Jugend, die seine Mangel an neuesten Titeln verachtet, aber von den Älteren bevorzugt wird, die einen Abend in dieser kleinen Kneipe für einen kleinen Preis ohne die Kinder würden halten. Es gibt eine einzelne Autobahn, die durch meine Stadt führt. Obwohl die Ein- und Ausfahrt in der nächsten Stadt sind. Es gab einmal eine Petition, um eine Ausfahrt in unsere Stadt zu bekommen. Die Jugend unterstützte es, während die Älteren ablehnten. Es scheint, dass die Autobahn in unserer Stadt ruinieren würde, also sagten die Älteren, die schließlich die Stadtverwaltung überzeugten, die Anfrage abzulehnen.

Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall.

Zumindest nicht an einem Ort, an dem die meisten Leute leben möchten.

In diesen Gemeinschaften, auf diesen Straßen, befinden sich ein Handvoll Wohnkomplexe - neben einander angeordnet wie russische Matrjoschka-Dolls, die sorgfältig auseinander genommen und nebeneinander in einer Linie entlang der Straße aufgestellt wurden. Die ersten Wohnanlagen, die man trifft, sind jene, über die es in den Nachrichten hieß, sie hätten sich in unangenehme Geschäfte verwickelt, daher wollen wir uns nicht zu sehr damit beschäftigen - Erscheinungen können doch täuschen. Aber die Wohnanlagen neben diesem Komplex, und die beiden Komplexe neben diesem, sind ein ganz anderes Universum, von dem fast niemand in dieser Gegend weiß. Über den Komplexen gegenüber befindet sich ein Campus der Community-College - ein stiller, schläfriger Satz von Bauten, der die Straße beobachtet, wo Studenten mit Kaffee in der Hand hineingehen, um 7 Uhr morgens und sich beim Aufwachen streckend beginnen, sich schlafen zu legen. Die eisernen Tore quietschen auf, um sie einzulassen, während die Pendler aus dem Fenster sehen und ihnen zürnen, weil sie den Verkehr auf Tagen mit höherer Teilnehmerzahl aufhalten. Die Straße schneidet in eine weitere Residentialstraße ein, an der eine Parkanlage auf einer Seite und ein Rehabilitationszentrum für Menschen steht, die sich in unglücklichen Umständen Knochen gebrochen haben. Das Behandlungszentrum hat fröhliche Veranda-Möbel und eine faul pendelnde Fliegenklappe, die das warme, dicke Sommerventilatorluft in alle Richtungen treibt. Kinder rennen zwischen den Gräsern auf der Parkanlage hin und her, in Würfe und Pinwirbeln über die spitzigen grünen Stängel, während Bienen faul in den Blumenbeeten entlang der Straße herumfliegen. Alte Rentner schlafen ihre Hunde auf dem Fußweg, schauen die Teenager auf ihren Skateboards giftig an und nicken bescheiden an die Teenager-Mädchen, die sich um das Spielplatz-Equipment herum drängen, über Jungs und die neuesten YouTube-Sensations zusammenzusammensuchen. Es gibt einen Sushi-Imbiss in einem Einkaufszentrum neben der Parkanlage, der günstig ist, aber nie zu voll ist - ein Schwimmzubehör-Shop direkt neben diesem und eine Nagel-Salon, der zwischen ihnen eingeschlossen ist. Sie können Ihre Schwimmbad für die Saison aufladen, während Sie sich eine Maniküre leisten und Hachapuri-Eintopf essen, alles auf einmal - die Schönheit eines Einkaufszentrums. Es gibt auch ein gefrorenes Yogurt-Eis dort, eines der Typs, bei dem man selbst fügt hinzu, und man sieht oft die Teenager in der Parkanlage mit kalten, schweißenden Tassen gefrorenen Yogurts, die mit Toppings bedeckt sind, während sie Tricks auf ihren Skateboards ausführen und Dampf inhalieren, weil sie das als das coolest finden.

But if you walk behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and continue behind the hotels which are only inhabited annually except for a few stints in the summer for family reunions, you'll find an entire thriving community. In these communities, on these streets, there are a handful of apartment complexes - arranged next to each other like Russian nesting dolls that have been carefully taken apart and placed side by side in a row along the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come across are those that were mentioned in the news for some unsavory dealings, so we won't focus too much on those - appearances can be deceiving. But the apartments next to that complex, and the two complexes next to that one, are a whole different world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing watch beside the road, where students enter with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to let them in one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road intersects with another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture and a lazily swaying ceiling fan that churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily fly around in the flower patches by the road. Old retirees walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There's a sushi place in a strip mall next to the park that has affordable food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right next to it and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There's also a frozen yogurt shop there, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they think it's the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.",

She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry.

From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice.

Sie war aus einer Stadt, in der der Supermarkt ein 5 Minuten Fußweg von ihrem Haus entfernt war - sie hatte in ihrem Leben noch nie so viel offenes Gelände gesehen. Verblüfft von der Ubiquität der Maisfelder, teilte ich ihr mit, was es bedeutete, in einem ländlichen Ohio aufzuwachsen, und in diesem Moment wusste sie schließlich, wer ich war und woher ich kam. Wenn man einen zweispurigen Landstraße entlangfuhr, gelangt man zu einem Steinbruch, der mit Wasser gefüllt ist. Direkt dahinter liegt die kleine Siedlung, in der ich wohne. Die Häuser sind größtenteils aus Backstein und Stucco erbaut. Jedes Haus hat mindestens einen halben Morgen Land, das jeder mit Stolz pflegt. Im Frühjahr sind die jährlich gepflanzten Blumen reichlich vorhanden, zusammen mit den mittelamerikanischen Bäumen, die sich mit jeder Jahreszeit ändern. Die Auffahrt ist mit den höchsten End- Mercedes Benz Luxuswagen gefüllt, die im Sonnenlicht des Mittags nach einem guten, alten, herkömmlichen Autowash glänzen. Wenn man weiter auf der Straße zum grauen Stucco-Haus meines fährt, ist mein koreanischer Nachbar immer draußen mit einem freundlichen Gesicht. Er verbringt den ganzen Tag damit, sein Rasen zu mähen, und kann man ihn über den Motorgeräusch seines John Deer Zero Turn-Mähers singend hören. Alles in der Nachbarschaft bekommt ein Lächeln aus ihm heraus, aber er ist immer aufrichtig und ein außergewöhnlicher Mensch mit einer einzigartigen Vergangenheit. Mit der Zeit ist er älter geworden und hat etwas von seinem Humor verloren. In seiner Vergangenheit war er Arzt und passte sich gewöhnlich mit dem Gras und seinem John Deer Zero Turn-Mäherschiff ab. Schließlich gelangt man zu meinem Zuhause. Im Seitenhof sind Gänse reichlich vorhanden und werden von unserem Terrier verfolgt. Im Hinterhof gibt es einen kleinen Bach, der in den Steinbruch fließt. Hier kann man den Gesang der Froschkönige, den Bach und gelegentlich ein \"Muh\" von den benachbarten Bauernhöfen hören. Jenseits der handgefertigten Holzbrücke liegt ein unberührtes Paradies mit natürlich wachsenden Bäumen, Kräutern und wildwachsenden Blumen. Hier verbrachte ich den größten Teil meiner Kindheit. Von dem Bau von Baumhäusern bis hin zum \"Jagen\" von Tieren (was in der Regel darin bestand, sie zu verfolgen), gab es immer etwas zu tun und meistens ein Nachbarskind, das sich als Freund anbiederte. Die Winter in meiner kleinen Stadt können sehr bitter sein, aber es gibt nichts Schöneres. Der Garten verwandelt sich von einem Meer von Grün in eine leere Wildnis. Die Bäume, die einst lebendige rote, violette und orangefarbene Blüten trugen, verwandeln sich in kahle Baumrinde. Wenn man einmal mit Schnee bedeckt ist, erscheint über Nacht ein Schneewunderland. Der Garten ist mit Schneemännern und Schneemännchen des Nachwuchses gesäumt. Mein Schwester und ich stritten uns oft als Kinder, und im Winter waren Schneebälle unsere Waffe der Wahl. Wir bauten riesige Igloos, um unsere Waffen zu beherbergen, gewöhnlich mit Zweigen, wie ein Arsenal. In unserem eigenen kleinen Wunderland spielten wir Geheimnisse, während wir uns in einer Zeit befanden, in der nichts anderes zählte. Wir waren einfach junge Kinder ohne Sorgen.\n\nEnglish translation back to English:\n\n[REWRITE] \n\nAs we drove past the cornfields that filled the horizon, she asked, \"Where is everything?\" \"This is it!\" I said, knowing she'd be taken aback by the vastness of the open landscape.

To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem.

Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with.

Die unoffizielle Stadtdevise, die auf dem Rücksitz eines Gebäudes steht, das als Pizzeria, Bar, Musikclub und Stripclub dient, sowie an der Grenze gesetzlicher Grenzen aller dieser Unternehmungen, ist \"Portland bleibt seltsam\". Für einige ist dies eine kleine Mahnung, an den Portland der 90er und frühen 2000er zu denken, einen Portland, der weniger bekannt und billiger war, kreative und einzigartige Subkulturen hervorbrachte. Für andere ist es ein lockendes Signal - komme nach Portland, wo Menschen dich immer noch als seltsam bezeichnen werden, diesmal aber als Kompliment. Trotz des Zustroms wohlhabender Kalifornier und der ständigen Bauarbeiten für Wohnungen für diese Kalifornier, ist Portland immer noch seltsam. Seltsam bedeutet nicht immer akzeptierend, aber es bedeutet akzeptierend für Dinge, die normalerweise nicht akzeptiert werden. Seltsam bedeutet nicht, dass wir keine modernen Annehmlichkeiten und moderne Probleme haben. Wie der Rest des Landes kaufen wir die meisten Dinge aus China. Es gibt eine Million Möglichkeiten, seltsam zu sein, um nicht normal zu sein, aber Portland hat genug Normales. Portland hat Yoga, Hipster und Geschäftsleute. Vielleicht bedeutet seltsam, dass wir uns all das weniger ernst nehmen. In meinem Viertel, wie in vielen Portland-Vierteln, haben wir bunte Häuser, Gartenhäuser mit Blumen, Kräutern und Gemüse, die die Straßen säumen, und kostenlose Boxen im Sommer. Kostenlose Boxen sind traditionell Kartons, die mit Gegenständen gefüllt sind, die jemand loswerden möchte, aber sie können auch Plastiktüten oder Boxen sein. Sie enthalten etwas Magisches, ein Schatz, der perfekt für den Passanten ist, der oft überraschend viel ist. Kostenlose Boxen neigen dazu, Kleidung und Bücher zu enthalten, aber sie können alles enthalten. Die magische Möglichkeit, durch ein Viertel im Südosten Portlands zu laufen, ist das Wesen von Portland, d. h. was Portland für mich ist, aber ich bin nur eine Variante der Vielen seltsamen Menschen. Einige Menschen, mit denen ich zusammenlebe, würden sich nie träumen lassen, ihre Kleidung aus einem Karton auf der Straße zu nehmen. Diese Menschen gehen zum Go-Yoga (ja, Yoga mit lebenden Ziegen) oder zu Timbers-Spielen (der Fußballverein der Stadt). Portland ist voller Menschen, die alle möglichen Dinge lieben. Portland ist voller Menschen, die unsere Träume verfolgen, oder über unsere Träume nachdenken, während sie zu viel Zeit im Bar leiden. Ja, Portland hat ein Drogenproblem. Drogenprobleme neigen dazu, (im Kern) psychische Gesundheitsprobleme zu sein, und der ständige Regen während eines großen Teils des Jahres, sowie die trüben Wolken, scheinen ein Beitrag zu sein. Portland hat auch ein Problem mit Obdachlosigkeit, das niemand weiß, wie man damit umgehen soll. Die Obdachlosenpopulation wird durch die Sozialdienste angezogen, die Portland bietet, die besser sind als in den meisten anderen Teilen des Landes, aber unsere Dienste sind unzureichend, wie in allen Teilen des Landes. Die nicht-obdachlose Bevölkerung schwankt zwischen Sorge und Hass.

No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",

Ob ich sie vergesse oder so sehr mit Arbeit und Leben beschäftigt bin, dass ich sie nicht wahrnehme, sie sind da, unwankend, unbeeinträchtigt und unbeeindruckt von den Widrigkeiten des Lebens. An Tagen, an denen ich am stressigsten bin und am stärksten belastet bin, verlangen sie, gesehen zu werden, und wenn ich mich ihnen zuwende, lassen sie mich mein angstvolles Gemüt ausruhen, mir geben sie die Stärke, um weiterzumachen, Tag für Tag. Ich kam hierher, als ich mein Studium begann, und die Berge im Norden des Campus waren es, was mich zuerst fesselte. Gewiss, die Universität hat ihre eigenen atemberaubenden Sehenswürdigkeiten in Gebäuden, Teichen und Bäumen, die ihren eigenen Teil meines Herzens haben, aber es sind die Berge, die auf ihrem Thron sitzen. Die restliche Stadt ist in ihrem eigenen Recht schön. Es gibt unzählige Cafes, die zum Zuhause vieler Stunden mit Kaffeekräften und Lernen wurden. Man kann zu Fuß oder mit dem Bus ein Stück weiter in die Stadtmitte gehen und in die Aura der Antiquität getaucht werden, die von den verblichenen, farbigen Backsteinen begleitet wird, die Restaurants und Bürogebäude umgeben. Es ist hier, dass diese scheinbar suburbane Stadt so viel Puls und Schwung besitzt, wie ihre benachbarte, städtische Nachbarschaft. Dies währt jedoch nicht lange, denn man kann, einmal wieder, in die ruhige kleine Stadt zurückkehren, indem man den Library passiert. Diese Dichotomie der Atmosphären in so naher Nähe gibt dieser Stadt ein wundervolles Flair, als ob sie aufforderte, erkundet zu werden. Das macht es leicht, viele geschätzte Erinnerungen zu schaffen, jede in Verbindung mit einem bestimmten Teil der Stadt. Ob es sich um das Gehen vorbei an den verrosteten Schaukeln im Park mit Freunden, nach einer Allnacht, oder um das Laufen durch die belebte Stadt, um den Film im fancy theater zu sehen, für das die Universität Tickets bereitgestellt hat. Leider ist es auch Zuhause zu vielen harten Erinnerungen, wie es in jedem Ort der Fall ist. Die Teiche, insbesondere, können ein eher passendes Ort für Reflexionen sowie Tränen-und-Mitten-in-einer-existentialen-Krise-Szenen sein. Letzteres ist jedoch meine Erfahrung. Während ich die Schildkröten, Enten und Insekten beobachte, die in ihrem Leben zurechtkommen, jeder mit einer eigenen Beitrags oder Rolle, konnte ich nicht umhin, mich über meinen eigenen Sinn für Zweck zu wundern, als ich mich bemühte, das Rätsel des Lebens zu lösen. Also, ich ging vorbei am Teich, und vorbei am Park und den kleinen Häusern, die Suburbania in sich tragen, bis ich eine Hauptstraße erreichte. Es war dann, dass die Sonne ihre strahlenden Strahlen auf die Palmenbäume sendete, die Himmel entlang malten, und als ich hinauf zu der Sonne sah, erkannte ich, dass ich nach Norden ging. Gewiss, sie waren da, wie immer. Die robusten, überwältigenden Berge streiften den blauen und gelben Himmel mehr als irgendein Gebäude im Horizont, und als ob sie ohne Worte sprächen, erweckten sie in mir den Wunsch zu wagen.\n\n[REWRITE] The mountains are always there.

Alas, it's also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which I have more experience with. While watching the turtles, ducks, and insects living their lives, each with their own contribution or role, I couldn't help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and the little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that the sun shone its brilliant rays on the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy, overpowering mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance. [/REWRITE]",
    "transformed": "The mountains are always there. In the north, as witnesses to the sun's rays every morning and every late afternoon. Whether I forget them or am so busy with work and life that I don't notice them, they are there, unwavering, unimpaired, and unimpressed by the tribulations of life. On days when I am most stressed and heavily burdened, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them, they allow me to rest my anxious soul, giving me the strength to go on, one day at a time. I moved here when I started my studies, and the mountains to the north of the campus were what first captivated me. Of course, the university has its own breathtaking sights in buildings, ponds, and trees, which hold their own share of my heart, but it's the mountains that hold their throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafes that were home to many hours of caffeine-fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus a little further into the downtown area and be enveloped in the aura of antiquity surrounded by the faded, colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It's there that this seemingly suburban town exhibits as much vibrancy and energy as its neighboring urban city. This doesn't last long, however, as one can escape once again to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity gives the town a wonderful vibe, as if it was beckoning to be explored.

Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here.

Die öffentliche Verkehrsmittel sind sehr zugänglich und sind einer der beliebtesten Formen des Verkehrs in New York City. Bensonhurt ist ein relativ städtisches Viertel, also werden Sie sich immer noch so fühlen, als ob Sie sich in New York City befinden. Während Ihres Besuchs, bereiten Sie sich darauf vor, die verschiedenen asiatischen Läden allenthalben zu sehen. Während der letzten zwei Jahrzehnte hat Bensonhurt eine große Einwandererwelle aus Asien erlebt. Daher sehen Sie ein asiatisch besessenes Geschäft mindestens an jedem Block, wenn Sie gehen. Die beliebtesten Geschäfte sind Supermärkte und Waschsalons. Zufällig sind diese Geschäfte sehr beliebt bei den Einheimischen, da die Qualität der Lebensmittel in den Supermärkten superb ist, die Preise sind viel günstiger und schließlich ist es sehr bequem. Gleich in meiner Nähe gibt es vier asiatische Supermärkte innerhalb von zwei Minuten Fußweg voneinander entfernt. Das fügt sich einfach in die Bequemlichkeit hinzu, Lebensmittel zu kaufen. Ich sage nicht, dass Bensonhurst rein von asiatischen Einwohnern bevölkert ist, obwohl. Es ist hier überall sehr vielfältig, mit Einwanderern und ihren ersten und zweiten Generationen von amerikanischen Kindern. Die meisten großen und beliebten Geschäfte in der lokalen Gegend sind asiatisch besessene. Neben diesen asiatisch besessenen Geschäften gibt es auch ein kürzlich renoviertes Park in der Nähe, das umfasst etwa zehn Basketballplätze, einen großen Feld für Fußball oder Baseball, vier Handballplätze, Schaukeln, einen Spielplatz für Kinder und sogar eine Wasserfontäne für Kinder, um sich im Sommer Wasser zu genießen. Da wir uns in New York City befinden, versteht sich, dass die Parks sehr vielfältig sind. Sie werden alle Arten von Vielfalt hier sehen, die spielen und sich gut miteinander verständigen können. In diesem Viertel gibt es nicht viele große Firmengebäude. Die einzigen Gebäude, die Sie finden, sind für Co-op-Wohnungen oder Eigentumswohnungen. Die Mehrheit der Wohnräume hier sind jedoch Zweifamilienhäuser. Die meisten Menschen sind jedoch sehr nett, aber sehr laut. Jeden Tag hören Sie Autos, die ihre Musik laut lassen, wenn sie an Ihrer Haustür vorbeifahren oder ständig das Gaspedal durchtritteln, wodurch Sie am Morgen geweckt werden. Wenn Sie während der Nachtzeit planen, Besuch zu machen, sollten Sie wachsam sein. Dieses Viertel ist relativ sicher, aber die Menschen sind unvorhersehbar. Sie mögen mit Leuten rechnen, die keinen Grund haben, Ärger zu beginnen, Bullen und Diebe. Ich selbst wurde in diesem Viertel in der Vergangenheit körperlich angegriffen, aber das war vor vielen Jahren. Ein weiteres jüngstes Ereignis betraf das Diebstahl von Paketen. Auch wenn es ein gängiges Phänomen ist, gibt es in diesem Viertel Paketdiebe. Zuletzt, obwohl New York City eine Geldstrafe für Menschen, die nicht nach ihren Hunden sauber machen, hat, befolgen die Menschen die Regeln nicht hier. Jeden Morgen sehen Sie mindestens einen Hundekot auf dem Weg zum Bahnhof, oder auf dem Weg zum Supermarkt. Mein größter Ärger ist der Hundekot auf dem Boden überall, wohin ich gehe in diesem Viertel. Seien Sie vorsichtig und halten Sie Ihre Schuhe sauber!\n\nDer Text in Deutsch zurück ins Englisch:\n\n[REWRITE] If you're planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you'll have no trouble finding it.

There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean.

Alles scheint nach unten zu fließen, und mein Haus sitzt direkt am Gipfel des steilsten Hügels im Viertel. Die Leute nennen es den \"Fitnesshügel\", weil viele Jogger ihn gerne während ihrer täglichen Fitnessroutine hinauflaufen. Da es überhaupt keinen Gehweg auf meiner Straße gibt, gehen alle auf der Straße. Die Straße ist an einigen Stellen pockennarbig und fühlt sich bei der Fahrt ein bisschen gefährlich an. Die Telefondrähte und Stromkabel, die um den Block herum aufgespannt sind, sehen zerrissen aus. Es regnet und stürmt oft in unserer Gegend, also fallen Äste und andere Abfälle oft auf die Leitungen herab, und die ständigen Reparaturen machen sie aussiehen, als wären sie voller Reparaturen. Es gibt viele hohe Tannen um mich herum, aber die Leute hier beneiden sie. Sie bemühen sich, so viele wie möglich zu fällen, weil die Bäume den Blick auf das Meer behindern. Deshalb sind viele Häuser in der Nähe so hoch oben auf dem Hügel gebaut worden, mit riesigen Glasfassaden im Obergeschoss, die sich hintereinander aufrichten, um den Blick auf die Bucht zu haben. Es ist schön, wenn die Sonne untergeht und das Wasser von unten angestrahlt wird und der Himmel orange wird. Es ist aber oft wolkig, also siehst du den meisten Sonnenlicht durch einen Nebel. Die meisten Tage sind bewölkt und feucht. Moos wächst überall herum: auf Dächern, Autos und Geländern. Ich habe einmal mein Auto einen Monat lang in meinem Einfahrt geparkt und als ich es dann benutzen wollte, war es grün und pelzig mit Moos überzogen. Es hat mich drei Stunden gekostet, es all abzuschaben. Es gibt nicht viele Kinder in meiner Gegend, obwohl es nur einen Block entfernt eine Schule gibt. Die meisten Menschen in meinem Viertel sind älter, viele sind sogar pensioniert. Stattdessen haben die Leute Hunde. Es ist normal, sie auf den Vorgärten sitzen zu sehen oder sie sich zueinander hinterherjagen zu sehen. Wenn du eine Tür oder ein Fenster offen lässt, riskierst du, dass sie in dein Haus eindringen. Ich habe einmal einen in meinem Wohnzimmer gefunden und musste ihn wieder rausjagen. Kaninchen laufen frei herum in der Gegend. Einige sind groß, und die Gärtenhelfer beneiden sie, weil sie die Wurzeln von Pflanzen aufgraben und in die Rasen der Leute graben. Meine Katzen mögen sie aber und haben fast alle aus unseres Viertels gejagt. Wir bekommen auch die übliche Mischung an Vogelarten: kleine Spatzen und Hummeln, und gelegentlich schwebt ein Habicht oder Adler über dem Viertel, bis die Krähen ihn verjagen. Es gibt keine Läden in der Nähe, aber wenn du bergab zum Wasser runter gehst, gibt es ein paar Restaurants, die frisches Fischgericht servieren. Es gibt nicht viel von einem Strand in der Nähe, aber die Felsen entlang der Küste sind Spaß, um sie in das Wasser zu werfen. Die Bucht selbst ist nicht sehr breit. Man kann die gegenüberliegende Küste sogar durch den Nebel hindurch klar sehen.\n\nNow, here is the translation back to English:\n\n[REWRITE] There aren't many sidewalks where I live.

It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",

Also bin ich geneigt zu sagen, dass alle anderen sich an uns gewöhnt haben, wie wir hereinkommen und ausgehen. Wir gehen raus und spielen, manchmal sogar im Regen. Manchmal grillen wir auch auf unserem Hinterhof und der Geruch von Grillen ist immer angenehm. Es scheint, dass immer jemand Rasen mäht hier und man hört fast jeden Tag von März bis Oktober ein Rasenmäher, wenn der Rasen schließlich aufhört zu wachsen. Wir haben viele Bäume in unserer Nachbarschaft, da es ursprünglich ein bewaldetes Gebiet war, also gibt es viel Schatten, aber es gibt immer viele Blätter im Herbst auch. Das bedeutet, dass wir Blätter jährlich räumen und verbrennen. Ich mag den Geruch von brennenden Blättern auch, also ist das immer ein angenehmer Hinweis darauf, dass der Herbst gekommen ist.

Lately, we've not been having much winter at all, so it just feels like a long fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we rarely use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time, and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays it's pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect. [/REWRITE]",
    "transformed": "I live in a typical suburban area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two federal highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but otherwise it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not so many people that move in and out, so I've gotten used to most of the people in the neighborhood. People occupy themselves mainly with gardening and other daily household chores. In winter we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front garden of our street, so we see everyone coming and going, and are familiar with the cars that drive around here. If we see an unfamiliar vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some neighbors walk around for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Children ride their bicycles and do everything one would expect from that. We are at home a lot, since we work from home. There are four of us, myself and my wife, and two daughters aged eleven and fourteen. So I'd say that everyone else has gotten used to us coming and going as well. We go outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Occasionally we grill outside on our backyard and the smell of barbecue is always pleasant. It seems that there's always someone mowing the lawn here and you can hear a lawn mower almost every day from March through about October, when the lawn finally stops growing.

Es sei denn, jemand hat tatsächlich das Gefühl, hier zu leben, dann verstehen sie wahrscheinlich nicht, wie es ist, ständig braune Farben zu sehen. Wenn man schließlich ein Gras sieht, weiß man, dass dieser Mensch eine große Menge Geld in Gartencare investiert. Als ich hier in den 90ern lebte, waren die Häuser weit und breit verteilt. Es ist jetzt eigentlich nicht anders, es gibt aber viele neue Einbauten. Ehrlich gesagt, sieht dieses Gebiet immer mehr wie eine Stadt aus, aber fast alle Orte verändern sich auf diese Weise. Die meisten Leute hier sind sehr freundlich, aber wie in jeder Stadt gibt es auch gute und schlechte Seiten. In meinem Viertel bin ich umgeben von freundlichen alten Leuten, ich denke, es ist ein nettes Viertel. Die Geschäfte in diesem Ort sind fast alle Ketten-Betriebe, wie Food for Less und Smart und Final. Wenn du dich nach Bio-Läden oder ähnlichem suchst, musst du reisen. Ich sehe mich nie mit Whole Foods oder ähnlichem um die Häuser kommen. Die meisten Jobs, die in meiner Stadt prominent sind, glaube ich nicht aufgrund offizieller Demografien, sind der Bau. Ich denke, das liegt daran, dass diese Stadt noch nicht sehr entwickelt ist, es gibt noch viel offenes Land, auf dem gebaut werden kann. Das ängstigt mich, ich mag die Dinge so, wie sie jetzt sind. Ich bin aus einer großen Stadt weggezogen und ich bin nicht begeistert, zurückzukehren. Mit dem Bau zu tun hat, ist mein Hauptberuf, ich bin Drywandschreiner und T-Bar-Installateur. Was ich an meinem Zuhause mag, ist die Vielfalt der Tiere. Leute kommen in die Wüste für viele Gründe, nicht zuletzt wegen der klaren Schönheit der Wüste selbst. Die Klima und Topographie der Wüste haben herausfordernde Ökosysteme geschaffen, die geschützt werden müssen und die verschiedenen Arten von Wildtieren beheimaten. Die menschlichen Bewohner der Wüste sollten sich die Zeit nehmen, um sich über die nicht-menschlichen Bewohner, die in dieser Umgebung leben, zu informieren, um sicher und harmonisch miteinander zu leben. Meine Familie und ich haben sich sehr gut an die Wildtiere angepasst. Ich habe drei Kinder und sie sind alle völlig von Eidechsen und Wüstenkäfern besessen, und als ich jetzt schreibe, sind sie draußen und versuchen, verschiedene Exemplare zu fangen. Was die Attraktionen betrifft, haben wir einige. Victorville ist auch ein guter Ort für Familien, um die Wüste zu erleben. Es kann eine andere Erfahrung bieten. Wenn du kannst, plane deinen Besuch so, dass er mit dem jährlichen Ereignis, dem San Bernardino County Fair, zusammenfällt. Die Messe wird deinen Besuch mit dem richtigen Mix an Aktivitäten und Spaß mit der Victorville-Art bereichern. Besuche den nahegelegenen Wrightwood, um die schneebedeckten Berge zu sehen und nehmen dir Winter-Sportkurse, um deinen Besuch abzuschließen. Wenn du dich für die natürliche Geschichte und Kultur des Ökosystems der Wüste interessierst, bietet das Victor Valley Museum geologische und paläontologische Sammlungen, kulturelle Artefakte der Ureinwohner und historische Objekte, die die Entwicklung der Gesellschaft und der Industrie von Victorville erzählen.\n\nEnglish translation:\n\n[REWRITE] My neighborhood is located in the middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, more dirt and even more dirt.

I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent.

There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them.

Während andere, die auf diese Frage antworten, wahrscheinlich Hausbesitzer mit eigenen Lebensläufen sind, ist meine Situation ein bisschen anders. Ich betrachte meine Nachbarschaft als den Campus, auf dem ich wohne, und die Menschen, die in meinem Wohnheim leben, als meine Gemeinschaft. Ich betrachte auch den umliegenden Campus als meine Nachbarschaft, wenn auch zu einem geringeren Grad. Trotz dieser Besonderheit teilt meine Nachbarschaft einige Gemeinsamkeiten mit den konventionellen Vorstellungen von einer Nachbarschaft. Genauso wie jede konventionelle Nachbarschaft hat mein Wohnort Häuser, Menschen, Geschäfte und Parks. Lassen Sie uns mit den \"Häusern\" beginnen, die meine Nachbarschaft bilden. Bevor ich mich auf die Häuser in meiner Nachbarschaft einlasse, wäre es besser, die verschiedenen Arten von Häusern, die in meiner Nachbarschaft zu finden sind, zu klären. Es gibt drei Arten von Wohnungen in meiner unmittelbaren Umgebung, die Wohnungen, die tatsächlichen Häuser und die Wohnheimhäuser. Zuerst sind in den Wohnungen in der Regel zwischen 2-4 Personen in jeder Etage untergebracht und es gibt etwa 4-6 Zimmer auf jeder Etage. Die am häufigsten vorkommende Gebäudetypus kann etwa 2 Etagen beherbergen, also wohnen in den meisten Gebäuden im Schnitt etwa 20-25 Personen. In zweiter Linie gibt es die tatsächlichen Häuser, die für jeden mit einer Verbindung zur Schule zu mieten sind. Diese sind typischerweise 2-4-Zimmer-Einheiten, die normalerweise von Alumni bewohnt werden. Es gibt jedoch nur ein Handvoll dieser Arten von Häusern in der Nachbarschaft, da sie weniger effizient sind. Schließlich gibt es die typischen Wohnzimmer, die hunderte von Studenten beherbergen. In diesen teilen sich zwei Personen ein Zimmer mit Ausnahmen, und es ist der häufigste Typ von Unterkunft in meiner Nachbarschaft. Mit dem Wohnen ist es Zeit, sich auf die Menschen zu konzentrieren. Meine Schule ist stolz auf ihre Vielfalt und diese wird in der Zusammensetzung meiner Nachbarschaft widerspiegelt. Es gibt Menschen aller Kulturen und Altersgruppen, die in meiner Nachbarschaft leben. Die meisten Berufsangehörigen leben in den Häusern, die in der Nachbarschaft platziert sind, während die neuen Studenten in der Wohnheim-Unterkunft und die älteren Studenten in der Apartment-Unterkunft leben. Die Menschen in meiner Nachbarschaft können nicht mit einfachen Worten beschrieben werden, daher wäre es am besten, einfach auf die Geschäfte und Parks in meiner Nachbarschaft zu sprechen zu kommen. Da meine Schule eigentlich ihr eigenes selbstständiges Viertel ist, verfügt sie über eine Vielzahl von Geschäften und einen einzigen Park. Die Geschäfte sind eine Mischung aus Essensangeboten, die in jedem anderen Viertel zu finden sind, und der eigenen Marke der Schule für Bekleidung und Lebensmittel. Als solches kann alles, was benötigt wird, innerhalb der Grenzen meiner Nachbarschaft gefunden werden! Darüber hinaus ist der Park in meiner Nachbarschaft ein Spielplatz für alle vielfältigen Menschen in meiner Nachbarschaft, er wird sauber und frei von Kriminalität durch alle Mitglieder meiner Nachbarschaft gehalten.\n\nTranslation back to English:\n\n[REWRITE] When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique.

Ich kam aus Riverdale nach Stockbridge, und ich kann nicht verschweigen, dass ich mich weinen musste, weil ich sie vermisste und sie liebte. Aber meine Mutter und mein Vater wollten das Beste für mich und meine kleine Schwester, deshalb zogen wir in ein besseres Viertel, eine bessere Schule, alles war als \"nicht schrottreif\" wenn wir in unser neues Viertel zogen. Im Laufe der Jahre wurde ich daran gewöhnt, machte neue Freunde, und auch einige Feinde in der Schule. Ich kannte meine Nachbarn nie wirklich, außer Mr. Glen und seinen Kindern sowie Dennis für ein bisschen, beide wohnen direkt neben uns. Sie waren lustige Leute, die ich fast als Familie in gewisser Weise ansprechen kann und ich schätze sie wirklich. Ich erinnere mich, als ich mit meiner Mutter, meinem Vater und meiner Schwester zu Mr. Glems Hochzeit ging (Sie haben sich wieder verheiratet). Es war richtig lustig und angenehm zu sagen, das mindestens und etwas, was ich irgendwann, als ich mein Vermögen aufbaut und meiner zukünftigen Frau den Lebensstil einer Königin gebe, vorfreue mich auf. Als Mr. Glems Frau, Ms. Veda, den weißen kleinen Riemen von ihrem Bein abnahm und ihn weggeworfen hat, habe ich ihn gefangen! Leider habe ich die Blumen nicht gefangen. Wir tanzten die ganze Nacht durch und ich genoss die Zeit mit Marsharii, einer ihrer Töchter. Ich sah sie seitdem aber nicht mehr. Ich hoffe, sie ist in großere und bessere Dinge weitergekommen.

    "transformed": "Well, considering that I've been here for about 10 years, I can share my experiences. I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I'm not going to lie, I cried because I missed them and I loved them. But my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better neighborhood, a better school, everything was considered \"not ghetto\" when we moved to our new neighborhood. Over the years, I got used to it, made some new friends, and also some enemies in school. I never really got to know my neighbors, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both living right next to us. They were fun people that I almost consider as family in some ways, and I truly appreciate them. I remember when I went to Mr. Glen's wedding (They got remarried) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I'm looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a queen. When Mr. Glen's wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Unfortunately, I didn't catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed spending time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven't seen her since though. I hope she's moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I've only gone so far, and that's when I've hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We used to play a lot of video games and enjoy life as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I'll also bring some branches that I bought from Home Depot and practice my balance, and bring my bokken wooden sword if I can.

Die meisten Gebäude sind Wohnhäuser, aber es gibt ein paar Restaurants und Bars, die Spaß machen und nicht allzu teuer sind. Eine der Bars hat kürzlich ihren Namen geändert, und die ist jetzt teurer, aber die Qualität des Service und die Getränke sind nicht schlecht. Die meisten Leute sind nett. Sie sind entweder Studenten oder haben einen niedrigeren Einkommen, weil das Wohnen nicht sehr teuer ist. Es gibt viele Kinder in der Nähe, weil eine Grundschule innerhalb von Gehweite von meinem Apartment liegt. Ich kenne meine Nachbarn nicht, aber ich will es auch nicht. Sie rauchen viel Gras und die Verwaltung meines Gebäudes hat daher eine Luftreinigungsanlage direkt vor ihrer Tür installiert, was mein Freund und ich sehr lustig fanden. Es ist fast beleidigend. Die Gebäude, die mich umgeben, sehen meistens alt aus, aber die Inneneinrichtungen könnten renoviert sein. Ein Stück die Straße weiter sind neue Apartments, aber ich mag sie nicht, weil ich weiß, dass die Firma, die sie gebaut hat, nicht sehr gut gearbeitet hat. Sie sind cheaply gebaut, aber der Mietpreis ist hoch, was ich für eine Schwindel halte. Aber weil sie in der Nähe der Universität liegen, kann die Verwaltung dieser Gebäude davon profitieren. Es gibt ein sehr günstiges Restaurant etwa fünf Minuten von meinem Zuhause entfernt, das nur auf Papierplatten serviert und fast alles, was sie servieren, in die Mikrowelle gelegt haben. Dann steht ein Tankstelle direkt davor, und ich habe gehört, dass das kein guter Ort für Arbeit ist. Aber dank des Geldes von der Stadt wurde die Straße im letzten Sommer asphaltiert, sodass es jetzt eine schöne breite Gehwege, viel Gras auf den Mittelinseln und an den Straßenrändern und der ganze Bereich ist ein bisschen hübscher geworden. Aber das Apartmentgebäude, in dem ich wohne, ist von Bäumen umgeben. Sie haben einige abgesägt, sodass es noch einige Stümpfe gibt, aber es gibt viele mehr Bäume, wo ich wohne, als auf der gegenüberliegenden Straße. Hinter meinem Apartmentkomplex gibt es eine Baumreihe und dann ein weiteres Apartmentgebäude. Ich wohne auf der 42. Straße, aber direkt dahinter ist die 43. Straße und die ist nicht so hübsch. Die Gehwege sind sehr schlecht und fallen auseinander, und die meisten Gebäude auf dieser Straße sehen heruntergekommen aus. Es gibt viele Bäume auf dieser Straße, aber das ist wahrscheinlich, um, was die Gebäude sehen lassen. Die meisten Verbrechen in meiner Gegend sind in einem Apartmentkomplex auf dieser Straße passiert, aber ich kann sie auch nicht allein verantwortlich machen. Es gibt Apartments gegenüber von mir, die auch viele Verbrechen haben und eine eher wandernde Bevölkerung haben. Aber ich denke, ich mag, wo ich wohne. Ich kann mich es leisten und es gibt viele nützliche Einkaufsmöglichkeiten in der Nähe. Ich mag besonders, dass die Universität in laufender Entfernung liegt und es gibt zwei Busstops, so dass ich leicht in den Laden und ins Zentrum fahren kann.\n\nEnglish translation:\n\n[REWRITE]My neighborhood is close to the university where I study, and that's why I really enjoy living there.

We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own.

Sie sind abwechselnd platziert und angeordnet, so dass sie wie einzelne Häuser aussehen. Der einzige Unterschied ist, dass jeder eine gelbe Farbe mit weißen Veranden und grünen Metalldächern hat. Fast alle, aber nicht alle, sind miteinander befreundet. Wir stehen an Ende einer nicht vorher entschiedenen Auffahrt manchmal abends und plaudern, während die kleinen Kinder der Nachbarschaft mit ihren Spielen, Straßenmalereien oder mit Ihren Drachen spielen. Es ist sehr erfrischend in dieser modernen, alles zu mechanisch/komputergesteuerten Welt. Es ist eher so, als ob man sich in die Vergangenheit zurückversetzt hätte. Wir sind von Feldern und Bäumen umgeben, die von blauen Himmeln und weißen, wellenförmigen Wolken erhöht werden. Der einzige Haken? Diese Saison erleben wir Tornados, und zum ersten Mal hörten wir letzte Nacht tatsächlich echte Tornadosirenen, also mussten wir uns auf das Schutzraum begeben. Natürlich hätte man mich in meinem Bad gefunden, zusammen mit meinem kleinsten Hund, meiner Handtasche und einigen Kissen. Mein großer Hund wollte nichts mit dem Badezimmer zu tun haben und blieb im Wohnzimmer, ängstlich und bellte, weil er sich um die ungewöhnlichen Umstände Sorgen machte. Die Nachbarschaft war ruhig, bis auf das Geräusch großer Hagelkörner, die überall auf dem Boden fielen. Nach dem Sturm war die Straße tatsächlich aufgrund der Temperaturänderung schweißig. Wir gingen von 92 auf 75 in wenigen Minuten. Der Hagel schmolz sofort, wenn er auf die heiße Fahrbahn traf. Als ich auf das sich klärende Himmel blickte, kam die Sonne heraus und es begann zu regnen. Ein Doppelregenbogen materialisierte sich. Ich rannte ins Haus und griff nach meiner Kamera. Schnell machte ich Fotos, um sie mit meinen Facebook-Freunden und Familie zu teilen. Sie waren begeistert, ebenso wie ich. Die Straßen blieben still für weitere eine Stunde, bevor einige Leute endlich nach Hause kamen, wo sie sich, als der Gewitter auftrat. Dann war es wieder so, als wäre nichts passiert – Mütter und Kinder draußen, während das Essen gart. Eine so freundliche Nachbarschaft für eine Frau, die kürzlich von NH nach NC gezogen ist. Ich liebe den südlichen Akzent, mit dem die Leute sprechen. Ich habe ein Zweizimmer- und Zweibad-Apartment, genau wie alle. Obwohl alle Häuser von außen gleich aussehen, sind nicht alle Apartments innen gleich. Einige sind sogar sehr klein. Das macht keinen Sinn für mich. Ich liebe es, entlang des größten Feldes hinter meinem Haus zu spazieren und mich nach unten zur nicht für Schwimmen konzipierten Teich zu begeben. Ich habe Rehe gesehen und am Morgen kann man das Grollen des riesigen Bullfrosches hören. Es ist ein fantastischer Ort, um zu leben, nur 40 Minuten außerhalb der Stadt Charlotte. Jeden Morgen wird man begrüßt vom Lärmen von Hähnen aus den umliegenden Bauernhöfen. Es ist eher so, als ob man in einem kleinen Dorf wohnt. Wir haben sogar einen Esel auf einer nahegelegenen Farm, der abends brüllt, um uns zu sagen, dass er da ist.

Keiner von beiden wohnt dort mehr, aber die Erinnerungen sind immer noch da. Die Leute, die hier bereits wohnten, als ich hier ankam, sind immer noch hier, zum größten Teil. Mein Viertel ist ähnlich wie das Durchschnitts-Viertel in den USA. Das Viertel hat eine Menge zweistöckiger Häuser. Jeden Wochenende oder wenn es warm draußen ist, höre ich die Kinder, die draußen spielen. Die meisten Tage in der Woche ist das Viertel ruhig. Ich habe nie Probleme mit den Leuten im Viertel gehabt. Sie lassen einen in Ruhe, es sei denn, man braucht Hilfe. Ich habe mehrere Pakete online bestellt, und noch nie ein Paket ab dem Briefkasten an mich geklaut. Ich fühle mich sicher, dass ich mich auf meine Nachbarn verlassen kann. Ein Park liegt nur ein paar Minuten von meinem Haus entfernt. Ich habe viel dort. Ich habe dort Basketball, Fußball und Baseball mit den anderen Jungs im Viertel gespielt. Ich habe auch mit einem meiner schlimmsten Erinnerungen dort meine Nase gebrochen, als ich mit dem Fußball gefoult wurde, aber die guten Erinnerungen überwiegen die schlechten. Heutzutage gehe ich in den Park, um Zeit mit den Enkelkindern meines Cousins zu verbringen. Sie sind viel jünger als ich und mögen es immer noch, auf Schaukelbäume und Schaukeln zu spielen und so weiter. Die Vorstellung, in den Park zu gehen, macht sie aufgeregt. Der Park macht mich sehr sentimental zu einem Haufen von Gründen. Das Viertel ist sehr vielfältig. Man findet alle Arten von Lebensmitteln in der Nähe. In einem Radius von nur einem Meilen findet man chinesische, indische, mexikanische und italienische Restaurants. Es ist jedoch der Fall, dass viele Leute heute nur Apps wie GrubHub und DoorDash verwenden, um ihr Essen direkt zu Hause geliefert zu bekommen.

    "transformed": "I moved to this neighborhood when I was on the verge of starting eighth grade. It was difficult for me to make friends at first, but I became close to someone who lives two houses away from me, and another guy who lives on my street. Neither of them live there anymore, but the memories are still there. The people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is similar to the average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or whenever it is warm outside, I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I never had any problems with the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and never had a package taken from my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park just a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also got hurt there, when a guy elbowed me in the nose while playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad ones. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park, it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still enjoy playing on swings and slides and all that sort of thing. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me nostalgic for a number of different reasons. The neighborhood is very diverse. You'll find all sorts of food nearby. In a one-mile radius, you'll find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, many people nowadays just use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are fast food shops, but you can find those near any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here have everything you'd ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are very diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you ever feel like making some homemade Indian food or buying some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I'm a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing the horror stories other people have to deal with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.",

Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants.

Es fällt nicht ins Auge gegenüber anderen in South Carolina, aber es hat einen erheblichen Einfluss auf den Agrarsektor. Johnston wird als die Pfirsichhauptstadt der Welt bekannt, was die Gemeinde auf der willkommenden Ankunftsbeschilderung stolz betont. Es besteht hauptsächlich aus landwirtschaftlichem Grundbesitz, der von Pfirsichbäumen oder Rinder dominiert wird. Häuser, die nicht im Zentrum des Ortes liegen, sind weit voneinander entfernt; die meisten sind zweistöckig und haben entweder Metalldächer, um sich gegen den brennenden Sommerhitze zu wehren, oder graue Schindeln. Oft liegen diese Häuser nicht in der Nähe der Straße, sondern sind weiter hinten, um die vorderen Felder für Tiere oder Feldfrüchte zu verwenden. Im Zentrum des Ortes befindet sich ein einzelner Verkehrskreisel. Hier befinden sich die einzigen Geschäfte im gesamten Ort. Es gibt drei Orte, an denen man \"Fast Food\" bekommen kann: Hong Kong, ein kleines chinesisches Restaurant, das von einer einzelnen Familie geleitet wird, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant oder Gary's, ein kleiner Hamburger-Imbiss. Es gab früher eine Pizzeria, aber sie ist vor kurzer Zeit geschlossen worden. Es gibt eine sehr kleine, in Familienbesitz befindliche Apotheke namens Maxwell and Halford Drug; amüsierlich genug, dass sie für die Cherry-Koca-Cola bekannt sind, die sie verkaufen. Es gibt ein kleines, aber teures Lebensmittelgeschäft namens Independent Grocers Alliance, bekannt als IGA. Obwohl es der einzige Lebensmittelladen im gesamten Ort ist, kaufen viele Menschen nur ein oder zwei Artikel; die meisten bevorzugen es, um den Großteil ihrer Lebensmittel in einem Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville zu kaufen. Die beliebteste Läden im gesamten Ort ist Dollar General; dieser Laden verkauft eine Vielzahl von Alltagsartikeln und ist oft ab dem Zeitpunkt des Öffnungszeiten bis zur Schließung sehr besucht! Es gibt eine sehr kleine Möbelgeschäft, Possibilities Furniture & More, das von einer freundlichen Frau geleitet wird, die in der Gemeinschaft bekannt ist. Das Geschäft ist seit vielen Jahren im Ort und beschäftigt sogar zwei Möbelpacker, die die gekauften Möbel liefern! An das Möbelgeschäft angrenzend befindet sich ein kleiner Hundesalon namens Clark's Cuts and Kennels. Sie bieten eine Vielzahl von Dienstleistungen wie Tagespflege, Aufnahme, Pflege, Nagelgrinden, Baden usw. an. Beide Arzt- und Tierarztpraxen befinden sich außerhalb des Hauptortes; sie sind beide sehr klein, aber gut ausgestattet, um die Einwohner von Johnston zu unterstützen. Es gibt eine einzige Elementarschule namens Johnston Elementary School. Sobald die Schüler den fünften Grad abgeschlossen haben, müssen sie in die nächste Stadt gehen, um Mittelschule und Highschool zu besuchen. Inoffiziell gibt es keine Parks im Ort, aber sie arbeiten an der Schaffung eines 2,5 Acres großen Freizeitbereichs, um Familien mehr Möglichkeiten zu bieten, Ausflüge zu unternehmen und mehr Besucher/ potenzielle Bewohner anzuziehen. Zugegeben, es gibt nicht viel zu tun; es gibt keine Kinos, Bowlingbahnen, \"Hängenbleiben\"-Stellen, Kinderspielplätze, Spazierwege für Hunde oder eine große Vielfalt an Restaurants. Trotzdem ist es ein schöner Ort, so klein, dass man ihn im Blinken verpassen kann, ohne es zu merken!\n\nTranslated back to English:\n\n[REWRITE] My neighborhood is a quiet little town.

Es war ein bisschen überraschend. Fast alle Apartments in der Gegend gingen für über tausend Dollar den Monat. Ich hatte nie davon gehört und auch keine meiner Freunde. Vielleicht ist das das Problem. Ich kenne einige Freunde, die sich am Abend zum Schlafen weinen. Dinge sind teuer, aber wir haben gelernt, im Laufe der Jahre, sparsam zu sein. Du beginnst, die staubige Duft von Flohmärkten-Spielzeug und eingemotteten Kleidern zu mögen. Du riechst weniger, wenn du erwachsen bist. Du fängst vielleicht an zu rauchen, oder du bist einfach zu gewohnt, der Situation. Aber der Flohmarkt behauptet sich immer wieder. Der Geruch der Erwachsenen ist staubige Zeitschriften auf einem geschlossenen Klavier. Er bohrt sich in die Leder und bleibt, auch nachdem du es gewaschen hast. Hier gibt es drei Second-Hand-Läden, die man zu Fuß erreichen kann. Wenn du am weitesten entfernten Ende beginnst, kannst du zwei Wohltätigkeits-Second-Hand-Läden, eine Bibliothek, einen Antiquariat und einen Curioshop besuchen. Die Innenstadt ist dicht, Autos und Menschen füllen die Straßen jeden Morgen, aber du hörst es in den Second-Hand-Läden nicht. Je mehr Menschen oder Autos an dir vorbeikommen, desto stiller ist der Laden. Es ist ein schöner Ort, um einen Nachmittag zu verbringen. Jedes Jahr wird es mehr davon. Autos und Menschen überschwemmen es. Es ist ein wachsendes Stadt, sagen sie. Hauptquartier eines der größten Online-Imperien für E-Commerce und Lieferung, es zeigt immer noch Wachstumsprobleme. Es erinnert mich an New York. Alles und jeder ist auf seine eigenen Ziele fixiert und es fragt niemand viel von dir. Du kannst allein, still und unabhängig sein und die Leute werden dich in Ruhe lassen. Es ist nicht wie im Süden, wo ein bisschen Sorge bedeutet, dass du dich kümmern willst. Du grübelst nicht in die Privatsphäre der Leute ein, wirklich. Du kannst deine Schale so lange aufrechterhalten, wie du möchtest, und die Stadt wird sich zurückrollen und wieder in die Wellen auf dem Strand schlagen. Es ist ein lebendiger Ort, um zu sein. Zwischen dem Pianisten nebenan und den zwei Amateur-Sängern im Obergeschoss ist immer etwas los. Man könnte sagen, wir haben weniger ein Apartment von Fremden und mehr eine Gemeinschaft von Freunden. Wir kommen zusammen, wenn wir etwas brauchen, feiern Geburtstage, trauern um Beerdigungen und helfen einander, wenn wir können. Man könnte sagen, ich bin glücklich, hier zu sein. Ich mag die meisten meiner Nachbarn und sie behandeln mich ganz nett. Ich versuche, mich ordentlich zu putzen und ihnen Essen zu hinterlassen und sie tun das auch. Ich bringe ihnen den Brief und sie mir. Es ist nett, sie zu sehen und ich glaube, dass sie genauso viel Freude an meiner Gegenwart haben wie ich an ihrer. Ich wohne in einem riesigen, entmenschenuschen modernen Sprawl, aber es sind Leute wie meine Nachbarn, die mich fühlen lassen, dass ich nicht völlig mein Leben ruiniert habe.\n\nNow, translating this German version back to English:\n\n[REWRITE] The first time I heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who had disappeared.

    "original": "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",

In meinem eigenen Viertel ist die Präsenz eines Hausbesitzer-Verbandes sehr offensichtlich. Wenn man hineinfährt, sieht man nichts als gut unterhaltene Einfamilienhäuser, für die wir den Hausbesitzer-Verband zu danken haben. Die Vorgärten sehen alle sehr ähnlich aus. Es gibt einen kleinen Rasenfläche, einige dekorative Steine und recht kurze Garagenwege. Man sieht gelegentlich auch kleine Bäume. Jeder hat eine zweite Garagenplatzz. Wenn man weiterhin durch das Viertel fährt, sieht man neue gepflasterte Betonstraßen. Trotz vieler verschiedener Familien, die hier leben, sind die Straßen in ausgezeichnetem Zustand. Man findet keine Löcher oder etwas Ähnliches hier nicht. Die meisten Häuser sind Einfamilienhäuser, manchmal sieht man aber auch zwei Stockwerke. Wir haben keine typische Briefkastenanordnung, wie man sie für Einfamilienhäuser erwarten würde. Es gibt keine einzelnen Briefkästen vor jedem Haus. Stattdessen sieht es aus wie ein Apartmentkomplex, wo es am Ende der Straße eine große Gruppe von Briefkästen gibt. Jeder muss einen Schlüssel verwenden, um auf seinen spezifischen Briefkasten zuzugreifen. Und es gibt zwei größere Schließfächer für Pakete. Wieder einmal, kann man dem Hausbesitzer-Verband und ihrer Besessenheit mit Uniformität dafür danken. Die Lage meines Hauses befindet sich am äußersten Rand der nahegelegenen Stadt, sodass mein Viertel als Teil ländlich, teil Suburbia beschrieben werden kann. Als Folge davon haben wir viel Land für, na ja, alles. Es gibt mehrere Gemeinschaftspools, auf die jeder hier lebend Zugriff hat. Es ist gut unterhalten und gesperrt. Und dann gibt es verschiedene Wanderwege, wo man seinen Hund spazieren führen kann oder einfach nur abends allein spazieren gehen kann. Man benötigt nicht ins Park zu gehen, um sich zu bewegen. Das Viertel ist groß genug, dass man einfach darum herumlaufen und mehr als genug Bewegung erhalten kann. Die meisten der Gemeinschaft besteht aus pensionierten Menschen. Es ist ein sehr sicheres Gebiet und alle schauen sich aus. Gemischt mit den Pensionisten haben wir auch ein paar mittelaltrige und junge Berufstätige. In Bezug auf die Stadt ist es erstaunlich groß - zumindest was die Einwohnerzahl betrifft - aber auch hat einen kleinen Zeitstadtfaktor. Wir haben die Mehrheit der Einrichtungen, die man erwarten und sich auf sie verlassen kann. Zum Beispiel haben wir genau eins Einkaufszentrum. Es ist nicht riesig, aber es reicht aus. Für mich dauert es etwa 15 Minuten, um an einem Ort von Bedeutung zu gelangen, aber einmal ich das getan habe, bin ich mit vielen verschiedenen Läden konfrontiert. Wir haben alles von Gourmet-Supermärkten, wo man bio-Food kaufen kann, zu Outlet-Shops, die nur eine kleine Auswahl an Artikeln führen und mit Minimum-Mitarbeitern, um Kosten einzusparen. Alles in allem ist mein Viertel sicher, gut unterhalten und ziemlich typisch. Wir haben viele schöne Dinge, wie Pools und Wanderwege. Und obwohl wir nicht direkt neben einem Einkaufszentrum wohnen, kann man einfach in den Wagen steigen und zu jedem großen Laden fahren, den man möchte.\n\nNow, I translate it back to English:\n\n[REWRITE]My general surroundings where I live can be described as typical suburban subculture.

In terms of the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small-town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that one comes to expect and rely on. For example, we have exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes about 15 minutes of driving to get to a significant location, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from gourmet grocery stores where one can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and have bare-minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, one can simply get in a car and go to any major chain one would like.[/REWRITE]",
    "transformed": "My general surroundings where I live can be described as typical suburban subculture. In my own neighborhood, the presence of a homeowners' association is very obvious. When one enters, they see nothing but well-maintained single-family homes, for which we can thank the homeowners' association. The front yards all look very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative stones, and relatively short driveways. One sees small trees occasionally. Everyone has a two-car garage. When one drives through the neighborhood, one sees newly paved concrete streets. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. One finds no potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single-story homes, but sometimes one sees two-story homes. We don't have a typical mailbox setup that one would expect for single-family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it looks like an apartment complex, where there is a large group of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone must use a key to access their specific mailbox. And there are two larger lockers for packages. Once again, one can thank the homeowners association and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the outer edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part subculture. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There are several community pools to which anyone living here can access. It is well-maintained and gated.

Meine direkte Nachbarschaft, auf der östlichen Seite des Ortes, könnte als das wirtschaftlich am schwächsten ausgestattete Gebiet des Ortes beschrieben werden. Die Grundstückswerte sind niedrig, die meisten Häuser werden entweder gemietet oder von Menschen mit niedrigem Einkommen besessen. Es ist jedoch nicht unattraktiv oder unangenehm. Meine Nachbarn sind allgemein freundliche Leute, die mich mit einem Lächeln und einem \"Hallo\" grüßen, wenn ich die Straße entlanggehe. Die Kriminalitätsraten sind zwar leicht höher als in anderen Teilen der Stadt, aber insgesamt niedrig. Es gab in den letzten zehn Jahren innerhalb weniger Blöcke meiner Heimat einige gewaltsame Verbrechen, einschließlich einiger Schüsse und mindestens eines Mordes. Unsere Nachbarn in der Wohnung nebenan verloren ihren Sohn in einem Schusswaffendrama vor einem Bar im letzten Jahr. Glücklicherweise hat unsere Familie keine direkten Auswirkungen von der Kriminalität erlebt, abgesehen davon, dass wir hin und wieder vergessen, etwas vom Vorbau zu holen und es verschwindet. Insgesamt hat sich der Ort, in dem ich lebe, stark von der \"Opioid-Epidemie\" beeinflusst, die viele Teile der Vereinigten Staaten getroffen hat. Viele Lebens wurden durch Fentanyl-Vergiftungen verloren. Glücklicherweise gibt es in meiner Stadt viele Ressourcen, um dieser Epidemie entgegenzuwirken, einschließlich mehrerer Rehabilitationszentren für Suchtpatienten und Narcan-Schulungen für Familien und Freunde von Menschen mit Suchtproblemen. Trotz dieser Herausforderungen hat dieser Ort viele positive Eigenschaften. Die Schule meines Sohnes hat einen hervorragenden Personal, von der Schulleiterin bis hin zu den Lehrern und dem Unterstützungspersonal. Trotz seiner besonderen Bedürfnisse ist er bisher nicht von Mobbing betroffen gewesen, weil die Innenatmosphäre dieser Schule unglaublich positiv ist, und er liebt sie dort. Wir haben eine aktive PTO, die mehrere Veranstaltungen im Laufe des Jahres plant, um die Beteiligung der Familien und den Bildungsvorsprung zu fördern. Weil mehr als 20 % der Bevölkerung unserer Stadt unter der Armutsgrenze lebt, bietet die Grundschule kostenlos Frühstück und Mittagessen allen Schülern an, sodass kein Kind je hungrig sein muss. Es gibt keinen Unterschied in der Behandlung von Kindern oder Familien aufgrund ihrer Unfähigkeit, zu bezahlen, und die Kosten für Schulgebühren, Schulbedarf und Schulfahrten sind sehr angemessen. Die Stadtverwaltung und das Personal haben viele Verbesserungen an der Sichtbarkeit unserer Stadt vorgenommen, einschließlich der Reparatur von Straßen, der Landschaftsplanung und der Sanierung von Stadtparks. Leider wurden die meisten dieser Verbesserungen im Zentrum der Stadt und auf der Westseite vorgenommen, wo alle Einkaufsgebiete liegen und die meisten Verkehrsstaus passieren. Die östliche Seite, wo ich wohne, wird eher vernachlässigt, was ein Streitpunkt für meine Nachbarn ist. Insgesamt genieße ich es, in dieser Stadt zu leben. Die Leute sind allgemein freundlich, die Schulen sind großartig, es gibt genügend Einkaufsmöglichkeiten ( sowohl kleine Geschäfte als auch größere Einzelhandelsgeschäfte) zur Befriedigung der Bedürfnisse meiner Familie und unsere Wohnung mag zwar nicht viel wert sein, ist aber bequem und ausreichend. Unsere Familie hat hier seit über 16 Jahren gelebt und wir können uns nicht vorstellen, anderswo zu leben.\n\nBack translation to English:\n\n[REWRITE] I live in a small Midwestern town that is located just outside the suburban areas of a major city.

    "original": "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",

    "raw_output": "Hier ist die Übersetzung ins Deutsche:\n\nMein Viertel ist voller Kultur. Es liegt auf einem Hügel, umgeben von Gebäuden mit historischer Bedeutung. Ich wohne in einem 7-stöckigen Apartmenthaus direkt gegenüber dem alten Theater und eine Blöcke die Straße runter ist dieses kühle kleine Arcade-Bar, wo sich verschiedene Arten von Leuten am warmen Sommerabend ansammeln. Oft, insbesondere an den Wochenenden im Juni und Juli, siehst du eine Schlange von Leuten, die warten, um herein zu kommen. Ein paar Blöcke weiter ist der nächste Stadtteilpark. Es ist ziemlich groß, wenn man bedenkt, in welchem Teil der Stadt es liegt. Die Parkumgebung ist aus Beton, mit hohen Treppen, die in die Wand integriert sind. Während der kalten Wintermonate stellen sich die obdachlosen Menschen ihre Zelte aufgereiht entlang der Gehwege und entlang der breiten Stufen auf. Es schneit nicht viel, aber es regnet, und der heftige Winterregen in der Mitte des Winters macht es oft schwierig, warm zu bleiben. Sie stellen ihre Zelte in der Nähe zusammen, in der Mitte der Stadt, anstatt in der Wildnis, was sie viel wärmer hält. Sie sind auch in einem vernünftigen Fuß- und Verkehrsbetriebsradius zur einzigen Familienzentrale in der Umgebung, wo sie duschen und baden können. Was ich jedoch an meiner Stadt liebe, ist nicht die Schönheit der historischen Natur – die stolzen Gebäude, die Architektur, die durch alle Ebenen der Hügel verstreut ist, die sich hinunter zur Küste ziehen. Was ich an meinem Viertel liebe, ist die Kultur der Menschen selbst. Siehst du, Hilltop war einst das schlimmste Viertel an der Westküste für Gewalt durch Gangs. Man hört immer noch Geschichten, sogar drei Jahrzehnte später, über Bundesbehörden und die DEA, die durch die Straßen fegen, um die Straßen zu reinigen. Die Leute vergessen das nicht. Die Geschichten werden von Generation zu Generation, bis hin zu Einwanderern wie mir, weitergegeben, über jene Tage. Die Leute arbeiten hart, auch wenn es immer noch eines der rauereren 'Hood' in der gesamten Stadt ist, um es aufgeräumt zu halten. Sie kümmern sich immer noch um das, was in ihrer Stadt, auf ihrem Block passiert. Sie sagen, dass, wenn du weiß bist, du nicht um den Hill spazieren gehen sollst, nachts. Wirklich, ich glaube, dass diese Warnung an die alten Tage erinnert und mit dem bitteren Geschmack der sozialen Verblendung getränkt ist. Vielleicht ist das nur, weil ich dunkel genug bin, um für eine nicht ganz \"weiße-Girl\" durchzugehen, oder vielleicht erkennt Hilltop mich als eine von ihnen, jemanden, der so schmerzlich bewusst ist, dass die ständigen Erinnerungen, die uns unser Land plagten, wiederkehren. Erinnerungen, dass Rassismus, kulturelle Verblendung und Annahmen aus Ignoranz und Angst gemacht werden, selbst in einer Stadt, die als kultureller Melting Pot Utopia gilt. Ich weiß eines: egal wie weit ich auch reise, Hilltop ist meine Heimat. Ich fühle mich lebendig, wenn ich durch die Straßen gehe, nachts, wenn ich Menschen treffe, die mir schnell und seltener bösartig ein Pullover angeboten haben, als mich zu berauben. Es ist ein Ort, an dem Waschsalonbesitzer geöffnet haben, nur ein paar Minuten später, damit ich meine Telefon ladete, wenn ich nirgendwohin fliehen konnte vor dem Regen. Es ist ein Ort, an dem ich mich ans eine Betonfassade gelehnt habe, in der dunkelsten grauen Nacht, mich für unsichtbar zu fühlen, nur um jemanden zu haben, der mich ansieht, mir ein 5-Dollar-Schein gibt und mir sagt, dass ich schön und wertvoll bin.\n\nHier ist die Übersetzung zurück ins Englisch:\n\n[REWRITE]My neighborhood is filled with culture.

Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",

Es gibt keine großen Einkaufszentren, keine Walmart, Target oder sogar kein Applebee's. Wo immer man auch hingeht, muss man fahren, um dorthin zu gelangen. Dennoch lebe ich in einem der schönsten Orte der Welt, umgeben von Wasser. Mein \"Stadtteil\" ist umgeben von Wasser. Schönes Lake Michigan auf einer Seite und Lake Charlevoix auf der anderen. Überall kann man eine Strand finden, an dem man sein Fußgelenk ins Wasser tauchen kann. Mein Stadtteil spiegelt die Idee von kleinen Städten wider. Die Häuser sind nicht übereinander gestapelt. Sie sind nicht cookie-cutter-Häuser, die gleich gebaut wurden. Sie sind ältere Häuser, einige davon wurden modernisiert und renoviert, einige davon sind älter. Die meisten Häuser haben Keller. Vollständige Keller, die man vom Straßenrand aus sehen kann. Viele Häuser in der Nachbarschaft haben alten Aluminium-Verkleidungen. Wir haben Häuser in allen möglichen Farben in den Blöcken, die um mein Haus herum liegen. Die meisten Häuser haben Gärten. Gärten mit Trampolinen und Spielplätzen. Einige Leute haben Gärten, und Zäune für ihre Tiere. Die Häuser erinnern sich an das klassische Amerika. Harte arbeitende Leute, die arbeiten müssen, um ein Auskommen zu finden und entweder Familien aufziehen oder bereits Familien aufgezogen haben. An jedem Tag kann man Kinder sehen, die auf den Straßen herumlaufen. Man sieht auch Leute, die Hunde spazieren führen, Fahrrad fahren und Inline-Skating machen. Nachbarn kennen sich und man kann erkennen, wer dazugehört und wer nicht dazugehört. Man sieht jemanden, der draußen grillt, und winkt, oder auch jemanden, der ein paar Blöcke weiterhin einen Hund spazieren führt, und lächelt freundlich. Die Rasenflächen sind in angemessener Verfassung. Niemand hat Blätter aufgehäuft zu Herbstzeit. Gras ist sorgfältig gemäht und unter Kontrolle. Wenn Leute Pflanzen und Büsche in ihren Gärten haben, sind sie sorgfältig geschnitten. Es ist nicht eine schön anzusehende Nachbarschaft, die man in einfahrt und denkt, \"Wow, diese Häuser sehen großartig aus!\", sondern eine, die man in fährt und denkt, \"Das wäre ein guter Ort, um eine Familie aufziehen zu können\". Es ist ruhig, friedlich und sicher. Während es nur durchschnittlich aussehen mag, ist es aufgrund der Tatsache, dass es das repräsentiert, was die Leute in der Welt wollen, nämlich einen sicheren Ort, an dem man sich am Ende des Tages niederlassen kann. In fußläufiger Nähe befindet sich das Bezirksgericht und das Gefängnis. Das Gesundheitsamt liegt direkt daneben. Die Stadtrecyclingzentrale liegt nur ein Stück die Straße hinunter, und die Nachbarn und Einwohner aus der Stadt nutzen die Dienstleistungen, die sie anbieten. Wir haben Baseball- und Softball-Felder in der Nähe, an denen man die Announcer hören kann, die das Spiel mitzählen und die Namen der Spieler aufrufen. Unsere kleine Stadtflughafen liegt nebenan. Man kann sich draußen, oder auch drinnen aufhält und die Rufe der kleinen Motorkräfte hören, die starten und landen. Man kann zu Fuß Eiscreme von der örtlichen Eiscreme-Verkäuferin holen, und wenn man wirklich in die Tiefe geht, kann man bis hinunter in die Innenstadt von unserem Stadtteil gelangen. Meine Kinder können auf ihren Fahrrädern zum Park fahren, der nur 8 Blöcke oder so entfernt ist. Es ist ein wunderbarer Ort, um zu leben.\n\n[REWRITE]I live in rural America, specifically a small town in Michigan. This goes from farmland to small tourist cities. There are no big city malls, no Walmart, Target, or even an Applebee's. Anywhere you go, you have to drive to get where you're going. Despite that, I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My \"neighborhood\" is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood reflects the idea of small towns. Houses aren't stacked on top of each other. They aren't cookie-cutter houses that are built the same. They're older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled, some of them being old. Most homes have basements. Full basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses in every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble classic America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn't belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn't a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It's quiet, peaceful and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff's department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.[/REWRITE]",
