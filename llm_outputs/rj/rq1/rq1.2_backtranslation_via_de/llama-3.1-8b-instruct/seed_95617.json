    "original": "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",

    "raw_output": "Hier ist die Übersetzung ins Deutsche:\n\nDa ich in einer großen Stadt lebe, ist mein Viertel sehr vielfältig. Wohngebiete sind zwischen Geschäftsgebieten verteilt, die anscheinend willkürlich zwischen Commercial-Areas und Wohngebieten verteilt sind. Einige dieser Geschäftsgebiete bestehen aus Büros, während andere verschiedene Geschäfte, Restaurants und Orte des Unterhaltung besitzen. Es fehlt an nichts, was es gibt, um zu essen oder zu shoppen. Während einige Geschäfte sind große, bekannte Marken, die von großen Konzernen besitzen, werden auch kleine Boutiquen immer beliebter. Sie befinden sich nicht nur in verschiedenen Einkaufszentren, sondern auch in den Straßen, die oft in Fußgängerreichweite von Vierteln liegen, die sonst ruhig und friedlich wären, wenn nicht so viele Punkte des Interesses umgeben wären. Es gibt auch ein paar nahe gelegene Parks und ich habe bemerkt, dass sich Menschen oft mit ihren jungen Kindern in diesen Parks aufhalten. Wenn man von den Menschen spricht, gibt es tatsächlich einiges an Vielfalt in meinem Viertel. In einem kleinen Bereich haben wir eine bekannte LGBTQ+-Gemeinde, eine orthodoxe jüdische Gemeinde und eine Sammlung von Flüchtlingen und Einwanderern aus der ehemaligen Sowjetunion. Ein Stück weiter außerhalb meines Viertels gibt es viele noch mehr Menschen verschiedener Rassen und Herkunft, obwohl sie manchmal in ihre eigenen kleinen Gemeinschaften innerhalb der Stadt zerstreut sind. Wir haben Gebiete, die als Koreatown, Chinatown, Little Armenia bekannt sind und viele mehr, die nur ein paar Meilen entfernt sind. Doch nur ein paar Meilen können eine sehr lange Fahrt sein. Eine Entfernung von nur 10 Meilen kann manchmal zwei Stunden dauern, wegen des Verkehrs, besonders während der Rushhour. Ganz wenige Menschen in meiner Stadt gehen überall herum. Während bestimmte Interessensgebiete unvermeidlich in der Nähe liegen, ist die Stadt riesig und Menschen bevorzugen es nicht, zu Fuß zu gehen. Als Ergebnis haben wir auch einige der schlimmsten Verkehrsprobleme der Welt und es kann schwierig sein, Parkplätze in der Nähe zu finden. Ironischerweise ist in den letzten Jahren eine große Anzahl an Bauprojekten gestartet worden, da große Wohngebäude zur Stadt hinzugefügt wurden. Es scheint zu einem beliebten Ziel zu sein, aber viele Bewohner sind enttäuscht von der Aussicht auf noch mehr Menschen, die einziehen, und noch mehr Fahrzeuge auf den Straßen. Es gibt viele verschiedene Arten von Häusern in meiner Stadt. Nicht jeder lebt, oder möchte leben, in einem großen Wohngebäude. Wohnegebiete bestehen aus Häusern, in verschiedenen Größen, und kleineren Wohngebäuden und Condominiums. Einige Eigentümer enthalten Einzelhaushalte, während andere Doppelhäuser enthalten. Dies gilt sogar innerhalb meines nächsten Viertels, so dass es auch nicht an Vielfalt in Bezug auf Wohnmöglichkeiten mangelt. Ähnlich verhält es sich mit dem Alter der Bewohner, und ehrlich gesagt bin ich nicht vertraut mit der Mehrheit meiner Nachbarn. Es ist nicht wirklich eine enge Gemeinschaft heute, obwohl ich viele Erinnerungen von meiner Kindheit habe, als ich mit meinem Nachbarn aus nächster Nähe mit anderen Freunden aus dem Viertel spielte, die alle in meiner Nähe wohnten.\n\nUnd hier ist die Rückübersetzung ins Englisch:\n\n[REWRITE] Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is very diverse.

Die meisten Häuser sind Einzelhaushalte, aber es gibt einige, die in zwei getrennte Teile unterteilt wurden, während sie noch miteinander verbunden sind, wenn das Sinn macht. Meine Heimat hat ein kleines Vorgarten vor dem Haus und einen kleinen Einfahrt links zur Häuser. Es, wie die meisten anderen, erinnert an eine Zeit, die nicht so lange her ist, wo das Leben in den Vororten das amerikanische Traum war. Dieser Traum schien sich einmal um die Menschen dieses Landes zu schließen, aber jetzt zieht er sich zurück. Aber mein Quartier und viele mehr bleiben noch, rufen uns und den Besuchern zu, dass der Traum noch am Leben ist und wir ihn so gut wie möglich halten. Die Menschen fühlen sich nicht so optimistisch mehr wie früher, die Pflege der kleinen Vorgärten sind nicht mehr so, wie sie einmal waren, aber es gibt immer noch ein Auto oder zwei in jeder Einfahrt, die Jugend spielt immer noch, als ob die Welt um sie herum ihr ganzes Leben wäre. Die öffentliche Schule, die hier fast 90 Jahre lang vorhanden ist, steht noch, scheint immer noch in der Zukunft für die Jugend von heute zu begeistern, während es in den älteren Bewohnern Nostalgie weckt. Die Kirchen sind selten und weit auseinander, meist leer, aber die Basketballfelder sind immer noch voll. Alle Häuser sehen unterschiedlich aus, aber fühlen sich gleich. Es gibt einen großen Supermarkt namens \"A\" der vom großen jemenitischen Familie gehört wird, die möglicherweise die einzige arabische Familie in der Nachbarschaft ist. Die Mehrheit der Bewohner ist Schwarze. Die Straßen sind breit und die Kinder spielen normalerweise Fußball, nur um die Autos hindurch zu lassen. Die meisten Menschen in meinem Quartier sind hier seit Generationen und die meisten können Geschichten von einer Zeit erzählen, in der jeder jeden kannte. Es gab eine Karate-Schule, aber als Hollywood Karate-Kid-Filme nicht mehr produzierte, verloren die Kinder das Interesse, Karate-Kid zu sein, also ist es jetzt eine Apotheke, da Medikamente alles besser machen, oder so habe ich gehört. Es gibt auch ein kleines Kino, das alte Filme zu einem ermäßigten Preis zeigt, geschont von den Massen durch die Jugend, die dessen Mangel an neuem Titeln verachtet, aber von den Älteren bevorzugt, die es als einen kleinen Preis für eine Nacht ausgeben, ohne Kinder natürlich. Es gibt eine einzige Schnellstraße, die durch mein Dorf führt. Obwohl die Ausfahrt und Einfahrt in der Stadt neben uns liegen. Es gab einmal eine Petition, um eine Ausfahrt für unser Dorf zu bekommen. Die Jugend unterstützte sie, während die Älteren dagegen waren. Es scheint, dass die Schnellstraße in unserem Dorf es ruinieren würde, also sagten die Älteren, die die Stadtverordneten schließlich dazu brachten, die Anfrage abzulehnen. Sie bauen eine neue Schule, und wir versuchen, einen Maskottchen für unser Dorf zu finden. Ich denke, ein Cyborg mit Landhaus-Akzent und eine Holzhütte wäre der beste Vertreter für mein Dorf.\n\nBack translation from German to English:\n[REWRITE] My neighborhood is interesting.

The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving.

The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between.

Zumindest nicht solche, in denen die meisten Menschen gerne leben würden. Wenn man jedoch hinter dem alten, verlassenen Whole Foods geht und hinter den Hotels zurückkehrt, die eigentlich nur im Sommer von Familien zu Besuch kommen, wird man eine ganze lebendige Gemeinde entdecken. In dieser Gemeinde, auf diesen Straßen, befinden sich ein paar Apartmentkomplexe - nebeneinander liegend, genau wie russische Matrjoschka-Dolchen, die sorgfältig auseinander genommen und nebeneinander in einer Reihe an der Straße aufgebaut wurden. Die ersten Wohnanlagen, die man trifft, sind solche, über die es in den Nachrichten Kritik gegeben hat, also wollen wir aus Rücksicht darauf nicht zu sehr darauf eingehen - Erscheinungen können ja täuschen. Die Wohnanlagen neben diesem Komplex, und die beiden Komplexe neben dem nächsten, sind jedoch eine ganz andere Welt, von der fast niemand in diesem Viertel weiß. Gegenüber diesen Komplexen ist ein satellite-Kampus einer Gemeinschafts-Hochschule - ein ruhiges, geschlafenes Ensemble von Gebäuden, das der Straße gegenüber steht, in dem Studierende mit Kaffee in der Hand herumlungern, um 7 Uhr morgens, um ihre müden Tage zu beginnen. Die Eisengatter creaken auf, um sie einzulassen, während Kommuter mit den Fäusten gegen die Fenster schlagen und sie wegen des Verkehrsstaus beschweren, wenn die Besucherzahlen höher sind. Die Straße trifft auf eine andere Wohnstraße, mit einem Park auf der einen Seite und einer Rehabilitationseinrichtung für Menschen, die in unglücklichen Umständen gebrochene Knochen haben. Die Behandlungseinrichtung hat vergnügte Möbel auf der Veranda und einen faulen, schwankenden Ventilator, der das warme, dicke Sommerventilatorluft vor und zurück dreht. Kinder laufen hin und her auf dem Rasen im Park gegenüber, während sie sich im Gras überschlagen und sich drehten, während Bienen faul in den Blumenbeeten an der Straße herumfliegen. Alte Rentner gehen mit ihren Hunden auf dem Fußweg, strengen die Teenager an, die auf ihren Skateboards fahren, und nickt schüchtern die jungen Mädchen bei der Spielplatzgastanlage, die über Jungs und die neuesten YouTube-Sensationen sprechen. Es gibt ein Sushi-Restaurant in einem Einkaufszentrum neben dem Park, das günstige Essen anbietet, aber nie zu voll ist - ein Schwimmsportgeschäft direkt neben dem und ein Nagelsalon, der sich zwischen dem befindet. Man könnte das eigene Schwimmbad für die Saison füllen, während man sich eine Maniküre und Hähnchen-Hibachi-Grillen lässt, alles auf einmal - der Zauber eines Einkaufszentrums. Es gibt auch ein gefrorenes Joghurt-Restaurant dort, eines der Selbstbedienung-Typen, und man sieht oft die Teenager im Park mit kalten, schweißenden Joghurtschalen, die mit Belägen bedeckt sind, während sie Stunts mit ihren Skateboards und Vape-Cigaretten machen, weil sie es als cool halten.

But the apartment complexes beside that one, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students lounge around with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and grumble at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road intersects with another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful furniture on the porch and a lazily undulating ceiling fan that churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and spinning across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily fly around in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There's a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that offers inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the charm of a strip mall. There's also a frozen yogurt shop there, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they think it's cool. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy South where hardly anything changes, not even time.",

She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered.

    "raw_output": "Here's the translation of the text to German:\n\n\"Wo ist alles?\" fragte sie, als wir an den Maisfeldern vorbeifuhren, die den Horizont ausfüllten. \"Das ist es!\" sagte ich, wissend, dass sie von der Sparsamkeit der freien Landschaft schockiert sein würde. Sie kam aus einer Stadt, in der der Einkaufsladen nur 5 Minuten Fußweg von ihrem Haus entfernt war - sie hatte nie so viel freies Gelände in ihrem Leben gesehen. Erschüttert von der Allgegenwart der Maisfelder, teilte ich ihr mit, was es bedeutet, in einer ländlichen Gegend in Ohio aufgewachsen zu sein, und in diesem Moment wusste sie endlich, wer ich war und woher ich kam. Wenn man eine Zwei-Spur-Straße entlangfährt, gelangt man zu einer Steinbrüche, die mit Wasser gefüllt ist. Direkt dahinter liegt der kleine Wohngebiet, in dem ich wohne. Die Häuser bestehen hauptsächlich aus Backstein und Stucco. Alle Häuser haben mindestens eine halbe Hektar eigenes Land, das jeder mit Stolz pflegt. In der Frühlingssaison sind jährlich gepflanzte Blumen reichlich vorhanden, ebenso wie die mittelamerikanischen Bäume, die sich mit jeder Saison ändern. Die Einfahrt sind alle gefüllt mit den hochkarätigen Mercedes-Benz-Luxuswagen, die im Mittagslicht nach einem guten, alten Waschgang glänzen. Wenn man weiter auf der Straße zu meinem grauen Stucco-Haus fährt, ist mein koreanischer Nachbar immer draußen mit einem freundlichen Gesicht. Er verbringt den ganzen Tag damit, seinen Rasen zu mähen und kann manchmal über den Lärm seines Mähers singend gehört werden. Jeder in der Nachbarschaft findet ihn lustig, aber er ist immer aufrichtig und ein außergewöhnlicher Mensch mit einer einzigartigen Vergangenheit. In der Vergangenheit war er Arzt und vermischte sich oft mit dem Gras und seinem John-Deere-Zero-Turn-Mäher. Schließlich gelangt man zu meinem Haus. Im Seitenbeet sind Gänse reichlich vorhanden und werden von unserem Terrier verfolgt. Hinten befindet sich ein kleiner Bach, der in den Steinbruch fließt. Hier kann man den Quaken der Frosche, den Bach und den gelegentlichen \"Muuu\" von den nahegelegenen Farmen hören. Auf der handgefertigten Holzbrücke gegenüber liegt ein unberührter Paradiesgarten, der mit natürlichen Wachsenden Bäumen, Kräutern und wilden Blumen gefüllt ist. Hier verbrachte ich die meisten meiner Kindheitstage. Von dem Bau von Baumhäusern bis hin zum \"Jagen\" von Tieren (was sich hauptsächlich aus dem Verfolgen von ihnen zusammensetzte), gab es immer etwas zu tun und meistens einen Nachbarskind, mit dem man befreundet sein konnte. Die Winter in meiner kleinen Stadt können quälend grausam sein, doch es gibt nichts Schöneres. Das Gelände verwandelt sich von einem Meer aus Grün in eine leere Wildnis. Die Bäume, die einst leuchtende rosa, lila und oranger Blätter trugen, verwandeln sich in kahlen Baumstümpfe. Wenn uns ein gelegentlicher Schneefall beschenkt, erscheint über Nacht ein Winterwunderland. Das Hinterhof ist mit Schneemannen und Schneemännern meiner kleinen Schwester gesäumt, und Schneebälle waren unsere Waffe der Wahl. Wir bauten riesige, igloähnliche Befestigungen, um unsere Waffen zu unterbringen, meistens mit Ästen, wie eine Waffenschrank. In unserem eigenen kleinen Wunderland spielten wir in einer Zeit, in der nichts anderes zählte. Wir waren nur junge Kinder ohne Sorgen.\n\nNow here's the English translation of the German text back into English, with natural variation in expression:\n\n[REWRITE]Where was everything?\" she asked as we drove past the cornfields that filled the horizon. \"This is it!\" I said, knowing she'd be shocked by the sparseness of the open landscape.

To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem.

    "raw_output": "The original English text translates to German as:\n\nPortland, Oregon ist das erste, was man über Portland verstehen muss, ist die Definition von \"weird\". Die unoffizielle Stadt-Devise, die sich auf dem Hintergrund eines Gebäudes befindet, das als Pizzastube, Bar, Musiklokale, Strip-Club und mindestens auf der Hälfte dieser Unternehmungen am Rande der Gesetze bewegt, lautet \"Keep Portland Weird\". Einige sehen dies als kleines Lamento an, um die Portland der 90er und frühen 2000er Jahre zu erinnern, ein Portland, das weniger bekannt und weniger teuer war, und verschiedene, kreative Subkulturen hervorbrachte. Andere sehen es als ein lockendes Gebot an - komme nach Portland, wo die Leute dich immer noch als \"weird\" bezeichnen, diesmal aber als Kompliment. Trotz des Zustroms von wohlhabenden Kaliforniern und der ständigen Fertigstellung von Wohnanlagen, um diese Kalifornier zu unterbringen, ist Portland immer noch \"weird\". \"Weird\" bedeutet nicht immer akzeptierend, aber es bedeutet akzeptierend von Dingen, die normalerweise nicht akzeptiert werden. \"Weird\" bedeutet nicht, dass wir keine modernen Annehmlichkeiten und keine modernen Kämpfe haben. Genau wie der Rest des Landes kaufen wir die meisten Dinge aus China. Es gibt eine Million Arten, \"weird\" zu sein, nicht normal zu sein, aber Portland hat genug Normalität. Portland hat Yoga, Hipster und Geschäftsberufstätige. Vielleicht bedeutet \"weird\" einfach, dass wir diese Dinge alle weniger ernst nehmen. In meinem Viertel, wie in vielen Portland-Vierteln, haben wir bunte Häuser, Gärten mit Blumen, Kräutern und Gemüse entlang der Straßen und kostenlose Boxen im Sommer. Kostenlose Boxen sind traditionell Kartonboxen, die Gegenstände enthalten, die jemand loswerden möchte, aber sie können auch Plastiktüten oder Kisten sein. Sie enthalten etwas Magisches, ein Schatz, der perfekt für den Passanten ist, oft überraschend. Kostenlose Boxen neigen dazu, Kleidung und Bücher zu enthalten, aber sie können alles enthalten. Das magische Potenzial, durch ein Viertel im Südosten Portlands zu gehen, ist, was Portland ausmacht. Das ist, was Portland für mich ausmacht, aber ich bin nur eine von Tausenden von \"weird\" Menschen. Die Menschen, unter denen ich lebe, würden nie träumen, ihre Kleidung aus einem Box auf der Straße zu holen. Diese Menschen gehen zum Baby-Yoga (ja, Yoga mit echten lebenden Ziegen) oder zu einem Timbers-Spiel (der Fußballverein der Stadt). Portland ist voll von Menschen, die alle möglichen Dinge lieben. Portland ist voll von Menschen, die ihre Träume verfolgen, oder sich über ihre Träume aufregen, während sie zu viel Zeit im Bar auf dem Tisch haben. Ja, Portland hat ein Drogenproblem. Drogenprobleme haben in der Regel (ihre Wurzel) psychische Gesundheitsprobleme und der ständige Regen, der über weite Teile des Jahres geht, sowie die traurigen Wolken, scheint ein Beitrag zu sein. Portland hat auch ein Obdachlosenproblem, über das niemand weiß, was man tun soll. Die Obdachlosenbevölkerung wird von den Sozialdiensten angezogen, die Portland bietet, die besser sind als in den meisten Teilen des Landes, aber unsere Dienste reichen nicht aus, wie in allen Teilen des Landes.

No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",

Im Norden zeugen sie vom Sonnenaufgang und vom Sonnenuntergang auf jeden Tag. Ob ich mich um sie kümmere oder nicht, ob ich mit Arbeit und Leben so sehr beschäftigt bin, dass ich sie überhaupt nicht bemerke - sie sind da, unerschütterlich, unbeeindruckt und unbeeinträchtigt von den Widrigkeiten des Lebens. Wenn ich an Tagen bin, an denen ich am meisten gestresst und verletzlich bin, erheben sie sich, wenn ich mich ihnen zuwende, und lassen mich meine angespannte Seele ruhen, geben mir Kraft, um weiterzumachen, Tag um Tag. Ich bin hierher gezogen, als ich mein Studium aufgenommen habe, und die Berge nördlich des Campus haben mich sofort fasziniert. Ja, die Universität hat ihre eigenen atemberaubenden Sehenswürdigkeiten in Gebäuden und Teichen und Bäumen, die ein Teil meines Herzens sind, aber es sind die Berge, die den Thron halten. Die restliche Stadt ist in ihrem eigenen Recht schön. Es gibt unzählige Kaffeehäuser, in denen ich viele Stunden mit Koffein-hochgetakteter Lernarbeit verbracht habe. Man kann zu Fuß oder mit dem Bus ein bisschen weiter in die Innenstadt fahren und von den verblassten bunten Backsteinen umrahmten Restaurants und Bürogebäuden in eine Aura der Antike eintauchen. Hier zeigt sich, dass diese scheinbar suburbane Stadt so viel Betriebsamkeit und Elan wie ihre benachbarte Stadt hat. Dies währt nicht lange, denn man kann wieder in die stille kleine Stadt gelangen, indem man die Bibliothek passiert. Diese Atmosphäre dieses gutmütigen Kontrasts so nahe beieinander gibt der Stadt einen wunderbaren Charm, als ob sie einladen würde, sie zu erkunden. Es ist leicht, viele geliebte Erinnerungen zu schaffen, jede in Verbindung mit einem bestimmten Teil der Stadt. Ob es darum geht, an den rostigen Schaukeln im Park mit Freunden nach einem Allnächtigen vorbeizulaufen oder durch die bustle der Innenstadt zu rennen, um den Film im anspruchsvollen Kino zu schauen, für das die Universität die Eintrittskarten bereitgestellt hat. Leider ist es auch Heimat vieler harten Erinnerungen, wie es in allen Orten im Leben so ist. Die Teiche können besonders eine passende Stätte für Reflexionen und Tränen sammeln sein, besonders in der Mitte der Nacht in der Mitte eines existenziellen Krisen. Letztere habe ich mehr Erfahrung mit. Während ich die Schildkröten, Enten und Insekten beobachte, wie sie ihr Leben leben, jedes mit einer Beitrags oder Rolle, konnte ich mich nicht helfen, über meinen eigenen Sinn des Lebens nachzudenken, während ich mich mit diesem Rätsel genannten Leben auseinander setzte. Also ging ich am Teich vorbei, am Park und den kleinen Häusern, die von Suburbanität schreien, bis ich auf eine Hauptstraße kam. Es war dann, dass die Sonne ihre strahlenden Strahlen auf die Palmenbäume warf, die Himmel entlang malte und als ich aufsah, sah ich mich nach Norden bewegen. Sicher genug, sie waren da, so wie sie immer gewesen waren. Die robusten, überwältigenden Berge streiften den nebligen blauen und gelben Himmel mehr als jeder Bauwerk im Horizont, und als ob sie ohne Worte sprächen, weckten sie in mir den Sinn der Hartnäckigkeit.\n\nBack to English Translation:\n\n[REWRITE] The mountains are always there.

    "transformed": "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun's journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up I am with work and life, they are there, unwavering, unimpressed, and untroubled by life's tribulations. On days when I am the most stressed and vulnerable, they rise up when I turn to them, and allow me to rest my anxious soul, lending me strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my studies, and the mountains to the north of the campus immediately captivated me. Yes, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which hold a part of my heart, but it's the mountains that truly hold their throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless coffee shops where I spent many hours fueled by caffeine and cramming for exams. One can walk or take the bus a little further into the downtown area and immerse oneself in the aura of antiquity surrounded by faded, colorful bricks of restaurants and office buildings. Here, this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vitality as its neighboring urban city. This doesn't last long, as one can escape again to the serene small town by passing through the library. The dichotomy of these contrasting atmospheres in such proximity truly gives this city a wonderful charm, as if it's beckoning to be explored. It's easy to create many cherished memories, each associated with a particular part of town. Whether it's walking past the rusty swings in the park with friends after a late night or racing through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the upscale cinema, for which the university provided tickets. Unfortunately, it's also home to many harsh memories, as it is in all places in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a suitable place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the midst of an existential crisis. The latter, I have more experience with.

Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here.

Die öffentliche Verkehrsmittel sind sehr zugänglich und gehören zu den beliebtesten Formen der Fortbewegung in New York City. Bensonhurt ist ein relativ urbaner Bezirk, daher werden Sie immer noch denken, dass Sie sich in New York City befinden. Während Ihres Besuchs sollten Sie sich auf die verschiedenen asiatischen Läden um sich herum vorbereiten. Im Laufe der letzten zwei Jahrzehnte hat Bensonhurt einen großen Zustrom asiatischer Einwohner erhalten. Deshalb werden Sie auf jeden Block hinweisen, dass ein asiatisch besitzener Laden ist, während Sie sich gerade spazieren tragen. Die beliebtesten Geschäfte sind Supermärkte und Waschsalons. Zufälligerweise sind diese Geschäfte sehr beliebt bei den Einwohnern, da die Lebensmittelqualität in den Supermärkten hervorragend ist, die Preise sind viel günstiger und schließlich ist es sehr bequem. Direkt in meiner Nähe gibt es vier asiatische Supermärkte innerhalb von zwei Minuten Gehdistanz voneinander. Das fügt sich einfach zum Komfort hinzu, die Lebensmittel abzuholen. Ich sage nicht, dass Bensonhurst rein von asiatischen Einwohnern bewohnt ist, obwohl. Es ist umgeben von einer diversen Bevölkerung, mit Einwanderern und ihren amerikanischen Kindern der ersten und zweiten Generation. Die meisten großen und beliebten Geschäfte in der lokalen Gegend sind asiatisch besitzt. Zusätzlich zu diesen asiatisch besitzten Geschäften gibt es auch einen kürzlich renovierten Park in der Nähe, der etwa zehn Basketballplätze, einen großen Rasen für Fußball oder Baseball, vier Handballplätze, Schaukeln, einen Spielplatz für Kinder und sogar eine Wassersprudel für Kinder zum Spielen im Sommer bietet. Da wir uns in New York City befinden, ist es natürlich, dass die Parks sehr vielfältig sind. Sie werden alle Arten von Vielfalt hier sehen, die sich gut miteinander vertragen. In diesem Viertel gibt es nicht viele große Firmengebäude. Die einzigen Gebäude, die Sie finden werden, sind solche für den co-op-Wohnen oder Wohnungen in Apartments. Die Mehrheit der Wohnräume hier sind jedoch zwei-Familienhäuser. Die meisten Menschen sind jedoch sehr nett, jedoch sehr lauten. Jeden Tag hören Sie Autos, die Musik laufen lassen, als sie vorbeifahren, oder laufen ständig volle Gas, was Sie am Morgen wecken wird. Wenn Sie sich während der Nachtzeit entscheiden, sollten Sie auf der Hut sein. Dieser Bezirk ist insgesamt sicher, jedoch sind die Menschen unvorhersehbar. Sie werden möglicherweise mit Menschen zusammenlaufen, die ohne Grund Streit anfangen wollen, Bullen und Diebe. Ich selbst wurde in diesem Viertel in der Vergangenheit körperlich angegriffen, aber dies war viele Jahre her. Ein weiterer jüngster Vorfall beinhaltete das Diebstahl von Paketen. Obwohl es ein häufiges Problem ist, gibt es in diesem Viertel Paketdiebe. Zuletzt, obwohl New York City eine Geldstrafe für Menschen, die nicht nach ihrem Hund Mist machen, hat, nicht nachmachen, tun Menschen es hier nicht. Jeden Morgen werden Sie auf Ihrem Weg zum Bahnhof oder zum Supermarkt auf jeden Fall Mist von Hunden sehen. Mein größter Ärger ist der Hundemist, den ich überall in diesem Viertel sehe.

There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean.

It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired.

My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood.

Die Leute nennen es den \"Fitness-Hügel\" weil viele Jogger ihn während ihrer täglichen Fitness-Session gerne hinauflaufen. Da es in meiner Straße überhaupt keine Gehwege gibt, laufen alle auf der Straße. Die Straße ist an einigen Stellen stark beschädigt und kann bei der Fahrt gefährlich werden. Einige Telefon- und Stromleitungen, die in der ganzen Straße aufgespannt sind, sehen ziemlich verlottert aus. Es regnet und stürmt oft in unserer Gegend, sodass Äste und andere Abfall oft auf die Stromleitungen fallen und die ständigen Reparaturen machen sie unscharf und patchwork-artig. Es gibt viele hohe Tannenbäume überall, aber die Leute hier haben es nicht gern, dass sie sie stehen. Sie bemühen sich, so viele wie möglich zu fällen, weil die Bäume die Sicht auf das Meer behindern. Deshalb sind viele Häuser so hoch oben auf dem Hügel gebaut worden, mit riesigen Glasfronten im ersten Stock, die nach oben ragen, um die Aussicht auf den Hafen zu genießen. Es ist um die Sonnenuntergangszeit wunderschön, wenn das Wasser von unten bestrahlt wird und der Himmel orange wird. Es ist oft bewölkt, daher sieht man den Großteil der Sonnenlicht durch einen Nebel. Die meisten Tage sind bedeckt und feucht. Moos wächst überall auf: auf Dächern, Autos und Geländern. Ich habe einmal mein Auto einen Monat auf dem Driveway stehen lassen und als ich es dann herausgeholt habe, war es grün und haarig mit Moos überzogen. Es dauerte mich drei Stunden, es abzukratzen. Es gibt nicht viele Kinder in meiner Umgebung, obwohl es in ein paar Blöcken Entfernung eine Schule gibt. Die meisten Leute in meinem Viertel sind älter, viele von ihnen sind pensioniert. Anstelle von Kindern haben die Leute Hunde. Es ist üblich, sie auf den Vorgärten sitzen oder auf der Straße rennen zu sehen. Wenn du eine Tür oder ein Fenster offen lässt, riskierst du, dass sie in dein Haus eindringen. Ich habe einmal einen im Wohnzimmer gefunden und musste ihn vor die Tür scheuchen. Hasen laufen wild herum in der Gegend. Einige sind groß, und die Gärtner hassen sie, weil sie die Wurzeln von Pflanzen aufgraben und in die Vorgärten der Leute graben. Meine Katzen lieben sie jedoch, und haben die meisten aus dem Viertel gejagt. Wir haben außerdem die übliche Auswahl an Vögeln: kleine Spatzen und Hummeln, und manchmal schwebt ein Falken oder Adler über den Dächern herum, bis die Nachbarschaftskrähen es vertreiben. Es gibt keine Geschäfte in der Nähe, aber wenn du abwärts zum Ufer gehst, gibt es ein paar Restaurants, die frische Meeresfrüchte servieren. Es ist nicht sehr breit, aber die Felsen am Strand sind zum Werfen in das Wasser Spaß. Der Hafen selbst ist nicht sehr breit.

There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year.

Es sind nicht zu viele Leute, die sich hier ansiedeln oder umziehen, also habe ich mich an die meisten Menschen im Viertel gewöhnt. Die Leute beschäftigen sich größtenteils mit Gartenarbeit und anderen alltäglichen Arbeiten. Im Winter fahren wir auf einer Hügel auf unserer Seitenstraße Schlitten.

Kinder fahren auf ihren Fahrrädern und das, was du erwarten würdest, in dieser Art der Stadt. Wir sind zu Hause sehr viel, da wir von hier aus arbeiten. Es gibt vier von uns, ich selbst, meine Frau und zwei Töchter im Alter von elf und vierzehn. Also, ich würde sagen, dass jeder andere sich an uns, wie wir kommen und gehen, gewöhnt hat.

Wir haben in unserem Viertel sehr viele Bäume, da es ursprünglich ein bewaldetes Gebiet war, also gibt es viele Schatten, aber es gibt auch immer viele Blätter im Herbst.

    "transformed": "I live in a typical suburban area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There aren't too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People keep themselves busy with yard work and other everyday chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go for a walk for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids ride their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We're at home a lot since we work from home. There are four of us, myself and my wife, and two daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Sometimes we grill outdoors on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems as if someone is always mowing the lawn around here and you can hear a lawnmower almost every day from March to about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood since it was originally a wooded area, so there's a lot of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the fall as well. This means we have to rake and burn the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much winter at all, so it just feels like a long fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we hardly use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here.

Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit.

Es sei denn, man hat das Leben hier wirklich erlebt, versteht man wahrscheinlich nicht, wie es ist, immer nur braune Farbe zu sehen, und wenn man einmal einen Rasen sieht, weiß man, dass sich der Besitzer einen ungeheuren Aufwand mit der Pflege macht. Als ich hier in den 90ern wohnte, waren die Häuser weit auseinander gestellt. Jetzt ist es ähnlich geblieben, aber es gibt viele neue Hinzufügungen. Ehrlich gesagt, sieht mein Viertel immer mehr wie eine Stadt aus, aber die meisten Orte verändern sich in ähnlicher Weise. Die Leute hier sind ziemlich freundlich, aber wie in jeder Stadt gibt es auch gute und schlechte Seiten. In meinem Viertel bin ich umgeben von freundlichen alten Menschen, ich denke, es ist ein nettes Viertel. Die Geschäfte in diesem Ort sind hauptsächlich Ketten, wie Food for Less und Smart und Final. Wenn man Supermärkte sehen will, muss man weit hinausfahren, ich sehe keine Whole Foods oder Geschäfte dieser Art. Die Arbeitsplätze, die in meiner Stadt am meisten präsent sind, sagen ich, nicht auf der Grundlage offizieller Demografien, sind Bau. Ich denke, dies ist aufgrund der Tatsache, dass diese Stadt noch nicht sehr entwickelt ist, gibt es immer noch viele freie offene Räume, um zu bauen. Das ängstigt mich ein bisschen, ich mag es, wie es jetzt ist. Ich bin aus einer großen Stadt weggezogen und ich bin nicht begeistert, wieder dorthin zurückzukehren. Über die Bauarbeiten: Mein Arbeitsplatz für meine Vollzeitstelle befindet sich im Bauwesen und ich bin Trockenbau- und T-Barmontagearbeiter. Was ich an meinem Zuhause mag, sind die verschiedenen Tiere. Leute kommen in die Wüste für viele Gründe, nicht zuletzt aufgrund der schroffen Schönheit der Wüste selbst. Klima und Landschaft der Wüste haben herausfordernde Ökosysteme geschaffen, die geschützt werden müssen und in denen sich verschiedene Arten von Wildtieren befinden. Die menschlichen Bewohner der Wüste sollten sich die Zeit nehmen, um sich über die nicht-menschlichen Bewohner dieser Umwelt zu informieren, um sicher und harmonisch miteinander zu coexistieren. Meine Familie und ich haben uns sehr gut an die Wildtiere angepasst. Ich habe drei Kinder und sie sind alle fasziniert von Echsen und Wüstenkäfern, als ich gerade schreibe, sind sie draußen und versuchen, verschiedene Exemplare zu fangen. Was die Attraktionen angeht, haben wir einige. Victorville ist auch ein gutes Ort für Familien, um die Wüste zu erleben. Es kann eine andere Erfahrung bereitstellen. Wenn du kannst, plane deinen Besuch so, dass du das jährliche Event mitmachen kannst: die San Bernardino County Fair. Die Messe wird deinen Besuch mit der richtigen Mischung aus Aktivitäten und Spaß nach dem Victorville-Konzept bereichern. Besuche das nahegelegene Wrightwood, um die geschneite Berge zu sehen und erfahre Wintersport-Techniken, um deinen Besuch zu beenden. Interessiert sich für die Naturschönheit und Kultur des Hochwüstenökosystems? Das Victor Valley Museum enthält geologische und paläontologische Exemplare, indianische Artefakte und historische Gegenstände, die die Geschichte der Entwicklung der Gesellschaft und der Industrie von Victorville erzählen.\n\nNow, I will translate the provided German text back to English:\n\n[REWRITE]My neighborhood is located in the middle of the high desert, where there's only sand and sand everywhere.

I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students.

Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park.

    "raw_output": "Ich werde mich freuen, dir zu helfen. Hier ist die deutsche Version des Textes:\n\nWenn ich gefragt werde, mein Viertel zu beschreiben, bin ich mir sicher, dass meine Antwort einzigartig ist. Während andere, die darauf antworten, wahrscheinlich Eigentümer mit ihren eigenen Lebensumständen sind, ist meine Situation ein bisschen anders. Ich betrachte mein Viertel als den College-Campus, auf dem ich wohne, und die Menschen, die in meinem Studentenwohnheim leben, als meine Gemeinschaft. Ich betrachte auch den umliegenden Campus als mein Viertel, wenn auch zu einem geringeren Grad. Trotz dieser Besonderheit teilt mein Viertel jedoch einige Gemeinsamkeiten mit den konventionellen Ideen über ein Viertel. Wie jedes konventionelle Viertel hat mein Viertel Häuser, Menschen, Läden und Parks. Lassen Sie uns mit den \"Häusern\" beginnen, die mein Viertel bilden. Bevor ich zu den Häusern in meinem Viertel übergehe, wäre es am besten, die Arten von Häusern zu klären, die in meinem Viertel gefunden werden können. Es gibt drei Arten von Wohnungen in meiner unmittelbaren Umgebung, die Apartments, die tatsächlichen Häuser und die Studentenhauswohnungen. Zuerst sind die Apartments, in denen normalerweise zwischen 2-4 Menschen in jedem Raum sind und es gibt etwa 4-6 Räume auf jeder Etage. Die am häufigsten anzutreffende Gebäudetypus kann etwa 2 Etagen beherbergen, sodass durchschnittlich etwa 20 Menschen in jedem Gebäude leben. Zweitens sind die tatsächlichen Häuser, die für jeden mit einer Verbindung zur Schule gemietet werden können. Typischerweise handelt es sich um 2-4-Zimmer-Angebote, die normalerweise von Alumni bewohnt werden. Es gibt jedoch nur wenige dieser Art von Häusern in meinem Viertel, da sie weniger effizient sind. Schließlich gibt es die typischen Studentenwohnheimräume, die Dutzende von Studenten beherbergen. In diesen teilen sich zwei Menschen einen Raum mit Ausnahme, und es ist der am häufigsten anzutreffende Typ von Unterbringung in meinem Viertel. Mit dem Thema Wohnungen haben wir bereit, zum Thema Menschen überzugehen. Meine Schule ist stolz auf ihre Vielfalt und das spiegelt sich in der Zusammensetzung meines Viertels wider. In meinem Viertel leben Menschen aus allen Kulturen und Altersgruppen. Die meisten Berufsangehörigen leben in den Häusern, die im Viertel platziert sind, während die neuen Studenten in den Studentenhauswohnheimen und die älteren Studenten in den Apartment-Style-Wohnungen wohnen. Die Menschen in diesem Viertel können nicht richtig gerechtfertigt werden, indem man nur über sie spricht, also ist es am besten, einfach zum Thema Läden und Parks in meinem Viertel überzugehen. Da meine Schule eigentlich ihr eigenes selbstständiges Viertel ist, verfügt es über eine Vielzahl von Läden und ein einziges Park. Die Läden sind ein Mix aus Speiseoptionen, die auch in jedem anderen Viertel zu finden wären, und der eigenen Markenartikel der Schule sowie Lebensmittelgeschäfte. Daher kann alles, was benötigt wird, innerhalb der Grenzen meines Viertels gefunden werden! Zusätzlich ist der Park in meinem Viertel ein Spielplatz für alle verschiedenen Menschen in meinem Viertel, er wird sauber und frei von Kriminalität gehalten von allen Mitgliedern meines Viertels.\n\nUnd nun wird der deutsche Text in englisch zurückübersetzt:\n\n[REWRITE]When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure my answer is unique.

Ich kam aus Riverdale nach Stockbridge, und ich lüge nicht, ich habe geweint, weil ich sie vermisste und sie liebte. Aber meine Mutter und mein Vater wollten das Beste für mich und meine kleine Schwester, also zogen wir in ein besseres Viertel, ein besseres Gymnasium, alles war als \"keine Gegend\" gesehen, als wir in unser neues Viertel zogen. Während der Jahre wurde ich daran gewöhnt, und machte einige neue Freunde, und einige neue Feinde im Schulalltag. Ich habe mich nie wirklich mit meinen Nachbarn angefreundet, außer mit Herrn Glen und seinen Kindern, sowie Dennis für einen kurzen Zeitraum, die direkt neben uns wohnten. Sie waren angenehme Menschen, die ich fast als Familie in gewisser Weise ansehen kann, und ich schätze sie wirklich. Ich erinnere mich, als wir, Mama, Papa und meine Schwester zu Herrn Glens Hochzeit gingen (Er hat sich wieder geheiratet) Es war wirklich Spaß und angenehm, und ich freue mich darauf, dass das einmal zu bewerkstelligen ist, als ich mein Vermögen aufbauen und meiner zukünftigen Frau ein Leben wie eine Königin bieten kann. Als Herr Glen seine Frau, Frau Veda, den weißen kleinen Riemen auf ihrem Bein abnahm und ihn wegworfen hat, habe ich ihn aufgefangen! Leider habe ich die Blumen nicht gefangen! Wir haben die Nacht durchgetanzt und ich habe mich wirklich wohlgefühlt, als ich mich mit Marsharii, einer ihrer Töchter, unterhielt. Ich habe sie seitdem aber nicht mehr gesehen. Ich hoffe, sie ist sich auf größere und bessere Dinge konzentriert. Das Viertel selbst ist wie ein Labyrinth, obwohl ich jetzt einen GPS habe, kann ich mich mehr Zeit nehmen, es zu erkunden. Ich bin nur bis hier gekommen und das ist, wenn ich mit meinen Freunden Kason und Curtis ausgegangen bin. Wir haben uns früher oft Videospielen, und einfach das Leben auf die volle Höhe so viel wie wir konnten, genossen. Manchmal ging ich in den Park und genoss die Natur, was mir Seelenfrieden gibt. Es gibt mir eine Beruhigung und Stille an solchen Tagen. Ich werde auch einige Stöcke, die ich von Home Depot gekauft habe, und meine Balance üben, Und meine Bokken-Balkenholzschwert, wenn ich kann. Ich habe Spaß daran, das zu tun, was ich liebe. Es gibt auch einen Basketball- und Tennisplatz, obwohl ich seit langem nicht mehr Tennis oder Basketball gespielt habe. Es ist immer noch nett, dass es da ist, falls ich es jemals wieder aufnehmen und es nochmal versuchen will. Mein Vater hat mich und meinen besten Freund mit Tennis unterrichtet, und wir hatten immer einen wunderbaren Zeit. Sie haben uns hart gearbeitet! Aber wir hatten immer Spaß.

I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I'm not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them. But my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered \"not ghetto\" when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, who lived right next to us. They were pleasant people that I almost can consider as family in some way, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen's wedding (he got remarried) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I'm looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a queen. When Mr. Glen's wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly, I didn't catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven't seen her since, though. I hope she's focused on greater and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take my time to explore it. I've only gone so far, and that's when I've hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We used to play video games a lot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I'd go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace on those days. I'll also bring some sticks that I bought from Home Depot and just practice my balance, and bring my bokken wooden sword if I can. I have fun doing what I love. There's also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven't played tennis or basketball in a long time, it's still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it up again and give it another go. My dad taught me and my best friend tennis, and we had a great time. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I think there are many times I've felt good in this neighborhood, and there are plenty of stories, but these are the ones that really stuck with me, and I believe that the best is yet to come!",

They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer.

Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live.

Die meisten Gebäude sind Wohnhäuser, aber es gibt ein paar Restaurants und Bars, die es sich lohnt, zu besuchen und die nicht zu teuer sind. Eine der Bars wurde kürzlich umgenannt, und die ist teurer zu besuchen, aber nicht wirklich die schlechteste Qualität der Bedienung oder Getränke. Die meisten Leute sind nett. Entweder sind sie Studenten oder sie sind prekar, da die Wohnungen nicht sehr teuer sind. Es gibt viele Kinder in der Nähe, da sich in Laufweite meines Apartments eine Grundschule befindet. Ich kenne meine Nachbarn nicht, aber ich will sie nicht wirklich kennenlernen. Sie rauchen viel Gras und die Verwaltung meines Gebäudes hat daher ein Luftrekordergerät direkt vor ihrer Tür platziert, was mein Freund und ich sehr amüsiert hat. Es ist fast beleidigend. Die Gebäude, die sich um mich herum befinden, sehen normalerweise ziemlich alt aus, aber möglicherweise haben sie renovierte Innenräume. Ein bisschen die Straße runter gibt es brandneue Apartments, aber ich mag sie nicht, weil ich weiß, dass die Bauarbeiten, die an ihnen durchgeführt wurden, nicht besonders gut waren. Sie sind billig gebaut, aber der Mietzins ist teuer, was ich als Betrug halte, aber da sie in der Nähe des Campus liegen, können die Verwalter dieser Gebäude davon profitieren. Es gibt ein sehr günstiges Restaurant etwa fünf Minuten von meinem Wohnort entfernt, das nur Essen auf Papierplatten serviert und die meisten Dinge, die sie zubereiten, werden im Mikrowellengerät zubereitet. Dann befindet sich direkt gegenüber ein Tankstelle, die ich gehört habe, sei kein guter Ort zum Arbeiten. Aufgrund von Geld aus der Stadt wurde die Straße im Sommer renoviert, sodass es jetzt eine schöne breite Gehsteig, viele Gras auf den Mittelstreifen und Seiten der Straßen gibt, und nun ist die Gegend ein bisschen nett. Aber mein Apartmentkomplex ist von Bäumen umgeben, sie haben einige von ihnen gekappt, also sind einige Stümpfe übrig, aber an meinem Wohnort gibt es viele mehr Bäume als die Straße runter. Hinter meinem Apartmentkomplex ist ein Baumreihen und dann ein weiterer Apartmentkomplex. Ich wohne auf der 42. Straße, aber direkt dahinter ist die 43. Straße und die ist nicht so nett. Die Gehsteige sind sehr schlecht und zusammengebrochen, und die meisten Gebäude auf dieser Straße sehen heruntergekommener aus. Es gibt viele Bäume auf dieser Straße, aber das ist wahrscheinlich nur, um die Aussehen der Gebäude zu verbergen. Die meisten Verbrechen in meiner Gegend sind im Apartmentkomplex auf dieser Straße passiert, aber dann wiederum kann ich nur diese nicht verantworten. Es gibt Apartments gegenüber von mir, die auch sehr viel Verbrechen und eine eher wandernde Bevölkerung aufweisen. Aber ich denke, ich mag wo ich wohne. Ich kann es mir leisten und es gibt viele nützliche Einrichtungen in der Nähe. Ich mag besonders, dass die Universität in Laufweite ist und es gibt zwei Bushaltestellen, sodass ich leicht zum Laden und in die Stadt komme.\n\nEnglish translation back to original meaning, with some variation in expression:\n\n[REWRITE] I live in a neighborhood near the college I attend, which is one of the reasons I like living there.

Sie stehen abwechselnd und werden so platziert, dass sie wie einzelne Häuser aussehen. Die einzige Abweichung ist, dass jeder ein anderes Mal gefärbt ist, mit weißen Veranden und grünen Metalldächern. Fast alle, aber nicht alle, sind miteinander befreundet. Wir stehen am Ende einer nicht vorher beschlossenen Auffahrt abends und plaudern miteinander, während die kleinen Kinder der Nachbarschaft mit ihren Spielsachen, Straßenmalerei oder ihrem Flugzeug spielen. Es ist sehr erfrischend in dieser modernen Welt voller Maschinen und Computer. Es ist, als würde man in die Vergangenheit zurückkehren. Wir sind von Feldern und Bäumen umgeben, die sich von den blauen Himmel und den wehenden weißen Wolken verbessern. Die einzige Hürde? Diese Saison erleben wir Tornadobenachrichtungen und zum ersten Mal letzten Nacht hörten wir tatsächlich die echten Tornadosirenen, also mussten wir uns auf den Weg zum Schutz begeben. Genau so, hättest du mich in meinem Bad sehen können, wo ich meinen kleinsten Hund, meine Handtasche und ein paar Kissen umklammerte. Mein großer Hund wollte nichts mit dem Badezimmer zu tun haben und blieb in der Wohnzimmer, nervös und bellend, nervös wegen der seltsamen Umstände. Die Nachbarschaft war ruhig, bis auf den Lärm des großen Hagels, der überall auf dem Boden fiel. Nach dem Sturm war die Straße tatsächlich dampfend, weil sich die Temperatur geändert hatte. Wir gingen von 92 auf 75 in einer Minute. Der Hagel schmolz sofort auf, als er auf die heiße Straße traf. Als ich auf die klare Himmel blickte, kam die Sonne heraus und es begann zu regnen. Ein Doppelregenbogen erschien. Ich lief ins Haus und nahm meine Kamera. Schnell machte ich einige Fotos, um sie mit meinen Facebook-Freunden und Familie zu teilen. Sie waren beeindruckt, ich auch. Die Straßen blieben ruhig für weitere eine Stunde, bevor einige Leute endlich nach Hause kamen, wo sie waren, als der Gewitter traf. Dann war es wieder Geschäfts wie gewohnt, Mütter und Kinder draußen, während das Abendessen kochte. Was für eine freundliche Nachbarschaft für diese Frau, die kürzlich von New Hampshire nach Nord Carolina gezogen ist. Ich liebe den südlichen Akzent, den die Leute sprechen. Ich habe ein Zweizimmer- und Zweibad-Apartment, genau wie jeder andere. Obwohl alle Häuser von außen gleich aussehen, sind nicht alle Apartments von innen gleich. Einige sind tatsächlich sehr klein. Das ergibt keinen Sinn für mich. Ich liebe es, entlang des größten Feldes hinter meinem Haus zu spazieren und dann den See zu erreichen, der nicht zum Schwimmen gedacht ist. Ich habe Hirsche gesehen und in den Morgenstunden kann man den Riesensalamander singen hören. Es ist ein fantastischer Ort, um zu wohnen, nur 40 Minuten außerhalb der Stadt Charlotte. Jeden Morgen begrüßt uns der Lärm der Hähne von den umliegenden Farmen. Es ist, als würde man in einer kleinen Dorfsiedlung leben. Wir haben sogar ein Esel auf einer nahegelegenen Farm, der man in der Abenddämmerung hören kann, um uns zu sagen, dass er da ist. Ich war glücklich, diesen Schatz einer Nachbarschaft gefunden zu haben.\n\nBack to English translation:\n[REWRITE]My neighborhood is made up of duplex houses on a dead-end street.

It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",

Ich habe dort mit den anderen Jungs im Viertel Basketball, Fußball und Baseball gespielt. Ich habe auch eines meiner schlimmsten Erinnerungen dort gemacht, als ich beim Fußballspielen ins Gesicht getroffen wurde, aber die guten Erinnerungen überwiegen die schlechten. Heute, wenn ich dorthin gehe, bin ich, um Zeit mit den Kindern meines Cousins zu verbringen. Sie sind viel jünger als ich und mögen es immer noch, auf Schaukelbäume und Rutschen zu spielen und so weiter. Nur der Gedanke daran, in den Park zu gehen, macht sie begeistert.

You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never had a package stolen from my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There's a park a minute or two away from my house. I have spent a lot of time there. I have played basketball, soccer, and baseball there with the other kids in the neighborhood before. I also have one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing soccer, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park, it's to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still enjoy playing on swings and slides and all that kind of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You can find all kinds of food nearby. Within a one-mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, many people use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are fast-food restaurants, but you can find those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizzerias. The stores here have everything you could need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse, with an Indian-owned store if you're ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some pre-made Indian food. Overall, I'm a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing news stories about the horror stories other people have to deal with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine. [/REWRITE]",

Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time!

    "raw_output": "Die Übersetzung des Textes in Deutsch:\n\nMein Viertel ist ein kleines, charmantes Dorf. Es fällt nicht ins Auge, wenn man sich durch South Carolina bewegt, aber es hat einen erheblichen Einfluss auf den Agrarsektor. Johnston ist bekannt als die Weltpeach-Hauptstadt, etwas, das die Stadt stolz auf dem willkommenen Schild zeigt. Es besteht hauptsächlich aus Agrarland, das von entweder Pfirsichbäumen oder Viehzucht dominiert wird. Die Häuser, die nicht im Hauptteil der Stadt liegen, sind weit voneinander entfernt; die meisten sind zweistöckig mit entweder Metalldächern, um sich gegen die brennende Sommerhitze zu wehren, oder grauen Schindeln. Häufiger als nicht werden diese Häuser nicht an der Straße liegen, sondern sind weiter hinten, um die vorderen Felder für Tiere oder Kulturen zu nutzen. Im Hauptteil der Stadt steht ein einzelnes Verkehrssignal an einer Vier-Wege-Kreuzung. Hier befinden sich die einzigen Geschäfte in der gesamten Stadt. Es gibt drei Orte, an denen man schnell essen kann: Hong Kong, ein kleines chinesisches Restaurant, das von einer einzelnen Familie geführt wird, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant oder Gary's, ein kleiner Burger-Kettenbetrieb. Es gab einmal eine Pizzeria, aber sie schloss sich kürzlich. Es gibt eine sehr kleine, von einer Familie betriebene Apotheke namens Maxwell und Halford Drug; zum Glück ist sie vor allem für die Cherry-Coca-Cola bekannt, die sie verkauft. Es gibt ein kleines, aber teures Supermarkt namens Independent Grocers Alliance, bekannt als IGA. Obwohl es der einzige Supermarkt in der gesamten Stadt ist, besuchen viele Einwohner nur, um ein oder zwei Artikel zu kaufen; die meisten bevorzugen es, in die Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville zu fahren, um den Großteil ihrer Lebensmittel einzukaufen. Das beliebteste Geschäft in der gesamten Stadt ist Dollar General; das Geschäft verkauft eine breite Palette von Alltagsartikeln und ist oft geschäftig von der Eröffnung bis zur Schließung. Es gibt ein sehr kleines Möbelgeschäft namens Possibilities Furniture & More, das von einer freundlichen Frau geführt wird, die in der Gemeinschaft bekannt ist. Das Geschäft befindet sich in Johnston seit einer Vielzahl von Jahren und beschäftigt sogar zwei Möbelpacker, die die gekauften Möbel liefern! An das Möbelgeschäftgebäude angelehnt ist ein kleiner Hundegrooming-Service namens Clarks Cuts and Kennels. Sie bieten eine Vielzahl von Dienstleistungen wie Tagesbetreuung, Unterbringung, Friseur, Nagelreißer, Baden usw. Sowohl eine Arztpraxis als auch eine Tierarztpraxis befinden sich außerhalb des Hauptteils der Stadt; sie sind beide sehr kleine Praxen, aber gut ausgestattet, um die Bewohner von Johnston zu unterstützen. Es gibt ein einzige Grundschule namens Johnston Elementary School. Sobald die Schüler den fünften Schuljahrgang beendet haben, müssen sie in die nächste Stadt weitergehen, um Mittelschule und Oberschule zu besuchen. Es gibt technisch gesehen keine Parks in der Stadt, aber sie befinden sich derzeit in der Mitte von einem 2,5 Hektar großen Freizeitareal, um Familien mehr Gelegenheit zu bieten, Ausflüge zu unternehmen und mehr Besucher/ potenzielle Einwohner anzuziehen. Zugegeben, es gibt nicht viel zu tun; es gibt keine Kinos, Bowlingbahnen, \"Häng'-out\"-Lokale, Spielplätze für Kinder, Flächen zum Spazierengehen mit Hunden oder eine große Vielfalt an Restaurants. Trotzdem ist es eine nette Stadt, so klein, dass man sie im Schlaf passieren kann, ohne es zu merken!\n\nDie Übersetzung des deutschen Textes zurück in das Originalenglische:\n\n[REWRITE] My neighborhood is a small, charming town.

For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",

The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n\nTranslation to German:\n\nDie allgemeine Gegend, in der ich lebe, kann als typisches Beispiel für Vorort-Architektur beschrieben werden. Für meinen Stadtteil insbesondere ist die Präsenz einer Eigentümergesellschaft sehr offensichtlich. Wenn man hereinkommt, sieht man nichts als gut unterhaltene Einfamilienhäuser, für die wir der Eigentümergesellschaft danken können.  Die Vorgärten sind alle sehr ähnlich. Es gibt eine kleine Rasenfläche, einige dekorative Kieselsteine und relativ kurze Fahrspuren. Ab und zu sieht man kleine Bäume. Jeder hat einen Doppelgaragen-Stellplatz. Wenn man weiter fährt, sieht man neue Asphaltstraßen. Trotz vielfältiger Familien, die hier leben, sind die Straßen in ausgezeichnetem Zustand. Man findet keine Löcher oder Ähnliches. Die meisten Häuser sind einstöckig, aber manchmal sieht man auch zweistöckige Gebäude. Wir haben keine typische Briefkasten-Anordnung, die man für Einfamilienhäuser erwarten würde. Es gibt keine Einzelbriefkästen vor jedem Haus. Stattdessen ist es eher wie ein Apartment, in dem es an der Endes der Straße eine große Gruppe an Briefkästen gibt. Jeder muss mit seinem Schlüssel auf seinen Briefkasten zugreifen. Und es gibt zwei größere Paketboxen. Noch einmal können wir der HOA und ihrer Obsession mit Uniformität dafür danken. Die Lage meines Hauses befindet sich am äußersten Rand der nahegelegenen Stadt, sodass mein Stadtteil als Teil ländlicher und städtischer Gegend beschrieben werden kann. Als Ergebnis haben wir viel Platz für, na, alles. Es gibt mehrere Gemeinschaftspools, auf die jeder hier lebende zugreifen kann. Sie sind gut gepflegt und zugänglich. Und dann gibt es verschiedene Wanderwege, auf denen man seinen Hund spazieren führen oder einfach nur abends alleine spazieren gehen kann. Man braucht nicht in einen Park zu gehen, um sich zu bewegen. Die Nachbarschaft ist groß genug, dass man einfach darum herumlaufen und genug Bewegung bekommen kann. Die Gemeinschaft besteht größtenteils aus pensionierten Menschen. Es ist ein sehr sicheres Gebiet, und jeder schaut sich um für den anderen. Gemischt mit dem gibt es eine kleine Menge mittelalter und junger Berufstätige. Was die Stadt angeht, ist sie überraschend groß - zumindest was die Bevölkerung angeht - aber auch hat sie das Gefühl einer Kleinstadt. Wir haben die große Mehrheit der Einrichtungen, die man erwarten und darauf zählen würde. Zum Beispiel haben wir genau einen Einkaufszentrum. Es ist nicht riesig, aber es reicht aus. Für mich dauert es ca. 15 Minuten, um überall zu kommen, wo es wichtig ist, aber wenn ich das getan habe, werde ich mit vielen verschiedenen Geschäften konfrontiert. Wir haben alles von hochpreisigen Lebensmittelgeschäften, in denen man biologische Lebensmittel kaufen kann, bis zu Spar-Einkaufszentren, die nur einen kleinen Auswahl an Artikeln führen und mit dem Minimum an Personal, um Kosten zu sparen. Alles in allem ist meine Nachbarschaft sicher, gut gepflegt und ziemlich typisch. Wir haben viele nette Dinge, wie Pools und Wanderwege. Und obwohl wir nicht direkt neben irgendeiner Art von Einkaufsmöglichkeiten wohnen, kann man einfach mit dem Auto fahren und zu jedem wichtigen Laden fahren, der man möchte.\n\nGerman translation back to English:\n\n[REWRITE] The general area where I live can be described as typical suburban architecture. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowners association is very apparent. When entering, you see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowners association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped lawn, some decorative pebbles, and relatively short driveways. Every so often you see small trees as well. Everyone has a two-car garage. As you continue to drive through the neighborhood, you see newly paved roads. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single-story, but sometimes you'll see two-story houses as well. We don't have a typical mailbox setup that you would expect for single-family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like an apartment complex where there are a large group of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to access their specific mailbox.

Meine unmittelbare Nachbarschaft, auf der östlichen Seite des Dorfes, könnte als das wirtschaftlich benachteiligste Gebiet des Dorfes beschrieben werden. Die Immobilienwerte sind niedrig, mit den meisten Häusern, die von niedrig verdienenden Einzelpersonen gemietet oder gekauft werden. Es ist jedoch nicht unattraktiv oder unangenehm. Meine Nachbarn sind generell freundliche Menschen, die mich mit einem Lächeln und einem Hallo grüßen, wenn ich die Straße entlanggehe. Die Kriminalitätsrate ist zwar leicht höher als in anderen Teilen des Dorfes, aber noch generell niedrig. Es gab in den letzten zehn Jahren einige Gewaltverbrechen in der Nähe meines Hauses, einschließlich einiger Schüsse und mindestens eines Mordes. Unsere Nachbarn in der Wohnung nebenan verlorenen letzten Jahr ihren Sohn bei einem Schuss in der Nähe eines Lokals. Glücklicherweise wurde unsere Familie nicht direkt von der Kriminalität betroffen, außer dass hin und wieder ein Gegenstand von unserem Vordach verschwindet, wenn wir ihn nicht ins Haus bringen. In der Regel ist das Dorf, in dem ich lebe, stark von der \"Opioid-Epidemie\" betroffen, die viele Teile der Vereinigten Staaten getroffen hat. Viele Menschen sind aufgrund von Fentanyl-Übertodestaten verloren gegangen. Glücklicherweise gibt es in meinem Dorf viele Ressourcen, um diese Epidemie zu bekämpfen, einschließlich mehrerer Rehabilitationszentren für Sucht und Narcan-Trainingssitzungen für Familien und Freunde von Menschen, die von der Sucht betroffen sind. Trotz dieser Herausforderungen hat das Dorf viele positive Eigenschaften. Die Schule meines Sohnes hat hervorragende Mitarbeiter, von der Schulleiterin bis zu den Lehrern und dem Unterstützungspersonal. Trotz seiner besonderen Bedürfnisse ist er bisher keine Mobbingopfer geworden, dank dem unglaublich positiven Klima der Schule, und er liebt es dort. Wir haben eine aktive Eltern-Eltern-Beirat, der mehrere Veranstaltungen im Laufe des Jahres plant, um die Familienbeteiligung und den Bildungsfortschritt zu fördern. Da mehr als 20 Prozent der Bevölkerung unseres Dorfes unter der Armutsgrenze lebt, bietet die Grundschule kostenlose Frühstück und Mittagessen allen Schülern an, so dass kein Kind jemals hungrig sein muss. Kein Kind oder keine Familie wird wegen seiner Unfähigkeit, zu zahlen, als \"weniger wert\" behandelt, und die Kosten für Schulkosten, Schulbedarf und Exkursionen sind sehr angemessen. Die Stadtverwaltung und das Personal haben viele Verbesserungen am Aussehen unseres Dorfes vorgenommen, einschließlich der Reparatur von Straßen, der Landscaping und der Wiederherstellung von Stadtgärten. Leider haben die meisten dieser Verbesserungen im Zentrum des Dorfes und auf der Westseite stattgefunden, wo sich alle Einkaufgebiete befinden und der Großteil des Verkehrs verläuft. Der östliche Teil, in dem ich lebe, wird tendenziell vernachlässigt, was ein Streitpunkt für die Leute in meiner Nachbarschaft ist. Insgesamt genieße ich es, in diesem Dorf zu leben. Die Leute sind generell freundlich, die Schulen sind großartig, es gibt ausreichend Shoppingmöglichkeiten (beide kleine Geschäfte und größere Einzelhandelsgeschäfte), um die Bedürfnisse meiner Familie zu erfüllen, und unser Zuhause mag nicht viel wert sein, aber es ist bequem und ausreichend. Unsere Familie lebt hier seit über 16 Jahren, und wir können uns nicht vorstellen, anderswo zu leben.\n\nTranslated German text back to English:\n\nI live in a small Midwestern town that is located just outside the suburbs of a major city.

    "original": "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",

Ich wohne in einem 7-stöckigen Wohnhaus direkt gegenüber dem alten Theater und einen Block weiter ist dieser coole kleine Arcade-Bars, zu dem sich auf warmen Sommerabenden unterschiedliche Arten von Leuten sammeln. Oft, besonders am Wochenende in Juni und Juli, siehst du eine Schlange von Leuten, die auf dem Eingang warten. Ein paar Blöcke weiter ist der nächste Stadtteilpark. Er ist ziemlich groß, besonders wenn man den Teil der Stadt berücksichtigt, in dem er liegt. Um den Park herum ist Beton, mit hohen Stufen in die Wand eingelassen. In den kühlen Wintermonaten stellen die obdachlosen Leute ihre Zelte in ordentlichen Reihen entlang der Gehwege und entlang der breiten Stufen auf. Es schneit nicht viel, aber es regnet, und der stürmische Regen in den mittleren Wintermonaten macht es oft schwierig, warm zu bleiben. Wenn sie ihre Zelte in der Nähe beieinander aufstellen, in der Mitte der Stadt anstatt im Dschungel, bleiben sie viel wärmer. Sie sind auch in einer vernünftigen Geh- und Verkehrsdistanz zum einzigen Familienzentrum in der Umgebung, wo sie sich duschen und baden können. Was ich jedoch an meiner Stadt liebe, ist nicht die Schönheit der historischen Natur - die hohen stolzen Gebäude, die Architektur, die sich durch die verschiedenen Ebenen der Hügel zieht, die sich nach dem Ozean hinunterwinden. Was ich an meiner Nachbarschaft liebe, ist die Kultur der Menschen selbst. Siehst du, Hilltop war einst das bekannteste Viertel an der Westküste für Gewalt durch Straßenbanden. Man hört noch Geschichten, sogar drei Dekaden später, von Bundesbeamten und DEA-Beamten, die durch die Straßen fegten, um die Straßen zu reinigen. Die Leute vergessen das nicht. Geschichten werden von Generation zu Generation weitergegeben, bis hin zu Neuankömmlingen wie mir, von jenen Tagen. Die Leute arbeiten hart, auch wenn es immer noch eines der raueren Viertel in der gesamten Stadt ist, um es sauber zu halten. Sie kümmern sich immer noch um das, was in ihrer Stadt, auf ihrem Block passiert. Sie sagen, wenn man weiß ist, soll man nicht nachts durch die Hill gehen. Wirklich, ich glaube, dass diese Warnung an die alten Tage erinnert und mit dem bitteren Geschmack der sozialen Bedingung getränkt ist. Vielleicht ist es nur, dass ich dunkel genug bin, um als nicht ganz \"weiß\" durchzugehen, oder vielleicht erkennt Hilltop mich als ein von ihnen selbst an, jemanden, der genauso schmerzlich bewusst ist, dass die ständigen Erinnerungen, die unsere Nation plagen. Erinnerungen, die aus Ahnungslosigkeit und Angst gemacht sind, selbst in einer Stadt, die für einen kulturellen Melting-Pot-Utopia gilt. Ich weiß eins: egal, wie weit ich reise, Hilltop ist mein Zuhause. Ich fühle mich lebendig, wenn ich durch die Straßen gehe nachts, Leute treffe, die mir schneller und seltener unerlaubt eine Jacke angedreht, als mich zu überfallen. Es ist ein Ort, an dem Waschsalonbesitzer erst ein paar Minuten später geöffnet haben, damit ich mein Handy aufladen konnte, wenn ich nirgendwohin zu entkommen hatte, bevor der Regen kam. Es ist ein Ort, an dem ich mich, mich selbst für unsichtbar glaube, gegen die Betonfassaden der Geschäfte gelehnt habe, an den grau und traurigesten von Nächten, und jemand kommt und hält mir einen 5-Dollar-Schein in die Augen, und sagt mir, dass ich schön und wertvoll bin.\n\nEnglish Translation:\n[REWRITE]\n\nMy neighborhood is full of culture.

Often, especially on weekends in June and July, you see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks away is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Surrounding the park is concrete, with tall steps poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalks and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential downpour in the mid-winter months often makes it difficult to keep warm. When they set their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, they stay much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center in the area, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city, however, isn't the beauty of the historic nature - the tall proud buildings, the architecture that sprawls throughout the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop was once the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, of federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it clean. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill at night. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely maliciously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had nowhere to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believed myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete storefronts on the most grey and dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n\n[/REWRITE]",

    "original": "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",

    "raw_output": "Hier ist die deutsche Übersetzung des Textes:\n\nIch lebe in ländlicher Amerika, speziell in einem kleinen Städtchen in Michigan. Hier wandelt man von Ackerland zu kleinen Touristenstädten über. Es gibt keine großen Stadtzentren, keine Walmart, keine Target oder gar einen Applebee’s. Überall muss man fahren, um dorthin zu gelangen. Trotzdem lebe ich in einem der schönsten Orte der Welt, umgeben von Wasser. Meine “Stadt” ist von Wasser umgeben. Sehr schön liegt auf der einen Seite der Lake Michigan und auf der anderen der Lake Charlevoix. Überall findest du ein Strand, an dem du deine Zehen baden kannst. Meine Nachbarschaft spiegelt das kleinste Städtchen wider. Die Häuser sind nicht über einem anderen aufgestapelt. Sie sind nicht standardmäßig gebaut und sehen alles andere als identisch aus. Sie sind ältere Häuser, einige von ihnen wurden renoviert und modernisiert, während andere älter sind. Die meisten Häuser haben Kellergeschosse, die man von der Straße aus sehen kann. Viele Häuser in der Nachbarschaft haben altes Aluminiumblech. In den Straßen um mein Haus herum gibt es Häuser aller möglichen Farben. Die meisten Häuser haben Gärten. Gärten mit Trampolinen, und Spielplätzen. Einige Menschen haben Gärten und Tore für ihre Tiere. Die Häuser sind dem typischen Mittelamerika ähnlich. Harte arbeitende Leute, die arbeiten, um einen Lebensunterhalt zu verdienen und entweder Familien großziehen oder Familien großgezogen haben. Jeden Tag kannst du Kinder laufen sehen, die die Straßen rauf und runter rennen. Du kannst auch Leute sehen, die Hunde ausführen, Fahrrad fahren oder Inline-Skating. Nachbarn kennen sich und du kannst erkennen, wer dazugehört und wer nicht. Du siehst jemanden, der draußen grillt, und winkt, oder jemanden, der in ein paar Häuserblocks entfernt mit seinem Hund spazieren geht und freundlich lächelt. Die Rasenflächen werden in einem guten Zustand gehalten. Niemand hat Blätter von der Herbstzeit aufgestapelt. Grüner Rasen wird gemäht und unter Kontrolle gehalten. Wenn Menschen Pflanzen und Büsche in ihren Gärten haben, werden sie gepflegt und gekürzt. Es ist kein schönes Viertel, das du fährst und denkst: Wow, was für schöne Häuser! Es ist vielmehr ein Viertel, das du fährst und denkst, das wäre ein guter Ort, um eine Familie großzuziehen. Es ist ruhig, friedlich und sicher. Während es nur durchschnittlich aussieht, ist es für die Tatsache außergewöhnlich, dass es das zeigt, was die Leute in der Welt wollen, nämlich einen sicheren Ort, an dem man sich am Ende des Tages niederlassen kann. In wenigen Gehminuten liegt das Bezirksgefängnis und das Gesundheitsamt. Das Recyclingzentrum liegt nur ein Stück die Straße runter, und die Nachbarn und die Bewohner aus der ganzen Stadt nutzen die Dienste, die sie anbieten. Wir haben Baseball- und Softballfelder in der Nähe, wo du die Kommentatoren hören kannst, die das Spiel im Auge behalten und die Namen der Spieler rufen. Unser kleiner Flughafen liegt direkt nebenan. Du kannst draußen spielen oder auch drinnen sein und die Motoren der kleinen Flugzeuge hören, die aufsteigen und landen. Du kannst zu Eiscreme gehen, wenn du in der Nähe wohnst, und wenn du dich wirklich in es einlässt, kannst du bis nach draußen in die Stadt fahren. Meine Kinder können ihre Räder bis zum Park fahren, der nur 8 Häuserblocks entfernt ist. Es ist ein wirklich großartiger Ort, um zu leben.\n\n[REWRITE]I live in rural America, specifically in a small town in Michigan. Here you go from farmland to small tourist towns.
