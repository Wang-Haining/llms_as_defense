Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",

Wohngebiete sind zwischen Geschäftszonen, in denen eine Vielzahl von Unternehmen betrieben werden, scheinbar zufällig verteilt. Einige dieser Unternehmen bestehen aus Büros, während andere verschiedene Geschäfte, Restaurants und Stätten der Unterhaltung sind. Es mangelt es nicht an neuen Restaurants, an denen man essen gehen kann, oder Geschäften, in denen man einkaufen kann. Während einige Geschäfte große, bekannte Marken sind, die von großen Konzernen gehalten werden, sind auch kleine Boutiquen immer beliebter. Sie sind nicht nur in verschiedenen Einkaufszentren zu finden, sondern auch in der Nähe der Straßen, die oft in Gehdistanz von Nachbarschaften liegen, die ansonsten ruhig und idyllisch wären, wenn sie nicht von so vielen Sehenswürdigkeiten umgeben wären. Es gibt auch ein paar nahegelegene Parks, und ich habe bemerkt, dass die Leute diese Parks mit ihren kleinen Kindern besuchen. Eines der Menschen spricht mich an: tatsächlich gibt es in meiner Nachbarschaft eine erhebliche Vielfalt. In einem kleinen Gebiet haben wir eine einflussreiche LGBTQ+-Community, eine orthodox-jüdische Gemeinde und eine Sammlung von Flüchtlingen und Einwanderern aus der ehemaligen Sowjetunion. Ein bisschen weiter außerhalb meiner Nachbarschaft gibt es viele weitere Menschen verschiedener Rassen und Herkunft, obwohl sie manchmal in ihre eigenen kleinen Gemeinschaften innerhalb der Stadt getrennt sind. Wir haben Orte wie Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia und viele mehr, die nur ein paar Meilen entfernt sind. Allerdings kann eine Entfernung von nur 10 Meilen manchmal zwei Stunden dauern, vor allem im Verkehr, besonders während der Rushhour. Während es einige Orte von Interesse gibt, die unweigerlich in der Nähe liegen, ist die Stadt riesig, und die Leute bevorzugen es nicht, zu Fuß zu gehen. Als Ergebnis haben wir auch einige der schlimmsten Verkehrssituationen der Welt und es ist schwierig, Parkplätze überall zu finden. Ironischerweise gab es in den letzten Jahren ein großes Bauprojekt, da große Wohngebäude zur Stadt hinzugefügt wurden. Es scheint ein beliebtes Ziel zu sein, aber viele Bewohner sind enttäuscht von der Aussicht, dass noch mehr Menschen einziehen und noch mehr Fahrzeuge auf den Straßen unterwegs sind. Es gibt viele verschiedene Arten von Häusern in meiner Stadt. Nicht jeder lebt oder möchte in einem großen Wohngebäude. Wohngebiete bestehen aus Häusern unterschiedlicher Größe und kleineren Appartementgebäuden und Konominien. Einige Eigentümer besitzen Einfamilienhäuser, während andere Doppelhäuser beinhalten. Das gilt auch innerhalb meiner Nachbarschaft, also gibt es auch in Bezug auf Wohnmöglichkeiten keine Mangel an Vielfalt. Ähnlich verhält es sich auch mit den Altersgruppen der Nachbarn, und um ehrlich zu sein, bin ich mir nicht sicher, wie die meisten meiner Nachbarn heißen. Es ist nicht wirklich eine enge Gemeinschaft mehr, obwohl ich viele Erinnerungen aus meiner Kindheit habe, wenn ich draußen mit meinem Nachbarn aus nächster Nähe spielte und ein paar weiteren Freunden aus der Nachbarschaft, die alle in meiner Nähe waren.\n\nEnglish translation:\n\n[REWRITE] Living in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse.

Die öffentliche Schule, die fast 90 Jahre alt ist, steht immer noch, scheint den Jugendlichen der heutigen Zeit Zukunft vorzuschweben, während sie bei den älteren Bewohnern Nostalgie weckt. Die Kirchen sind selten und weit auseinander, meist leer, aber die Basketballplätze sind immer noch voll. Alle Häuser sehen anders aus, fühlen sich aber gleich. Es gibt einen großen Supermarkt namens \"Super A\", der von einer großen Familie Yemni besitzt, die wahrscheinlich die einzige arabischen Familie in der Nachbarschaft ist.

Zumindest nicht Orte, die die meisten Menschen leben möchten. Aber wenn man hinter dem alten, verlassenen Whole Foods geht und dann hinter den Hotels geht, die nur im Laufe eines Jahres außerhalb der Sommerzeit für Familienfeiern bewohnt sind, findet man eine aufgeheizte Gemeinschaft. In diesen Gemeinschaften, auf diesen Straßen, gibt es ein paar Apartmentkomplexe – nebeneinander stehen sie, wie russische Puppen, die sorgfältig, sorgfältig auseinandergezogen und nebeneinander aufgereiht sind, Stück für Stück. Die ersten Wohnungen, die man findet, sind jene, die im Fernsehen für einige unangenehme Geschäfte bekannt sind, also werden wir uns nicht allzu sehr damit beschäftigen – wie man weiß, können Erscheinungen täuschen. Aber die Wohnungen neben diesem Komplex, und die beiden Komplexe neben jenen, sind ein ganz anderes Universum, von dem fast niemand in dieser Gegend weiß. Gegenüber jenen Komplexen steht ein Campus einer Gemeinschaftsschule - ein ruhiges, schläfriges Ensemble von Gebäuden, die Wache halten, wo Studenten mit Kaffee in der Hand herumtrödeln und sich um 7 Uhr morgens rühren, um ihre schläfrigen Tage zu beginnen. Die eisernen Torflügel creaken auf, um sie einzulassen, während die Pendler ihr Fenster aufreißen und sie beschweren, dass sie den Verkehr aufhält, wenn die Schülerzahl höher ist. Die Straße schneidet in eine andere Wohnstraße ein, mit einem Park auf einer Seite und einem Rehabilitationseinrichtung für Leute, die aus unglücklichen Umständen Knochen gebrochen haben. Die Behandlungsstätte ist mit liegenden Esstischen und einem wellenförmigen Ventilator ausgestattet, der die warme, dicke Sommersonne umherwirbelt. Kinder laufen auf dem Rasen im Park hin und her, hüpfen und drehten sich auf den spitzigen, grünen Stängeln, während Bienen in den Blumenbeeten neben der Straße faulenzen. Alte Rentner gehen mit ihren Hunden auf dem Spazierweg, verziehen sich über die Teenager auf ihren Skateboards und nickten höflich den Teenagern zu, die sich um das Spielplatzgerät gesammelt haben, um über Jungs und die neuesten YouTube-Sensationen zu plaudern. Es gibt ein Sushi-Restaurant in einem Einkaufszentrum neben dem Park, wo man billige Essen bekommt, aber nie zu sehr beschäftigt ist – ein Schwimmsportgeschäft direkt neben jener, und eine Nagelschönheitssauna, eingebettet zwischen. Man könnte die Schwimmbad für die Saison füllen, während man sich die Fingernägel macht und Hachimakichicken isst, alles auf einmal – die Schönheit eines Einkaufszentrums. Es gibt auch ein gefrorenes Joghurtscafé dort, eines der Art, bei der man selbst machen kann, und man sieht oft die Teenager im Park, die kalte, schweißende Joghurtbecher, die mit Zutaten überhäuft sind, während sie Stunts auf ihren Skateboards und Vape-Pfeifen machen, weil sie das cool finden.

She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",

    "raw_output": "Here is the translation of the text to German:\n\n\"Wo ist alles?\" fragte sie, wobei wir vorbei an den Maisfeldern fuhren, die den Horizont füllten. \"Das ist es!\" sagte ich, wissend, dass sie von der Wüstenhaftigkeit der offenen Landschaft schockiert sein würde. Sie war aus einer Stadt, in der das Einkaufszentrum nur ein 5-minütiger Spaziergang von ihrem Haus entfernt war – sie hatte noch nie so viel offenes Gelände in ihrem Leben gesehen. Durch die Allgegenwart der Maisfelder zurückgehalten, teilte ich ihr mit, was es bedeutete, in ländlichen Ohio aufzuwachsen, und in diesem Moment wusste sie schließlich, wer ich war und woher ich kam. Autofuhren auf einer zwei-spurigen Landstraße, kommen wir an einem Steinbruch vorbei, der mit Wasser gefüllt ist. Etwas weiter, ist das kleine Wohngebiet, in dem ich lebe. Die Häuser sind hauptsächlich aus Backsteinen und Stucco. In den meisten Häusern hat jeder mindestens eine halbe Acre Land für sich, das jeder mit Stolz pflegt. Im Frühling ist der jährliche Anbau von Blumen und die mittelwestlichen Bäume, die sich mit jeder Saison ändern, reichlich vorhanden. Die Einfahrten sind alle mit den höchsten End- Mercedes Benz-Luxuswagen gefüllt, die im Mittagssonnenschein nach einem guten, alten Waschanlass glänzen. Weiter auf der Straße, Richtung meinem grauen Stucco-Haus, ist mein koreanischer Nachbar immer draußen mit einem freundlichen Gesicht. Er verbringt den ganzen Tag damit, seine Wiese zu mähen und kann über den Summton seiner Mähmaschine hingehört werden. Jeder im Nachbarschaft lacht über ihn, aber er ist immer ehrlich und ein unglaublicher Mensch mit einer einzigartigen Geschichte. Er ist älter geworden und hat etwas von seinem Witz verloren, wie er mit dem Alter geworden ist. In seiner Vergangenheit war er Arzt und mischt sich normalerweise mit dem Gras und seiner John-Deer-Zero-Turn-Mähmaschine. Schließlich erreichen wir mein Zuhause. Im Seitenhof gibt es Krähen, die von unserem Terrier verfolgt werden. Im Hinterhof gibt es einen kleinen Bach, der in den Steinbruch fliesst. Hier kann man die Bullfrosche hören, den Bach und das gelegentliche \"Mü\" der nahe gelegenen Farmen hören. Auf der handgefertigten Holzbrücke ist ein unberührter Paradiesgarten, der mit natürlich wachsenden Bäumen, Kräutern und Wildblumen gefüllt ist. Hier verbrachte ich den größten Teil meiner Kindheit. Von Bauten von Baumhäusern bis hin zu \"Jagden\" auf Tiere (was meistens darin bestand, sie zu jagen), gab es immer etwas zu tun und normalerweise ein Nachbarschaftskind für die Freundschaft. Die Winter in meinem kleinen Städtchen können grausam sein, doch es gibt nichts Schöneres. Der Hof verwandelt sich von einem Grünsee in eine leere Wildnis. Die Bäume, die einst bunte rosa, violette und orangelbe Blüten getragen haben, sind nun kahle Skelette aus Rinde. Wenn man mit dem gelegentlichen Schneefall begünstigt wird, erscheint ein Winterwunderland über Nacht. Der Garten ist von Schneemannen und Schneefiguren meiner kleinen Schwester gespickt. Mein Schwester und ich stritten sich oft als Kinder, und in den Wintermonaten waren unsere Schneebälle unsere Waffe der Wahl. Wir bauten riesige Schneeeislands wie Bauten, normalerweise mit Zweigen, wie ein Arsenal. In unserem eigenen kleinen Wunderland spielten wir Fantasy-Spiele in einer Zeit, in der nichts anderes zählte. Wir waren nur junge Kinder ohne Sorgen.\n\nHere is the translation back to English:\n\n[REWRITE]Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past the cornfields which filled the horizon. \"This is it!\" I said, knowing she'd be taken aback by the vastness of the open landscape. She was from a town where the shopping center was a 5-minute walk from her house – she had never seen so much open space in her life. Taken aback by the ubiquity of cornfields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you'll reach a quarry that's filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly made of brick and stucco. Most of the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves, which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annual flowers and midwestern trees that change with every season are abundant. The driveways are all filled with high-end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash.

To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time.

    "raw_output": "German translation of the given text:\n\nPortland, Oregon ist das erste, was man über Portland, Oregon verstehen muss, ist die Definition von \"seltsam\". Der unoffizielle Stadt-Traum, auf dem Rücken eines Gebäudes, das als Pizzeria, Bar, Musiklokal, Strip-Club und mindestens auf der Hälfte dieser Unternehmungen am Rande des Gesetzes operiert, ist \"Portland bleibt seltsam\". Für manche ist dies ein kleiner Schrei, um an die Portland der 90er und frühen 2000er Jahre zu erinnern, ein Portland, das weniger bekannt und weniger teuer war, und dabei eine Vielzahl von kreativen und einzigartigen Untergruppen aufkommen ließ. Für andere ist es ein lockender Aufruf - komme nach Portland, wo Menschen dich immer noch als seltsam bezeichnen werden, diesmal aber als Kompliment. Trotz der Einwanderung von wohlhabenden Kaliforniern und der ständigen Bauaktivitäten von Wohnhäusern für diese Kalifornier, ist Portland immer noch seltsam. Seltsam bedeutet nicht immer akzeptierend, aber es bedeutet akzeptierend von Dingen, die normalerweise nicht akzeptiert werden. Seltsam bedeutet nicht, dass wir keine modernen Annehmlichkeiten und modernen Kampagnen haben. Wie der Rest der USA kaufen wir fast alles aus China. Es gibt eine Million Möglichkeiten, seltsam zu sein, von nicht normal zu sein, aber Portland hat genügend Normalität. Portland hat Yoga, Hipster und Geschäftsleute. Vielleicht bedeutet seltsam, dass wir einfach alles weniger ernst nehmen. In meinem Viertel, wie in vielen Portland-Vierteln, haben wir bunte Häuser, Gärten mit Blumen und Kräutern und Gemüse entlang der Straßen und kostenlose Kisten im Sommer. Kostenlose Kisten sind traditionell Kartons, die mit Dingen gefüllt sind, die jemand loswerden will, aber sie können auch Plastiktüten oder Kisten sein. Sie enthalten etwas Magisches, ein Schatz, der genau für den Passanten perfekt ist, ein überraschendes Mal. Kostenlose Kisten haben meist Kleidung und Bücher, aber sie können alles enthalten. Das magische Potential, durch ein Viertel im Südosten Portlands zu wandern, ist das, was Portland alles über sich selbst ausmacht, das heißt, was Portland alles über sich selbst ausmacht, wie ich es sehe, aber ich bin nur eine von Tausenden von seltsamen Personen. Einige Menschen, mit denen ich zusammenlebe, würden nie träumen, ihre Kleidung aus einer Kiste auf der Straße zu nehmen. Diese Menschen gehen zu Goat Yoga (ja, Yoga mit lebenden Ziegen) oder zu Timbers-Spielen (der Fußballverein der Stadt). Portland ist voller Menschen, die alles mögliche lieben. Portland ist voller Menschen, die unsere Träume verfolgen oder davon träumen, unsere Träume zu verfolgen, während sie zu viel Zeit im Bar spendieren. Ja, Portland hat ein Drogenproblem. Drogenprobleme haben (aufgrund ihrer Wurzel) meistens psychische Gesundheitsprobleme, und die ständigen Regenfälle über weiten Teilen des Jahres sowie die dämmrigen Wolken scheinen dabei beizutragen. Portland hat auch ein Obdachlosenproblem, das niemand weiß, was man damit machen soll. Die Obdachlosen werden von den Sozialservices Portlands angezogen, die besser sind als in der Mehrheit der Vereinigten Staaten, aber unsere Dienste sind unzureichend, wie in der gesamten Vereinigten Staaten. Die nicht-obdachlosen Bevölkerung schwankt zwischen Mitleid und Hass. In diesem Punkt sind wir gar nicht seltsam.\n\nEnglish translation of the German version of the text is:\n\n[REWRITE]Portland, Oregon is the first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon - the definition of \"weird\".

Ob ich mich nun um sie kümmere oder so sehr mit Arbeit und Leben beschäftigt bin, dass ich sie nicht bemerke, sie sind immer da, unerschütterlich, unangreifbar und unbeeindruckt von den Widrigkeiten des Lebens. Dann an den Tagen, wenn ich am most gestresst und verletzlich bin, verlangen sie, gesehen zu werden, und wenn ich mich ihnen zuwende, lasse sie mich meine angstvolle Seele ausruhen und leihen mir die Kraft, weiter zu gehen, Tag für Tag. Ich bin hierher gezogen, als ich mein Studium begonnen habe, und die Berge nördlich des Campus, wo mich zuerst fesselten. Sicher, die Universität hat auch ihre eigenen atemberaubenden Anblicke in Gebäuden, Seen und Bäumen, die auch ihren eigenen Teil meines Herzens haben, aber es sind die Berge, die wirklich ihren Thron halten. Der Rest der Stadt ist in seinem Recht schön. Es gibt zahlreiche Cafes, die zu vielen Stunden von Kaffee-energiertem Notlernen wurden. Man kann zu Fuß gehen oder den Bus nehmen und ein bisschen weiter nach unten in den Innenstadtbereich fahren und in eine Aura der Antiquität von den abgefärbten Backsteinen umgeben werden, die Restaurants und Bürogebäude einfassen. Es ist hier, dass diese scheinbar suburbane Stadt so viel Betrieb und Energie wie ihre benachbarte Stadt zeigt. Dies hält jedoch nicht über viele Blöcke hinaus, da man sich, einmal wieder, in die ruhige Kleinstadt entführen kann, indem man die Bibliothek passiert. Diese Doppeldeutigkeit der Atmosphäre in solcher Nähe gibt dieser Stadt einen wunderbaren Charakter, als würde sie auffordern, erkundet zu werden. Mit diesem, ist es leicht, viele geliebte Erinnerungen zu schaffen, jede mit einem gewissen Teil der Stadt verbunden. Ob es darum geht, an den verrosteten Schaukeln im Park nach einem Vollnacht zu gehen oder durch den bunt belebten Innenstadtbereich zu laufen, um den Film im fancy Theater zu sehen, für das die Universität Tickets zur Verfügung gestellt hat. Gott sei Dank ist es auch Zuhause vieler harten Erinnerungen, wie alle Orte in dem Leben. Die Seen, insbesondere, können eine eher passende Stelle für Reflexionen, sowie für Tränenstunden in der Mitte der Mittagsstunde in einer existenziellen Krise sein. Die letztere, von denen ich mehr Erfahrung habe. Beim Beobachten der Schildkröten, Enten und Insekten beim Leben ihrer Leben, jeder mit einer gewissen Beitrags- oder Rolle, konnte ich mich nicht umhin, mich über meinen eigenen Sinn fürs Leben zu wundern, während ich mich in dieser Mysterium genannten des Lebens zu navigieren versuchte. Also ging ich am See vorbei, und am Park und den kleinen Häusern, die von Suburbanen schreien, bis ich einen Hauptstraße erreichte. Es war dann, dass die Sonne ihre strahlenden Strahlen auf die Palmbäume warf, die Himmel entlang kolorierte und als ich aufsah, realisierte ich, dass ich nach Norden ging. Sicher genug, sie waren da, wie sie es immer waren. Die robusten überwältigenden Berge rieben sich an dem hazy blauen und gelben Himmel mehr als irgendein Gebäude im Horizont, und als ob sie ohne Worte sprächen, rührten sie in mir meinen Sinn von Beharrlichkeit an.\n\n[REWRITE] The mountains are always there.

The sturdy overpowering mountains stroked the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.",

Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket.

Die öffentliche Verkehrsmittel sind sehr zugänglich und gehören zu den beliebtesten Transportmitteln in New York City. Bensonhurst ist ein relativ städtisches Viertel, sodass Sie sich immer noch so fühlen wie in New York City. Bei Ihrem Besuch bereiten Sie sich darauf vor, die verschiedenen asiatischen Läden in der Umgebung zu sehen. Im Laufe der letzten zwei Jahrzehnte ist Bensonhurst eine große Zahl von asiatischen Einwohnern aufgenommen. Deshalb sehen Sie ein asiatisches Geschäft auf jeden Block hin und wieder, wenn Sie zu Fuß gehen. Die beliebtesten sind Supermärkte und Wäschereien. Zufällig sind diese Geschäfte sehr beliebt unter den Einwohnern, da Qualität der Lebensmittel im Supermarkt hervorragend ist, die Preise sind viel günstiger und schließlich ist es sehr bequem. In meiner Nähe gibt es vier asiatische Supermärkte innerhalb von zwei Minuten zu Fuß von einander entfernt. Das fügt sich einfach zu der Bequemlichkeit hinzu, Lebensmittel zu haben. Ich sage nicht, dass Bensonhurst ausschließlich von asiatischen Einwohnern bewohnt ist, obwohl. Es ist in der Umgebung sehr vielfältig, mit Einwanderern und ihren ersten- und zweiten-amerikanischen Kindern hier. Die meisten der großen und beliebten Geschäfte in der lokalen Gegend sind asiatisch besitzt. Neben diesen asiatisch besitzt Geschäften gibt es auch einen kürzlich sanierten Park in der Nähe, der etwa zehn Basketballplätze, einen großen Feld für Fußball oder Baseball, vier Handballplätze, Schaukeln, ein Spielplatz für Kinder und sogar eine Wasserspiel für Kinder hat, die in der Sommersaison Wasser genießen können. Da wir uns in New York City befinden, natürlich sind die Parks sehr vielfältig. Sie sehen alle Arten von Vielfalt hier, die sich gut miteinander vertragen. In diesem Viertel gibt es nicht viele große Unternehmen. Die einzigen Gebäude, die Sie finden, sind solche für Kooperative Wohnungen oder Eigentumswohnungen. Die meisten der Wohnungen hier sind jedoch Zweifamilienhäuser. Die meisten Leute sind jedoch sehr nett, jedoch sehr laut. Jeden Tag hören Sie, wie Autos Musik lauten lassen, wenn sie an Ihrem Haus vorbeifahren, oder ständig den Gaspedal vollgas geben, was Sie morgens wach werden lässt. Wenn Sie während der Nachtzeit kommen, sollten Sie auf der Hut sein. Dieses Viertel ist recht sicher, aber Menschen sind unvorhersehbar. Sie können mit Menschen zusammenlaufen, die Probleme anfangen wollen, ohne einen Grund, Bullen und Diebe. Ich selbst wurde in diesem Viertel in der Vergangenheit körperlich angegriffen, aber das war viele Jahre her. Ein weiterer jüngerer Vorfall betraf das Stehlen von Paketen. Auch wenn es ein gängiges Ding ist, gibt es in diesem Viertel Paketdiebe. Zuletzt jedoch, obwohl New York City eine Geldstrafe für Menschen hat, die nicht nach ihrem Hund knuddeln, tun Leute das hier nicht. Jeden Morgen sehen Sie mindestens einen Hundehaufen auf Ihrem Weg zur Bahnstation oder auf Ihrem Weg zum Supermarkt. Meine größte Tick ist das Stellen von Hundehäufen überall, wo ich in diesem Viertel hingehe. Seien Sie vorsichtig und halten Sie Ihre Schuhe sauber!\n\nEnglish translation:\n\n[REWRITE] If you're planning a visit to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you won't have trouble finding it!

There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings.

Die Leute nennen es den \"Fitness-Hügel\" weil viele Jogger ihn zu ihren täglichen Trainingsläufen nehmen. Da es in meiner Straße überhaupt keine Gehsteige gibt, gehen alle auf der Straße. Die Straße ist an einigen Stellen zerfurcht und kann gefährlich zu fahren sein. Die Telefon- und Stromleitungen, die um den Block herum gespannt sind, sehen ziemlich zerrissen aus. Es regnet und stürmt oft in unserer Gegend, also fallen Zweige und anderes Treibgut oft auf die Stromleitungen und die ständigen Reparaturen machen sie aussehen wie ein Scheckerpapier. Überall um mich herum gibt es viele hohe Nadelbäume. Aber die Leute hier hassten die Bäume. Sie bemühen sich, so viele wie möglich zu fällen, weil die Bäume den Blick aufs Meer behindern. Deshalb werden viele Häuser so hoch auf dem Hügel gebaut, mit riesigen Glasfronten in den Obergeschossen, die sich hintereinander erheben, um den Blick auf die Bucht zu haben. Es ist um die Sonnenuntergang herum wunderschön, wenn das Wasser von unten beleuchtet wird und der Himmel orange wird. Es ist oft bewölkt, also sieht man den größten Teil der Sonne durch den Nebel. Die meisten Tage sind bedeckt und feucht. Moos wächst überall, wo es können: auf Dächern, Autos und Geländern. Ich habe einmal mein Auto einen Monat lang im Freien gelassen und als ich es dann benutzen wollte, war es grün und moosbewachsen. Es hat mich drei Stunden gekostet, es alle abzuschmirgeln. Es gibt nicht viele Kinder in meiner Nachbarschaft, obwohl es nur ein paar Blocks von hier entfernt eine Schule gibt. Die meisten Menschen in meinem Viertel sind älter, viele von ihnen sind pensioniert. Anstatt Kinder haben die Leute Hunde. Es ist üblich, sie in den Vorgärten sitzen zu sehen oder sie rennen durch die Straße, gefolgt von einem anderen. Wenn du die Tür oder das Fenster offen lässt, riskierst du, dass sie in dein Haus schlüpfen. Ich habe mal einen in meinem Wohnzimmer gefunden und musste ihn wieder vor die Tür jagen. Hasen laufen wild durch die Gegend. Einige von ihnen sind groß, und die Gärtner hassten sie, weil sie die Wurzeln der Pflanzen aufgraben und sich in die Vorgärten der Leute einbuddeln. Meine Katzen lieben sie jedoch und haben die meisten von ihnen aus unserem Viertel vertrieben. Wir bekommen auch die übliche Auswahl an Vögeln: Spatzen und Hummeln, und hin und wieder taucht ein Habicht oder Adler auf, bis die Nachbarschaftkrähen ihn verjagen. Es gibt keine Läden in der Nähe, aber wenn du den Hügel hinab zum Wasser fährst, gibt es ein paar Restaurants, die frische Meeresfrüchte servieren. Es gibt nicht viel Strand, aber die Felsen am Ufer sind spaßig, um sie in das Wasser zu werfen. Die Bucht selbst ist nicht sehr breit.

People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year.

Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",

Wenn man nicht schon einmal erlebt hat, wie es ist, hier zu leben, versteht man es wahrscheinlich nicht richtig, wenn man immer nur braune Farbe sieht. Wenn man ein Gras sieht, weiß man, dass die Person, die es gepflegt hat, eine Menge Geld dafür ausgegeben hat. Als ich hier in den 90ern lebte, waren die Häuser weit auseinander verteilt. Heute ist es fast gleich, aber es gibt jetzt viele neue Gebäude. Ehrlich gesagt, sieht mein Viertel immer mehr wie eine Stadt aus, aber ich denke, dass es nicht nur hier so ist. Die meisten Orte ändern sich so. Die meisten Leute hier sind sehr freundlich, aber wie auch in jeder Stadt gibt es gute und schlechte Seiten. In meinem Viertel bin ich umgeben von freundlichen alten Leuten. Ich denke, es ist ein hübsches Viertel. Die Geschäfte in diesem Ort sind fast nur Ketten wie Food 4 Less und Smart & Final. Wenn Sie ein Lebensmittelgroßmarkt möchten, müssen Sie weit reisen. Ich sehe nie ganze Lebensmittelgeschäfte oder Geschäfte dieser Art. Die Arbeitsplätze, die in meiner Stadt am häufigsten vorkommen, würden ich sagen, sind keine offiziellen Demografien, sondern Bau. Ich denke, das liegt daran, dass diese Stadt immer noch nicht sehr entwickelt ist und es noch viele offene Flächen gibt, auf denen man bauen kann. Das lässt mich ein bisschen Angst, ich mag es, wie es jetzt ist. Ich bin aus einer großen Stadt weggezogen und ich bin nicht sehr gespannt darauf zurückzukehren. Wenn es um Bau geht, ist mein Arbeitsplatz in einem anderen Feld, ich bin ein Trockenbauspezialist und -installateur. Was ich an meinem Zuhause mag, sind die verschiedenen Tiere. Viele Menschen kommen in das Hochebene für viele Gründe, nicht zuletzt für die starke Schönheit der Wüste selbst. Die Hochebenen-Klima und -Topographie haben herausfordernde Ökosysteme geschaffen, die geschützt werden müssen und auf denen verschiedene Arten von Wildtieren leben. Die menschlichen Bewohner der Hochebene sollten sich die Zeit nehmen, um mehr über die nicht-menschlichen Bewohner in diesem Umfeld zu lernen, um sicher und harmonisch miteinander zu leben. Meine Familie und ich haben uns sehr gut an die Wildtiere gewöhnt. Ich habe drei Kinder und sie sind alle fasziniert von Eidechsen und Wüsteninsekten, während ich dies schreibe, sind sie draußen, um verschiedene Exemplare zu fangen. Was die Sehenswürdigkeiten angeht, haben wir einige. Victorville ist auch ein gutes Ort für Familien, um die Wüste zu erleben. Es kann einen anderen Erfahrung gewähren. Wenn Sie können, planen Sie Ihren Besuch so, dass Sie mit dem jährlichen Ereignis der San Bernardino County Fair zusammenfallen. Die Messe wird Ihren Besuch mit dem richtigen Mix aus Aktivitäten und Spaß erweitern. Besuchen Sie auch das Wrightwood in der Nähe, um die Schneebedeckten Berge zu sehen und nehmen Sie Wintersport-Kurse, um Ihren Besuch abzuschließen. Interessieren Sie sich für die Naturgeschichte und Kultur der Hochebenenökosysteme? Das Victor Valley Museum enthält geologische und paläontologische Sammlungen, Artefakte der Ureinwohner und historische Gegenstände, die die Entwicklung der Gesellschaft und der Industrie von Victorville erzählen.\n\nTranslation from German to English:\n\n[REWRITE] My neighborhood is located in the middle of the high desert, where it's only dirt, dirt, and even more dirt.

There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor.

Während andere, die auf diese Frage antworten, wahrscheinlich Eigentümer mit ihren eigenen individuellen Leben sind, ist meine Situation ein bisschen anders. Ich betrachte meine Nachbarschaft als den College-Campus, auf dem ich wohne, und die Menschen, die in meinem Studentenheim wohnen, als meine Gemeinschaft. Ich betrachte auch den umliegenden Campus als meine Nachbarschaft, in gewisser Weise jedoch weniger stark. Trotz dieser Besonderheit teilt meine Nachbarschaft einige Gemeinsamkeiten mit den konventionellen Ideen über eine Nachbarschaft. Wie jede konventionelle Nachbarschaft, die ich wohne, hat meine Nachbarschaft Häuser, Menschen, Läden und Parks. Lassen Sie uns damit beginnen, die 'Häuser' zu diskutieren, die meine Nachbarschaft ausmachen. Bevor ich mich auf die Häuser in meiner Nachbarschaft einlassen, sollte ich die Arten von Häusern, die in meiner Umgebung vorfinden, klarstellen. Es gibt drei Arten von Wohnungen in meiner unmittelbaren Nähe: die Wohnungen, die tatsächlichen Häuser und die Studentenheime. Zunächst gibt es in den Wohnungen in der Regel zwischen 2-4 Personen in jedem Raum, und es gibt etwa 4-6 Räume auf jeder Etage. Das am häufigsten vorkommende Gebäudetypus kann etwa 2 Etagen beherbergen, sodass durchschnittlich etwa 20 Personen in jedem Gebäude leben. Zweitens sind die tatsächlichen Häuser, die für jeden mit einer Verbindung zur Schule vermietet werden können. Typischerweise sind diese 2-4-Zimmer-Anlagen, die normalerweise Alumni beherbergen. Es gibt jedoch nur eine Handvoll dieser Arten von Häusern im gesamten Bezirk, da sie weniger effizient sind. Schließlich gibt es die typischen Studentenzimmer, die Hunderte von Studenten beherbergen. In diesen teilen sich zwei Personen einen Raum, mit Ausnahmen, und es ist der häufigste Arten von Unterkunft in meiner Nachbarschaft. Mit der Wohnraumfrage sind wir bereit, zu den Menschen überzugehen. Meine Schule schwärmt von Vielfalt und dies spiegelt sich in der Zusammensetzung meiner Nachbarschaft wider. In meiner Nachbarschaft leben Menschen aller Kulturen und Altersgruppen. Die meisten Fachkräfte wohnen in den Häusern, die im Bezirk platziert sind, während die neuen Studenten in der Studentenhausverwaltung und die älteren Studenten in der Appartments verweilen. Die Menschen in dieser Nachbarschaft können nicht durch einfaches Reden gerecht werden, also wäre es am besten, einfach auf die Läden und Parks in meiner Nachbarschaft zuzugehen. Da meine Schule tatsächlich eine eigene selbstständige Nachbarschaft ist, hat sie eine Vielzahl von Läden und einen einzigen Park. Die Läden sind eine Mischung aus Essen, die in jeder anderen Nachbarschaft zu finden sind, und der eigenen Marke der Schule von Kleidung und Lebensmittelläden. Daher kann alles, was man benötigt, innerhalb der Grenzen meiner Nachbarschafts gefunden werden! Darüber hinaus ist der Park in meiner Nachbarschaft ein Spielplatz für alle Vielfalt der Menschen in meiner Nachbarschaft, er wird sauber und frei von Kriminalität durch alle Mitglieder meiner Nachbarschaft gehalten!\n\nEnglish translation:\n\n[REWRITE]When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique.

Ich kam aus Riverdale nach Stockbridge und ich muss sagen, ich weinte, weil ich sie vermisste und sie liebte... aber meine Mutter und mein Vater wollten das Beste für mich und meine kleine Schwester, also zogen wir in ein besseres Viertel mit besserer Unterkunft, einem besseren Gymnasium, alles wurde als \"nicht ghetto\" angesehen, als wir in unser neues Viertel zogen. Im Laufe der Jahre kam ich daran gewöhnt und machte einige neue Freunde und auch einige Feinde in der Schule. Ich habe mich nie wirklich mit meinen Nachbarn auskennt, abgesehen von Herrn Glen und seinen Kindern sowie Dennis für ein bisschen, da beide direkt neben uns wohnen. Sie waren angenehme Menschen, die ich fast als Familie betrachten kann und ich schätze sie wirklich. Ich erinnere mich, als ich, meine Mutter, mein Vater und meine Schwester zu Herrn Glems Hochzeit gingen (Sie heirateten sich wieder) Es war wirklich lustig und angenehm, um es so auszudrücken, und etwas, auf das ich mich einmal freue, wenn ich mein Vermögen aufbaue und meiner zukünftigen Frau ein Leben wie eine Königin geben werde. Als Herr Glen seine Frau, Frau Veda, den weißen kleinen Riemen von ihrem Bein nahm und ihn wegworfen hat, habe ich ihn gefangen! Leider habe ich die Blumen nicht gefangen! Wir tanzten die ganze Nacht weg und ich hatte wirklich Spaß, Marsharii, einer ihrer Töchter, zu treffen. Ich habe sie aber nicht mehr gesehen. Ich hoffe, sie ist aufgestiegen und geht es besser. Das Viertel selbst ist wie ein Labyrinth, obwohl ich jetzt eine GPS habe, so kann ich mich mehr Zeit nehmen, es zu erkunden. Ich bin nur so weit gegangen, und das ist, wenn ich mit meinen Freunden Kason und Curtis zusammensaß. Wir haben uns früher viel mit Videospielen beschäftigt und einfach das Leben auskosten wie wir konnten. Manchmal ging ich in den Park und genoss die Natur, was mir Seelenfrieden gibt. Es gibt mir ein Gefühl von Ruhe und Frieden in diesen Tagen. Ich bringe auch Holzschläger, die ich von der Heimwerkerfachhandlung gekauft habe und übe meine Balance, und bringe meinen Bokken-Bambus-Schwert mit, wenn ich kann.

Die meisten Gebäude sind Wohnblocks, aber es gibt einige Restaurants und Bars, die man gerne besuchen kann, und sie sind nicht sehr teuer. Einige der Bars wurde neu benannt, und die eine ist teurer, aber das ist nicht der schlechteste Service oder die Qualität der Getränke. Die meisten Menschen sind nett. Entweder sind sie Studenten oder sie haben einen niedrigen Einkommen, da die Wohnungen nicht sehr teuer sind. Es gibt viele Kinder in der Nähe, da eine Grundschule in walking Entfernung von meinem Apartment liegt. Ich kenne meine Nachbarn nicht, aber ich will sie auch nicht. Sie rauchen viel Marihuana und deshalb hat die Verwaltung meines Gebäudes ein Luftrefreshergerät direkt vor ihrer Tür aufgestellt, was mein Freund und ich sehr lustig fanden. Es ist fast beleidigend. Die umliegenden Gebäude sind normalerweise relativ alt aussehend, aber möglicherweise haben sie renovierte Innenräume. Ein Stück die Straße runter gibt es brandneue Apartments, aber ich mag sie nicht, weil ich weiß, dass die Bauarbeiten an ihnen nicht besonders gut waren. Sie sind günstig gebaut, aber die Miete ist teuer, was ich als Betrug empfinde, aber da sie in der Nähe des Campus liegen, können die Verwaltung diese Gebäude davonkommen. Es gibt ein sehr günstiges Restaurant etwa fünf Minuten von meinem Wohnort entfernt, das nur Papierplatten verwendet, um Essen zu servieren, und die meisten Dinge, die sie herstellen, sind im Mikrowellenherd zubereitet. Dann gegenüber liegt ein Tankstellenbetrieb, der nicht sehr gut angeschrieben ist. Aber dank einigen Geldern von der Stadt wurde die Straße letzten Sommer neu asphaltiert, sodass es jetzt einen großen Gehweg, viel Gras auf den Mittelstreifen und an den Straßenrändern gibt, und nun ist der Bereich ein bisschen nett. Aber das Apartmentgebäude, in dem ich wohne, ist von Bäumen umgeben. Sie haben einige von ihnen abgeholzt, also gibt es einige Stümpfe, aber es gibt mehr Bäume, wo ich wohne, als auf der Straße runter. Hinter meinem Apartmentkomplex gibt es einen Baumgraben und dann noch ein weiteres Apartmentgebäude. Ich wohne auf der 42. Straße, aber direkt dahinter liegt die 43. Straße, und die ist nicht so nett. Die Gehwege sind wirklich schlecht und bröckeln auseinander, und die meisten Gebäude auf dieser Straße sehen heruntergekommen aus. Es gibt viele Bäume auf dieser Straße, aber das ist wahrscheinlich, um das Aussehen dieser Gebäude zu verstecken. Die meisten Diebstähle in meinem Bereich sind im Apartmentkomplex auf dieser Straße passiert, aber ich kann sie auch nicht nur schuldig machen. Es gibt Apartments gegenüber von mir, die auch eine Menge Kriminalität und eine eher wandelnde Bevölkerung haben. Aber ich denke, ich mag, wo ich wohne. Ich kann es mir leisten und es gibt viele nützliche Einrichtungen in der Nähe. Ich mag besonders, dass die Universität in walking Entfernung ist und es gibt zwei Bushaltestellen, damit ich zum Laden und in die Innenstadt leicht kommen kann.\n\nGerman to English translation:\n\n[REWRITE] My neighborhood is near the college that I attend, and because of that I really like living there.

The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",

Sie stehen abwechselnd und sind so angeordnet, dass sie wie Einzelhäuser aussehen. Die einzige Unterschied ist, dass sie alle gelb gestrichen sind, mit weißen Veranden und grünen Metalldächern. Fast alle, aber nicht alle, sind miteinander befreundet. Wir stehen am Ende eines nicht vorgeschlagenen Weges manchmal abends und plaudern, während die kleinen Kinder des Viertels mit ihren Spielsachen, Farben auf dem Gehweg oder ihrem Flugzeug spielen. Es ist sehr erfrischend in dieser modernen Welt, die sich immer mehr der Technik und Computern verdankt. Es ist fast so, als ob man zurück in der Zeit geht. Wir sind umgeben von Feldern und Bäumen, die durch blaue Himmel und weiße Wolken noch hervorgehoben werden. Die einzige Abweisung ist, dass wir in dieser Saison Tornado-Warnungen erleben und zum ersten Mal gestern Nacht tatsächlich das Sirenen der Tornados hörten und mussten uns in den Unterstand begeben. Sicherlich hättest du mich in meiner Badewanne gefunden, wobei ich mit meinem kleinsten Hund, meiner Handtasche und ein paar Kissen klammere. Mein großer Hund wollte nichts mit der Toilette zu tun haben und blieb in der Wohnzimmer, war nervös und bellar-te, nervös wegen der ungewöhnlichen Umstände. Das Viertel war still, außer dem Geräusch des Hagels, der überall auf dem Boden fiel. Nach dem Sturm war die Straße fast schäumend von der Temperaturänderung. Wir gingen von 92 auf 75 in ein paar Minuten. Der Hagel schmolz augenblicklich, als er auf die heiße Straße traf. Als ich auf die klarebenden Wolken blickte, kam die Sonne heraus und fing an zu regnen. Ein doppelter Regenbogen erschien. Ich lief ins Haus und nahm meine Kamera. Schnell machte ich ein paar Fotos, um sie mit meinen Facebook-Freunden und meiner Familie zu teilen. Sie waren beeindruckt, so wie ich. Die Straßen blieben für weitere Stunden ruhig, bevor einige Leute schließlich nach Hause kamen von woanders, wo sie waren, als das Gewitter traf. Dann war wieder alles wie immer, Mütter und Kinder draußen, während das Abendessen gare. Ein so freundliches Viertel für diese Frau, die kürzlich von New Hampshire nach North Carolina gezogen ist. Ich liebe die südliche Aussprache, die die Leute sprechen. Ich habe ein Zweizimmer- und Zweibad-Apartment, genau wie alle. Obwohl alle Häuser von außen gleich aussehen, sind nicht alle Apartments innen gleich. Einige sind sogar sehr klein. Das macht keinen Sinn für mich. Ich liebe es, entlang der größten Wiese hinter meinem Haus zu spazieren und mich zum Teich zu schleichen, der nicht zum Baden gedacht ist. Ich habe Rehe gesehen und morgens können Sie das Riesenfrosch sein singen hören. Es ist ein fantastisches Ort, um zu leben, nur vierzig Minuten außerhalb der Stadt von Charlotte. Jeden Morgen begrüßt uns das Geräusch der Krähenten von den umliegenden Farmen. Es ist fast so, als ob man in einem kleinen Dorf lebt. Wir haben sogar einen Esel auf einer nahe gelegenen Farm, der in der Abendzeit brüllt, um uns zu signalisieren, dass er da ist. Ich war glücklich, diesen Schatz eines Viertels gefunden zu haben.\n\nEnglish translation back to English (with slight variations in expression):\n\n[REWRITE] My neighborhood consists of duplexes on a dead-end street.

Es war mir anfangs nicht leicht, Freunde zu finden, aber ich bin schließlich mit jemandem in der Nähe befreundet, der zwei Häuser von mir entfernt wohnt, und einem anderen Jungen, der in meiner Straße wohnt. Keiner von ihnen wohnt dort mehr, aber die Erinnerungen sind noch immer da. Die meisten Leute, die hier lebten, als ich hier ankam, sind immer noch hier. Meine Nachbarschaft ist ziemlich ähnlich wie ein durchschnittliches amerikanisches Vorortviertel. In der Nachbarschaft gibt es viele Zweistöckige Häuser. Jeden Wochenende oder wenn es warm ist, höre ich die Kinder draußen spielen. Die Nachbarschaft ist an den meisten Tagen ruhig. Ich habe nie mit irgendeinem der Menschen in der Nachbarschaft Probleme gehabt. In dieser Nachbarschaft lässt man dich allein, es sei denn, du benötigst Hilfe. Ich habe mehrere Pakete online bestellt und habe noch nie ein Paket vom Vordach meines Hauses klauen sehen. Ich fühle mich in der Lage, meine Nachbarn zu vertrauen. In ein paar Minuten Fußweg von meinem Haus entfernt gibt es einen Park. Ich habe viele Erinnerungen daran. Ich habe dort mit den anderen Jungen in der Nachbarschaft Fußball, Basketball und Baseball gespielt. Ich habe auch einen meiner schlimmsten Erinnerungen dort gemacht, als ich mir beim Fußballspiel eine Nasenblutung zugezogen habe, aber die guten Erinnerungen überwiegen die schlechten. Heutzutage, wenn ich in den Park gehe, ist es, um Zeit mit den Kindern meines Cousins zu verbringen. Sie sind viel jünger als ich und mögen es immer noch, auf Schaukeln und Rutschen zu spielen und so weiter. Nur der Gedanke daran, den Park zu besuchen, macht sie aufgeregt. Der Park macht mich sehr sentimental, weil es viele verschiedene Gründe dafür gibt. Die Nachbarschaft ist sehr vielfältig. Man findet alle Arten von Lebensmitteln in der Nähe. In einem Radius von etwa einem Meilenkilometer kann man chinesische, indische, mexikanische und italienische Restaurants finden. Doch in letzter Zeit verlassen viele Leute ihre Apps, wie GrubHub und DoorDash, um Essen direkt zu ihren Häusern liefern zu lassen. Die bekanntesten Essensplätze sind die Fast-Food-Läden, aber man kann sie in den meisten Vorortvierteln finden. Es gibt auch viele Pizzaplätze. Die Geschäfte hier enthalten alles, was man jemals benötigen würde. Es gibt mehrere Reinigungsläden in der Nähe. Es gibt eine Walgreens und eine CVS auf der gleichen Straße sowie einen Jewel-Osco-Supermarkt, der sehr beliebt im Mittleren Westen ist. Einige der Geschäfte sind sogar vielfältig, da es ein indischer Laden gibt, falls man mal in der Stimmung ist, selbst indisches Essen zu machen oder fertiges indisches Essen zu kaufen.

    "original": "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",

Es fällt nicht auf, indem es sich von anderen in South Carolina unterscheidet, aber es hat einen erheblichen Einfluss auf die Landwirtschaft. Johnston wird als die Weltpeach-Hauptstadt bekannt, was der Ort stolz auf der begrüßenden Schilder besingt. Es besteht hauptsächlich aus landwirtschaftlichen Flächen, die von Erdbeerbäumen oder Rindern dominiert werden. Die Häuser, die nicht in der Hauptteil des Ortes liegen, sind weit voneinander entfernt; die meisten sind zweistöckig mit Metalldächern, um den strahlenden Sommerhitze zu helfen, oder grauen Schindeln. Diese Häuser sind oft nicht in der Nähe der Straße, sondern liegen weiter zurück, um die vorderen Felder für Tiere/Gewächse zu nutzen. Im Hauptteil des Ortes gibt es eine einzige Ampel, die an einer Kreuzung hängt. Hier sind die einzigen Läden des gesamten Ortes zu finden. Es gibt drei Orte, an denen Sie \"Fast Food\" erhalten können: Hong Kong, ein kleines chinesisches Restaurant, das von einer Familie betrieben wird, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant oder Gary's, eine kleine Burgerkette. Es gab einst ein Pizzeria, aber es schloss vor kurzer Zeit. Es gibt ein sehr kleines, von einer Familie betriebenes Apotheken namens Maxwell and Halford Drug; komisch genug, sie sind berühmt für die Cherry Coca-Cola, die sie verkaufen. Es gibt ein kleines, aber teures Supermarkt namens Independent Grocers Alliance, mehr commonly bekannt als IGA. Während es der einzige Supermarkt des gesamten Ortes ist, fahren viele Menschen nur, um ein oder zwei Artikel zu kaufen; die meisten bevorzugen es, in eine Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville zu fahren, um die meisten ihrer Lebensmittel zu kaufen. Der beliebteste Laden im gesamten Dorf ist Dollar General; dieser Laden verkauft eine breite Palette von Alltagsartikeln und ist oft von der Öffnung bis zur Schließung sehr frequentiert! Es gibt ein sehr kleines Möbelgeschäft, Possibilities Furniture & More, das von einer freundlichen Frau betrieben wird, die in der Gemeinschaft bekannt ist. Das Geschäft ist seit Jahren in Johnston und beschäftigt sogar zwei Möbeltransporter, die die gekauften Möbel liefern! An dem Möbelgeschäft befindet sich ein kleines Tierfriseur namens Clark's Cuts and Kennels. Sie bieten eine Vielzahl von Dienstleistungen wie Hundefriseur, Tagesbetreuung, Pensionswohnung, Nagelbearbeitung, Waschung usw. an. Ein Arzt- und ein Tierarztpraxis befindet sich außerhalb des Hauptteils des Ortes; sie sind beide sehr kleine Praxen, aber sehr gut ausgestattet, um den Einwohnern von Johnston zu helfen. Es gibt eine einzige Grundschule namens Johnston Elementary School. Sobald die Schüler den fünften Grad abgeschlossen haben, müssen sie in die nächste Stadt fahren, um Mittelschule und Gymnasium zu besuchen. Es gibt in der Stadt theoretisch keine Parks, aber sie arbeiten gerade an einem 2,5-Acre-Rekreationsgelände, um Familien mehr Möglichkeiten für Ausflüge und Erlebnisse zu bieten und mehr Besucher/Pendler anzuziehen. Zugegeben, es gibt nicht viel zu tun; es gibt keine Kinokinos, Bowlingbahnen, \"Häng-out\"-Orte, Spielplätze für Kinder, Fußgängerzone, große Auswahl an Restaurants oder eine Vielzahl von Restaurants. Trotzdem ist es ein nettes Dorf, so klein, dass Sie es im Flüstern erkennen können, ohne es zu bemerken!\n\nEnglish translation:\n\n[REWRITE] My neighborhood is a small, charming town. It doesn't stand out from others in South Carolina, but it has a significant influence on the agricultural sector. Johnston is known as the World Peach Capital, which the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It primarily consists of farmland dominated by peach trees or cattle. Houses that are not located in the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two-story with either metal roofs to help combat the scorching summer heat or gray shingles. Often, these houses are not located near the road, but are set further back to utilize the front fields for animals or crops.

You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it.

Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York.

Es war ein bisschen überraschend. Fast jedes Apartment in der Gegend kostet über 1.000 Dollar im Monat. Ich hatte nie davon gehört und auch meine Freunde nicht. Vielleicht ist das der Stress. Ich kenne einige meiner Freunde, die sich am Abend ins Bett weinen. Dinge sind teuer, aber wir haben gelernt, sparsam zu sein. Man beginnt, den Staubgeruch von Flohmärkten und konfektionierten Kleidern zu mögen. Man riecht weniger in der Erwachsenenwelt. Man könnte beginnen, zu rauchen, oder man ist einfach zu der Situation gewöhnt. Aber der Flohmarkt behauptet sich immer. Der Geruch der Erwachsenenwelt ist von alten Zeitschriften auf einem geschlossenen Klavier. Er bohrt sich in das Leder und bleibt auch nachdem man sie gewaschen hat. Hier gibt es drei Flohmärkte in Gehweite. Wenn du am weitesten entfernten Beginn startest, kannst du zwei Wohltätigkeits-Flohmarkthändler, eine Bibliothek, einen seltenen Buchladen und einen Kurienschuppen aufsuchen. Die Innenstadt ist dicht besiedelt, Autos und Menschen füllen die Straßen morgens, aber man hört es in den Flohmärkten nicht. Es ist egal, wie viele Leute oder Autos vorbeikommen, die Läden sind still. Es ist ein angenehmer Ort, um einen Nachmittag zu verbringen. Jedes Jahr werden immer mehr Autos und Menschen überflutet. Es ist eine sich entwickelnde Stadt, sagen sie. Sie beherbergt eines der größten Online-Empire für E-Commerce und Lieferungen, sie zeigt noch nachwachsendes Wachstum. Es erinnert mich an New York. Alles und jeder ist auf seine eigenen Ziele fokussiert, und nichts wird von euch verlangt. Man kann allein, still und unabhängig sein, und Leute werden euch in Ruhe lassen. Es ist anders als im Süden, wo man, wenn man ein bisschen besorgt ist, bedeutet das, dass man sich um jemanden kümmert. Man stößt hier nicht in jeden Lebensbereich ein. Man kann seine Schale so lange aufrechterhalten, wie man will, und die Stadt wird wie die Wellen am Strand vorbeikrachen. Es ist ein lebendiger Ort. Zwischen dem Pianisten nebenan und den zwei Amateur-Vokalisten oben ist immer etwas los. In einer Weise haben wir weniger ein Apartment aus Fremden und mehr eine Gemeinschaft von Freunden. Wir kommen zusammen, wenn wir etwas brauchen, feiern Geburtstage, trauern bei Beerdigungen und helfen uns gegenseitig, wenn wir können. In einer Weise bin ich hier glücklich. Ich mag die meisten meiner Nachbarn und sie behandeln mich freundlich. Ich versuche, hinterherzurasen und ihnen Essen zu hinterlassen, und sie tun dasselbe. Ich bringe Briefe zu ihnen und sie zu mir. Es ist schön, sie zu sehen, und ich glaube, sie genießen meine Gegenwart genauso wie ich ihre. Ich wohne in einem riesigen, entmenschlichen modernistischen Sumpf, aber es sind Leute wie meine Nachbarn, die mich so fühlen lassen, als hätte ich nicht mein Leben total ruiniert.\n\nNow, translating the German text back to English:\n\n[REWRITE] The first time I heard about my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing.

In meinem Viertel ist die Präsenz einer Eigentümergemeinschaft sehr offensichtlich. Wenn man hereinkommt, sieht man nichts als gut gepflegte Einfamilienhäuser, für die wir die Eigentümergemeinschaft danken können. Die Vorgärten sehen alle sehr ähnlich aus. Es gibt einen kleinen Rasen, einige dekorative Kiesel und recht kurze Garagen. Manchmal sieht man auch kleine Bäume. Jeder hat eine Zwei-Parkplatz-Garage. Wenn man weiter durch das Viertel fährt, sieht man frisch asphaltierte Straßen. Trotz der vielen verschiedenen Familien, die hier wohnen, sind die Straßen in einem exzellenten Zustand. Man findet keine Unebenheiten oder ähnliches hier. Die meisten Häuser sind einstöckig, manchmal sieht man auch zwei Stockwerke. Wir haben keine typische Briefkastenanordnung, die man von Einfamilienhäusern erwarten würde. Es gibt keine einzelnen Briefkästchen vor jedem Haus. Stattdessen sieht man es eher als Wohnanlagen, wo es am Ende der Straße eine große Gruppe von Briefkästchen gibt. Jeder benötigt einen Schlüssel, um auf seinen spezifischen Briefkasten zuzugreifen. Es gibt auch zwei größere Schließfächer für Pakete. Wieder einmal können wir der HOA und deren Obsession mit Uniformität dafür danken. Die Lage meines Hauses befindet sich am Rand der nahen Stadt, also kann mein Viertel als Teil ländlich, Teil Suburbia beschrieben werden. Als Ergebnis haben wir viel Land für alles. Es gibt mehrere Gemeinschaftspools, die jeder Bewohner nutzen kann. Es ist gut gepflegt und gesichert. Und dann gibt es verschiedene Wanderwege, auf denen man seinen Hund spazieren führen oder einfach mal eine Abendstunde allein unternehmen kann. Man muss kein Park besuchen, um sich zu bewegen. Das Viertel ist groß genug, dass man einfach darum herumlaufen und genug Bewegung machen kann. Die Mehrheit der Gemeinschaft besteht aus Rentnern. Es ist ein sehr sicheres Gebiet, und jeder schaut sich aus. Gemischt mit dem ist ein kleiner Anteil von mittelalten und jüngeren Berufstätigen. Was die Stadt betrifft, ist sie erstaunlich groß - zumindest was die Bevölkerung angeht - aber auch hat sie einen kleinstädtischen Charakter. Wir haben die Mehrheit der Einrichtungen, die man erwarten und sich auf sie verlassen kann. Zum Beispiel haben wir genau einen Einkaufszentrum. Es ist nicht groß, aber es reicht aus. Für mich dauert es ungefähr 15 Minuten, um an einem wichtigen Ort zu gelangen, aber sobald ich das mache, habe ich viele verschiedene Geschäfte zur Auswahl. Wir haben alles von hochpreisigen Lebensmittelgeschäften, wo man organische Lebensmittel bekommen kann, bis hin zu Bietengeschäften, die nur eine kleine Auswahl an Produkten haben und mit Minimum-Personal arbeiten, um Kosten zu senken. Insgesamt ist mein Viertel sicher, gut gepflegt und recht typisch. Wir haben viele schöne Dinge, wie Pools und Wanderwege. Und obwohl wir nicht direkt neben irgendeinem Einkaufszentrum wohnen, kann man einfach ein Auto nehmen und zu jedem größeren Laden fahren, den man gerne besuchen möchte.\n\nEnglish Translation (back to English) from the German text:\n\n[REWRITE] The general area where I live can be described as typical cookie-cutter suburbia.

Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things like pools and walking trails. And although we're not right next to any shopping centers, you can simply get in your car and go to any major chain store you'd like. [/REWRITE]",
    "transformed": "The general area where I live can be described as typical cookie-cutter suburbia. In my neighborhood, the presence of a homeowner's association is very noticeable. Upon entering, you see nothing but well-maintained single-family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two-car garage. As you continue to drive around the neighborhood, you see freshly asphalted roads. Despite many different families living here, the streets are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single-story, but sometimes you'll see two-story houses as well. We don't have a typical mailbox setup that you'd expect for single-family homes. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large group of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone needs a key to access their specific mailbox. There are also two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is at the edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part-rural, part-suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of space for everything. There are several community pools that anyone living here can use. It's well-maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog or just take a stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get some exercise. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retirees. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that are a small number of middle-aged and young professionals. In terms of the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small-town feel. We have the majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get to a significant location, but once I do that, I'm greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high-end grocery stores where you can get organic food to bargain stores that only stock a small selection of items and have minimum staff to keep costs down.

Meine direkte Nachbarschaft, auf der östlichen Seite der Stadt, könnte als das wirtschaftlich benachteiligste Gebiet der Stadt beschrieben werden. Die Grundstückspreise sind niedrig, und die meisten Häuser werden entweder gemietet oder von Personen mit niedrigem Einkommen besessen. Es ist jedoch nicht unattraktiv oder unangenehm. Meine Nachbarn sind im Allgemeinen freundliche Menschen, die lächeln und hallo sagen, wenn ich die Straße entlanggehe. Die Kriminalitätsraten, auch wenn sie leicht höher sind als in anderen Teilen der Stadt, sind im Allgemeinen noch immer niedrig. Es gab in den letzten zehn Jahren wenige Gewaltverbrechen innerhalb weniger Blöcke von meinem Zuhause, einschließlich einiger Schießereien und mindestens einen Mord. Unsere Nachbarn links daneben verloren ihren Sohn bei einem Schießerei vor einem Bar-Areal im letzten Jahr. Glücklicherweise wurde unsere Familie nicht direkt von der Kriminalität betroffen, abgesehen von einem gelegentlichen Verschwinden von Gegenständen, wenn wir sie im Freien vergessen. Insgesamt hat die Stadt, in der ich lebe, stark unter dem \"Opioid-Epidemie\" gelitten, die viele Teile der Vereinigten Staaten betroffen hat. Viele Leben sind durch Fentanyl-Überdosen verloren gegangen. Glücklicherweise gibt es in meiner Stadt viele Ressourcen, um diesem Epidemiekampf beizutragen, einschließlich mehrerer Drogenentzugszentren und Narcan-Trainings für Familien und Freunde von Menschen, die von der Sucht betroffen sind. Trotz dieser Herausforderungen hat diese Stadt viele positive Merkmale. Die Schule meines Sohnes hat hervorragende Mitarbeiter, vom Schulleiter bis zu den Lehrern und dem Personals. Trotz seiner besonderen Bedürfnisse ist er bis jetzt nicht durch Mobbing betroffen, weil die unglaublich positive Atmosphäre der Schule. Er liebt sie dort. Wir haben einen aktiven PTO, der mehrere Veranstaltungen durchführt, um die familiäre Beteiligung und den Bildungsfortschritt zu fördern. Da mehr als 20 % der Bevölkerung unserer Stadt unterhalb der Armutsgrenze lebt, bietet die Grundschule kostenlose Frühstück und Mittagessen allen Schülern an, so dass kein Kind jemals hungern muss. Kein Kind oder keine Familie wird wegen einer Unfähigkeit zu bezahlen als \"weniger wert\" behandelt, und für Schulgebühren, Schulbedarf und Exkursionen sind die Kosten sehr angemessen. Die Stadtverwaltung und das Personal haben viele Verbesserungen an der Erscheinung unserer Stadt vorgenommen, einschließlich der Pflasterung von Straßen, Landschaftsgärtnerei und der Sanierung von Stadtgärten. Leider sind die meisten dieser Verbesserungen im Zentrum der Stadt und auf der westlichen Seite entstanden, wo sich alle Einkaufsgebiete befinden und die meisten Durchgangsverkehr stattfindet. Die östliche Seite, an der ich wohne, wird tendenziell vernachlässigt, was für diejenigen in meinem Viertel ein Anlass zum Streit ist. Insgesamt genieße ich es, in dieser Stadt zu leben. Die Leute sind im Allgemeinen freundlich, die Schulen sind großartig, es gibt genug Einkaufsmöglichkeiten (kleine Unternehmen und größere Einzelhandelsgeschäfte), um die Bedürfnisse meiner Familie zu erfüllen, und unser Zuhause mag vielleicht nicht viel wert sein, aber es ist bequem und ausreichend. Unsere Familie lebt seit über 16 Jahren hier, und wir können uns nicht vorstellen, anderswo zu leben.\n\nEnglish translation back:\n\n[REWRITE] I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburbs of a major city.

I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",

Ich wohne in einem 7-stöckigen Apartmentgebäude direkt gegenüber dem alten Theater und ein Block weiter die Hill, ist dieser kühle kleine Arcade Bar, der sich verschiedene Arten von Menschen am warmen Sommerabend sammeln. Oftmals, besonders am Wochenende im Juni und Juli, sehen Sie eine Schlange von Menschen an, die in die Bar gehen wollen. Ein paar Blöcke weiter befindet sich das nächste Stadtteilpark. Er ist ziemlich groß, wenn man bedenkt, in welchem Teil der Stadt er liegt. Der Park wird von Beton umgeben, mit hohen Treppen, die in die Wand eingelassen sind. Während der kalten Wintermonate setzen Obdachlose ihre Zelte in ordentlichen Reihen entlang der Gehwege und den breiten Stufen auf. Es schneit nicht viel, aber es regnet, und der heftige Regen in den mittleren Wintermonaten macht es oft schwierig, warm zu bleiben. Durch das Aufstellen ihrer Zelte in der Mitte der Stadt, anstatt draußen im Dschungel, bleiben sie viel wärmer. Außerdem sind sie in Fuß- und Busentfernung zum einzigen Familienzentrum in der Umgebung, wo sie sich waschen und duschen können. Was ich an meiner Stadt liebe, ist nicht die Schönheit der historischen Natur – die hohe stolze Gebäude, die Architektur, die durch die verschiedenen Ebenen der Hügel verteilt ist, die sich nach unten zur Küste erstrecken. Was ich an meiner Nachbarschaft liebe, ist die Kultur der Menschen selbst. Sie wissen, dass Hilltop einmal das bekannteste Viertel auf der Westküste für Gewalt durch Banden war. Man hört sogar nach drei Jahrzehnten noch Geschichten über die Bundesbehörden und den DEA, die durch die Stadt fahren, um die Straßen zu sauber zu machen. Die Menschen vergessen nicht. Geschichten werden von Generation zu Generation weitergegeben, sogar an Einwanderer wie mich, über jene Tage. Die Menschen arbeiten hart, obwohl es immer noch zu den raueren Vierteln in der gesamten Stadt gehört, um es sauber zu halten. Sie kümmern sich trotzdem noch immer um das, was in ihrer Stadt passiert, auf ihrem Block. Sie sagen, wenn du weiß bist, solltest du die Hill nachts nicht mehr durchqueren. Tatsächlich glaube ich, dass diese Warnung an die Alten Tage erinnert und mit dem bitteren Geschmack der sozialen Verhaltensweise gemischt ist. Vielleicht bin ich einfach dunkel genug, um mich als nicht ganz weiße Mädchen auszugeben, oder vielleicht erkennt Hilltop mich als eine von ihnen, als jemanden, der genauso schmerzhaft von den Erinnerungen weiß, die unsere Nation ständig heimsuchen. Erinnerungen, dass Rassismus, kulturelle Verhaltensweisen und Annahmen aus Ignoranz und Angst gemacht werden, selbst in einer Stadt, die als kultureller Melting-Pot-Utopia gilt. Ich weiß eines: egal wie weit ich wandere, die Hilltop ist mein Zuhause. Ich fühle mich lebendig, wenn ich diese Straßen nachts entlang gehe, Menschen, die mir rasch und selten hinterhältig als Jackett angeboten haben, als mir zu stehlen. Es ist ein Ort, an dem Laundromat-Eigner geöffnet haben, nur ein paar Minuten länger, damit ich mein Handy aufladen konnte, als ich nirgendwohin entkommen konnte, wenn es regnete. Es ist ein Ort, an dem ich mich, mich für unsichtbar glaubend, gegen die Betonfronten der Geschäfte zusammengekauert habe, an den damen grauen, dämmerigen Abenden, nur um von jemandem angehalten und angesehen zu werden, mir 5 $ gegeben zu erhalten und zu hören, dass ich schön und wertvoll bin.\n\n[REWRITE] My neighborhood is full of culture.

Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",

On any given day you will see children running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors know each other and can tell who fits in and who doesn't. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone walking their dog from a few blocks away and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards, they are kept trimmed down. It's not a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think \"wow, look at the nice homes!\" but one that you drive into and think \"this would be a good place to raise a family.\" It's quiet, peaceful, and safe. Although it only looks average, it's exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance, there is the county sheriff's department and jail. The health department is just next to that. The city recycling center is just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city use the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling out the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside or even inside and hear the rumble of small planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream shop, and if you're really into it, you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is only 8 blocks or so away. It's a really great place to live. [/REWRITE]",
    "transformed": "I live in rural America, specifically in a small town in Michigan. There, you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There are no big shopping centers, no Walmart, Target, or even an Applebee's. Wherever you need to go, you have to drive to get there. Despite that, I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world, surrounded by water. My \"city\" is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan on one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you can find a beach where you can dip your toes. My neighborhood reflects the idea of a small town. Houses are not stacked on top of each other. They are not identical houses built the same way. They are older homes, some of which have been renovated and modernized, while others are older. Most houses have full basements that can be seen from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have old aluminum siding.
