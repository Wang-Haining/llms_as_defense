While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest.

Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere.

There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options.

Wohnbereiche werden scheinbar zufällig zwischen Geschäftsbereichen verteilt, wo sich eine Vielzahl von Unternehmen betreiben lässt. Einige dieser Unternehmen bestehen aus Büros, während andere verschiedene Läden, Restaurants und Einrichtungen für Unterhaltung sind. Es mangelt an nichts an neuen Restaurants, an denen man essen kann, oder Läden, in denen man einkaufen kann. Während einige Läden groß, bekannte Marken sind, die von großen Konzernen besitzt werden, sind kleine Boutiquen auch immer beliebter. Sie sind nicht nur in verschiedenen Einkaufszentren zu finden, sondern auch an den Straßen, die oft in Gehdistanz zu Vierteln liegen, die andernfalls ruhig und idyllisch wären, wenn sie nicht von so vielen Sehenswürdigkeiten umgeben wären. Es gibt auch ein paar Parks in der Nähe, und ich habe bemerkt, dass Menschen diese Parks mit ihren kleinen Kindern frequentieren. Wenn es um die Menschen geht, so gibt es tatsächlich eine erhebliche Vielfalt innerhalb meines Viertels. In einem kleinen Ort haben wir eine prominenten LGBTQ+-Gemeinschaft, eine orthodox-jüdische Gemeinschaft und eine Sammlung von Flüchtlingen und Einwanderern aus der ehemaligen Sowjetunion. Wenn man ein Stück weiter außerhalb meines Viertels hinausgeht, gibt es viele mehr Menschen verschiedener Rassen und Herkunft, obwohl sie manchmal in ihre eigenen kleinen Gemeinschaften innerhalb der Stadt geteilt werden. Wir haben Orte wie Korea town, China town, Little Armenia und viele mehr, die nur ein paar Meilen entfernt liegen. Doch nur ein paar Meilen können sich zu einer sehr langen Fahrt auswachsen, insbesondere während der Rushhour. Fast niemand in meiner Stadt geht überhaupt noch zu Fuß. Während bestimmte Orte von Interesse trotzdem in der Nähe liegen, ist die Stadt riesig, und die Menschen bevorzugen es in der Regel nicht, zu Fuß zu pendeln. Als Ergebnis haben wir auch einige der schlimmsten Verkehrsunfälle der Welt und es ist schwierig, Parkplätze überall zu finden. Ironischerweise war es in den letzten Jahren zu einer großen Menge an Baumaßnahmen gekommen, da große Wohnblocks zur Stadt hinzugefügt wurden. Es scheint ein beliebtes Ziel zu sein, aber viele Einwohner sind enttäuscht von der Aussicht auf noch mehr Menschen, die einziehen, und noch mehr Fahrzeuge auf den Straßen. Es gibt viele verschiedene Arten von Häusern in meiner Stadt, aber nicht jeder lebt oder möchte in einem großen Wohnblock wohnen. Wohnbereiche setzen sich aus Häusern, in verschiedenen Größen, und kleineren Wohnungen und Konodomien zusammen. Einige Eigentümer besitzen Einfamilienhäuser, während andere Duplexe enthalten. Dies ist auch innerhalb meines unmittelbaren Viertels der Fall, sodass es auch keine Mangel an Vielfalt im Hinblick auf Wohnmöglichkeiten gibt. Ebenso besteht das Viertel aus Menschen verschiedenen Alters, und ehrlicherweise bin ich nicht mit der Mehrheit meiner Nachbarn vertraut. Es ist nicht wirklich ein eng verbundenes Gemeinschaft diese Tage, obwohl ich viele Erinnerungen von meinen Kindertagen an die Freizeit, die ich draußen mit meinem Nachbarn rechts neben mir und ein paar anderen Freunden aus dem Viertel, die alle in der Nähe meines Alters waren, hatte.\n\nEnglish Translation:\n\n[REWRITE] Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse.

Die meisten Häuser sind Einzelhäuser, aber es gibt auch einige, die in zwei geteilt wurden, obwohl sie noch miteinander verbunden sind. Mein Zuhause hat einen kleinen Vorgarten und einen kleinen Parkplatz links neben dem Haus. Wie die meisten anderen erinnert es an eine Zeit, die nicht so lange her ist, in der das Leben in den Vororten der amerikanische Traum war. Dieser Traum schien einst die Menschen dieses Landes umzumfassen, aber jetzt zieht er sich zurück. Doch mein Viertel und viele andere bleiben, rufen uns und den Besuchern zu, dass der Traum noch am Leben ist und wir ihn so gut wie möglich festhalten. Die Menschen fühlen sich nicht mehr so optimistisch wie früher, die Pflege der kleinen Vorgärten ist nicht mehr so wie früher, aber es gibt immer noch ein Auto oder zwei in jedem Parkplatz, die Jugendlichen spielen, als ob die Welt um sie herum ihr gesamtes Dasein ausmachen würde. Die öffentliche Schule, die seit fast 90 Jahren hier ist, steht noch, scheint eine Zukunft in den jungen Menschen aufzubauen, während sie bei den älteren Bewohnern Nostalgie aufweckt. Die Kirchen sind selten und weit voneinander entfernt, meist leer, aber die Basketballplätze sind immer noch voll. Alle Häuser sehen unterschiedlich aus, aber fühlen sich gleich. Es gibt ein großes Supermarkt namens \"Super A\", das von einer großen jemenitischen Familie gehört wird, die wahrscheinlich die einzige arabische Familie im Viertel ist. Die überwiegende Mehrheit der Bewohner ist afroamerikanisch. Die Straßen sind breit und die Kinder spielen Fußball, nur um den Autos Platz zu lassen, die vorbeifahren. Die meisten Menschen in meinem Viertel sind hier seit Generationen und die meisten können Geschichten von einer Vergangenheit erzählen, in der jeder jeden kannte. Es gab ein Karate-Schul, aber als Hollywood die Filme \"Karate Kid\" nicht mehr produzierte, verloren die Kinder das Interesse, Karatekid zu sein, also ist es jetzt eine Apotheke, weil Medizin alles besser macht, oder so habe ich gehört. Es gibt auch ein kleines Kino, das alte Filme zu einem ermäßigten Preis zeigt, das durch die Jugendlichen von der Menge verschont wird wegen des Fehlens neuerer Filme, aber vom älteren Teil der Bevölkerung geschätzt wird, die ein Abendessen mit dem kleinen Preis als geringfügige Opfer ansieht, ohne die Kinder natürlich. Es gibt eine einzelne Autobahn, die durch mein Dorf führt. Obwohl die Ausfahrt und Einfahrt in das benachbarte Dorf liegen. Es gab einmal eine Petition, um eine Ausfahrt für unser Dorf zu erhalten. Die Jugendlichen unterstützten sie, während die Älteren sie ablehnten. Es scheint, dass die Autobahn in unserem Dorf es ruinieren würde, so sagten die Älteren, die letztendlich die Stadtverwaltung überzeugten, die Anfrage abzulehnen. Sie bauen ein neues Gymnasium und wir versuchen, einen Maskottchen für unser Dorf zu entscheiden.

Zumindest nicht Orte, an denen die meisten Menschen leben möchten. Wenn du jedoch hinter dem alten, verlassenen Whole Foods gehst und hinter den Hotels zurückgehst, die nur im Laufe des Jahres außerhalb der Sommerzeit von ein paar kurzen Aufenthalten für Familienbesuche bewohnt sind, findest du eine ganze lebendige Gemeinschaft. In diesen Gemeinschaften, auf diesen Straßen, befinden sich ein Handvoll Wohnkomplexe - nebeneinander platziert, wie russische Matrjoschka-Eier, die sorgfältig auseinandergenommen und in einer Reihe entlang der Straße nebeneinander gestellt wurden. Die ersten Wohnungen, die du triffst, wurden in den Nachrichten für einige eher unangenehme Vorfälle genannt, also konzentrieren wir uns nicht allzu sehr darauf - Erscheinungen können täuschen, nach all. Die Wohnungen neben diesem Komplex und die beiden Komplexe neben dem anderen sind eine Welt, die fast niemand in dieser Gegend kennt. Gegenüber den Komplexen befindet sich ein Campus der Gemeinschaftscollege - ein stiller, schläfriger Satz von Gebäuden, der wie ein Wächter neben der Straße steht, wo Studenten mit Kaffee in der Hand herumlungern und gegen 7 Uhr morgens mit einem Gähnen beginnen, um ihre schläfrigen Tage zu beginnen. Die eisernen Tore quietschen auf, um sie einzulassen, während Pendler mit den Fäusten durch das Autofenster schlagen und sie beschuldigen, den Verkehr auf Tagen mit höherer Teilnahme aufzuhalten. Die Straße trifft auf eine weitere Wohnstraße, mit einem Park auf einer Seite und einer Rehabilitationseinrichtung für Menschen, die durch unglückliche Umstände Knochen gebrochen haben. Die Behandlungszentrale präsentiert sich mit fröhlicher Terrassenmöbel, und einem locker schwingenden Dachventilator, der die warme, dicke Sommersonne auf und ab bläst. Kinder laufen im Gras des Parks hin und her, Drehbügeln und Pinwheels über die scharlachgrünen Stängel, während Bienen faul in den Blumenbeeten neben der Straße herumfliegen. Ältere, pensionierte Menschen gehen mit ihren Hunden auf dem Gehweg, wüten gegen die Teenager auf ihren Skateboards und nicken höflich gegenüber den Teenagern, die bei der Spielgeräte gruppiert sind, über Jungs und die neuesten YouTube-Sensationen zu plaudern. Es gibt einen Sushi-Imbiss in einem Einkaufszentrum neben dem Park, der günstig ist, aber nie zu voll ist - eine Schwimmbad-Verkaufsstelle direkt neben, und eine Nagelschmiede, die zwischen den beiden platziert ist. Du könntest deine Schwimmbad für die Saison füllen, während du eine Maniküre und Hühnchen hibachi essen, alles auf einmal - die Schönheit eines Einkaufszentrums. Es gibt auch ein gefrorenes Joghurtgeschäft dort, eines der Selbstbedienungstypen, und oft siehst du die Teens im Park mit kalten, schwitzenden Tassen gefrorenem Joghurt mit Toppings überzogen, während sie Kunststücke auf ihren Skateboards ausführen und vaporen, weil sie glauben, es sei das Coolest).

She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash.

He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry.

Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness.

Sie kam aus einer Stadt, in der der Supermarkt ein 5-minütiger Spaziergang von ihrem Haus entfernt war – sie hatte so viel offenes Raum in ihrem Leben noch nie gesehen. Beim Anblick der ubiquitäten Maisfelder war sie schockiert und ich teilte ihr mit, was es bedeutete, in ländlichen Ohio aufzuwachsen, und in diesem Moment wusste sie, wer ich war und woher ich kam. Auf der zwei-spurigen Landstraße fahren Sie an einem Steinbruch vorbei, der mit Wasser gefüllt ist. Etwas dahinter liegt die kleine Entwicklung, in der ich wohne. Die Häuser bestehen hauptsächlich aus Backstein und Stucco. Fast alle Häuser haben mindestens einen halben Hektar Land, das jeder hütet, in dem er Stolz hat. Im Frühling sind jährlich gepflanzte Blumen und die mittleren Bäume des Mittleren Westens, die mit jeder Jahreszeit wechseln, reichlich vorhanden. Die Einfahrten sind alle mit den teuersten Mercedes-Benz-Luxuswagen gefüllt, die im sonnigen Mittagsschatten nach einem guten, alten Auto-Waschen glänzen. Entlang der Straße, Richtung meinem grauen Stucco-Haus, ist mein koreanischer Nachbar immer draußen mit einem freundlichen Gesicht. Er verbringt den ganzen Tag damit, seinen Rasen zu mähen und kann man ihn über den Lärm seines John-Deer-Zero-Turn-Mähers singen hören. Jeder im Viertel hat sich über ihn lustig gemacht, aber er ist immer aufrichtig und ein unglaublicher Mensch mit einer einzigartigen Vergangenheit. Er ist älter geworden und hat etwas seines Witzes verloren. Ermöglicht er war ein Doktor und blendet sich normalerweise mit dem Gras und seinem John-Deer-Zero-Turn-Mäher ein. Schließlich erreichen Sie Ihr Zuhause. In der Seitenfläche sind Gänsen reichlich vorhanden und werden von unserem Terrier verfolgt. Im Hinterhof ist ein kleiner Bach, der in den Steinbruch mündet. Hier können Sie Bullfrosche hören, den Bach und den gelegentlichen \"Mooo\" von den nahegelegenen Farmen hören. Über die handgefertigte Holzbrücke befindet sich ein unberührter Oase gefüllt mit natürlich wachsenden Bäumen, Kräutern und Wildblumen. Hier verbrachte ich meine Kindheit. Von Baumhäusern zu bauen bis 'Wilderei' (was hauptsächlich darin bestand, sie zu verfolgen), gab es immer etwas zu tun und meistens einen Nachbarskind, das sich anfreundete. Die Winter in meinem kleinen Dorf können brutal sein, doch es ist nichts Schöneres. Die Gärten verändern sich von einem Meer aus Grün in eine leere Wildnis. Die Bäume, die einst bunte rosa, violette und orangelüsternde Blüten trugen, werden zu kahlen Skeletten von Rinde. Wenn man Glück hat und mit seltenen Schneefällen begünstigt ist, erscheint über Nacht ein Winterswunderland. Die Schneeküsse der kleinen Schwester sind im Garten zu finden, und Schneemann. Meine Schwester und ich stritten häufig als Kinder, und im Winter waren Schneebälle unsere Waffe der Wahl. Wir bauten riesige Igluähnliche Befestigungen, um unsere Waffen zu beherbergen, normalerweise mit Ästen, wie eine Waffenträger. In unserem eigenen kleinen Wunderland spielten wir 'Puppen' während einer Zeit, in der nichts anderes zählte. Wir waren einfach nur junge Kinder ohne Sorgen.\n\n[REWRITE] Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. \"This is it!\" I said, knowing she'd be shocked by the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town where the grocery store was a 5-minute walk from her house—she'd never seen this much open space in her life. Taken aback by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you'll reach a quarry that's filled with water. Just past it is the small development where I live. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco.

To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time.

Die unoffizielle Stadt-Wahlspruch, auf der Rückseite eines Gebäudes, das als Pizzeria, Bar, Musikclub, Strip-Club und auf jeden Fall auf mindestens der Hälfte dieser Aktivitäten schummelt, lautet \"Keep Portland Weird\" (Behalte Portland seltsam). Für manche ist dies ein kleiner Hilferuf, um die Portland der 90er und frühen 2000er Jahre wiederzubeleben, ein Portland, das weniger bekannt und weniger teuer war, und kreative und einzigartige Subkulturen hervorbrachte. Für andere ist es eine lockende Aufforderung - komm nach Portland, wo dich Leute noch immer seltsam nennen, aber diesmal als Kompliment. Trotz des Zustroms von reichen Kaliforniern und der ständigen Baumaßnahmen, um diese Kalifornier unterzubringen, ist Portland immer noch seltsam. Seltsam bedeutet nicht immer akzeptierend, aber es bedeutet doch akzeptierend für Dinge, die normalerweise nicht akzeptiert werden. Seltsam bedeutet nicht, dass wir keine modernen Annehmlichkeiten und keine modernen Kämpfe haben. Wir kaufen wie der Rest des Landes die meisten Dinge aus China. Es gibt eine Million Wege, seltsam zu sein, nicht normal zu sein, aber Portland hat auch ordentliche Leute. Portland hat Yoga, Hipster und Geschäftsleute. Vielleicht bedeutet seltsam, dass wir einfach all das weniger ernst nehmen. In meinem Viertel, wie in vielen Portland-Vierteln, haben wir bunte Häuser, Blumen und Kräuter und Gemüse in den Straßen, und Frei-Boxen im Sommer. Frei-Boxen sind traditionell Kartons enthaltende Gegenstände, die jemand loswerden möchte, aber sie können auch Plastiksäcke oder Kartons sein. Sie enthalten etwas Magisches, ein Schatz, der perfekt für den Passanten ist, oft zu überraschen. Frei-Boxen neigen dazu, Kleidung und Bücher zu enthalten, aber sie können alles enthalten. Der magische Potenzial, durch ein Viertel in Southeast Portland zu laufen, ist, was Portland alles ist, also was Portland für mich ist, aber ich bin nur eine von Tausenden von seltsamen Sorten. Manche Leute, mit denen ich zusammenlebe, träumen nicht im Traum daran, ihre Kleidung aus einem Karton auf der Straße zu ziehen. Diese Leute gehen zum Goat Yoga (ja, Yoga mit echten lebenden Ziegen) oder Timbers-Spielen (der Fußballverein der Stadt). Portland ist voll von Leuten, die alle möglichen Dinge lieben. Portland ist voll von Leuten, die ihre Träume verfolgen oder über ihre Träume nachdenken, während sie sich zu viel Zeit in der Bar verbringen. Ja, Portland hat ein Drogenproblem. Drogenprobleme sind (in ihrer Wurzel) häufig gesundheitliche Probleme, und der ständige Regen über weite Teile des Jahres, plus die trüben Wolken, erscheinen als Beitrag dazu. Portland hat auch ein Obdachlosenproblem, über das niemand weiß, was zu tun ist. Die Obdachlosenpopulation wird von den Sozialdiensten angetrieben, die Portland bietet, besser als in den meisten Teilen des Landes, aber unsere Dienste sind unzureichend, wie in allen Teilen des Landes. Die nicht-obdachlosen Bevölkerung schwankt zwischen Sorge und Hass. In diesem Punkt sind wir überhaupt nicht seltsam.\n\nEnglish translation: [REWRITE]\n\nThe first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon, is the definition of \"weird\".

Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me.

Ob ich sie vergessen habe oder ob ich mit Arbeit und Leben so sehr beschäftigt bin, dass ich sie bemerke, sie sind dort, unerschütterlich, unangreifbar und unbeeindruckt von den Tribulationen des Lebens. An den Tagen, an denen ich am meisten gestresst und verletzlich bin, fordern sie mich auf, sie anzusehen, und wenn ich mich ihnen zuwendet, lassen sie mich my angstvolles Herz ruhen, sie verleihen mir eine Stärke, um weiterzumachen, Tag für Tag. Ich habe mich nur hier umgezogen, als ich mein Studium begonnen habe, und die Berge im Norden des Campus waren es, was mich zuerst fesselte. Jawohl, die Universität hat ihre eigenen Traumhaft-zielen in Gebäuden und Teichen und Bäumen, die ihren eigenen Anteil an meinem Herzen haben, aber es sind die Berge, die wirklich ihre Krone behalten. Der Rest der Stadt ist in seinem Recht schön. Es gibt unzählige Kaffeehäuser, in denen ich viele Stunden mit Kaffee und Stress gefüllt habe. Man kann zu Fuß oder mit dem Bus ein bisschen weiter in die Innenstadt gehen und in einer Aura der Antiquität von den abgeblätterten Farben umhüllt sein, die sich in Restaurants und Bürogebäuden befinden. Es ist hier, dass diese scheinbar vorstädtische Stadt so viel Betrieb und Energie zeigt wie ihre benachbarte große Stadt. Das hält aber nicht lange an, da man leicht entfliehen kann, um wieder in die friedliche kleine Stadt vorbeizugehen und die Bibliothek zu passieren. Diese Doppelheit der Atmosphären in so naher Nähe gibt der Stadt einen wunderbaren Anstrich, als wenn sie mich aufforderte, sie zu erkunden. Mit diesem machst es leicht, viele geliebte Erinnerungen zu schaffen, jede in Verbindung mit einem bestimmten Teil der Stadt. Ob es darum geht, vorbei an den rostigen Schaukeln im Park mit Freunden nach einer Nachtschicht zu gehen oder durch die geschäftige Innenstadt zu laufen, um den Film im schicken Kino zu sehen, für das die Universität Tickets besorgt hat. Alas, es ist auch der Ort vieler harten Erinnerungen, wie alle Orte im Leben. Die Teiche bieten sich an als eine passende Stelle für Reflexionen sowie Tränenessions in der Mitte der Nacht, wenn man sich in der Existenzkrise befindet. Letzteres habe ich mehr Erfahrung mit. Während ich die Schildkröten, Enten und Insekten beobachte, wie sie ihr Leben leben, jedes mit einer bestimmten Leistung oder Rolle, konnte ich nicht umhin, mich nach meinem eigenen Sinn im Leben zu fragen, als ich mich darum bemühte, dieses Rätsel zu lösen. Also ging ich vorbei am Teich, vorbei am Park und den kleinen Häusern, die von Vorstadtcharm sprechen, bis ich eine Hauptstraße erreichte. Es war dann, dass die Sonne ihre strahlenden Strahlen auf die Palmen warf, die Himmel entlang malte und als ich nach oben schaute, sah ich auf, dass ich nach Norden ging. Gewiss, sie waren dort, genauso wie immer. Die standhaften, überwältigenden Berge bedeckten den blasenblauen und gelben Himmel mehr als jede Gebäude im Horizont, und als sprächen sie ohne Worte, erweckten sie in mir mein Gefühl der Ausdauer.\n\nNow, the German text will be translated back to English.\n\n[REWRITE] The mountains are always there.

Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",

Die öffentliche Verkehrsmittel sind sehr zugänglich und gehören zu den beliebtesten Formen der Fortbewegung in New York City. Bensonhurt ist ein relativ urbane Nachbarschaft, also werden Sie immer noch das Gefühl haben, in New York City zu sein. Während Ihres Besuchs bereiten Sie sich vor, die verschiedenen asiatischen Läden um sich herum zu sehen. Im Laufe der letzten zwei Dekaden hat Bensonhurt eine Welle von asiatischen Einwohnern erhalten. Deshalb werden Sie an jeder Ecke einen asiatisch besitzenen Laden sehen, während Sie spazieren gehen. Die beliebtesten sind Supermärkte und Waschsalons. Zufällig sind diese Geschäfte sehr beliebt bei den Einwohnern, da die Qualität der Lebensmittel in den Supermärkten hervorragend ist, die Preise sind viel günstiger und schließlich wichtig ist es sehr bequem. Kurz vor mir gibt es vier asiatische Supermärkte in zwei Minuten Fußweg voneinander entfernt. Das trägt nur noch zur Bequemlichkeit des Einkaufs bei. Ich sage nicht, dass Bensonhurst ausschließlich von asiatischen Einwohnern bewohnt ist, obwohl. Es ist sehr vielfältig überall, mit Immigranten und ihren ersten und zweiten Generationenamerikanischen Kindern hier. Die meisten großen und beliebten Geschäfte in der lokalen Gegend sind asiatisch besitzt. Neben diesen asiatisch besitzenen Geschäften gibt es auch ein kürzlich renoviertes Park, der in der Nähe liegt, der umfasst etwa zehn Basketballplätze, einen großen Feld für Fußball oder Baseball, vier Handballsplätze, Tahrausler, einen Spielplatz für Kinder, und sogar eine Wasserspiel für Kinder, um im Sommer Wasser zu genießen. Da wir uns in New York City befinden, ist es natürlich, dass die Parks sehr vielfältig sind. Sie werden viele Arten von Vielfalt hier sehen, die gut miteinander auskommen. In dieser Nachbarschaft gibt es nicht viele große korporative Gebäude. Die einzigen Gebäude, die Sie finden werden, sind die für Co-op Wohnungen oder Condotteigenschaften. Die meisten Wohnräume hier sind zwei-Familienhäuser. Die meisten Menschen sind jedoch sehr nett, aber sehr lauten. Jeden Tag hören Sie Autos, die Musik am Fenster blasen, während sie vorbeifahren, oder die ständig den Gaspedal betätigen, was Sie am Morgen wecken wird. Wenn Sie sich entscheiden, in der Nacht zu besuchen, sollten Sie auf der Hut sein. Diese Nachbarschaft ist relativ sicher, aber die Menschen sind unvorhersehbar. Sie können Menschen treffen, die für keinen Grund willen Streit anfangen wollen, Bullen und Diebe. Ich selbst bin in diesem Viertel in der Vergangenheit via körperlicher Angriff belästigt worden, aber das war viele Jahre her. Ein weiteres kürzliches Ereignis betraf die Diebstahl von Paketen. Obwohl ein gängiges Ding, gibt es in diesem Viertel Paketdiebe. Zuletzt jedoch, obwohl New York City eine Strafe für Menschen verhängt, die nicht hinterhermachen, nach dem Fressens ihrer Hunde, tun es die Menschen hier nicht ein. Jeden Morgen sehen Sie mindestens einen Hundehaufen auf dem Weg zum Bahnhof oder zum Supermarkt, oder auf dem Weg zum Supermarkt. Meine größte Beschwerde ist der Hundehaufen überall, wohin ich gehe in dieser Nachbarschaft. Vorsichtig sein und Ihre Schuhe sauber halten!\n\nEnglish translation of the German text:\n\n[REWRITE] If you decide to visit Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you won't have a hard time finding it.

Alles scheint sich nach unten zu bewegen, und mein Haus sitzt genau auf der höchsten Stelle des steilsten Hügels im Viertel. Die Leute nennen es den \"Fitness-Hügel\", weil so viele Jogger ihn während ihrer täglichen Turnübung hinauf laufen. Da es überhaupt keine Gehsteige auf meiner Straße gibt, gehen die Leute auf die Straße. Die Straße ist in einigen Abschnitten eingeborsten und kann gefährlich zum Fahren sein. Einige der Telefon- und Stromkabel, die um das Block herumgespannt sind, sehen zerrissen aus. Es regnet und stürmt viel in unserer Gegend, also fallen Äste und andere Abfälle oft auf die Stromleitungen herab und die ständigen Reparaturen machen sie aussehen, als ob sie aus verschiedenen Stücken zusammengesetzt wären. Es gibt viele hohe Fichtenbäume überall, die man sieht. Aber die Leute hier hassen die Bäume. Sie versuchen, so viele wie möglich zu fällen, weil die Bäume die Sicht auf das Meer behindern. Deshalb werden viele der Häuser so hoch auf den Hügel gebaut, mit riesigen, von Glasfronten umgebenen Obergeschossen, die sich übereinander türmen, um die Sicht auf die Bucht zu nehmen. Es ist atemberaubend um die Sonnenuntergang herum, wenn das Wasser von unten beleuchtet wird und der Himmel orange wird. Es ist oft wolkig, sodass man sich die Sonnenschein durch einen Nebel stören muss. Die meisten Tage sind bewölkt und feucht. Moos wächst überall, wo es kann: auf Dächern, Autos und Geländern. Ich habe einmal meinen Wagen vor meiner Garage parken lassen und als ich ihn dann wieder herausgenommen habe, hatte er sich grün und furchtbar mit Moos überzogen. Es hat mich drei Stunden gekostet, es abzukratzen. Es gibt in meiner Gegend nicht viele Kinder, obwohl es nur ein paar Blöcke vom Schulzentrum entfernt ist. Die meisten Leute in meinem Viertel sind alt, viele von ihnen sind in Rente. Stattdessen haben die Leute Hunde. Es ist nicht ungewöhnlich, sie in den Vorgärten oder die Straße hinunterhüpfen zu sehen. Wenn du eine Tür oder ein Fenster offen lässt, riskierst du, dass sie in dein Haus kriechen. Ich habe einmal einen in meinem Wohnzimmer gefunden und musste ihn wieder aus dem Hauseingang schubsen. Hasen laufen wild herum in der Gegend. Manche sind sogar ziemlich groß, und die Gärtner hassen sie, weil sie die Wurzeln von Pflanzen aufgraben und in die Vorgärten der Leute hineingraben. Meine Katzen haben sie allerdings lieb, und haben fast alle aus unserem Viertel gejagt. Wir bekommen auch die übliche Auswahl an Vögeln: kleine Spatzen und Hummeln, und es gibt gelegentlich einen Falken oder einen Adler, der manchmal überflog, bis die Krähen aus dem Viertel ihn verjagten. Es gibt in der Nähe keine Geschäfte, aber wenn du runter zum Wasserweg gehst, gibt es ein paar Restaurants, die frisch gefangenes Fischgericht servieren. Es gibt nicht viel von einer Bucht dort unten, aber die Steine am Strand sind zum Werfen in das Wasser Spaß. Die Bucht selbst ist nicht sehr breit. Man kann sogar über die andere Uferlinie hingucken, auch wenn es oft neblig ist.\n\nBack to English:\n\n[REWRITE] There aren't many sidewalks where I live.

It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",

Kinder fahren mit ihren Fahrrädern herum und das ist das, was man von einem solchen Viertel erwarten würde. Wir sind oft zu Hause, seit wir von zu Hause arbeiten. Es sind vier von uns, also mein Partnerin und ich und unsere beiden Töchter, elf und vierzehn Jahre alt. Also sage ich, dass alle anderen auch daran gewöhnt sind, dass wir kommen und gehen. Wir gehen raus und spielen, manchmal sogar im Regen. Manchmal grillen wir auch auf unserer Terrasse und es ist immer ein angenehmes Geruch von dem Grill und allem. Es scheint, dass sich immer jemand um die Rasenpflege kümmert und man hört fast jeden Tag eine Rasenmähmaschine, von März bis etwa Oktober, wenn der Rasen endlich aufhört zu wachsen. Wir haben eine Menge Bäume in unserem Viertel, da es ursprünglich ein Waldgebiet war, also gibt es viele Schatten, aber es gibt immer eine Menge Laub im Herbst. Das bedeutet also auch, dass wir das Laub jährlich beheben und verbrennen. Ich mag den Geruch des brennenden Laubs auch, also ist das immer ein schöner Anzeichen, dass der Herbst angekommen ist. Lately, haben wir nicht viel Winter, also fühlt es sich nur an wie ein langer Herbst. Unsere Garage befindet sich am Hinterhof unseres Hauses, also verwenden wir die Haustür selten, es sei denn, jemand klingelt an der Tür, was selten vorkommt. Ich mag es, in der Garage an meinem Truck oder anderen Projekten zu arbeiten, manchmal, und wenn ich die Garagetüren öffne, fühlt es sich an, als bin ich mehr auf das Viertel eingestimmt.

In winter, we sled down the hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a rare vehicle, we take note of it. Some neighbors go for a walk to get exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids ride their bicycles and all that you'd expect from a neighborhood like this. We are at home a lot since we work from home. There are four of us, my partner and I and our two daughters, ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is also accustomed to us coming and going. We go outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. We sometimes grill on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone mowing the lawn and you can hear a lawn mower almost every day from March to about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's a lot of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the fall as well. This means we rake and burn the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much winter, so it just feels like a long fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we rarely use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time, and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more attuned to the neighborhood. On holidays, it's pretty quiet around here. On Thanksgiving, some neighborhood families visit with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.",

Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit.

Wenn man nicht selbst hier gelebt hat, versteht man wahrscheinlich nicht, wie es ist, immer nur Brauntöne zu sehen und wenn man einmal einen Rasen sieht, weiß man, dass die Person eine Menge Geld für die Rasenpflege ausgibt. Als ich hier in den 90ern lebte, waren die Häuser weit verstreut. Jetzt ist es ähnlich, aber es gibt viele neue Hinzufügungen. Ehrlich gesagt, sieht dieses Gebiet immer mehr wie eine Stadt aus, aber wie viele Orte ändern sich auch so. Die meisten Leute sind sehr freundlich, aber wie in jeder Stadt gibt es auch gute und schlechte Seiten. In meinem Viertel bin ich von freundlichen alten Leuten umgeben, ich denke, es ist ein nettes Viertel. Die Geschäfte hier sind in der Regel die Ketten wie Food 4 Less und Smart & Final. Wenn du Upscale-möbel willst, musst du fahren. Ich sehe fast nie ganze Foods oder Geschäfte dieser Art. Die in meiner Stadt am meisten vertretenen Berufe sind, ohne auf offizielle Demografien zurückzugreifen, die Bauwirtschaft. Ich denke, das liegt daran, dass diese Stadt immer noch nicht sehr entwickelt ist, es gibt immer noch viel offenes Gelände, auf dem gebaut werden kann. Das beunruhigt mich ein bisschen, ich mag die Dinge so wie sie jetzt sind. Ich kam aus einer großen Stadt und ich bin nicht begeistert, zurückzukehren. Wenn man von der Bauwirtschaft spricht, liegt mein Arbeitsplatz in diesem Bereich, ich bin ein Fachmann für Trockenauskleidung und T-Bars. Was ich an meinem Zuhause mag, sind die verschiedenen Tiere. Leute kommen in die Wüste für viele Gründe, nicht zuletzt für die raue Schönheit der Wüste selbst. Die Klima und Topographie der Wüste haben herausfordernde Ökosysteme geschaffen, die geschützt werden müssen, die auch verschiedene Arten von Wildtieren beheimatet. Die menschlichen Bewohner der Wüste sollten sich die Zeit nehmen, um sich über die nicht-menschlichen Bewohner dieses Umfeldes zu informieren, um sicher und harmonisch miteinander zu leben. Meine Familie und ich haben sich sehr gut an die Wildtiere angepasst. Ich habe drei Kinder und sie sind alle von Eidechsen und Wüsteninsekten besessen, als ich jetzt schreibe, sind sie draußen und versuchen, verschiedene Exemplare zu fangen. Was die Attraktionen angeht, haben wir einige. Außerdem ist Victorville ein guter Ort für Familien, um die Wüste zu erleben. Es bietet eine andere Erfahrung. Wenn du kannst, plane deinen Besuch mit seinem jährlichen Event, dem San Bernardino County Fair, ab. Die Messe wird deinen Besuch mit der richtigen Mischung von Aktivitäten und Spaß, der Victorville-Art, bereichern. Besuche in der Nähe gelegene Wrightwood, um die Schneebedeckten Berge zu sehen und einige Wintersportkurse zu nehmen, um deinen Besuch abzurunden. Bist du an der Naturgeschichte und der Kultur des Hochwüstenökosystems interessiert? Das Victor Valley Museum zeigt geologische und paläontologische Exemplare, Objekte der indigenen amerikanischen Kultur, sowie historische Gegenstände, die die Entwicklung der Gesellschaft und der Industrie von Victorville erzählen.\n\nNext, I'll translate the German text back to English:\n\n[REWRITE] My neighborhood is in the middle of the high desert area, where there is earth, more earth, and even more earth.

I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent.

Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students.

Während andere, die auf diese Frage antworten, wahrscheinlich Eigentümer mit ihren eigenen individuellen Leben sind, ist meine Situation ein bisschen anders. Ich betrachte meine Nachbarschaft als die Universitätscampus, in dem ich mich aufhalte, und die Menschen, die in meinem Wohnheim leben, als meine Gemeinschaft. Ich betrachte auch die umliegende Universität als meine Nachbarschaft, jedoch in geringerem Maße. Trotz dieser Besonderheit teilen meine Nachbarschaft einige Gemeinsamkeiten mit den konventionelleren Vorstellungen über eine Nachbarschaft. Genauso wie jede konventionelle Nachbarschaft hat meine Nachbarschaft Häuser, Menschen, Geschäfte und Parks. Lass uns damit beginnen, die \"Häuser\" in meiner Nachbarschaft zu besprechen, die sie ausmachen. bevor ich mich mit den Häusern in meiner Nachbarschaft beschäftige, ist es am besten, die Arten von Häusern zu klären, die in meiner Nähe zu finden sind. Es gibt drei Arten von Wohnungen in meiner unmittelbaren Umgebung, die Apartments, die tatsächlichen Häuser und die Wohnheimhäuser. Zuerst, in den Apartments gibt es in der Regel zwischen 2-4 Personen in jeder Etage und es gibt etwa 4-6 Zimmer auf jeder Etage. Die am häufigsten vorkommende Gebäudetyp kann etwa 2 Etagen unterbringen, also leben durchschnittlich etwa 20-25 Personen in jedem Gebäude. Zweitens sind die tatsächlichen Häuser, die für jeden mit einer Verbindung zur Schule gemietet werden können. Diese sind in der Regel 2-4-Zimmer-Einheiten, die normalerweise von Alumni bewohnt werden. Es gibt jedoch nur wenige dieser Art von Häusern in der Nachbarschaft, da sie weniger effizient sind. Schließlich gibt es die typischen Zimmer in einem Wohnheim, in denen Hunderte von Studenten leben. In diesen teilen zwei Personen einen Raum, mit Ausnahmen, und es ist der am häufigsten vorkommende Typ von Wohnraum in meiner Nachbarschaft. Da wir mit dem Wohnraum fertig sind, können wir mit den Menschen fortfahren. Mein College ist stolz auf seine Vielfalt und dies spiegelt sich in der Zusammensetzung meiner Nachbarschaft wider. Es gibt Menschen aus allen Kulturen und Altersgruppen, die in meiner Nachbarschaft leben. Die meisten der hauptberuflichen Mitarbeiter leben in den Häusern, die in der Nachbarschaft liegen, während die neuen Studenten in der Art von Wohnheimen und die älteren Studenten in der Art von Apartmentwohnungen leben. Die Menschen in dieser Nachbarschaft können nicht gerecht werden, indem man einfach über sie spricht, also wäre es am besten, einfach zu den Geschäften und Parks in meiner Nachbarschaft zu kommen. Da mein College eigentlich seine eigene, abgeriegelte Nachbarschaft ist, hat es eine Vielzahl von Geschäften und einen einzigen Park. Die Geschäfte sind eine Mischung aus Speiseoptionen, die man in jeder anderen Nachbarschaft finden würde, und der eigenen Marke des Colleges von Kleidung und Lebensmitteln. Als solches kann alles, was benötigt wird, innerhalb der Grenzen meiner Nachbarschaft gefunden werden! Des Weiteren ist der Park in meiner Nachbarschaft ein Spielplatz für alle vielfältigen Menschen in meiner Nachbarschaft, er wird sauber gehalten und frei von Kriminalität durch alle Mitglieder meiner Nachbarschaft!\n\nEnglish translation:\n\n[REWRITE] When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique.

Zuerst war ich sehr traurig, als ich in mein Viertel kam. Ich kam aus Riverdale nach Stockbridge und ich sage es nicht, aber ich habe geweint, weil ich sie vermisst und geliebt habe... aber meine Mutter und mein Vater wollten das Beste für mich und meine kleine Schwester, also sind wir in ein besseres Viertel gezogen, wo es ein besseres Haus, eine bessere Schule und alles in allem \"nicht slumartig\" war, als wir in unser neues Viertel zogen. Im Laufe der Jahre, habe ich mich daran gewöhnt und habe neue Freunde gemacht, aber auch einige Feinde in der Schule. Ich habe mich nie wirklich mit meinen Nachbarn angefreundet, außer Mr. Glen und seinen Kindern sowie Dennis für ein bisschen, die direkt neben uns wohnen. Sie sind nett und ich kann sie fast als Familie betrachten und ich schätze sie wirklich. Ich erinnere mich, als mein Vater, meine Mutter, meine Schwester und ich zum Hochzeitstag von Mr. Glen gingen (Sie heirateten erneut) Es war wirklich Spaß und ich genoss mich, um es zu sagen, und etwas, an dem ich mich freue, eines Tages, wenn ich mein Vermögen aufbaue und meiner zukünftigen Frau das Leben einer Königin bieten kann. Als Mr. Glen's Frau, Ms. Veda, das weiße kleine Halfter von ihrem Bein abnahm und es wegwirf, habe ich es aufgefangen! Leider habe ich die Blumen nicht aufgefangen! Wir tanzten die ganze Nacht durch, und ich genoss es, mich mit Marsharii, einer ihrer Töchter, gut zu unterhalten. Ich habe sie aber leider nicht wieder gesehen. Ich hoffe, sie ist auf die größeren und besseren Dinge vorgerückt. Das Viertel ist wie ein Labyrinth, obwohl ich jetzt eine GPS habe, also kann ich mich mehr Zeit nehmen, es zu erkunden. Ich bin nur bis zu einem bestimmten Punkt gegangen, und das war, als ich mit meinen Freunden Kason und Curtis abgehangen bin. Wir haben früher viel Zeit mit Computerspielen verbracht und uns das Leben so gut wie möglich genossen. Manchmal ginge ich in den Park und genoss die Natur, was mich beruhigt und mich ein Gefühl von Frieden gibt. Ich bringe auch Stöcke mit, die ich in der Baumarkt gekauft habe und übe mein Gleichgewicht und bringe meinen Bokken-Bambus-Schwert mit, wenn ich kann.

I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge and I'm not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them... but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered \"not slum-like\" when we moved to our new neighborhood. Over the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, but also some new enemies in school. I never really got to know my neighbors over the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, who live right next to us. They have been nice people that I almost consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when I, my mom, my dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen's wedding (They got remarried) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I'm looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a queen. When Mr. Glen's wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Unfortunately I didn't catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven't seen her since though. I hope she's moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take my time to explore it. I've only been as far as when I've hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We used to spend a lot of time playing video games and just enjoying life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I'd go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I'll also bring some sticks that I bought from Home Depot and just practice my balance, and bring my bokken wooden sword if I can. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There's also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven't played tennis or basketball in a long time, It's still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad taught me and my best friend tennis with Mr. Graves, and we'd always have a great time... They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I think there are a lot of times I've had fun in this neighborhood, and there are plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best is yet to come!",

Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved.

But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road.

Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live.

Die meisten Gebäude sind Wohnhäuser, aber es gibt auch einige Restaurants und Bars, die Spaß machen und nicht sonderlich teuer sind. Eine der Bars wurde kürzlich umgetauft, und die ist teurer, aber es ist nicht wirklich das schlimmste Service oder Getränkeangebot. Die meisten Menschen sind nett. Sie sind entweder Studenten oder haben ein niedriges Einkommen, da die Wohnungsmiete nicht sehr teuer ist. Es gibt viele Kinder in der Nähe, da sich eine Grundschule in der Nähe meiner Wohnung befindet. Ich kenne meine Nachbarn nicht, aber ich will sie auch nicht wirklich kennen. Sie rauchen sehr viel Gras und daher haben die Verwaltung meines Hauses eine Luftbefeuchterin direkt gegenüber ihrer Tür gestellt, was mein Freund und ich sehr lustig fanden. Es ist fast ein Beleidigung. Die Gebäude, die mich umgeben, sehen in der Regel alt aus, aber mögen möglicherweise renovierte Innenräume haben. Ein Stück die Straße runter gibt es brandneue Wohnungen, aber ich mag sie nicht, weil ich weiß, dass die Bauarbeiten, die an ihnen durchgeführt wurden, nicht besonders gut waren. Sie sind billig gebaut, aber die Miete ist teuer, was ich als Betrug empfinde, aber weil sie sich in der Nähe des Campus befinden, kann die Verwaltung dieser Gebäude sich das leisten. Es gibt ein sehr billiges Restaurant etwa fünf Minuten von meinem Wohnort entfernt, das nur auf Pappbechern serviert und die meisten der Dinge, die sie machen, sind im Mikrowellengerät zubereitet. Dann ist direkt gegenüber ein Tankstelle, die ich gehört habe, ist nicht besonders ein guter Arbeitgeber zu sein. Aber dank von Geld aus der Stadt hat die Straße im letzten Sommer erneuert worden, sodass es jetzt eine große, breite Gehweg, viel Gras auf den Mittelstreifen und Seitenstraßen und jetzt ist der Bereich ein bisschen nett. Aber das Gebäude, in dem ich wohne, ist von Bäumen umgeben. Sie haben ein paar von ihnen gekappt, also sind ein paar Stümpfe übrig, aber es gibt viele mehr Bäume, wo ich wohne, als auf der gegenüberliegenden Straße. Hinter meinem Wohnkomplex ist eine Baumreihe und dann ein weiterer Gebäudekomplex. Ich wohne auf der 42. Straße, aber direkt dahinter ist die 43. Straße und die ist nicht so nett. Die Gehwege sind wirklich schlecht und fallen auseinander, und die meisten Gebäude auf dieser Straße sehen heruntergekommen aus. Es gibt viele Bäume auf dieser Straße, aber das ist wahrscheinlich, um das Aussehen der Gebäude zu verstecken. Die meisten Verbrechen in meiner Gegend sind im Apartmentkomplex auf dieser Straße passiert, aber ich kann sie auch nicht nur beschuldigen. Es gibt Wohnungen direkt gegenüber von mir, die auch eine Menge Kriminalität und eine eher flüchtige Bevölkerung haben. Aber ich denke, ich mag wo ich wohne. Ich kann es mir leisten und es gibt viele nützliche Einrichtungen in der Nähe. Ich mag besonders, wie die Universität innerhalb Laufweg ist und es gibt zwei Bushaltestellen, damit ich leicht in den Laden und in die Innenstadt kommen kann.\n\nDie deutsche Übersetzung wird dann zurück ins Englische übersetzt:\n\n[REWRITE]I live in an area that's near the college I attend, and I enjoy living there for that.

The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",

Sie sind abwechselnd platziert und so angeordnet, dass sie wie Einzelhäuser aussehen. Die einzige Abweichung ist, dass jeder mit gelben Farbe gestrichen ist, weißer Vorsprüngen und grünen Metalldächern. Fast alle, aber nicht alle, sind miteinander befreundet. Wir stehen am Ende einer nicht vorher beschlossenen Einfahrt zuweilen und plaudern, während die kleinen Kinder des Viertels mit ihren Spielsachen, Schnüre oder mit ihren Flugzeugen spielen. Es ist sehr erfrischend in dieser modernen, von Maschinen und Computern bestimmten Welt. Es ist vielmehr so, als ob man zurück in die Zeit zurückgekehrt ist. Wir sind umgeben von Feldern und Bäumen, die durch blaue Himmel und weiße Wolken noch erhöht werden. Der einzige Haken ist, dass wir dieser Saison Tornados melden und zum ersten Mal gestern Abend tatsächlich die echten Sirenen hörten, also mussten wir uns in den Keller begeben. Sicherlich, du hättest mich in meinem Badezimmer finden können, während ich meinen kleinsten Hund mit meiner Handtasche und einigen Kissen umklammert hielt. Mein großer Hund wollte nichts mit dem Bad zu tun haben und blieb im Wohnzimmer, nervös und winselnd, Nerven über die seltsamen Umstände. Das Viertel war ruhig, abgesehen von dem Geräusch, das große Hagelkörner machten, die überall auf dem Boden fielen. Nach dem Sturm war die Straße tatsächlich von dem Temperaturwechsel gesteamt. Wir gingen von 92 auf 75 Grad in wenigen Minuten. Der Hagel schmolz sofort, als er auf die heiße Straße traf. Als ich aufhob und zum klaren Himmel hinaufschaute, kam die Sonne heraus und es begann zu regnen. Ein doppeltes Regenbogen erschien. Ich ging ins Haus und nahm meine Kamera. Schnell machte ich Fotos, um sie mit meinen Facebook-Freunden und -Familie zu teilen. Sie waren erstaunt, genau wie ich. Die Straßen blieben noch eine Stunde ruhig, bevor einige Leute schließlich nach Hause kamen, wohin sie sich bei dem Sturm befanden. Dann war es wieder Geschäft wie gewohnt, Mütter und Kinder draußen, während das Abendessen kocht. Ein so freundliches Viertel für diese Frau, die kürzlich von NH nach NC gezogen ist. Ich liebe den südlichen Akzent, den die Menschen sprechen. Ich habe ein Zweibettzimmer und zwei Badezimmer in meinem Apartment, genau wie alle anderen. Obwohl alle Häuser von außen gleich aussehen, sind nicht alle Apartments intern gleich. Einige sind tatsächlich sehr klein. Es macht keinen Sinn für mich. Ich liebe es, entlang der größten Wiese hinter meinem Wohnort zu gehen und mich bis zum See zu begeben, der nicht zum Schwimmen gedacht ist. Ich habe Rehwild gesehen und in der Morgendämmerung kannst du das riesige Hähnchen singen hören. Es ist ein fantastischer Ort, um zu leben, nur vierzig Minuten von der Stadt Charlotte entfernt. Jeden Morgen begrüßt uns der Lärm von Hähnen, die von den umliegenden Farmen kommen. Es ist so, als ob man in einem kleinen Dorf lebt, das seine eigene Welt hat. Wir haben sogar ein Esel auf einer nahegelegenen Farm, das man jeden Abend hören kann, wenn es brüllt, um uns zu sagen, dass es da ist. Ich war glücklich, diesen kleinen Juwel eines Viertels zu finden.\n\nNow, I will translate the German text back to English:\n\n[REWRITE] My neighborhood is made up of duplexes on a dead-end street.

Es war für mich zunächst schwer, Freunde zu finden, aber ich bin letztendlich mit jemandem befreundet, der zwei Häuser weiter von mir wohnt, und einem anderen Jungen, der in meiner Straße lebt. Keiner dieser beiden lebt mehr hier, aber die Erinnerungen sind immer noch da. Die gleichen Leute, die hier lebten, als ich erst hierher gezogen bin, leben immer noch hier. Mein Viertel ist ähnlich einer durchschnittlichen amerikanischen Vorstadt. Das Viertel hat viele zweistöckige Häuser. Jeden Wochenende oder wenn es warm draußen ist, höre ich die Kinder draußen spielen. Das Viertel ist ruhig die meisten Tage der Woche. Ich habe nie ein Problem gehabt mit den Leuten in dem Viertel. Man lässt dich in diesem Viertel alleine, es sei denn, du brauchst Hilfe. Ich habe mehrere Pakete online bestellt und habe nie eines von meinem Vorgarten geklaut bekommen. Ich fühle mich bei meinem Nachbarn sicher. In ein paar Minuten Fußweg von meinem Haus ist ein Park. Ich habe viele Erinnerungen dort. Ich habe dort Basketball, Fußball und Baseball mit den anderen Jungen im Viertel gespielt. Ich habe auch einen meiner schlimmsten Erinnerungen dort gemacht, als ich beim Fußballspiel im Gesicht getroffen wurde, aber die guten Erinnerungen überwiegen die schlechten. Heutzutage gehe ich dorthin, um Zeit mit den Enkelkindern meines Cousins zu verbringen. Sie sind viel jünger als ich und mögen es noch immer, auf Spielgeräten und Schaukeln zu spielen. Der Gedanke daran, zum Park zu gehen, macht sie aufgeregt. Der Park macht mich nostalgisch, weil es viele Gründe dafür gibt. Das Viertel ist sehr vielfältig. Man kann dort alle Arten von Restaurants finden. In einem Radius von einem Meilenradius kann man chinesische, indische, mexikanische und italienische Restaurants finden. Allerdings nutzen viele Menschen heutzutage Apps wie GrubHub und DoorDash, um Essen zu sich nach Hause liefern zu lassen. Die beliebtesten Essensorte sind die Fastfood-Shops, aber man findet diese in fast jedem Vorstadtviertel. Es gibt auch viele Pizzarestaurants.

My neighborhood is similar to an average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses. Every weekend or just when it's warm outside, I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I never had a problem with anyone in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I've ordered multiple packages online and never had a package stolen from my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There's a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other kids in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park, it's to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me nostalgic for a number of different reasons. The neighborhood is very diverse. You can find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one-mile radius, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays a lot of people use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast-food shops, but you can find those in almost any suburban neighborhood. There are also a lot of pizza places. The stores here have everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There are a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse, like an Indian-owned store if you ever feel like making some homemade Indian food or buying some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I'm a big fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.[/REWRITE]",

    "original": "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",

Sie fällt nicht durch die Landschaft von South Carolina, aber sie hat einen bedeutenden Einfluss auf die Agrarsektor. Johnston wird als \"Peach Capital of the World\" bekannt, was auch auf dem begrüßenden Schild verewigt ist. Sie besteht hauptsächlich aus Ackerland, das von Peach-Bäumen oder Rinderdomestiken dominiert ist. Die Häuser, die nicht in der Stadtmitte liegen, sind weit voneinander entfernt; die meisten sind zweistöckig mit Metalldächern, um dem heißen Sommerwetter zu widerstehen, oder grauen Schindeln. Oftmals sind sie nicht an der Straße gelegen, sondern weiter hinten, um die vorderen Felder für Tiere oder Feldfrüchte zu nutzen. In der Stadtmitte gibt es einen einzelnen Ampelkreuzungspunkt. Hier befinden sich die einzigen Geschäfte in der gesamten Stadt. Es gibt drei Orte, an denen man \"Fast Food\" bekommen kann: Hong Kong, eine kleine chinesische Gaststätte, die von einer Familie betrieben wird, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant oder Gary's, ein kleiner Burger-Imbiss. Es gab einmal eine Pizzeria, die jedoch vor Kurzem geschlossen wurde. Es gibt eine sehr kleine, von einer Familie betriebene Apotheke namens Maxwell and Halford Drug; zum Glück sind sie vor allem für den Cherry-Coca-Cola bekannt, den sie verkaufen. Es gibt ein kleines, aber teures Einkaufszentrum namens Independent Grocers Alliance, auch bekannt als IGA. Obwohl es der einzige Supermarkt in der gesamten Stadt ist, kaufen viele Einwohner nur ein oder zwei Artikel; die meisten bevorzugen es, in die Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville zu fahren, um die meisten ihrer Lebensmittel einzukaufen. Die beliebteste Einrichtung in der gesamten Stadt ist Dollar General; dieses Geschäft verkauft eine Vielzahl von Alltagsartikeln und ist oft von der Öffnung bis zur Schließung abgesehen sehr beliebt! Es gibt ein sehr kleines Möbelgeschäft namens Possibilities Furniture & More, das von einer freundlichen Frau betrieben wird, die in der Gemeinschaft bekannt ist. Das Geschäft ist schon seit einer Vielzahl von Jahren in Johnston und beschäftigt sogar zwei Möbeltransporter, die die gekauften Möbel liefern! An das Möbelgeschäft angrenzend befindet sich ein kleines Tiergrooming namens Clark's Cuts and Kennels. Sie bieten eine Vielzahl von Dienstleistungen wie Tagespflege, Krankenhausversorgung, Fellpflege, Nagelgrinden, Baden usw. an. Beide eine Arzt- und eine Tierarztpraxis sind außerhalb der Hauptstadtteil gelegen; sie sind beide sehr kleine Praxen, obwohl sie gut ausgestattet sind, um die Bewohner von Johnston zu unterstützen. Es gibt ein einziges Grundschulzentrum namens Johnston Elementary School. Sobald die Schüler die fünfte Klasse beendet haben, müssen sie in der nächsten Stadt in die Mittelschule und Oberschule gehen. Es gibt technisch gesprochen keine Parks in der Stadt, aber sie arbeiten gerade an der Schaffung eines 2,5 Hektar großen Freizeitgeländes, um Familien mit mehr Möglichkeiten zum Ausgehen und die Anziehung von mehr Besuchern/Potenzialbesitzern zu ermöglichen. Ehrlich gesagt gibt es nicht viel zu tun; es gibt keine Kinos, Bowlingbahnen, \"Hängenbleiben\"-Stellen, Spielplätze für Kinder, Orte zum Spazieren fahren mit Hunden oder eine große Vielfalt an Restaurants. Trotzdem ist es eine nette Stadt, so klein, dass man sie im Blickwinkel verpassen könnte, ohne es zu merken!\n\nDie Übersetzung zurück ins Englisch:\n\n[REWRITE] My neighborhood is a small, charming town.

Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me.

Fast jedes Apartment in der Gegend kostete über tausend Dollar im Monat. Ich hatte nie davon gehört und auch keine meiner Freunde. Vielleicht ist es das Elend. Ich kenne einige meiner Freunde, die sich bei Nacht weinen. Dinge sind teuer, aber wir haben gelernt, sparsam zu sein. Du beginnst, den Staubgeruch von Flohmärkten-Lieblingspielzeug und verstaubten Kleidern zu mögen. Du riechst weniger in der Erwachsenenwelt. Du beginnst vielleicht, Zigaretten zu rauchen, oder du bist einfach zu den Dingen gewöhnt. Aber der Flohmarkt behauptet sich immer. Der Staubgeruch der Erwachsenenwelt ist staubige Magazine auf einem geschlossenen Klavier. Er bohrt sich in das Leder und bleibt, auch nachdem du es gewaschen hast. Hier gibt es in der Nähe drei Second-Hand-Läden. Wenn du von der anderen Seite beginnst, kannst du zwei Wohltätigkeitsläden, eine Bibliothek, einen seltenen Buchladen und einen Kuriositätengeschäft besuchen. Die Innenstadt ist dicht, Autos und Menschen füllen die Straßen jeden Morgen, aber du hörst es nicht in den Second-Hand-Läden. Obwohl viele Menschen oder Autos vorbeifahren, ist das Geschäft still. Es ist ein schöner Ort, um einen Nachmittag zu verlieren. Jedes Jahr gibt es mehr und mehr von ihnen. Autos und Menschen überschwemmen es. Es ist ein wachsendes Stadtgebiet, sagen sie. Es ist hier der Sitz eines der größten Onlineimperien für E-Commerce und Lieferung, es zeigt immer noch Schmerzen in der Wachstumsphase. Es erinnert mich an New York. Alles und alle konzentrieren sich auf ihre eigenen Ziele, und es ist nicht viel, was jemand von dir verlangt. Du kannst allein, still und unabhängig sein und die Leute werden dich in Ruhe lassen. Es ist nicht so wie der Süden, wo ein bisschen Mitgefühl bedeutet, dass du dich kümmern möchtest. Man stößt nicht in das Leben anderer ein. Du kannst so lange deine Schale um dich herum behalten, wie du willst, und die Stadt wird sich wie Wellen am Strand setzen und zurückrollen. Es ist ein lebendiger Ort. Zwischen dem Pianisten nebenan und den zwei Laiensängern oben ist immer etwas los. In einer Weise haben wir weniger ein Apartment voller Fremder und mehr eine Gemeinschaft von Freunden. Wir treffen uns für unsere Bedürfnisse, feiern Geburtstage, begehen Beerdigungen und helfen einander, wenn wir können. Auf eine Weise bin ich glücklich, hier zu sein. Ich mag die meisten meiner Nachbarn und sie behandeln mich ziemlich gut. Ich versuche, mich zu reinigen und ihnen Essen zu hinterlassen und sie tun das auch, in Gegenwart. Ich bringe ihnen Post und sie bringen mir Post. Es ist schön, sie zu sehen und ich denke, dass sie meinen Aufenthalt genauso genießen, wie ich ihren. Ich wohne in einer riesigen, entmenschenverachtenden, modernen Siedlung, aber es sind Leute wie meine Nachbarn, die mich dazu bringen, mich nicht zu fühlen, als hätte ich mein Leben komplett ruiniert.\n\nEnglish translation back to English:\n\n[REWRITE] The first time I heard about my place, I was listening to an episode about people who'd gone missing.

For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",

Besonders für meinen Stadtteil ist die Präsenz einer Verwaltungsstiftung sehr offensichtlich. Wenn man hereinkommt, sieht man nichts als gepflegte Einfamilienhäuser, die wir der Verwaltungsstiftung zu verdanken haben. Die Vorgärten sehen alle sehr ähnlich aus. Es gibt einen kleinen Rasen, ein paar dekorative Steine und recht kurze Einfahrten. Man sieht manchmal auch kleine Bäume. Jeder hat ein Abstellplatz für zwei Autos. Wenn man sich durch den Stadtteil fährt, sieht man neues Beton. Trotz vielen verschiedenen Familien, die hier leben, sind die Straßen in ausgezeichneter Verfassung. Man findet keine Löcher oder ähnliches. Die meisten Häuser sind einstöckig, aber manchmal sieht man auch zwei Stockwerke. Wir haben keine typische Briefkasten-Anordnung wie man sie für Einfamilienhäuser erwarten würde. Es gibt keine Briefkästen vor jedem Haus. Stattdessen ist es ähnlich wie in einer Wohnung, wo es eine große Anzahl an Briefkästen am Ende der Straße gibt. Jeder muss einen Schlüssel haben, um auf seinen Briefkasten zuzugreifen. Und es gibt zwei größere Abholplätze für Pakete. Nochmals, man kann der Verwaltungsstiftung und deren Obsession mit Uniformität für das danken. Meine Adresse befindet sich am äußersten Rand der nahegelegenen Stadt, also kann man meinen Stadtteil als Teil der Landwirtschaft, Teil der Vorstädte beschreiben. Als Ergebnis haben wir viel Land, um alles zu machen. Es gibt mehrere Gemeinschaftspools, zu denen jeder hier leben kann. Es wird gut gepflegt und ist eingezäunt. Außerdem gibt es verschiedene Wanderwege, wo man seinen Hund ausführen kann oder einfach nur einen Abendspaziergang machen kann. Man muss nicht in ein Park gehen, um sich zu bewegen. Der Stadtteil ist groß genug, dass man einfach drumherum laufen kann und genug Bewegung bekommt. Die Mehrheit der Gemeinschaft besteht aus pensionierten Menschen. Es ist ein sehr sicheres Gebiet und jeder schaut sich gegenseitig aus. Miteingemischt sind auch einige mittelalte und junge Profis. In Bezug auf die Stadt ist es überraschend groß - zumindest was die Einwohnerzahl angeht - aber auch hat einen kleinen Städtchen-Geist. Wir haben die überwiegende Mehrheit der Einrichtungen, die man erwarten und abhängig ist. Zum Beispiel haben wir genau einen Einkaufszentrum. Es ist nicht groß, aber es reicht aus. Für mich dauert es etwa 15 Minuten Fahrtzeit, bis man zu etwas Bedeutendem kommt, aber wenn man das tut, bin ich mit vielen verschiedenen Läden konfrontiert. Wir haben alles von hochwertigen Lebensmittelläden, wo man organische Lebensmittel kaufen kann, bis hin zu niedrigpreisigen Läden, die nur eine kleine Auswahl an Artikeln haben und mit dem Minimum an Personal auskommen, um Kosten zu sparen. Insgesamt ist mein Stadtteil sicher, gepflegt und ziemlich typisch. Wir haben viele nette Dinge, wie Pool und Wanderwege. Und obwohl wir nicht direkt neben einem Einkaufszentrum wohnen, kann man einfach in den Wagen steigen und zu jedem größeren Laden fahren, den man möchte.\n\nEnglish translation back to English:\n\n[REWRITE] The general area where I live can be described as typical cookie-cutter suburbia. The presence of a homeowners association is particularly apparent in my neighborhood. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single-family homes, thanks to the homeowners association. The front yards are all very similar, featuring a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and relatively short driveways. Every so often, you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two-car garage. As you continue driving through the neighborhood, you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition, with no potholes or anything like that. Most of the houses are single-story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox setup you'd expect for single-family homes, with no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments, with a large group of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to access their specific mailbox, and there are two larger lockers for packages. We can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. My house is located on the outskirts of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as a mix of rural and suburban areas. As a result, we have plenty of land for everything. There are multiple community pools, which are well-maintained and gated, and various walking trails where you can walk your dog or take an evening stroll. You don't need to go to a park to get some exercise; the neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get plenty of exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people, but it's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. There's also a small number of middle-aged and young professionals mixed in. In terms of the city, it's surprisingly large – at least by population – but also has a small-town feel. We have the majority of amenities you'd expect and rely on, including a single mall that's not huge but gets the job done. It takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once you do, you're greeted with many different stores to choose from, including high-end grocery stores with organic options and bargain outlets with minimal staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical, with many nice features like pools and walking trails. And while we're not right next to any shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain you'd like. [/REWRITE]",

Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff.

Mein direkter Nachbarschaftsbezirk, auf der östlichen Seite des Dorfes, könnte als der wirtschaftlich am wenigsten begünstigte Teil des Dorfes beschrieben werden. Die Eigentumswohnungswerte sind niedrig, mit den meisten Häusern werden von Menschen mit niedrigem Einkommen gemietet oder besessen. Es ist jedoch nicht unattraktiv oder unangenehm. Meine Nachbarn sind Menschen, die grundsätzlich freundlich sind und sich mit einem Lächeln und einem Gruß grüßen, wenn ich die Straße entlanggehe. Die Kriminalitätsraten, obwohl leicht höher als in anderen Teilen des Dorfes, sind im Allgemeinen noch niedrig. Es gab in den letzten zehn Jahren einige gewaltsame Verbrechen in den letzten wenigen Blöcken meiner Wohnung, einschließlich einiger Schießereien und mindestens eines Mordes. Unsere Nachbarn haben ihren Sohn in einer Schießerei vor einem Barraum in letztem Jahr verloren. Glücklicherweise hat unsere Familie keine direkten Auswirkungen durch Kriminalität erlitten, außer wenn wir unsere Terrasse vergessen haben und ein Gegenstand verschwindet. Insgesamt hat das Dorf, in dem ich wohne, von der \"Opiumepidemie\", die viele Teile der Vereinigten Staaten betroffen hat, stark betroffen worden. Viele Menschen sind aufgrund von Fentanyl-Überdosen ums Leben gekommen. Glücklicherweise gibt es in meinem Dorf viele Ressourcen, um diese Epidemie zu bekämpfen, einschließlich mehrerer Suchttherapiezentren und Narcan-Schulungen für Familien und Freunde der von der Sucht betroffenen Menschen. Trotz dieser Herausforderungen hat unser Dorf viele positive Eigenschaften. Mein Sohnes Grundschule hat hervorragende Mitarbeiter, von der Schulleitung bis zu den Lehrern und dem Supportpersonal. Trotz der Sonderbedürfnisse meines Sohnes hat er sich bis jetzt noch keinen Mobbing erlebt, da die Schule eine außergewöhnlich positive Atmosphäre hat, und er liebt sie dort. Wir haben eine aktive Eltern-Kind-Gruppe, die während des Jahres mehrere Veranstaltungen plant, um die Beteiligung der Familien und den Bildungsfortschritt zu fördern. Da mehr als 20 % der Bevölkerung unseres Dorfes unter der Armutsgrenze lebt, bietet die Grundschule kostenlose Frühstück und Mittagessen allen Schülern an, so dass kein Kind jemals hungrig sein muss. Kein Kind oder keine Familie wird wegen ihres Unvermögens als \"weniger wert\" behandelt und die Kosten für Schulgebühren, Schulbedarf und Ausflüge sind sehr angemessen. Die Stadtverwaltung und das Personal haben viele Verbesserungen an der Erscheinung unseres Dorfes vorgenommen, einschließlich der Asphaltierung von Straßen, Landschaftsbau und der Sanierung der städtischen Parks. Leider wurden die meisten dieser Verbesserungen in der Innenstadt und auf der westlichen Seite vorgenommen, wo sich alle Einkaufsgebiete befinden und die meisten Verkehrsmassen durch fließen. Die östliche Seite, an der ich wohne, wird tendenziell vernachlässigt, was ein Streitpunkt für meine Nachbarn ist. Insgesamt genieße ich es, in diesem Dorf zu leben. Die Menschen sind grundsätzlich freundlich, die Schulen sind großartig, es gibt genug Einkaufsmöglichkeiten (kleine Unternehmen und größere Einzelhandelsunternehmen) , um die Bedürfnisse meiner Familie zu erfüllen, und unsere Wohnung mag nicht viel wert sein, aber sie ist bequem und ausreichend. Unsere Familie hat hier seit über 16 Jahren gelebt, und wir können uns nicht vorstellen, in einem anderen Ort zu leben.\n\nTranslation back to English:\n\n[REWRITE] I live in a small town in the Midwest that is outside the suburbs of a major city.

    "original": "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",

Ich wohne in einem siebenstöckigen Apartmenthaus direkt gegenüber dem alten Theater und ein Block entfernt befindet sich dieses kleine, coole Arcade-Bar, an die sich auf warmen Sommerabenden verschiedenste Menschen ziehen. Oftmals, besonders am Wochenende im Juni und Juli, siehst du eine Schlange von Menschen, die nur herein gelassen werden wollen. Ein paar Blocks entfernt liegt der nächste Stadtteilpark. Er ist ziemlich groß, wenn man bedenkt, in welchem Teil der Stadt er steht. Um den Park herum ist Beton mit hohen Treppen in die Wand gepourt. Während der frostigen Wintermonate stellen sich Obdachlose ihre Zelte aufgereiht entlang der Straße und entlang der breiten Stufen auf. Es schneit nicht viel, aber es regnet, und der heftige Regen im Mittelwinter macht es oft schwierig, warm zu bleiben. Das Aufstellen ihrer Zelte direkt nebeneinander, in der Mitte der Stadt, anstatt in der Wildnis, hält sie viel wärmer. Sie sind auch in einer vernünftigen Fußgänger- und Verkehrsdistanz zum einzigen Familienzentrum in der Gegend, wo sie baden und duschen können. Was ich an meiner Stadt liebe, ist jedoch nicht die Schönheit der historischen Natur – die hohen stolzen Gebäude, die Architektur, die durch die verschiedenen Ebenen der Hügel verteilt ist, die sich hinunter zum Meer rollen. Was ich an meinem Viertel liebe, ist die Kultur der Menschen selbst. Siehst du, Hilltop war einst das berüchtigtste Viertel auf der Westküste für Gewalt durch Banden. Man hört immer noch Geschichten darüber, selbst drei Dekaden später, von Bundesbehörden und der DEA, die wie mit einem Besen durch die Straßen fegten, um sie sauber zu machen. Die Menschen vergessen das nicht. Die Geschichten werden von Generation zu Generation weitergegeben, bis hin zu Neuankömmlingen wie mir, von jenen Tagen. Die Leute arbeiten hart, obwohl es immer noch eines der raueren 'Viertel' in der gesamten Stadt ist, um es sauber zu halten. Sie kümmern sich immer noch darum, was in ihrer Stadt, auf ihrem Block passiert. Sie sagen, wenn du weiß bist, solltest du das Viertel nachts nicht durchqueren. Wörtlich glaube ich, dass diese Warnung an die alten Tage erinnert und mit dem bitteren Geschmack der sozialen Bedingung geprägt ist. Vielleicht bin ich nur dunkel genug, um für eine nicht ganz \"weiße Mädchen\" durchzugehen, oder vielleicht erkennt Hilltop mich als eine von ihnen an, jemand, der genauso schmerzhaft bewusst ist von den Erinnerungen, die uns unsere Nation ständig heimsuchen. Die Erinnerungen daran, dass Rassismus, kulturelle Bedingung und Annahmen aus Ahnungslosigkeit und Angst gemacht werden, sogar in einer Stadt, die als kultureller Melting-Pot-Utopia galt. Ich weiß eines: egal wie weit ich mich bewege, Hilltop ist mein Zuhause. Ich fühle mich lebendig, wenn ich diese Straßen nachts entlanggehe, mich mit Menschen treffe, die mir viel schneller und selten neidisch ein Jackett angeboten haben, als mich zu berauben. Es ist ein Ort, an dem Ladenbesitzer geöffnet haben, um ein paar Minuten länger, damit ich mein Handy aufladen konnte, als ich nirgendwohin fliehen konnte, als der Regen kam. Es ist ein Ort, an dem ich mich, mich selbst als unsichtbar fühlte, mich an die Betonfassaden geschmiegt habe in den grausten widrigsten der Nächte, nur um jemanden zu sehen, der auf mich hinunteersieht, mir 5 US-Dollar gibt und mir sagt, dass ich wertvoll und schön bin.\n\n[REWRITE]My neighborhood is rich in culture.

    "original": "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",

They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong.

Es gibt keine großen Einkaufszentren, keine Walmart, Target oder sogar kein Applebee’s. Überall, wohin du auch gehst, musst du fahren, um dorthin zu kommen. Trotzdem lebe ich in einem der schönsten Orte der Welt, umgeben von Wasser. Meine „Stadt“ ist umgeben von Wasser. Das wunderschöne Lake Michigan auf einer Seite und Lake Charlevoix auf der anderen. Überall, wohin du gehst, findest du einen Strand, an dem du deine Zehen in das Wasser tauchst. Meine Nachbarschaft spiegelt die Idee eines kleinen Ortes wider. Die Häuser sind nicht aufeinander gestapelt. Sie sind nicht identische Häuser, die gleich gebaut sind. Sie sind ältere Häuser, einige davon werden modernisiert oder überholt, einige davon sind älter. Die meisten Häuser haben Kellerräume. Vollständige Kellerräume, die man von der Straße aus sehen kann. Viele Häuser in der Nachbarschaft haben altes Aluminiumdachblech. Wir haben Häuser in jedem Farbton, den man sich vorstellen kann, in den Blöcken, die mein Haus umgeben. Die meisten Häuser haben Gärten. Gärten mit Trampolinen und Spielgeräten. Einige Leute haben Gärten und Zäune für ihre Tiere. Die Häuser erinnern sich an das Bild von Mittelamerika. Hart arbeitende Menschen, die arbeiten, um einen Lebensunterhalt zu verdienen und entweder Familien aufziehen oder haben bereits Familien aufgezogen. Jeden Tag siehst du Kinder, die die Straßen hinauf und herunter laufen. Du siehst auch Leute, die Hunde spazieren führen, radeln und Rodeln. Die Nachbarn kennen sich und man kann erkennen, wer sich hineinpasst und wer nicht. Man sieht jemanden, der draußen grillt und winkt, oder sogar jemanden, der ein paar Blöcke weiter seinen Hund spazieren führt und freundlich lächelt. Die Rasenflächen sind in ordentlichem Zustand. Niemand hat Blätter gestapelt, die man im Herbst findet. Gras ist geschnitten und unter Kontrolle gehalten. Wenn Leute Pflanzen und Büsche in ihren Gärten haben, werden sie geschnitten. Es ist keine schöne Nachbarschaft, die du in ein und aus fährst und denkst: 'Wow, was für schöne Häuser!' Aber es ist eine, in die du eintauchst und denkst, das wäre hier ein guter Ort, um eine Familie großzuziehen. Es ist ruhig, friedlich und sicher. Während es nur durchschnittlich aussieht, ist es außergewöhnlich wegen des Faktums, dass es das darstellt, was die Leute in der Welt wollen, nämlich einen sicheren Ort zum Abschalten. In Laufnähe befindet sich das County-Justizministerium und das Gefängnis. Die Gesundheitsabteilung liegt direkt daneben. Die Stadt-Recycling-Anlage liegt nur ein Stückchen die Straße weiter, und die Nachbarn und die Bewohner aus der ganzen Stadt nutzen die Dienste, die sie anbieten. Wir haben Baseball- und Softballfelder in der Nähe, wo man die Rufe der Kommentatoren hören und die Namen der Spieler nennen kann. Unser kleiner Flughafen liegt direkt neben. Man kann draußen spielen oder drinnen sein und die Rumpfgeräusche der kleinen Flugzeuge hören, die ab- und landen. Man kann zu Fuß Eiscreme aus dem örtlichen Eiscreme-Shop holen, und wenn man wirklich dran ist, kann man es bis in die Stadt schaffen, von unserem Wohngebiet aus. Meine Kinder können auf ihren Fahrrädern zum Park fahren, der nur ungefähr 8 Blocks entfernt liegt. Es ist ein wirklich großartiger Ort, um zu leben.\n\nEnglish translation back to English:\n[REWRITE] I live in rural America, specifically in a small town in Michigan.
