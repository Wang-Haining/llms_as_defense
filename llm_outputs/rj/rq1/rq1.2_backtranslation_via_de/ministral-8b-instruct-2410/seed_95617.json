Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",

    "original": "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",

Sie kam aus einer Stadt, in der der Supermarkt nur fünf Minuten zu Fuß von ihrem Haus entfernt war – sie hatte in ihrem Leben noch nie so viel offene Landschaft gesehen. Beeindruckt von der Häufigkeit der Maisfelder, erzählte ich ihr von meinem Leben auf dem Land in Ohio, und in diesem Moment wusste sie, wer ich war und wo ich herkam. Wenn man die zweispurige Landstraße entlang fährt, erreicht man ein Steinbruch, der mit Wasser gefüllt ist. Just past dem Steinbruch liegt die kleine Siedlung, in der ich lebe. Die Häuser bestehen mostly aus Backstein und Stuck. Alle Häuser haben mindestens eine halbe Acre Land zu sich selbst, um die sich jeder Stolz bemüht. Im Frühling gibt es viele jedes Jahr neu gepflanzte Blumen sowie mittelländische Bäume, die sich mit jeder Jahreszeit ändern. Die Einfahrten sind alle mit den Luxusfahrzeugen Mercedes-Benz gefüllt, die im Mittagslicht funkeln, nach einer guten, altmodischen Autowäsche. Weiter entlang der Straße zu meinem grauen Stuckhaus ist mein koreanischer Nachbar immer draußen mit einem freundlichen Gesicht. Er neigt dazu, den ganzen Tag seinen Rasen zu mähen und ist beim Summen seines Rasenmähers zu hören. Alle in der Nachbarschaft lachen über ihn, aber er ist immer aufrichtig und eine unglaubliche Person mit einer besonderen Geschichte. Er ist älter geworden und hat einiges von seinem geistigen Scharfsinn verloren. In seiner Vergangenheit war er ein Arzt und verschmilzt normalerweise mit dem Gras und seinem John Deere Zero Turn Rasenmäher. Schließlich erreicht man mein Zuhause. Im Seitenhof gibt es viele Gänse, die von unserem Terrier gejagt werden. Hinten gibt es einen kleinen Bach, der in den Steinbruch fließt. Hier kann man Frösche, den Bach und das gelegentliche “Muh” der nahen Farmen hören. Über die handgefertigte Holzbücke ist ein unberührter Oasen, gefüllt mit naturbelassenen Bäumen, Kräutern und Wildblumen. Hier habe ich die meiste Zeit meiner Kindheit verbracht. Von Baumhäusern bauen bis zum ‘Jagen’ von Tieren, es gab immer etwas zu tun und meistens ein Kind aus der Nachbarschaft, um Freundschaft zu schließen. Die Winter in meiner kleinen Stadt können schmerzhaft brutal sein, aber nichts ist schöner. Der Garten verwandelt sich von einem Meer aus Grün in eine leere Wildnis. Die Bäume, die einst vibrierend pink, lila und orange Blumen trugen, verwandeln sich in nackte Baumstämme. Wenn es Snowfall gibt, erscheint eine Winterwunderland über Nacht. Der Hof ist mit Schneemännchen und Schneeengeln der kleinen Schwester gesäumt, die wir uns als Kinder gebaut haben. Wir kämpften oft als Kinder und im Winter wurden Schneebälle unsere Waffen. Wir bauten riesige Iglu-artige Festungen, um unsere Waffen zu beherbergen, normalerweise mit Ästen, wie eine Armee. In unserer eigenen kleinen Wunderwelt spielten wir in einer Zeit, in der nichts anderes zählte. Wir waren nur junge Kinder ohne Sorgen.\n\n[REWRITE] “Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world. [/REWRITE]",

The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes.

The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",

No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",

Die öffentliche Verkehrsanbindung ist sehr gut und ist eine der beliebtesten Formen des Transports in New York City. Bensonhurt ist ein relativ städtisches Viertel, sodass Sie sich immer noch wie in New York City fühlen werden. Während Ihres Besuchs sollten Sie sich auf die verschiedenen asiatischen Geschäfte vorbereiten, die überall zu finden sind. In den letzten beiden Jahrzehnten hat Bensonhurt einen Zufluss asiatischer Einwohner erlebt. Daher werden Sie mindestens einen asiatischen Laden pro Block sehen, wenn Sie durch die Gegend laufen. Die beliebtesten Geschäfte sind Supermärkte und Waschsalons. Diese Unternehmen sind bei den lokalen Bewohnern sehr beliebt, da die Qualität der Lebensmittel in den Supermärkten hervorragend ist, die Preise viel günstiger sind und sie sehr bequem sind. In der Nähe meines Wohnortes gibt es vier asiatische Supermärkte, die innerhalb von zwei Minuten zu Fuß von einander entfernt sind. Dies erhöht nur die Bequemlichkeit beim Einkaufen von Lebensmitteln. Ich möchte nicht sagen, dass Bensonhurst nur von asiatischen Bewohnern bewohnt ist, obwohl es hier sehr vielfältig ist, mit Einwanderern und ihren ersten- und zweiten Generationen von amerikanischen Kindern. Die meisten großen und beliebten Unternehmen in der Umgebung sind asiatisch. Neben diesen asiatischen Unternehmen gibt es auch einen kürzlich renovierten Park in der Nähe, der etwa zehn Basketballplätze, ein großes Feld für Fußball oder Baseball, vier Handballplätze, Schaukeln, eine Spielplatz für Kinder und sogar einen Brunnen für Kinder, um im Sommer Wasser zu genießen, bietet. Da wir in New York City sind, sind natürlich die Parks sehr vielfältig. Sie werden hier alle Arten von Vielfalt sehen, die gut zusammenleben können. In diesem Viertel gibt es nicht viele große Geschäftsgebäude. Die einzigen Gebäude, die Sie finden werden, sind solche für die Gründung von Genossenschaften oder Wohnungen in Eigentumswohnungen. Die Mehrzahl der Wohnungen sind Zweifamilienhäuser, obwohl die meisten Menschen sehr nett, aber sehr laut sind. Jeden Tag hören Sie Autos, die ihre Musik aufdrehen, wenn sie an Ihrem Haus vorbeifahren, oder Menschen, die Gaspedal durchdrücken, um Sie morgens aufzuwecken. Wenn Sie planen, nachts zu besuchen, sollten Sie vorsichtig sein. Dieses Viertel ist relativ sicher, aber die Menschen sind unvorhersehbar. Sie könnten auf Menschen stoßen, die ohne Grund Ärger suchen, Rowdies und Diebe. Ich selbst wurde in diesem Viertel in der Vergangenheit durch körperliche Gewalt belästigt, aber das ist viele Jahre her. Ein jüngster Vorfall betraf den Diebstahl von Paketen. Obwohl es ein häufiges Problem gibt, gibt es auch Paketdiebe in diesem Viertel. Letztendlich, obwohl New York City eine Strafe für Menschen hat, die ihre Hunde nicht sauber halten, halten sich die Menschen hier nicht an die Regeln. Jeden Morgen sehen Sie auf dem Weg zum Bahnhof oder zum Supermarkt mindestens eine Hundehaufen auf dem Weg. Mein größtes Ärgernis ist der Hundedreck auf dem Boden überall, wo ich hingehe in diesem Viertel. Seien Sie vorsichtig und halten Sie Ihre Schuhe sauber!\n\n**Back to English:**\n\nIf you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it!

Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean! [/REWRITE]",
    "transformed": "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as the quality of food in the supermarkets is superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian-owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer.

Alles scheint nach unten zu fließen, und mein Haus steht genau oben auf dem steilsten Hügel im Viertel. Die Leute nennen ihn den \"Fitnesshügel\", weil so viele Jogger gerne daran hochlaufen. Da gibt es keine Gehsteige auf meiner Straße, also läuft jeder auf der Straße. Die Straße ist an einigen Stellen löchrig und kann fürs Fahren gefährlich sein. Einige der Telefon- und Stromleitungen, die um den Block verlaufen, sehen zerlumpt aus. Es regnet und stürmt oft bei uns, sodass Äste und anderes Zeug die Stromleitungen herunterschlagen und die ständigen Reparaturen sie aussehen lassen wie ein Flickwerk. Überall gibt es große immergrüne Bäume. Die Menschen hier hassen die Bäume. Sie versuchen, so viele wie möglich gefällt zu bekommen, weil die Bäume den Meerblick versperren. Daher sind viele der Häuser so hoch oben am Hügel gebaut, mit riesigen glassfrontigen Dachgeschossen, die einer nach dem anderen aufragen, um den Blick auf die Bucht zu haben. Es ist wunderschön um Sonnenuntergang, wenn das Wasser von unten erleuchtet zu sein scheint und der Himmel orange wird. Es ist meist bewölkt, sodass du die meiste Zeit das Sonnenlicht durch Nebel siehst. Die meisten Tage sind bewölkt und feucht. Moos wächst auf allem, was es kann: Dächern, Autos und Geländern. Einmal ließ ich mein Auto einen Monat lang in meiner Einfahrt stehen, und als ich es verwenden wollte, war es grün und pelzig mit Moos. Es dauerte drei Stunden, es wieder abzukehren. Es gibt nicht viele Kinder in meiner Nachbarschaft, obwohl es nur ein paar Blocks entfernt eine Schule gibt. Die meisten Menschen in meiner Nachbarschaft sind älter, viele von ihnen pensioniert. Statt Kindern haben die Menschen Hunde. Es ist normal, sie in den Gärten oder auf der Straße hintereinander herjagen zu sehen. Wenn du eine Tür oder ein Fenster offen lässt, riskierst du, dass sie in dein Haus schlüpfen. Einmal fand ich einen in meinem Wohnzimmer und musste ihn durch die vordere Tür hinausscheuchen. Hasen laufen wild in der Gegend herum. Einige von ihnen sind groß, und die Gärtner hassen sie, weil sie die Pflanzenwurzeln ausgraben und in den Rasen buddeln. Meine Katzen lieben sie, und sie haben fast alle aus unserer Nachbarschaft gejagt. Wir bekommen auch die übliche Auswahl an Vögeln: kleine Spatzen und Kolibris, und manchmal kreisen ein Habicht oder ein Adler über der Nachbarschaft, bis die Krähen ihn vertreiben. Es gibt keine Läden in der Nähe, aber wenn du den Hügel hinabwanderst bis zum Wasser, gibt es einige Restaurants, die frischen Fisch servieren. Es gibt nicht viel Strand dort, aber die Felsen am Ufer sind Spaß, wenn man Steine ins Wasser schleudert. Die Bucht ist nicht sehr breit. Man kann die gegenüberliegende Küste klar durch den Nebel sehen an den meisten Tagen.\n\n**Back to English:**\n\n[REWRITE] There aren't many sidewalks where I live.

    "original": "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",

High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit.

    "original": "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",

Zuerst einmal war ich sehr traurig, als ich in mein Viertel zog. Ich kam von Riverdale nach Stockbridge, und ich werde nicht lügen, ich habe geweint, weil ich sie vermisste und sie liebte. Aber Mama und Papa wollten das Beste für mich und meine kleine Schwester, also zogen wir in ein besseres Wohngebiet, eine bessere High School, alles war als \"nicht Gang\" angesehen, als wir in unser neues Viertel zogen. Im Laufe der Jahre habe ich mich daran gewöhnt und einige neue Freunde und auch einige neue Feinde in der Schule gemacht. Ich habe die Nachbarn nie wirklich richtig kennengelernt, außer Mr. Glen und seine Kinder sowie Dennis für eine Weile, die direkt neben uns wohnten. Sie sind nette Menschen, die ich fast als Familie betrachten kann, und ich schätze sie wirklich sehr. Ich erinnere mich, als ich, Mama, Papa und meine Schwester zur Hochzeit von Mr. Glen gingen (Sie haben sich wieder verheiratet), es war wirklich lustig und unterhaltsam, um es milde auszudrücken, und etwas, auf das ich mich freue, wenn ich mein Vermögen baue und meiner zukünftigen Frau das Leben einer Königin gebe. Als Mrs. Glen, Ms. Veda, den weißen Streifen an ihrem Bein abnahm und ihn warf, habe ich ihn gefangen! Leider habe ich die Blumen nicht gefangen! Wir haben die Nacht weggetanzt, und ich habe es wirklich genossen, gute Zeiten mit Marsharii, einer ihrer Töchter zu haben. Ich habe sie seitdem nicht mehr gesehen. Ich hoffe, sie ist weitergekommen und hat Besseres erreicht. Das Viertel selbst ist wie ein Labyrinth, obwohl ich jetzt ein GPS habe, also kann ich mehr Zeit damit verbringen, es zu erkunden. Ich bin nur so weit gekommen, und das ist, wenn ich mit meinen Freunden Kason und Curtis abgehangen habe. Wir haben immer viele Videospiele gespielt und das Leben bis zum Äußersten genossen, so gut wir konnten. Manchmal gehe ich in den Park und genieße die Natur, was mir ein Gefühl von Ruhe und Frieden gibt. Ich bringe auch manchmal Stöcke mit, die ich im Baumarkt gekauft habe, und übe mein Gleichgewicht und bringe mein Bokken-Schwert mit, wenn ich kann. Ich habe Spaß daran, das zu tun, was ich liebe. Es gibt auch Basketball- und Tennisplätze, obwohl ich seit Jahren nicht mehr Tennis oder Basketball gespielt habe, ist es doch schön zu wissen, dass ich es jederzeit wieder aufnehmen kann. Papa hat mich und meinen besten Freund mit Mr. Graves großgezogen, und wir hatten immer eine tolle Zeit. Sie haben uns hart gearbeitet, aber wir hatten immer Spaß. Es gibt viele Momente, in denen ich Spaß in diesem Viertel hatte, und es gibt viele Geschichten, aber diese hier sind mir besonders in Erinnerung geblieben, und ich glaube, dass das Beste noch kommt!\n\n**Back to English:**\n\n[REWRITE]Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know.

One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",

The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",

It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",

My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\"\n\n[REWRITE] (German translation and retranslation)\n\nIch bin in dieses Viertel gezogen, kurz bevor ich mit der achten Klasse angefangen habe.

    "original": "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",

Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",

In meiner Nachbarschaft ist die Anwesenheit einer Homeowner's Association besonders ersichtlich. Wenn man hereinkommt, sieht man nur gut gepflegte Einfamilienhäuser, die wir der Homeowner's Association zu verdanken haben. Die Vorgärten sind alle sehr ähnlich. Es gibt eine kleine Rasenfläche, einige dekorative Kieselsteine und recht kurze Einfahrten. Gelegentlich sieht man auch kleine Bäume. Jeder hat eine Doppelgarage. Wenn man weiter durch die Nachbarschaft fährt, sieht man neu gepflasterte Betonstraßen. Trotz vieler verschiedener Familien, die hier leben, sind die Straßen in hervorragendem Zustand. Man findet hier keine Schlaglöcher oder Ähnliches. Die meisten Häuser sind einstockig, aber manchmal sieht man auch zweistöckige Häuser. Wir haben keine typische Briefkastenanlage, wie man sie bei Einfamilienhäusern erwarten würde. Stattdessen ist es mehr wie in Wohnungen, wo es am Ende der Straße eine große Gruppe von Briefkasten gibt. Jeder verwendet einen Schlüssel, um Zugang zu seinem spezifischen Briefkasten zu erhalten. Und es gibt zwei größere Briefkästen für Pakete. Wieder einmal kann man der HOA und ihrer Fixierung auf Einheitlichkeit dafür danken. Die Lage meines Hauses ist am äußersten Rand der nahegelegenen Stadt, sodass meine Nachbarschaft sowohl ländlich als auch suburban ist. Daher haben wir viel Land für, nun ja, alles. Es gibt mehrere Gemeinschafts pools, auf die jeder hier zugreifen kann. Sie sind gut gepflegt und eingezäunt. Und es gibt verschiedene Spazierwege, auf denen man seinen Hund ausführen oder einfach einen Abendspaziergang machen kann. Man muss nicht in einen Park gehen, um sich zu bewegen. Die Nachbarschaft ist groß genug, dass man einfach drum herum laufen und mehr als genug Bewegung bekommen kann. Der Großteil der Gemeinschaft besteht aus Rentnern. Es ist ein sehr sicheres Gebiet, und alle halten zusammen. Untergemischt sind auch einige middle-aged und junge Fachkräfte. Was die Stadt betrifft, so ist sie überraschend groß - zumindest was die Bevölkerung angeht - aber auch kleinstädtisch. Wir haben den Großteil der Annehmlichkeiten, die man erwartet und für die man sich verlassen kann. Zum Beispiel haben wir genau ein Einkaufszentrum. Es ist nicht riesig, aber es tut seinen Zweck. Für mich dauert es etwa 15 Minuten Autofahrt, um zu einem wichtigen Ort zu gelangen, aber wenn ich das tue, werde ich mit viele verschiedenen Geschäften begrüßt. Wir haben alles vom hochwertigen Supermarkt, in dem man Bio-Lebensmittel bekommt, bis hin zu Rabattgeschäften, die nur eine kleine Auswahl an Artikeln führen und minimalen Personalaufwand haben, um die Kosten niedrig zu halten. Alles in allem ist meine Nachbarschaft sicher, gut gepflegt und sehr typisch. Wir haben viele schöne Dinge wie Pools und Spazierwege. Und obwohl wir nicht direkt an irgendein Einkaufszentrum angrenzen, kann man einfach ins Auto steigen und zu jedem beliebigen großen Laden fahren.\n\n**Translation back to English:**\n\n[REWRITE] The general area in which I live can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia.

And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.",

Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",

Mein unmittelbarer Wohnbezirk auf der Ostseite der Stadt kann als der am wenigsten begüterte Bereich der Stadt beschrieben werden. Die Grundstückswerte sind niedrig, und die meisten Häuser werden an Menschen mit low income vermietet oder gehören ihnen. Allerdings ist es nicht unattraktiv oder unangenehm. Meine Nachbarn sind im Allgemeinen freundliche Menschen, die mir auf der Straße ein Lächeln und einen Gruß schenken. Die Kriminalitätsrate ist zwar etwas höher als in anderen Teilen der Stadt, bleibt aber insgesamt niedrig. In den letzten zehn Jahren gab es in einem Radius von wenigen Blocks um mein Zuhause herum einige Gewaltverbrechen, darunter mehrere Schusswaffeneinsätze und mindestens einen Mord. Unsere Nachbarn behaupten, dass ihr Sohn im letzten Jahr in einem Schusswaffeneinsatz vor einer Bar in ihrer Nähe getötet wurde. Glücklicherweise hat unsere Familie keine direkten Auswirkungen durch Kriminalität erfahren, außer dass gelegentlich Gegenstände von unserem Vorbau verschwunden sind, wenn wir sie nicht reinbringen. In der Regel hat die Stadt, in der ich lebe, von der “Opioid-Krise” betroffen, die viele Teile der Vereinigten Staaten betrifft. Vielen Menschen sind durch Fentanyl-Überdosierungen das Leben genommen worden. Glücklicherweise gibt es in meiner Stadt viele Ressourcen, um dieser Epidemie entgegenzuwirken, darunter mehrere Suchtbehandlungszentren und Narkan-Trainingsveranstaltungen für Familien und Freunde von Suchtkranken. Trotz dieser Herausforderungen hat diese Stadt viele positive Attribute. Die Grundschule meines Sohnes hat einen hervorragenden Personal, von der Schulleitung bis zu den Lehrern und dem Supportpersonal. Trotz seiner besonderen Bedürfnisse hat er bisher kein Mobbing erlebt, was auf die unglaublich positive Atmosphäre der Schule zurückzuführen ist, und er liebt es dort. Wir haben eine aktive PTO, die regelmäßig Veranstaltungen plant, um die Familienbeteiligung und den Bildungsfortschritt zu fördern. Da über 20% der Einwohner der Stadt unter der Armutsgrenze leben, bietet die Grundschule allen Schülern ein kostenloses Frühstück und Mittagessen an, damit kein Kind hungern muss. Kein Kind oder keine Familie wird wegen ihrer Fähigkeit zu zahlen als “weniger” behandelt, und die Kosten für Schulgebühren, Materialien und Ausflüge sind sehr erschwinglich. Der Stadtrat und das Personal haben viele Verbesserungen an der Außendarstellung der Stadt vorgenommen, darunter Straßeninstandsetzung, Landschaftsgestaltung und Renovierung städtischer Parks. Leider haben die meisten dieser Verbesserungen in der Mitte der Stadt und auf der Westseite stattgefunden, wo sich alle Einkaufsbereiche und der meiste Verkehr befinden. Die Ostseite, auf der ich lebe, wird vernachlässigt, was ein Anliegen für die Menschen in meinem Viertel ist. Insgesamt genieße ich es, in dieser Stadt zu leben. Die Menschen sind im Allgemeinen freundlich, die Schulen sind großartig, es gibt ausreichend Einkaufsmöglichkeiten (ob kleine Geschäfte oder größere Einzelhandelsgeschäfte) für die Bedürfnisse meiner Familie, und unser Zuhause mag nicht viel wert sein, aber es ist bequem und ausreichend. Unsere Familie lebt hier seit über 16 Jahren, und wir können uns keinen anderen Ort vorstellen.\n\n**[REWRITE]**\n\nI live in a small Midwestern town just outside the suburban areas of a major city.

I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",

Viele Häuser im Viertel haben ältere Aluminiumverkleidungen. In den Blocks um mein Haus herum gibt es Häuser in jeder denkbaren Farbe. Die meisten Häuser haben einen Garten, mit Trampolinen und Spielgeräten. Einige Menschen haben Gärten und Zäune für ihre Tiere.

Du siehst auch Leute, die Hunde ausführen, Rad fahren und Rollschuh fahren. Nachbarn kennt man, und man kann erkennen, wer dazugehört und wer nicht passt. Du siehst jemand, der im Freien grillt und winkt, oder jemand, der seinen Hund von ein paar Blocks weiter spazieren führt und freundlich lächelt. Die Rasen sind in Ordnung gehalten. Niemand hat Blätter vom letzten Herbst aufgetürmt. Die Rasen sind gemäht und unter Kontrolle. Wenn Menschen Pflanzen und Büsche in ihren Gärten haben, sind sie gestutzt.

Most houses have yards with trampolines and playsets. Some people have gardens and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America with hard-working people who are either raising or have raised families. On any given day, you'll see kids running up and down the streets. You'll also see people walking dogs, biking, and rollerblading. Neighbors know their neighbors and can tell who fits in and who doesn't. You'll see someone grilling outside and wave or someone walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are well-maintained. There are no piles of leaves from fall. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards, they are trimmed down. It isn't a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into thinking \"wow, look at the nice homes,\" but one you drive into thinking \"this would be a good place to raise a family.\" It's quiet, peaceful, and safe. While it might not look exceptional, it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to end the day. Within walking distance, there's the county sheriff's department and jail. The health department is right next to it. The city recycling center is just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city use the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcer keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to the fields. You can be playing outside or inside and hear the sound of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream shop, and if you're really into it, you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is only 8 blocks away. It's a really great place to live. [/REWRITE]",
    "transformed": "I live in rural America, specifically in a small town in Michigan. From farmland to small tourist cities, there are no big city malls, no Walmart, Target, or even an Applebee's. You have to drive to get anywhere you need to go, but I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My town is surrounded by beautiful Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go, you'll find a beach to dip your toes in.
