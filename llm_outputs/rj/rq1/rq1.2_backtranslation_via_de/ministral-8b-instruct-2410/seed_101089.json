    "original": "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",

Die meisten Häuser sind Einfamilienhäuser, aber einige wurden in zwei Wohnungen aufgeteilt, obwohl sie weiterhin angebaut sind, wenn das Sinn macht. Mein Zuhause hat einen kleinen Vorgarten und eine kleine Einfahrt links vom Haus. Es erinnert, wie viele andere, an eine Zeit nicht allzu lange her, in der das Leben in den Vororten der amerikanische Traum war. Dieser Traum schien einst das Land zu umfassen, aber er weicht nun zurück. Aber meine Nachbarschaft und viele andere bleiben, rufen uns und Besuchern zu, dass der Traum noch lebt und wir versuchen, uns daran festzuhalten. Die Menschen sind nicht mehr so optimistisch wie früher, die Pflege der kleinen Vorgärten lässt zu wünschen übrig, aber es gibt immer noch ein Auto oder zwei in jeder Einfahrt, und die Jugend spielt, als ob die Welt um sie herum das ganze ihrer Existenz wäre. Die öffentliche Schule, die fast 90 Jahre alt ist, steht noch, entfacht bei den Jugendlichen die Vorstellung eines zukünftigen Lebens, während sie bei den älteren Bewohnern Nostalgie weckt. Die Kirchen sind rar gesät und meist leer, aber die Basketballplätze sind immer voll. Alle Häuser sehen unterschiedlich aus, aber sie fühlen sich gleich an. Es gibt einen großen Supermarkt namens Super \"A\", der von einer großen Yemeni-Familie betrieben wird, die wahrscheinlich die einzige arabische Familie in der Nachbarschaft sind. Die überwiegende Mehrheit der Bewohner sind Afroamerikaner. Die Straßen sind breit und die Kinder spielen meist Fußball, nur um den Autos Platz zu machen. Die meisten Menschen in meiner Nachbarschaft leben seit Generationen hier und die meisten können Geschichten über eine Zeit erzählen, in der jeder jeden kannte. Es gab einst eine Karateschule, aber als Hollywood mit den Karate Kid-Filmen aufhörte, wollten die Kinder nicht mehr der Karate Kid sein, also wurde es zu einer Apotheke, weil Drogen alles besser machen sollen, wie ich gehört habe. Es gibt auch ein kleines Kino, das altmodische Filme zum reduzierten Preis zeigt, das von den Jugendlichen gemieden wird, die die fehlenden Neuerscheinungen ablehnen, aber von den Älteren geschätzt wird, die es als kleinen Preis für einen Abend ohne Kinder zahlen. Es gibt eine einzige Schnellstraße, die durch meine Stadt führt. Der Exit und der Eingang liegen in der Stadt neben uns. Es gab einst ein Petition, um einen Exit für unsere Stadt zu erhalten. Die Jugend unterstützte es, während die Älteren sich weigerten.

    "original": "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",

    "original": "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",

Sie war aus einer Stadt, in der der Supermarkt nur fünf Minuten zu Fuß von ihrem Haus entfernt war - sie hatte noch nie so viel offenem Raum in ihrem Leben gesehen. Erstaunt über die Häufigkeit der Maisfelder teilte ich ihr mit, wie es war, in ländlichem Ohio aufzuwachsen, und in diesem Moment wusste sie, wer ich war und woher ich kam. Auf der zweispurigen Landstraße erreichen Sie eine Steinbruch, der mit Wasser gefüllt ist. Jenseits davon befindet sich die kleine Siedlung, in der ich lebe. Die Häuser bestehen mostly aus Backstein und Stuck. Alle Häuser haben mindestens ein halbes Acre Land, um das sich jeder mit Stolz kümmert. Im Frühjahr wachsen alljährlich gepflanzte Blumen sowie die Bäume der mittleren Region, die sich mit jeder Jahreszeit verändern. Die Einfahrten sind alle gefüllt mit den teuersten Luxusautos von Mercedes-Benz, die im Mittagslicht nach einer gründlichen Autowäsche glitzern. Weiter die Straße entlang zu meinem grauen Stuckhaus, ist mein koreanischer Nachbar immer draußen mit einem freundlichen Gesicht. Er verbringt den ganzen Tag damit, seinen Rasen zu mähen und kann über das Brummen seines Mähers gehört werden. Jeder im Viertel lacht über ihn, aber er ist immer ehrlich und eine beeindruckende Person mit einer einzigartigen Geschichte. Mit dem Alter hat er einige seiner Schärfe verloren. In seiner Vergangenheit war er Arzt und mischt sich jetzt meistens mit dem Gras und seinem John Deere Zero Turn Mähgerät. Schließlich erreichen Sie mein Zuhause. Im Seitenhof sind viele Gänse, die von unserem Terrier gejagt werden. Direkt dahinter fließt ein kleiner Bach in den Steinbruch. Hier können Sie Frösche, den Bach und gelegentlich ein \"Moo\" aus den nahegelegenen Farmen hören. Über die handgefertigte Holzbrücke ist ein unberührtes Oasis, das mit natürlich wachsenden Bäumen, Kräutern und Wildblumen gefüllt ist. Hier verbrachte ich die meiste Zeit meiner Kindheit. Von Baumhäusern bis zum \"Jagen\" von Tieren (was mostly darin bestand, sie zu jagen), gab es immer etwas zu tun und meistens ein Kind aus der Nachbarschaft, das Freundschaft suchte. Die Winter in meinem kleinen Ort können schmerzhaft brutal sein, aber es gibt nichts Schöneres. Der Garten verwandelt sich von einem Meer aus Grün in eine leere Wildnis. Die Bäume, die früher lebendige pink, lila und orange Blumen trugen, verwandeln sich in kahlen Baumstämmen. Wenn es zufällig schneit, entsteht über Nacht ein Winterwunderland. Der Hinterhof ist mit Schneemännern und Schneeengeln gefüllt, die von meiner kleinen Schwester gemacht wurden. Mein Bruder und ich stritten uns oft als Kinder, und im Winter waren Schneebälle unsere Waffe.

She was from a town where the grocery store was a five-minute walk from her house—she'd never seen this much open space in her life. Taken aback by the ubiquity of cornfields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves, which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest-end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past, he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world. [/REWRITE]",

    "original": "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",

Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me.

The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library.

The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street.

Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",

Die öffentliche Verkehrsmittel sind sehr zugänglich und einer der beliebtesten Verkehrsmittel in New York City. Bensonhurst ist ein relativ städtisches Viertel, sodass du dich immer noch wie in New York City fühlst. Während deines Besuchs solltest du auf die verschiedenen asiatischen Geschäfte achten. In den letzten zwei Jahrzehnten hat Bensonhurst viele asiatische Einwohner erhalten. Daher wirst du an jedem Block mindestens einen asiatisch geführten Laden sehen. Die beliebtesten Geschäfte sind Supermärkte und Waschsalons. Diese Geschäfte sind sehr beliebt bei den Anwohnern, da die Lebensmittelqualität in den Supermärkten hervorragend ist, die Preise viel günstiger sind und es sehr bequem ist. In der Nähe, wo ich bin, gibt es vier asiatische Supermärkte, die innerhalb von zwei Minuten zu Fuß voneinander entfernt sind. Dies erhöht die Bequemlichkeit des Einkaufens. Ich sage nicht, dass Bensonhurst ausschließlich von asiatischen Einwohnern bewohnt wird, sondern es ist sehr divers. Es gibt hier Immigranten und deren erste und zweite Generation amerikanische Kinder. Die meisten großen und beliebten Geschäfte in der Umgebung sind asiatisch geführt. Neben diesen asiatisch geführten Geschäften gibt es auch einen neu renovierten Park in der Nähe, der etwa zehn Basketballplätze, ein großes Feld für Fußball oder Baseball, vier Handballplätze, Schaukeln, einen Spielplatz für Kinder und sogar eine Wasserfontäne für Kinder zum Vergnügen im Sommer umfasst. Da wir uns in New York City befinden, sind die Parks sehr vielseitig. Du wirst hier alle Arten von Vielfalt sehen und dich gut verstehen. In diesem Viertel gibt es keine großen Bürogebäude. Die einzigen Gebäude, die du hier finden wirst, sind solche für Kooperativen Wohnungen oder Eigentumswohnungen. Die meisten Wohnräume hier sind Zweifamilienhäuser. Die meisten Menschen hier sind sehr nett, aber auch sehr laut. Jeden Tag hörst du Autos mit lautem Musik wiedergeben, die an deinem Haus vorbeifahren, oder Autos, die ihr Gaspedal durchtreten und dich in der Nacht wecken. Wenn du in der Nacht besuchen möchtest, solltest du auf der Hut sein. Dieses Viertel ist relativ sicher, aber die Menschen sind unvorhersehbar. Du könntest auf Menschen stoßen, die Ärger suchen, ohne Grund, Schläger und Diebe. Ich selbst wurde in diesem Viertel in der Vergangenheit durch körperliche Gewalt belästigt, aber das war vor vielen Jahren. Ein weiterer jüngster Vorfall betraf das Stehlen von Paketen. Obwohl dies hier normal ist, gibt es Paketdiebe in diesem Viertel. Insgesamt gibt es auch hier keine strenge Einhaltung der Regeln, wenn es um Hundeausscheidungen geht. Jeden Morgen siehst du mindestens eine Hundekot auf dem Weg zur U-Bahn oder zum Supermarkt. Mein größtes Ärgernis sind Hundekot auf dem Boden überall, wo ich hingehe in diesem Viertel.

Over the past two decades, Bensonhurst has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as the quality of food in the supermarkets is superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing groceries. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian-owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago.

Alles scheint nach unten zu fließen, und mein Haus sitzt genau auf der Kuppe des steilsten Hügels im Viertel. Die Menschen nennen es den 'work out hill', weil so viele Läufer es jeden Tag während ihrer Trainingseinheiten hochlaufen. Da es auf meiner Straße keine Bürgersteige gibt, läuft jeder auf der Straße. Die Straße ist an einigen Stellen uneben und fühlt sich ein wenig gefährlich zum Fahren an. Einige der im Block hängenden Telefon- und Stromleitungen sehen zerzaust aus. Es regnet und stürmt bei uns oft, sodass Äste und anderes Geröll die Stromleitungen herunterschlagen und die ständigen Reparaturen ihnen ein geflicktes Aussehen geben. Es gibt viele hohe immergrüne Bäume überall, soweit das Auge reicht. Aber die Menschen hier hassen die Bäume. Sie versuchen so viele wie möglich zu fällen, weil die Bäume den Blick auf den Ozean versperren. Daher sind viele der Häuser auf dem Hügel gebaut, mit riesigen glasfrontigen zweiten Stockwerken, die nacheinander aufragen, um den Blick auf die Bucht zu genießen. Es ist um die Dämmerung herum wunderschön, wenn das Wasser von unten beleuchtet wird und der Himmel orange wird. Es ist oft trübe, und du siehst das meiste Sonnenlicht durch Nebel. An den meisten Tagen ist es bewölkt und feucht. Moos wächst auf allem, was es kann: Dächern, Autos und Geländern. Einmal habe ich mein Auto einen Monat lang in meiner Einfahrt geparkt gelassen, und als ich es zum Nutzen herausholen wollte, war es grün und pelzig mit Moos bedeckt. Es hat mich drei Stunden gekostet, es alles abzukratzen. Es gibt nicht viele Kinder in meiner Nachbarschaft, obwohl es nur ein paar Blocks entfernt eine Schule gibt. Die meisten Menschen in meiner Nachbarschaft sind älter, viele von ihnen pensioniert. Anstatt Kinder haben die Menschen Hunde. Es ist normal, sie in den Vorgärten sitzen oder die Straße entlangrennen zu sehen. Wenn du eine Tür oder ein Fenster offen lässt, riskierst du, dass sie in dein Haus schlüpfen. Einmal habe ich einen gefunden, der in meinem Wohnzimmer war, und musste ihn durch die vordere Tür hinausjagen. Hasen laufen frei durch die Gegend. Einige sind recht groß, und die Gärtner hassen sie, weil sie die Wurzeln der Pflanzen ausgraben und in die Rasen der Menschen buddeln. Katzen lieben sie, und sie haben die meisten von ihnen aus unserer Nachbarschaft gejagt. Wir bekommen auch die üblichen Vogelarten: kleine Spatzen und Kolibris, und manchmal kreist ein Habicht oder ein Adler über die Nachbarschaft, bis die Krähen ihn vertreiben. Es gibt keine Geschäfte in der Nähe, aber wenn du den Hügel zum Wasser hinabsteigst, gibt es einige Restaurants, die frischen Fisch servieren. Es gibt nicht viel Strand dort unten, aber die Steine am Ufer sind spaßig zu werfen. Die Bucht selbst ist nicht sehr breit. Man kann die gegenüberliegende Küste klar durch den Nebel hindurch sehen.\"\n\n**Back to English:**\n\"There aren't many sidewalks where I live.

    "original": "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",

    "original": "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",

Als ich hier in den 90er Jahren lebte, waren die Häuser weit zerstreut. Das ist jetzt fast genauso, aber es gibt viele neue Ergänzungen. Echt, es sieht immer mehr wie eine Stadt aus, aber ich denke, das passiert in den meisten Orten. Die meisten Menschen sind sehr freundlich, aber wie in jeder Stadt gibt es auch gute und schlechte Teile. In meiner Nachbarschaft bin ich von freundlichen alten Menschen umgeben, ich denke, es ist eine nette Nachbarschaft. Die Geschäfte hier sind hauptsächlich Kettenläden, wie Food4Less und Smart & Final. Wenn du Bio-Lebensmittel suchst, musst du reisen, ich habe nie richtige Bioläden oder solche Läden gesehen. Die häufigsten Jobs in meiner Stadt wären, basierend auf offiziellen Demografien, im Bauwesen. Ich denke, das liegt daran, dass diese Stadt noch nicht sehr entwickelt ist, es gibt noch viele offene Flächen zum Bauen. Das macht mir ein bisschen Angst, ich mag es so, wie es jetzt ist. Ich kam aus einer großen Stadt und bin nicht scharf darauf, dorthin zurückzukehren. Was die Bauarbeiten betrifft, ist das mein ganzer Arbeitsplatz, ich bin ein Trockenbauinstallateur und T-Bar Installateur. Was mir an meinem Zuhause gefällt, sind die verschiedenen Tiere. Menschen kommen in das Hochwüsteland für viele Gründe, nicht zuletzt wegen der schroffen Schönheit der Wüste selbst. Das Hochwüstenklima und die Topografie haben herausfordernde Ökosysteme geschaffen, die geschützt werden müssen und die verschiedene Arten von Wildtieren beherbergen. Die menschlichen Bewohner des Hochwüsten sollten sich die Zeit nehmen, sich mit den nicht-menschlichen Bewohnern vertraut zu machen, die diesen Lebensraum teilen, um sicher und harmonisch zusammenzuleben. Meine Familie und ich haben uns sehr gut an die Wildtiere angepasst. Ich habe drei Kinder und sie sind alle verrückt nach Eidechsen und Wüsteninsekten, während ich dies schreibe, sind sie draußen und versuchen, verschiedene Exemplare zu fangen. Wenn es um Sehenswürdigkeiten geht, haben wir einige. Additionally, Victorville ist ein guter Ort für Familien, um die Wüste zu erleben. Es kann eine andere Erfahrung bieten. Wenn möglich, plane deinen Besuch so, dass er mit dem jährlichen Ereignis: der San Bernardino County Fair übereinstimmt. Die Messe wird deinen Besuch mit dem richtigen Mix aus Aktivitäten und Spaß auf die Victorville-Art bereichern. Schau vorbei beim nahe gelegenen Wrightwood, um die schneebedeckten Berge zu sehen und einige Wintersporteinheiten zu nehmen, um deinen Aufenthalt zu beenden. Interessiert an der natürlichen Geschichte und Kultur des Hochwüstenökosystems? Das Victor Valley Museum umfasst geologische und paläontologische Exponate, Indianische Artefakte und historische Objekte, die die Geschichte der Entwicklung der Gesellschaft und Industrie von Victorville erzählen.\n\n**German to English:**\n[REWRITE] My neighborhood is right in the middle of the high desert, where there's just dirt, dirt, and more dirt. Unless someone has actually lived here, they probably don't really understand the feeling of seeing brown all the time, and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it's pretty much the same way, but there are a lot of new additions. Honestly, this place looks more and more like a city every day, but I think that's how most places are changing. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood, I'm surrounded by friendly old people and I guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores here are mostly chain stores, like Food4Less and Smart & Final. If you want organic, you have to travel, I never really see any Whole Foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city, based on any official demographics, are construction. I think this is because the city is still not very developed, there's still a lot of open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I came from a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction, that's where my full-time job is located, I am a drywall and T-bar installer. What I like about my home is the variety of animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems that need protecting and are home to various types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they're all obsessed with lizards and desert bugs, as I'm writing this now they're outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions go, we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a great place for families to experience the desert. It can offer a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry in Victorville.

Während andere, die auf diese Frage antworten, wahrscheinlich Hausbesitzer mit einem eigenen Leben sind, ist meine Situation ein bisschen anders. Ich betrachte meinen Wohnbezirk als das College-Campus, auf dem ich wohne, und die Menschen, die in meinem Wohnheim leben, als meine Gemeinschaft. Ich betrachte auch das umliegende Campusgelände als meinen Wohnbezirk, wenn auch in geringem Maße. Trotz dieser Besonderheit teilt mein Wohnbezirk einige Gemeinsamkeiten mit den herkömmlicheren Ideen von einem Wohnbezirk. Genau wie in einem herkömmlichen Wohnbezirk gibt es auch in meinem Wohnbezirk Häuser, Menschen, Geschäfte und Parks. Lassen Sie uns zunächst über die \"Häuser\" sprechen, die meinen Wohnbezirk ausmachen. Bevor ich mit der Erkundung der Häuser in meinem Wohnbezirk beginne, wäre es am besten, die Arten von Häusern zu klären, die in meiner Umgebung zu finden sind. Es gibt drei Arten von Wohnungen in meiner direkten Nachbarschaft: Wohnungen, richtige Häuser und Wohnheime. In den Wohnungen leben normalerweise 2 bis 4 Personen in einem Zimmer, und es gibt etwa 4 bis 6 Zimmer pro Stockwerk. Der häufigste Gebäudetyp kann etwa 2 Stockwerke aufnehmen, so dass im Durchschnitt etwa 20 Personen in einem Gebäude leben. Zweitens gibt es die richtigen Häuser, die für jeden, der eine Verbindung zur Schule hat, vermietet werden können. Diese sind typischerweise 2-4 Schlafzimmer und bewohnt von Alumni. Es gibt jedoch nur eine Handvoll solcher Häuser im Wohnbezirk, da sie weniger effizient sind. Schließlich gibt es die typischen Wohnheim-Zimmer, in denen Hunderte von Studenten leben. In diesen teilen sich zwei Personen das Zimmer, mit einigen Ausnahmen, und es ist die häufigste Art von Wohnraum in meinem Wohnbezirk. Mit der Wohnsituation abgedeckt sind wir bereit, zu den Menschen überzugehen. Unsere Schule rühmt sich ihrer Vielfalt, und das zeigt sich in der Zusammensetzung meines Wohnbezirks. Es gibt Menschen aus allen Kulturen und Altersgruppen, die in meinem Wohnbezirk leben. Die meisten der beruflichen Mitarbeiter wohnen in den Häusern, die im Wohnbezirk stehen, während die neueren Studenten in den Wohngemeinschaften und die älteren Studenten in den Wohnungen leben. Die Menschen in diesem Wohnbezirk können nicht durch einfache Worte beschrieben werden, daher ist es am besten, einfach zu den Geschäften und Parks überzugehen. Da unsere Schule wirklich ein eigener abgeschlossener Wohnbezirk ist, gibt es dort eine Vielzahl von Geschäften und einen einzigen Park. Die Geschäfte sind eine Mischung aus Essensoptionen, die auch in anderen Wohnbezirken zu finden sind, und den eigenen einzigartigen Mode- und Lebensmittelgeschäften der Schule. Daher kann man in den Grenzen meines Wohnbezirks alles finden, was man braucht! Zusätzlich ist der Park in meinem Wohnbezirk ein Spielplatz für all die vielfältigen Menschen in meinem Wohnbezirk.

Zuerst einmal war ich, als ich in mein Viertel gezogen bin, sehr traurig. Ich kam von Riverdale nach Stockbridge, und ich will ehrlich sein, ich habe geweint, weil ich sie vermisste und sie geliebt habe. Aber meine Eltern und ich wollten das Beste für mich und meine kleine Schwester, also sind wir in ein besseres Wohnviertel gezogen, in eine bessere weiterführende Schule, alles war als \"nicht arm\" angesehen, als wir in unser neues Viertel zogen. Im Laufe der Jahre habe ich mich daran gewöhnt und einige neue Freunde und auch einige neue Feinde in der Schule gefunden. Ich habe meine Nachbarn nie richtig kennengelernt, außer Mr. Glen und seine Kinder sowie Dennis, die direkt neben uns wohnten. Sie waren nette Menschen, die ich fast als Familie betrachten kann, und ich schätze sie wirklich. Ich erinnere mich, als meine Mutter, mein Vater und meine Schwester zur Hochzeit von Mr. Glen (er hat wieder geheiratet) gingen. Es war wirklich lustig und schön, und ich freue mich darauf, dass ich eines Tages meine Frau und ihr ein königliches Leben bieten kann. Als Mrs. Veda, die Frau von Mr. Glen, den kleinen weißen Schuh von ihrem Bein abschnürte und ihn wegwarf, habe ich ihn gefangen! Leider habe ich die Blumen nicht gefangen!\n\nWir tanzten die ganze Nacht und ich hatte eine tolle Zeit mit Marsharii, einer ihrer Töchter. Ich habe sie seitdem nicht mehr gesehen. Ich hoffe, sie hat sich weiterentwickelt und ist zu besseren Dingen gekommen. Das Viertel selbst ist wie ein Labyrinth, aber jetzt habe ich ein GPS, sodass ich mehr Zeit habe, es zu erkunden. Ich bin nur so weit gegangen, wo ich mit meinen Freunden Kason und Curtis hingegangen bin. Wir haben immer viele Videospiele gespielt und das Leben in vollen Zügen genossen, solange wir konnten. Manchmal ging ich auch in den Park und genoss die Natur, was meiner Seele guttut und mir Frieden gibt. Ich nehme manchmal Stöcke mit, die ich von Home Depot gekauft habe, und übe mein Gleichgewicht und bringe meinen Bokken-Holzschwert mit, wenn ich kann. Ich habe Spaß daran, das zu tun, was ich liebe. Es gibt auch einen Basketball- und Tenniscourt, obwohl ich schon lange nicht mehr Tennis oder Basketball gespielt habe, ist es immer noch schön zu wissen, dass ich es wieder aufnehmen kann, wenn ich will.

There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",

Sie sind entweder Studierende oder haben ein geringes Einkommen, da die Wohnmöglichkeiten nicht sehr teuer sind. In der Nähe gibt es viele Kinder, da sich eine Grundschule in Fußweite meines Apartments befindet. Ich kenne meine Nachbarn nicht, aber ich will sie auch nicht kennenlernen. Sie rauchen sehr viel Gras und deswegen hat die Hausverwaltung einen Luftreiniger direkt vor ihrer Tür angebracht, was mein Freund und ich sehr lustig fanden. Es ist fast beleidigend. Die Gebäude um mich herum sehen alt aus, aber sie könnten renovierte Innenräume haben. Ein paar Blocks weiter gibt es brandneue Apartments, aber ich mag sie nicht, weil ich denke, dass die Bauqualität nicht besonders gut ist. Sie sind billig gebaut, aber die Miete ist hoch, was ich für eine Abzocke halte, aber weil sie in der Nähe des Campus liegen, können die Vermieter das durchsetzen. Es gibt ein sehr günstiges Restaurant etwa fünf Minuten von meinem Wohnort entfernt, das nur Papierservietten verwendet und die meisten Gerichte in der Mikrowelle zubereitet. Daneben gibt es eine Tankstelle, von der ich gehört habe, dass sie kein guter Arbeitsplatz ist. Aber dank einiger städtischer Mittel wurde die Straße im letzten Sommer neu asphaltiert, sodass es jetzt einen großen Gehweg, viel Gras auf den Verkehrsinseln und Straßenrändern gibt und das Viertel ein bisschen netter geworden ist. Mein Wohngebäude ist von Bäumen umgeben. Sie haben einige gefällt, sodass ein paar Stümpfe übrig geblieben sind, aber es gibt hier viel mehr Bäume als weiter unten an der Straße. Hinter meinem Apartmentkomplex befindet sich eine Baumreihe und dann eine weitere Reihe von Wohnungen. Ich wohne in der 42. Straße, aber direkt dahinter liegt die 43. Straße, die nicht so schön ist. Die Gehwege sind sehr schlecht und zerfallen, und die meisten Gebäude sehen heruntergekommen aus. Es gibt viele Bäume auf dieser Straße, aber das ist wahrscheinlich, um die Gebäude zu verstecken. Die meisten Kriminalität in meinem Viertel hat in einem Apartmentkomplex auf dieser Straße stattgefunden, aber ich kann es nicht nur ihnen anlasten. Es gibt auch Apartments auf der anderen Straßenseite von mir, die viel Kriminalität haben und eine recht mobile Bevölkerung. Aber ich denke, ich mag es, hier zu wohnen. Ich kann es mir leisten, und es gibt viele nützliche Annehmlichkeiten in der Nähe. Ich mag besonders, dass die Universität zu Fuß erreichbar ist und es zwei Bushaltestellen gibt, sodass ich den Supermarkt und die Innenstadt bequem erreichen kann.\n\n[REWRITE]My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.[/REWRITE]",

    "original": "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",

It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",

    "transformed": "My neighborhood is a charming little town. It doesn't stand out from other towns in South Carolina, but it significantly impacts the agricultural sector. Johnston, known as the Peach Capital of the World, proudly displays this on its welcoming sign. The town is mostly farmland, either with peach trees or cattle. Houses outside of the town center are spread far apart; most are two-story homes with metal roofs to withstand the intense summer heat or gray shingles. These houses are often farther back from the road, allowing the front fields to be used for animals or crops. In the town center, there's a single traffic light at a four-way intersection, where the town's only stores are located. There are three fast-food options: Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a local burger chain. A pizzeria used to be there but closed recently. There's a small, family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug, famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola. There's also an expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, which is the town's only grocery store. Most residents prefer to shop at Walmart in the nearby town of Batesburg-Leesville. The most popular store is Dollar General, selling a wide range of everyday items and often busy from opening to closing. There's a small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a community-known woman who employs two movers for deliveries. Attached to the store is a small pet groomer, Clark's Cuts and Kennels, offering services like daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, and bathing. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are located away from the town center, well-equipped to serve the town's residents. Johnston Elementary School is the only school in town, and students must attend middle and high school in the next town after fifth grade. There are no parks, but a 2.5-acre recreational area is being created to provide more opportunities for outings and attract visitors.

Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say.

You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends.

Besonders in meinem Wohnviertel ist die Anwesenheit einer Eigentümergemeinschaft sehr auffällig. Beim Betreten bemerkt man ausschließlich gut gepflegte Einfamilienhäuser, wofür wir der Eigentümergemeinschaft danken können. Die Vorgärten sind alle sehr ähnlich. Es gibt kleine Rasenflächen, dekorative Kieselsteine und relativ kurze Zufahrten. Gelegentlich sieht man kleine Bäume. Jeder hat einen Doppelgarage. Wenn man weiter durch das Wohnviertel fährt, sieht man neu gepflasterten Beton. Trotz der vielen verschiedenen Familien, die hier wohnen, sind die Straßen in ausgezeichnetem Zustand. Man findet keine Schlaglöcher oder ähnliches hier. Die meisten Häuser sind ein Stockwerk hoch, manchmal auch zwei Stockwerke. Wir haben keine typische Briefkastenanlage wie man sie von Einfamilienhäusern kennt. Stattdessen hat man große Briefkastenanlagen am Ende der Straße, an denen jeder mit einem Schlüssel Zugang zu seinem eigenen Briefkasten hat. Es gibt auch zwei große Abteile für Pakete. Wieder einmal kann man der HOA und ihrer Obsession für Uniformität danken. Das Haus befindet sich am äußeren Rand der nahegelegenen Stadt, sodass mein Wohnviertel als Teil ländlich, Teil Vorstadt beschrieben werden kann. Als Ergebnis haben wir viel Platz für alles. Es gibt mehrere Gemeinschaftsbecken, auf die jeder hier zugreifen kann. Sie sind gut gepflegt und abgesperrt. Es gibt auch verschiedene Spazierwege, auf denen man seinen Hund ausführen oder einfach einen Abendspaziergang machen kann. Man muss nicht in einen Park gehen, um sich Sport zu treiben. Das Wohnviertel ist groß genug, dass man es einfach durchlaufen und mehr als ausreichend Sport treiben kann. Die meisten Bewohner sind pensioniert. Es ist eine sehr sichere Gegend und jeder passt auf den anderen auf. Hinzu kommt eine kleine Anzahl von Personen mittleren Alters und Berufstätigen. In Bezug auf die Stadt ist sie überraschend groß – zumindest nach der Einwohnerzahl – aber auch mit einem kleinen Städtchencharme. Wir haben die meisten Annehmlichkeiten, die man zu erwarten und auf die man angewiesen ist. Zum Beispiel gibt es genau ein Einkaufszentrum. Es ist nicht riesig, aber es tut seinen Zweck. Für mich dauert es etwa 15 Minuten Autofahrt, um zu einem wichtigen Ort zu gelangen, aber sobald ich dort angekommen bin, werde ich mit vielen verschiedenen Läden begrüßt. Man findet alles von gehobenen Supermärkten, in denen man Bio-Lebensmittel bekommt, bis hin zu Billigläden, die nur eine kleine Auswahl an Artikeln führen und mit minimalem Personal auskommen, um die Kosten niedrig zu halten. Alles in allem ist mein Wohnviertel sicher, gut gepflegt und ziemlich typisch. Wir haben viele schöne Dinge wie Schwimmbäder und Spazierwege. Und obwohl wir nicht direkt in der Nähe von Einkaufsmöglichkeiten wohnen, kann man einfach in ein Auto steigen und zu jeder großen Kette fahren, die man möchte.\n\n**Back to English:**\n[REWRITE]The general area I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia.

Es gab in den letzten zehn Jahren ein paar gewalttätige Verbrechen in ein paar Blocks von meinem Zuhause, darunter einige Schusswaffengebrauchsfälle und mindestens eine Tötung. Unsere Nachbarn haben letzten Jahr ihren Sohn in einem Schusswaffengebrauch in einer Bar vor Ort verloren. Glücklicherweise hat unsere Familie keine direkten Auswirkungen durch Kriminalität erfahren außer dass gelegentlich etwas von unserem Porch verschwindet, wenn wir es nicht ins Haus bringen. Im Allgemeinen wurde unsere Stadt stark von der “Opioid-Epidemie” betroffen, die viele Teile der USA betrifft. Viele Menschen haben durch Fentanyl-Überdosierungen ihr Leben verloren. Glücklicherweise gibt es in unserer Stadt viele Ressourcen, um dieser Epidemie entgegenzuwirken, darunter mehrere Entzugskliniken und Narcan-Schulungen für Familien und Freunde von Suchtkranken. Trotz dieser Herausforderungen hat unsere Stadt viele positive Merkmale. Die Grundschule meines Sohnes hat einen exzellenten Lehr- und Verwaltungspersonals. Trotz seiner besonderen Bedürfnisse hat er noch keine Mobbing-Attacken erlebt dank der extrem positiven Atmosphäre in der Schule und liebt es dort. Wir haben einen aktiven Elternvereins, der mehrere Events im Jahr plant, um die Familienbeteiligung und den schulischen Fortschritt zu fördern.

It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",

    "raw_output": "**German Translation:**\n\nMeine Nachbarschaft ist voller Kultur. Sie liegt auf einem Hügel, umgeben von Gebäuden mit historischem Wert. Ich lebe in einem 7-stöckigen Wohngebäude direkt gegenüber vom alten Theater und ein paar Blocks weiter unten auf dem Hügel befindet sich ein cooles kleines Arcade-Bar, zu der verschiedene Menschen an warmen Sommerabenden strömen. Besonders an den Wochenenden im Juni und Juli kann man oft eine Schlange von Leuten sehen, die darauf warten, reinzukommen. Ein paar Blocks weiter oben liegt der nächste Stadtpark. Er ist recht groß, wenn man bedenkt, dass er in diesem Teil der Stadt liegt. Der Park wird von einer Betonmauer umgeben, in die große Stufen gegossen sind. In den kalten Wintermonaten stellen Obdachlose ihre Zelte in ordentlichen Reihen entlang der Bürgersteige und den breiten Treppen auf. Es schneit nicht viel, aber es regnet stark, und die sintflutartigen Regengüsse im winterlichen Jahresverlauf machen es oft schwierig, warm zu bleiben. Wenn sie ihre Zelte eng zusammenstellen, in der Mitte der Stadt und nicht im Dschungel, bleiben sie viel wärmer. Sie sind auch in bequemer Geh- und Nahverkehrsreichweite zum einzigen Familienzentrum in der Nähe, wo sie baden und duschen können. Was ich an meiner Stadt liebe, ist nicht die Schönheit der historischen Architektur – die hohen, stolzen Gebäude, die Architektur, die auf verschiedenen Hügeln verteilt ist und sich zum Meer hin erstreckt. Was ich an meiner Nachbarschaft liebe, ist die Kultur der Menschen selbst. Denn Hilltop war einst das berüchtigste Viertel an der Westküste für Gangkriminalität. Man hört noch heute Geschichten, drei Jahrzehnte später, von der Bundesregierung und der DEA, die wie ein Besen durch die Straßen fegen, um die Straßen zu säubern. Die Menschen vergessen nicht. Geschichten werden von Generation zu Generation weitergegeben, auch an Neuansiedler wie mich, über diese Tage. Die Menschen arbeiten hart, auch wenn es immer noch als eines der raueren Viertel der Stadt gilt, um es sauber zu halten. Sie kümmern sich immer noch um das, was in ihrer Stadt und in ihrem Block passiert. Es heißt, wenn man weiß ist, sollte man nicht nachts durch den Hill wandern. Tatsächlich glaube ich, dass diese Warnung an die alten Zeiten erinnert und einen säuerlichen Beigeschmack von sozialer Konditionierung hat. Vielleicht bin ich dunkel genug, um nicht ganz wie ein \"weiße-Mädchen\" zu wirken, oder der Hilltop erkennt mich als einen der ihren, jemanden, der genauso schmerzlich der ständigen Erinnerung gewahr ist, die unser Land ständig plagt. Rassismus, kulturelle Konditionierung und Annahmen entstehen aus Ignoranz und Angst, selbst in einer Stadt, die angeblich ein kulturelles Schmelztiegel-Utopia sein soll. Eines weiß ich: egal wie weit ich streife, der Hilltop ist meine Heimat. Ich fühle mich lebendig, wenn ich nachts durch diese Straßen gehe, Menschen, die mir schneller und eher selten bösartig eine Jacke anbieten als mich zu bestehlen. Es ist ein Ort, an dem Waschsalonbesitzer ein paar Minuten länger aufbleiben, damit ich mein Handy aufladen kann, wenn ich nirgendwohin aus dem Regen fliehen kann. Es ist ein Ort, an dem ich unsichtbar geglaubt habe, zusammengekauert gegen den Beton der Ladenfronten an den trübsten und grauesten Nächten sitzen, nur um dann angehalten zu werden, in die Augen geblickt zu bekommen, eine 5-Euro-Note in die Hand gedrückt zu bekommen und zu hören, dass ich schön und wertvoll bin.\n\n**Rewritten English Translation:**\n\n[REWRITE]\n\nMy neighborhood is full of culture.

    "original": "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
