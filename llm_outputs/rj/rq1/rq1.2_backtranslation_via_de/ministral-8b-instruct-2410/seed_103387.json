    "original": "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",

My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",

She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",

    "original": "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything.

Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket.

Public Transportation ist sehr zugänglich und ist eine der beliebtesten Formen des Transports in New York City. Bensonhurst ist ein relativ städtisches Viertel, sodass du dich immer noch so fühlst, als wärst du in New York City. Während deines Besuchs solltest du auf die verschiedenen asiatischen Geschäfte achten. In den letzten beiden Jahrzehnten hat Bensonhurst einen Ansturm asiatischer Bewohner erlebt. Daher wirst du auf jedem Block mindestens ein asiatisch geführtes Geschäft sehen. Die beliebtesten Geschäfte sind Supermärkte und Waschsalons. Zufällig sind diese Geschäfte sehr beliebt bei den lokalen Bewohnern, da die Lebensmittelqualität in den Supermärkten hervorragend ist, die Preise viel günstiger sind und es sehr bequem ist. In der Nähe, wo ich bin, gibt es vier asiatische Supermärkte innerhalb von zwei Minuten fußläufig voneinander entfernt. Dies Adds noch zur Bequemlichkeit des Einkaufens bei. Ich sage nicht, dass Bensonhurst rein von asiatischen Bewohnern bevölkert ist, obwohl es sehr vielfältig ist, mit Einwanderern und ihren ersten- und zweiten Generationen hier. Die meisten der großen und beliebten Unternehmen im lokalen Bereich sind asiatisch geführt. Darüber hinaus gibt es neben diesen asiatisch geführten Unternehmen auch einen kürzlich renovierten Park in der Nähe, der etwa zehn Basketballplätze, ein großes Feld für Fußball oder Baseball, vier Handballplätze, Schaukeln, einen Spielplatz für Kinder und sogar eine Wasserfontäne für Kinder, die im Sommer Wasser genießen können, beherbergt. Da wir in New York City sind, sind die Parks natürlich sehr vielfältig. Du wirst hier alle Arten von Vielfalt sehen, die gut zusammenleben und spielen können. In diesem Viertel gibt es nicht viele große Firmengebäude. Die einzigen Gebäude, die du finden würdest, sind für Mitbewohnerwohnungen oder Eigentumswohnungen. Die meisten der Wohnräume hier sind Zweifamilienhäuser. Die meisten Menschen sind sehr nett, aber auch sehr laut. Jeden Tag wirst du hören, wie Autos mit lauter Musik vorbeifahren oder ständig das Gaspedal durchdrücken, was dich morgens weckt. Wenn du nachts besuchst, solltest du auf der Hut sein. Dieses Viertel ist relativ sicher, aber die Menschen sind unvorhersehbar. Du könntest auf Menschen stoßen, die Ärger suchen, Rowdies und Diebe. Ich selbst wurde in diesem Viertel in der Vergangenheit durch körperliche Gewalt bedrängt, aber das war vor vielen Jahren. Ein jüngstes Vorkommnis betraf den Diebstahl von Paketen. Obwohl es hierfür bekannt ist, gibt es in diesem Viertel Paketdiebe. Letztlich, obwohl New York City eine Strafe für Menschen auferlegt, die ihre Hunde nicht aufräumen, befolgen die Menschen hier nicht die Regeln. Jeden Morgen wirst du mindestens eine Hundekotze auf dem Weg zur U-Bahn oder zum Supermarkt sehen. Mein größter Nervfaktor ist Hundekotze auf dem Boden überall, wohin ich gehe in diesem Viertel.

People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",

    "transformed": "Es gibt nicht viele Bürgersteige in meiner Nachbarschaft. Alles scheint bergab zu strömen, und mein Haus liegt genau am Kamm des steilsten Hügels der Nachbarschaft. Die Leute nennen es den \"Trainingshügel\", weil so viele Jogger jeden Tag daran vorbeilaufen. Da es in meiner Straße keine Bürgersteige gibt, geht jeder auf der Straße. Diese Straße ist an einigen Stellen mit Schlaglöchern übersät und kann gefährlich zum Fahren sein. Einige der Telefon- und Elektrokabel, die um den Block gespannt sind, sehen zerlumpt aus. Es regnet und stürmt in unserer Gegend oft, sodass Äste und anderes Gerümpel die Stromleitungen herunterzischen und die ständigen Reparaturen sie unordentlich und bunt aussehen lassen. Es gibt viele hohe Kiefern in der Nähe, wohin man auch schaut. Aber die Menschen hier hassen die Bäume. Sie versuchen, so viele wie möglich zu fällen, weil die Bäume den Ausblick auf den Ozean versperren. Deswegen sind viele der Häuser so hoch oben auf dem Hügel gebaut, mit großen, verglasten zweiten Etagen, die sich nacheinander erheben, um den Ausblick auf die Bucht zu genießen. Es ist um Sonnenuntergang herum wunderschön, wenn das Wasser von unten erleuchtet zu werden scheint und der Himmel orange wird. Es ist aber oft bewölkt, sodass man die meiste Sonne durch Nebel sieht. Die meisten Tage sind verhangen und feucht. Moos wächst auf allem, was es kann: Dächern, Autos und Geländern. Einmal ließ ich meinen Wagen einen Monat lang in meiner Einfahrt stehen und als ich ihn uso er ausgefahren wollte, war er von Moos bedeckt. Es dauerte drei Stunden, um es alle abzukratzen.

It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",

Es sei denn, man hat hier wirklich gewohnt, dann versteht man wahrscheinlich nicht das Gefühl, immer braun zu sehen, und wenn man doch mal einen Rasen sieht, weiß man, dass diese Person ein Vermögen für die Rasenpflege ausgibt. Als ich hier in den 90er Jahren lebte, waren die Häuser weit auseinander verteilt. Heute ist es etwa genauso, aber es gibt viele neue Bauprojekte. Echt, dieser Ort sieht immer mehr nach einer Stadt aus, aber angeblich verändern sich die meisten Orte auf diese Weise. Die Menschen sind in der Regel sehr freundlich, aber wie in jeder Stadt gibt es auch hier gute und schlechte Viertel. In meiner Nachbarschaft bin ich von freundlichen alten Leuten umgeben, und ich denke, das ist ein netter Stadtteil. Die Geschäfte hier sind mostly Kettenläden wie Food4Less und Smart & Final. Wenn du auf der Suche nach großem Maßstab bist, musst du reisen. Ich habe hier nie richtige Bio-Läden oder dergleichen gesehen. Die prominentesten Jobs in meiner Stadt, so würde ich sagen, sind im Baugewerbe. Das liegt wohl daran, dass diese Stadt noch nicht sehr entwickelt ist und es noch viele offene Flächen zum Bauen gibt. Das macht mir ein bisschen Angst, ich mag es so, wie es ist. Ich komme aus einer großen Stadt und habe keine Lust, wieder dorthin zurückzukehren. Was den Bau angeht, ist das auch mein ganzer Arbeitsplatz. Ich bin Trockenbau- und T-Bauinstallateur. Was mir an meinem Zuhause gefällt, sind die verschiedenen Tiere. Menschen kommen in die Wüste aus vielen Gründen, nicht zuletzt wegen der rauen Schönheit der Wüste selbst. Das Klima und die Topographie der Wüste haben herausfordernde Ökosysteme geschaffen, die geschützt werden müssen und in denen verschiedene Tierarten leben. Menschen, die in der Wüste leben, sollten sich die Zeit nehmen, sich über die nichtmenschlichen Bewohner zu informieren, um sicher und harmonisch mit ihnen zu leben. Meine Familie und ich haben uns sehr gut an die Tiere angepasst. Ich habe drei Kinder und sie sind alle total verrückt nach Eidechsen und Wüsteninsekten. Während ich das schreibe, sind sie draußen und versuchen, verschiedene Exemplare zu fangen. Was die Sehenswürdigkeiten angeht, gibt es hier einige. Außerdem ist Victorville ein guter Ort für Familien, um die Wüste zu erleben. Man kann eine andere Erfahrung machen. Wenn du kannst, plane deinen Besuch so, dass er mit dem jährlichen Event der San Bernardino County Fair übereinstimmt. Die Messe wird deinen Aufenthalt mit der richtigen Mischung aus Aktivitäten und Spaß im Stil von Victorville bereichern. Schau doch mal bei der nahen Wrightwood vorbei, um die schneebedeckten Berge zu sehen und Wintersporteinheiten zu buchen, um deinen Besuch zu beenden. Interessiert an der natürlichen Geschichte und Kultur des Wüstenökosystems? Das Victor Valley Museum bietet geologische und paleontologische Sammlungen, indianische Artefakte und historische Objekte, die die Entwicklung der Gesellschaft und Industrie von Victorville erzählen.\n\n### [REWRITE]Final English translation: My neighborhood is smack in the middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt, and more dirt.

    "original": "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",

    "original": "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul.

There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",

My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC.

Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own.

Sie sind unregelmäßig angeordnet und beabstandet, sodass sie wie einzelne Häuser aussehen. Der einzige Unterschied ist, dass sie alle gelb gestrichen sind mit weißen Veranden und grünen Metalldächern. Fast jeder, aber nicht alle, sind untereinander befreundet. Wir stehen abends sometimes am Ende eines nicht vorbestimmten Zufahrtsweges und unterhalten uns, während die kleinen Kinder des Viertels mit ihren Spielsachen, Kreide oder Drachen fliegen. Es ist sehr erfrischend in dieser modernen, von Maschinen und Computern gefüllten Welt. Es ist fast wie eine Reise in die Vergangenheit. Wir sind von Feldern und Bäumen umgeben, die durch blauem Himmel und weißen, wehenden Wolken ergänzt werden. Der einzige Nachteil? Wir erleben in dieser Saison Tornadowarnungen und gestern Abend haben wir tatsächlich die Tornadosirenen gehört, sodass wir Zuflucht suchen mussten. Tatsächlich fand man mich in meiner Badewanne, wo ich meinen kleinsten Hund, meine Handtasche und einige Kissen festhielt. Mein größerer Hund wollte aber nichts von dem Badezimmer wissen und blieb nervös und bellend im Wohnzimmer zurück. Das Viertel war ruhig, bis auf das Geräusch des großen Hagels, der auf dem Boden niederprasselte. Nach dem Sturm dampfte die Straße buchstäblich von der Temperaturänderung. Wir erlebten eine Temperaturveränderung von 92 auf 75 Grad in Minuten. Der Hagel schmolz sofort, wenn er auf den heißen Asphalt traf. Als ich nach oben schaute, zeigte sich der Himmel und es fing an zu regnen. Ein doppelter Regenbogen erschien. Ich rannte ins Haus und schnappte mir schnell ein paar Fotos, um sie mit meinen Facebook-Freunden und meiner Familie zu teilen. Sie waren ebenso erstaunt wie ich. Die Straßen blieben eine Stunde ruhig, bis einige Menschen schließlich nach Hause kamen, von wo sie sich, als der Gewittersturm losbrach, befanden. Danach war alles wieder wie immer, Kinder und Mütter waren draußen, während das Abendessen gekocht wurde. So eine freundliche Nachbarschaft für mich, die kürzlich von NH nach NC gezogen ist. Ich liebe den südlichen Akzent, den die Leute sprechen. Ich habe eine Zweizimmerwohnung mit zwei Badezimmern, genau wie alle anderen. Auch wenn alle Häuser von außen gleich aussehen, sind die Wohnungen drinnen nicht alle gleich. Einige sind sogar recht klein. Das ergibt keinen Sinn für mich. Ich liebe es, entlang des größten Feldes hinter meinem Wohnort zu spazieren und bis zum Teich zu schlendern, der nicht zum Schwimmen geeignet ist. Ich habe Hirsche gesehen und morgens kann man den großen Frosch singen hören. Es ist ein wunderbarer Ort zum Leben, nur eine halbe Stunde von Charlotte entfernt. Jeden Morgen begrüßen uns die Hähne der umliegenden Farmen mit ihrem Krähen. Es ist fast wie in einem kleinen Dorf. Wir haben sogar einen Esel auf einem nahegelegenen Hof, von dem man ihn abends brayen hört, um uns wissen zu lassen, dass er da ist. Ich hatte Glück, diesen Schatz einer Nachbarschaft zu finden.\n\n**English Translation:**\n[REWRITE] My neighborhood consists of duplexes on a cul-de-sac.

Es war schwierig, zunächst Freunde zu finden, aber ich habe mich mit jemandem angefreundet, der zwei Häuser von mir entfernt wohnt, und einem anderen Jungen, der auf meiner Straße lebt. Beide sind nicht mehr dort, aber die Erinnerungen sind immer noch da. Die selben Menschen, die hier wohnten, als ich einzog, sind zum größten Teil noch hier. Mein Viertel ähnelt sehr einem durchschnittlichen amerikanischen Vorort. Es gibt viele zweistöckige Häuser in der Nachbarschaft. Jedes Wochenende oder wann immer es warm ist, höre ich die Kinder draußen spielen. Das Viertel ist die meisten Tage der Woche ruhig. Ich habe nie ein Problem mit jemandem aus der Nachbarschaft gehabt. Hier wird man allein gelassen, es sei denn, man braucht Hilfe. Ich habe mehrere Pakete online bestellt und keins davon wurde von meiner Veranda gestohlen. Ich fühle mich in der Lage, meinen Nachbarn zu vertrauen. Ein Park ist nur ein paar Minuten vom Haus entfernt. Dort habe ich viele Erinnerungen. Ich habe dort Basketball, Fußball und Baseball mit den anderen Jungs aus dem Viertel gespielt. Auf dem Fußballplatz habe ich auch einen meiner schlimmsten Erinnerungen gesammelt, als ich mir die Nase an der Nase an der Fußballspitze abschlug, aber die guten Erinnerungen überwiegen die schlechten. Heute besuche ich den Park, um Zeit mit meinen Cousins' Kids zu verbringen. Sie sind viel jünger als ich und mögen immer noch auf Schaukeln und Rutschen zu spielen. Der Gedanke an den Park macht sie sehr aufgeregt. Der Park macht mich auf verschiedene Weisen nostalgisch. Das Viertel ist sehr bunt. Man findet dort eine Vielfalt an Lebensmitteln. Innerhalb eines Radius von einer Meile findet man chinesische, indische, mexikanische und italienische Restaurants. Aber heute bestellen viele Menschen ihre Mahlzeiten per App, wie zum Beispiel GrubHub und DoorDash. Die beliebtesten Restaurants sind die Fastfoodläden, man findet sie in fast jedem Vorort. Es gibt auch viele Pizzerien. Die Geschäfte hier bieten alles, was man braucht. Es gibt mehrere Waschsalons in der Nähe. Auch eine Walgreens und eine CVS liegen in der gleichen Straße wie ein Jewel-Osco-Supermarkt, der in der Mitte Westens beliebt ist. Einige der Geschäfte sind sogar bunt, es gibt einen indischen Laden, falls man mal indische Hausmannskost kochen oder fertige indische Gerichte kaufen möchte. Insgesamt bin ich mit meinem Viertel zufrieden. Auf Social Media und in den Nachrichten hört man immer wieder von schrecklichen Geschichten über die Erfahrungen anderer Menschen mit ihren Nachbarn, was mich für meine Nachbarschaft dankbar macht.\n\n[REWRITE]\nI moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade.

    "raw_output": "**[DEUTSCH]**\n\nMeine Nachbarschaft ist ein charmantes kleines Städtchen. Es unterscheidet sich nicht von anderen in South Carolina, aber es hat einen bedeutenden Einfluss auf die Landwirtschaft. Johnston ist als die \"Peach Capital of the World\" bekannt, etwas, das die Stadt auf der freundlichen Begrüßungstafel mit Stolz hervorhebt. Es besteht hauptsächlich aus Landwirtschaftsland, das entweder von Pfirsichbäumen oder Rinderweiden dominiert wird. Häuser, die sich nicht im Hauptteil der Stadt befinden, sind weit voneinander entfernt; die meisten sind zwei Stockwerke hoch mit entweder Metalldächern, um die brennende Sommerhitze zu bekämpfen, oder grauem Schiefer. Häufiger sind diese Häuser nicht an der Straße, sondern weiter hinten, sodass die vorderen Felder für Tiere oder Ernten genutzt werden können. Im Hauptteil der Stadt gibt es eine einzelne Ampel, die an einer vierseitigen Kreuzung hängt. Hier befinden sich die einzigen Geschäfte der gesamten Stadt. Es gibt drei Orte, an denen man \"Schnellimbiss\" bekommen kann: Hong Kong, ein kleines von einer Familie geführtes chinesisches Restaurant, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant oder Gary's, eine kleine Burger-Kette. Es gab früher eine Pizzeria, die jedoch vor kurzem geschlossen hat. Es gibt eine sehr kleine, von einer Familie geführte Apotheke namens Maxwell und Halford Drug; merkwürdigerweise sind sie am besten für die Cherry Coca-Cola bekannt, die sie verkaufen. Es gibt einen kleinen, aber teuren Supermarkt namens Independent Grocers Alliance, bekannt als IGA. Obwohl es der einzige Supermarkt in der gesamten Stadt ist, halten viele Menschen nur an, um ein oder zwei Dinge zu kaufen; die meisten ziehen es vor, zu einem Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville zu fahren, um die meisten ihrer Lebensmittel zu kaufen. Der beliebteste Laden in der gesamten Stadt ist Dollar General; dieser Laden verkauft eine breite Palette von Alltagsartikeln und ist oft von der Eröffnung bis zur Schließung sehr frequentiert! Es gibt einen sehr kleinen Möbelgeschäft namens Possibilities Furniture & More, das von einer freundlichen Frau geleitet wird, die im gesamten Ort bekannt ist. Das Geschäft hat bereits seit vielen Jahren in Johnston bestanden und beschäftigt sogar zwei Möbelpacker, die den gekauften Hausrat liefern! An das Möbelgeschäft angebaut befindet sich eine kleine Tierpflege namens Clark's Cuts and Kennels. Sie bieten eine Vielzahl von Dienstleistungen wie Betreuung, Übernachtung, Pflegen, Nagelschleifen und Baden an. Sowohl eine Arzt- als auch eine Tierarztpraxis befinden sich fernab vom Hauptteil der Stadt; sie sind beide sehr klein, aber gut ausgestattet, um die Einwohner von Johnston zu versorgen. Es gibt eine einzige Grundschule namens Johnston Elementary School. Nach dem Abschluss der fünften Klasse müssen die Schüler sowohl die Mittelschule als auch die Highschool im nächsten Ort besuchen. Es gibt theoretisch keine Parks in der Stadt, aber sie sind derzeit dabei, einen 2,5-Acre-Freizeitbereich zu schaffen, um Familien mehr Gelegenheiten zum Ausgehen und zum Anlocken von Besuchern/ potentiellen Einwohnern zu bieten. Es gibt tatsächlich nicht viel zu tun; es gibt keine Kinos, Bowlingbahnen, \"Meet-up\"-Spots, Spielplätze für Kinder, Bereiche zum Spazierengehen mit Haustieren oder eine große Auswahl an Restaurants. Trotz allem ist es eine nette Stadt, so klein, dass man sie im Bruchteil einer Sekunde übersehen könnte!\n\n**[ENGLISH]**\n\nMy neighborhood is a quaint little town.

Es war ein wenig überraschend. Fast jedes Apartment in der Gegend ging für über tausend Dollar im Monat. Ich hatte noch nie etwas darüber gehört und auch meine Freunde nicht. Vielleicht ist es der Kampf. Ich weiß, dass einige meiner Freunde sich selbst in der Nacht in den Schlaf weinen. Dinge sind teuer, aber wir haben im Laufe der Jahre gelernt, sparsam zu sein. Ihnen gefällt der staubige Geruch von Flohmarktspielzeug und muffeligen Kleidern. Sie riechen in der Kindheit viel weniger. Sie könnten anfangen zu rauchen oder einfach nur daran gewöhnt sein. Aber der Flohmarkt behauptet sich immer. Der Geruch der Kindheit ist ein Stapel staubiger Magazine auf einem geschlossenen Klavier. Er dringt in das Leder ein und bleibt auch nach dem Waschen. Hier gibt es drei Secondhand-Läden in Gehdistanz. Wenn du auf der anderen Seite anfängst, kannst du zwei Wohltätigkeitsläden, eine Bibliothek, einen Antiquariat und einen Kellerladen besuchen. Downtown ist dicht, Autos und Menschen füllen die Straßen jeden Morgen, aber du würdest es in den Secondhand-Läden nicht hören. Egal, wie viele Menschen oder Autos vorbeikommen, der Laden ist still. Es ist ein netter Ort, um einen Nachmittag zu verbringen. Jedes Jahr gibt es mehr und mehr von denen. Autos und Menschen strömen herein. Es ist eine wachsende Stadt, sagen sie. Headquarters der größten Online-Handels- und Lieferplattform der Welt, zeigt es immer noch Wachstumsschmerzen. Es erinnert mich an New York. Alles und jeder hat seine eigenen Ziele, und es ist nicht viel, was jemand von dir will. Du kannst allein, still und unabhängig sein, und die Stadt wird dich in Ruhe lassen. Es ist nicht wie im Süden, wo ein wenig Besorgnis bedeutet, dass man sich kümmert. Hier dringt niemand in das Leben anderer ein. Du kannst deine Hülle so lange tragen, wie du möchtest, und die Stadt wird wie Wellen am Strand an- und abrollen. Es ist ein lebendiger Ort. Zwischen dem Pianisten nebenan und den beiden Amateur-Sängern oben ist immer etwas los. Auf eine Weise haben wir weniger eine Wohnung voller Fremder und mehr eine Gemeinschaft von Freunden. Wir versammeln uns zu unseren Bedürfnissen, feiern Geburtstage, trauern bei Beerdigungen und helfen uns gegenseitig, wenn wir können. Auf eine Weise bin ich froh, hier zu sein. Mir gefällt die meisten meiner Nachbarn und sie behandeln mich gut. Ich versuche sicherzustellen, dass ich nach mir selbst aufräume und ihnen Essen bringe, und sie tun dasselbe im Gegenzug. Ich bringe den Nachbarn Post und sie bringen sie zu mir. Es ist schön, sie zu sehen, und ich glaube, sie genießen meine Gesellschaft genauso sehr wie ich die ihre.

Wenn man dorthin kommt, sieht man nur gut gepflegte Einfamilienhäuser, wofür wir der Verbandsgemeinschaft der Eigentümer zu danken haben. Die Vorgärten sind alle sehr ähnlich. Es gibt kleine Rasenflächen, dekorative Kies und eher kurze Einfahrten. Ab und zu sieht man auch kleine Bäume. Jeder hat eine Doppelgarage. Wenn man weiter fährt, sieht man neue Asphaltstraßen. Trotz der vielen verschiedenen Familien, die hier leben, sind die Straßen in ausgezeichnetem Zustand. Es gibt keine Schlaglöcher oder dergleichen. Die meisten Häuser sind eingeschossig, manchmal sieht man aber auch zweischössige. Wir haben keine typischen Briefkastenanlagen, wie man sie an Einfamilienhäusern erwarten würde. Stattdessen ist es eher wie in Wohnungen, wo es am Ende der Straße eine große Gruppe von Briefkästen gibt. Jeder verwendet einen Schlüssel, um Zugang zu seinem Briefkasten zu erhalten. Und es gibt zwei größere Abholkästen für Pakete. Wieder einmal kann man der HOA und ihrer Obsession für Gleichmäßigkeit danken. Die Lage meines Hauses befindet sich am äußersten Rand der nahen Stadt, so dass mein Viertel sowohl ländlich als auch suburban ist. Daher haben wir viel Platz für alles. Es gibt mehrere Gemeinschaftsbecken, auf die jeder hier zugreifen kann. Sie sind gut gepflegt und abgeschlossen. Und es gibt verschiedene Spazierwege, auf denen man seinen Hund ausführen kann oder einfach einen Abendspaziergang machen kann. Man muss nicht in einen Park gehen, um Sport zu treiben. Das Viertel ist groß genug, um einfach drumherum zu laufen und genügend Sport zu bekommen. Der Großteil der Gemeinschaft besteht aus Rentnern. Es ist ein sehr sicherer Bereich und alle schauen aufeinander auf. Daneben gibt es auch einige mittlere und junge Berufstätige. Was die Stadt betrifft, so ist sie überraschend groß - zumindest was die Bevölkerung angeht - aber sie hat auch ein kleines Stadtgefühl. Wir haben die meisten Annehmlichkeiten, die man erwarten und auf die man sich verlassen kann. Zum Beispiel haben wir genau ein Einkaufszentrum. Es ist nicht riesig, aber es tut seinen Zweck. Für mich dauert es etwa 15 Minuten mit dem Auto, um zu einem wichtigen Ort zu gelangen, aber sobald ich dort bin, werde ich mit vielen verschiedenen Geschäften begrüßt. Es gibt alles von hochwertigen Supermärkten, in denen man Bio-Lebensmittel bekommen kann, bis hin zu günstigen Outlets, die nur eine begrenzte Auswahl an Artikeln führen und ein Minimum an Personal haben, um die Kosten niedrig zu halten.

For example, we have exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.",

    "original": "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",

    "original": "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",

Sie werden auch Leute sehen, die ihre Hunde spazieren führen, Rad fahren und Rollschuhe fahren. Nachbarn kennen ihre Nachbarn und können erkennen, wer dazugehört und wer nicht. Sie werden jemanden sehen, der draußen grillt und grüßen, oder jemanden, der seinen Hund von ein paar Blocks weiter führt und freundlich lächelt. Die Rasen sind in gutem Zustand.
