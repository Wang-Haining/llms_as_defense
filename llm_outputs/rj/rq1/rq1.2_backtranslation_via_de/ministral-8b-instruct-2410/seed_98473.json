Wohngebiete sind zwischen kommerziellen Gebieten verstreut, in denen eine Vielzahl von Unternehmen betrieben werden. Einige dieser Unternehmen bestehen aus Büros, während andere verschiedene Geschäfte, Restaurants und Unterhaltungsorte sind. Es gibt keine Mangel an neuen Restaurants, in denen man essen kann, oder Geschäften, in denen man einkaufen kann. Während einige Geschäfte große, bekannte Marken sind, die von großen Konzernen betrieben werden, sind kleine Boutiquen ebenfalls zunehmend beliebt. Sie sind nicht nur in verschiedenen Einkaufszentren, sondern auch auf den Straßen zu finden, die oft in Gehweite von Wohngebieten liegen, die ansonsten ruhig und friedlich wären, wenn sie nicht von so vielen interessanten Punkten umgeben wären. Es gibt auch ein paar nahegelegene Parks, und ich habe bemerkt, dass Menschen diese Parks mit ihren jungen Kindern besuchen. Was die Menschen betrifft, so gibt es im Stadtteil tatsächlich eine ziemliche Vielfalt. In einem kleinen Bereich haben wir eine prominente LGBTQ+-Community, eine orthodox-jüdische Gemeinschaft und eine Gruppe von Flüchtlingen und Einwanderern aus der ehemaligen Sowjetunion. Etwas weiter außerhalb meines Stadtteils gibt es viele Menschen aus verschiedenen Rassen und Ursprüngen, die jedoch manchmal in eigenen kleinen Gemeinschaften innerhalb der Stadt leben. Wir haben Orte wie Korea-Stadt, China-Stadt, Kleines Armenien und viele mehr, die nur wenige Meilen entfernt sind. Allerdings können nur wenige Meilen in dieser Stadt zu einer sehr langen Fahrt werden. Eine Fahrt von nur 10 Meilen kann manchmal zwei Stunden dauern, insbesondere während der Rush Hour. Kaum jemand in meiner Stadt geht zu Fuß irgendwohin, obwohl bestimmte interessante Orte in der Nähe sind. Die Stadt ist riesig, und die Menschen ziehen es nicht vor, zu Fuß zu pendeln. Daher haben wir auch einige der schlechtesten Verkehrsverhältnisse der Welt, und es ist schwierig, fast überall einen Parkplatz zu finden. Ironischerweise gibt es in den letzten Jahren einen großen Bauboom, da große Apartments in der Stadt gebaut werden. Es scheint ein beliebtes Ziel zu sein, aber viele Bewohner sind enttäuscht von der Aussicht auf noch mehr Menschen, die einziehen und mehr Fahrzeuge auf den Straßen. Es gibt verschiedene Arten von Häusern in meiner Stadt, obwohl nicht jeder oder will, in einem großen Apartmentgebäude leben. Wohngebiete bestehen aus Häusern in verschiedenen Größen und kleineren Apartments und Condominien. Einige Grundstücke enthalten Einfamilienhäuser, während andere Duplexe enthalten. Dies gilt auch für meinen direkten Stadtteil, sodass es auch keine Mangel an Möglichkeiten im Bereich des Wohnens gibt. Ähnlich dazu besteht der Stadtteil aus Menschen verschiedener Altersgruppen, und um ehrlich zu sein, bin ich mit der majority meiner Nachbarn nicht vertraut. Es ist heute nicht wirklich eine enge Gemeinschaft, obwohl ich aus meiner Kindheit viele Erinnerungen daran habe, im Freien mit meinem Nachbarn aus dem Haus nebenan und ein paar anderen Freunden aus dem Stadtteil zu spielen, die alle in meinem Alter waren.\"\n\nRevised English: [REWRITE] Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse.

Es, wie die meisten anderen, erinnert einem an eine Zeit nicht allzu lange her, wo das Leben im Vorort der amerikanische Traum war. Dieser Traum schien einst alle Menschen des Landes zu umarmen, aber jetzt weicht er zurück. Aber meine Nachbarschaft und viele mehr bleiben bestehen und rufen uns und die Besucher zu, dass der Traum immer noch lebt und wir ihn so gut wie möglich festhalten. Die Menschen fühlen sich nicht mehr so optimistisch wie früher, die Pflege der kleinen Gärten ist nicht mehr, was sie einmal waren, aber es gibt noch ein oder zwei Autos in jeder Einfahrt und die Jugend spielt, als ob die Welt um sie herum ihr ganzes Dasein wäre. Die öffentliche Schule, die seit fast 90 Jahren besteht, steht immer noch und scheint bei den Jugendlichen von heute eine Zukunft zu versprechen, während sie bei den älteren Bewohnern Nostalgie weckt. Die Kirchen sind rar gesät und meist leer, aber die Basketballplätze sind immer voll. Alle Häuser sehen unterschiedlich aus, aber sie fühlen sich gleich an. Es gibt einen großen Supermarkt namens Super \"A\", der von einer großen Jemenitischen Familie gehört wird, die wahrscheinlich die einzige arabische Familie in der Nachbarschaft sind. Die überwiegende Mehrheit der Bewohner sind Afroamerikaner. Die Straßen sind breit und die Kinder spielen normalerweise Fußball, nur um den Autos Platz zu machen. Die meisten Menschen in meiner Nachbarschaft sind seit Generationen hier und die meisten können Geschichten aus einer Zeit erzählen, in der jeder jeden kannte. Es gab eine Karateschule, aber als Hollywood aufhörte, Karatekind-Filme zu machen, hörten die Kinder auf, den Karatekid sein zu wollen, so dass es jetzt eine Apotheke ist, weil Drogen angeblich alles besser machen. Es gibt auch ein kleines Kino, das alte Filme zu einem reduzierten Preis zeigt, geschützt vor den Jugendlichen, die sich an die fehlenden Neuveröffentlichungen stören, aber von den älteren Bewohnern geschätzt, die es als kleinen Preis für einen Abend ohne Kinder betrachten. Es gibt eine einzige Schnellstraße, die durch meine Stadt führt. Das Ein- und Ausfahrten liegen in der Stadt neben uns. Es gab einmal eine Petition, um eine eigene Ausfahrt für unsere Stadt zu erhalten. Die Jugend unterstützte es, während die Älteren ablehnten. Es scheint, dass eine Schnellstraße in unserer Stadt alles ruinieren würde, sagten die Älteren und überzeugten schließlich den Stadtrat, die Anfrage abzulehnen.

In diesen Gemeinschaften, auf diesen Straßen, gibt es eine Handvoll Wohnkomplexe, die nebeneinander stehen wie russische Matrjoschka-Puppen, die sorgfältig auseinandergenommen und in einer Reihe entlang der Straße aufgestellt wurden. Die ersten Apartments, die du erreichst, waren in den Nachrichten für einige fragwürdige Geschäfte, also werden wir uns darauf nicht zu sehr konzentrieren - schließlich kann der Schein trügen. Aber die Apartments neben diesem Komplex und die zwei Komplexe daneben sind eine ganz andere Welt, von der fast niemand in diesem Bereich weiß. Gegenüber diesen Komplexen liegt ein Campus einer Gemeinschaftsuniversität - ein stiller, schläfriger Gebäudekomplex, der am Straßenrand steht, wo Studenten mit Kaffee in der Hand hereinkommen und um 7 Uhr morgens gähnen, um ihre schläfrigen Tage zu beginnen. Die eisernen Tore quietschen auf, um sie einzulassen, während Pendler aus dem Fenster schimpfen und bei höherer attendance die Straße aufhalten. Die Straße geht in eine andere Wohnstraße über, mit einem Park auf einer Seite und einem Rehabilitationszentrum für Menschen, die sich bei unglücklichen Umständen die Knochen gebrochen haben. Das Behandlungszentrum hat fröhliche Terrassenmöbel und eine träge sich drehenden Deckenventilator, der die warme, dicke Sommerluft hin und her bewegt. Kinder rennen auf dem Rasen hin und her, drehen Saltos und Radschläge auf den spitzen grünen Halmen, während Bienen träge in den Blumenbeeten entlang der Straße kreisen. Alte Rentner spazieren mit ihren Hunden auf dem Gehweg, schimpfen über die Jugendlichen auf ihren Skateboards und nicken den Teenagerinnen zu, die sich am Spielplatzgerät versammeln und über Jungs und die neuesten YouTube-Sensationen tratschen.

She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",

Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me.

One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library.

Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well.

The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here.

Öffentliche Verkehrsmittel sind sehr zugänglich und eine der beliebtesten Arten des Transports in New York City. Bensonhurt ist ein relativ städtisches Viertel, sodass du dich immer noch wie in New York City fühlst. Während deines Besuchs solltest du auf die verschiedenen asiatischen Geschäfte achten, die überall um dich herum zu sehen sind. In den letzten zwei Jahrzehnten hat Bensonhurt eine Welle von asiatischen Einwohnern erhalten. Daher wirst du mindestens jedes zweite Haus eine asiatisch geführte Geschäfts findest. Besonders beliebt sind Supermärkte und Waschsalons. Es ist nicht verwunderlich, dass diese Geschäfte sehr beliebt bei den ansässigen Bewohnern sind, da die Lebensmittelqualität in den Supermärkten hervorragend ist, die Preise viel günstiger sind und es sehr bequem ist. Gleich in der Nähe, wo ich wohne, gibt es vier asiatische Supermärkte, die in zwei Minuten zu Fuß voneinander entfernt sind. Dies erhöht die Bequemlichkeit beim Einkaufen. Ich will nicht sagen, dass Bensonhurst ausschließlich von asiatischen Einwohnern bewohnt wird. Es ist sehr vielseitig, mit Einwanderern und ihren ersten- und zweiten Generationen von amerikanischen Kindern. Die meisten großen und beliebten Geschäfte in der Umgebung sind asiatisch geführt. Neben diesen asiatischen Geschäfts gibt es auch einen kürzlich renovierten Park in der Nähe, der etwa zehn Basketballplätze, ein großes Feld für Fußball oder Baseball, vier Handballdächer, Schaukeln, einen Spielplatz für Kinder und sogar eine Wasserfontäne für Kinder hat, um im Sommer zu spielen. Da wir in New York City sind, sind die Parks natürlich sehr vielseitig. Du wirst hier alle Arten von Vielfalt sehen und gut miteinander auskommen. In diesem Viertel gibt es nicht viele große Unternehmensgebäude. Die einzigen Gebäude, die du finden wirst, sind solche für Kooperativen oder Eigentumswohnungen. Die meisten Wohnungen sind Zweifamilienhäuser. Die meisten Menschen sind sehr nett, aber auch sehr laut. Jeden Tag hörst du, wie Autos ihre Musik aufdrehen, wenn sie an deinem Haus vorbeifahren, oder wie sie ständig die Gaspedale durchtreten, was dich morgens weckt. Wenn du planst, abends zu besuchen, solltest du auf der Hut sein. Dieses Viertel ist relativ sicher, aber die Menschen sind unvorhersehbar. Du könntest auf Menschen stoßen, die ohne Grund Ärger machen wollen, Rowdies und Diebe. Ich selbst wurde in diesem Viertel in der Vergangenheit körperlich angegriffen, aber das war vor vielen Jahren. Ein weiteres jüngstes Ereignis war das Diebstahl von Paketen. Obwohl es hier oft vorkommt, gibt es auch Paketdiebe. Letztlich, obwohl New York City eine Strafe für Menschen hat, die ihre Hunde nicht sauber hinterlassen, werden die Regeln hier nicht befolgt. Jeden Morgen siehst du mindestens einen Hundehaufen auf dem Weg zum Bahnhof oder zum Supermarkt. Mein größtes Ärgernis ist es, dass es überall in diesem Viertel Hundehaufen gibt.

Over the past two decades, Bensonhurst has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as the quality of food in the supermarkets is superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing groceries. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!",

It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",

    "original": "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",

Zunächst einmal war ich traurig, als ich zu meinem neuen Wohngebiet kam. Ich kam aus Riverdale nach Stockbridge und ich werde nicht lügen, ich habe geweint, weil ich sie vermisste und sie geliebt habe, aber meine Eltern und meine kleine Schwester wollten das Beste für uns, also sind wir in eine bessere Wohngegend, eine bessere Highschool und alles erschien \"nicht heruntergekommen\", als wir in unser neues Wohngebiet zogen. Über die Jahre habe ich mich daran gewöhnt und einige neue Freunde gefunden, aber auch einige Feinde in der Schule. Ich habe meine Nachbarn nie wirklich kennengelernt, außer Mr. Glen und seine Kinder sowie Dennis für eine Weile, die beide direkt neben uns wohnten. Sie waren nette Menschen, die ich fast als Familie betrachten kann, und ich schätze sie wirklich. Ich erinnere mich, als ich, meine Mutter, mein Vater und meine Schwester zur Hochzeit von Mr. Glen (sie haben sich wieder verheiratet) gingen. Es war wirklich lustig und unterhaltsam, um es mild auszudrücken, und etwas, auf das ich mich freue, wenn ich meine Zukunftspläne verwirkliche und meiner zukünftigen Frau das Leben einer Königin ermöglichen werde. Als Mrs. Veda, die Frau von Mr. Glen, das kleine weiße Band von ihrem Bein nahm und es warf, fing ich es! Leider habe ich die Blumen nicht gefangen! Wir tanzten die ganze Nacht durch, und ich hatte wirklich Spaß mit Marsharii, einer ihrer Töchter. Ich habe sie seither nicht mehr gesehen, aber ich hoffe, sie hat es zu etwas Größerem und Besserem gebracht. Das Wohngebiet selbst ist wie ein Labyrinth, obwohl ich jetzt ein GPS habe, so dass ich mehr Zeit zum Erkunden habe. Ich bin noch nicht so weit gekommen, aber dort, wo ich mit meinen Freunden Kason und Curtis hingegangen bin, haben wir viele Videospiele gespielt und das Leben in vollen Zügen genossen. Manchmal gehe ich in den Park und genieße die Natur, was meine Seele beruhigt. Es gibt mir ein Gefühl von Gelassenheit und Frieden. Ich bringe manchmal Stöcke mit, die ich aus dem Baumarkt gekauft habe, und übe mein Gleichgewicht, und bringe meinen Bokken-Holzschwert mit, wenn ich kann. Ich habe Spaß daran, das zu tun, was ich liebe. Es gibt auch einen Basketball- und Tennisplatz, obwohl ich schon lange nicht mehr Tennis oder Basketball gespielt habe, ist es immer noch schön, falls ich es wieder aufnehmen möchte. Mein Vater hat mich und meinen besten Freund auf Tennis mit Mr. Graves trainiert, und wir hatten immer viel Spaß. Sie haben uns hart gearbeitet, aber wir hatten immer viel Spaß. Ich denke, es gibt viele Momente, in denen ich Spaß in diesem Wohngebiet hatte, und es gibt viele Geschichten, aber diese sind besonders für mich wichtig, und ich glaube, dass das Beste noch kommt!\n\n**Back to English:**\n\n[REWRITE] Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know.

Einer der Bars hat kürzlich einen neuen Namen bekommen, und diese ist teurer, aber die Qualität des Services und der Getränke ist nicht so schlecht. Die meisten Menschen sind nett. Sie sind entweder Studenten oder haben ein geringeres Einkommen, weil der Wohnraum nicht teuer ist. Es gibt viele Kinder in der Nähe, da sich eine Grundschule in Fußweite von meiner Wohnung befindet. Ich kenne meine Nachbarn nicht, und ich möchte das auch nicht. Sie rauchen viel Gras, und deswegen hat die Verwaltung meines Gebäudes eine Luftreinigungsanlage direkt vor ihrer Tür installiert, was mein Freund und ich sehr lustig fanden. Das ist fast beleidigend. Die Gebäude um mich herum sind normalerweise alt, aber sie haben renovierte Innenräume. Ein Stück weiter die Straße entlang gibt es neue Wohnungen, aber ich mag sie nicht, weil ich weiß, dass sie nicht besonders gut gebaut wurden. Sie sind billig gebaut, aber die Mieten sind teuer, was ich für einen Betrug halte, aber weil sie in der Nähe des Campus liegen, kann die Verwaltung dieser Gebäude davon profitieren. Es gibt ein sehr günstiges Restaurant etwa fünf Minuten von meiner Wohnung entfernt, das nur auf Pappbechern serviert und die meisten Speisen in der Mikrowelle zubereitet werden. Direkt gegenüber befindet sich eine Tankstelle, die ich gehört habe, ist kein guter Arbeitsplatz. Aber dank einiger städtischer Gelder wurde die Straße vergangenen Sommer neugestaltet, so dass es einen großen Bürgersteig, viel Gras auf den Mittelstreifen und an den Straßenrändern gibt und der Bereich jetzt ein bisschen schöner ist. Aber das Apartmentgebäude, in dem ich wohne, ist von Bäumen umgeben. Sie haben ein paar gefällt, so dass einige Stümpfe stehen, aber es gibt mehr Bäume bei mir als weiter unten an der Straße.

We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",

It's a fantastic place to live, just forty minutes outside Charlotte. Each morning is greeted by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It's like living in a small, self-contained village. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that brays in the evening to let us know he is there. I was fortunate to find this gem of a neighborhood.

    "transformed": "My neighborhood consists of duplexes on a cul-de-sac. The buildings are scattered and spaced in such a way that they appear as individual homes. The only difference is that they are all painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We often stand at the end of an unplanned driveway in the evenings and chat while the neighborhood's small children play with their toys, sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. It is refreshing in this modern world filled with machinery and computers. It feels like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees, enhanced by blue skies and white, billowing clouds. The only downside? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings, and last night, for the first time, we heard the actual sirens, so we had to rush to shelter. Sure enough, I found myself in my bathtub, clutching my smallest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My bigger dog refused to join us in the bathroom, remaining in the living room, nervous and barking about the unusual circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet, except for the sound of large hail falling all around. After the storm, the road was literally steaming from the sudden temperature change, dropping from 92 to 75 degrees in minutes. The hail instantly melted upon hitting the hot pavement. As I looked up at the clearing skies, the sun came out, and it started to rain. I ran inside and quickly snapped pictures of a double rainbow to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were as awestruck as I was. The streets remained quiet for another hour before some people finally returned home from wherever they had been when the thunderstorm hit. Then, it was business as usual, with mothers and children outside while dinner was being prepared. This neighborhood is a gem for me, who has recently moved from NH to NC. I love the Southern accent that people speak with. My two-bedroom, two-bath apartment is typical for the neighborhood. Although all the houses look the same from the outside, not all apartments are the same on the inside; some are quite small. It doesn't make sense to me.

Es war schwer, erste Freunde zu finden, aber ich habe mich schließlich mit jemandem angefreundet, der zwei Häuser weiter wohnt, und mit einem anderen Jungen, der auf meiner Straße wohnt. Beide wohnen dort nicht mehr, aber die Erinnerungen sind noch da. Die meisten Menschen, die hier lebten, als ich hierher zog, leben noch immer hier. Mein Nachbarschaft ist sehr ähnlich wie ein durchschnittliches amerikanisches Vorortsnachbarschaft. Es gibt viele zweistöckige Häuser hier. An den Wochenenden oder wann immer es warm ist, höre ich die Kinder im Freien spielen. Die Nachbarschaft ist die meisten Tage der Woche ruhig. Ich habe nie ein Problem mit den Leuten in der Nachbarschaft gehabt. Man ist hier allein, es sei denn, man braucht Hilfe. Ich habe online viele Pakete bestellt und noch nie ein Paket von meinem Vorgarten gestohlen worden. Ich fühle mich sicher bei meinen Nachbarn. In etwa einer Minute zu Fuß von meinem Haus entfernt gibt es einen Park. Dort habe ich viele Erinnerungen. Ich habe dort Basketball, Fußball und Baseball mit den anderen Jungen in der Nachbarschaft gespielt. Ich habe auch eine meiner schlechtesten Erinnerungen dort, als ich mir beim Fußballspielen die Nase eingedrückt habe, aber die guten Erinnerungen überwiegen die schlechten. Heute gehe ich dorthin, um Zeit mit den Kindern meines Cousins zu verbringen. Sie sind viel jünger als ich und mögen immer noch auf Schaukeln und Rutschen zu spielen. Der Gedanke an den Park macht sie aufgeregt. Der Park macht mich sehr nostalgisch für viele verschiedene Gründe. Die Nachbarschaft ist sehr vielfältig. Man findet hier viele verschiedene Arten von Lebensmitteln. In einem Radius von einer Meile findet man chinesische, indische, mexikanische und italienische Restaurants. Heute bestellen viele Menschen ihre Nahrung über Apps wie GrubHub und DoorDash liefern zu lassen. Die beliebtesten Essensplätze sind die Fastfood-Restaurants, aber man findet sie in fast jeder Vorortsnachbarschaft. Es gibt auch viele Pizzerien. Die Geschäfte hier bieten alles, was man braucht. Es gibt mehrere Wäschereien in der Nähe. Auf der gleichen Straße wie Walgreens und CVS gibt es auch einen Jewel-Osco-Supermarkt, der im Mittleren Westen beliebt ist. Einige der Geschäfte sind auch vielfältig, wie ein indisch geführtes Geschäft, falls man mal indisches Essen selbst machen oder fertige indische Speisen kaufen möchte. Insgesamt bin ich zufrieden mit meiner Nachbarschaft. Wenn ich auf sozialen Medien lese und im Fernsehen Nachrichten sehe, wie andere Menschen mit ihren Nachbarn Horrorgeschichten erleben, bin ich dankbar für meine Nachbarschaft.\n\n[REWRITE] I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade.

Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time!

Es fällt in South Carolina nicht weiter auf, aber es hat einen signifikanten Einfluss auf die Landwirtschaft. Johnston ist als die Peach-Capital der Welt bekannt, etwas, auf das die Stadt stolz ist und das auf den Begrüßungsschildern steht. Es besteht hauptsächlich aus Landwirtschaftsland, das entweder von Pfirsichbäumen oder von Vieh beherrscht wird. Häuser, die nicht im Hauptteil der Stadt liegen, sind weit verstreut; die meisten sind zweistöckig mit entweder Metalldächern, um die brennende Sommerhitze zu bekämpfen, oder grauen Dachziegeln. Diese Häuser stehen nicht nah an der Straße, sondern weiter hinten, sodass die vorderen Felder für Tiere oder Erntezwecke genutzt werden können. Im Hauptteil der Stadt hängt an einer vierfachen Kreuzung eine Ampel, und hier befinden sich die einzigen Geschäfte der gesamten Stadt. Es gibt drei Orte, an denen man \"Schnellesser\" bekommt: Hong Kong, ein kleines chinesisches Restaurant, das von einer Familie betrieben wird, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant oder Gary's, eine kleine Burgerkette. Es gab früher eine Pizzeria, die aber kürzlich geschlossen hat. Es gibt eine kleine, familiengeführte Apotheke namens Maxwell und Halford Drug; seltsamerweise sind sie am besten für das Cherry-Cola bekannt, das sie verkaufen. Es gibt einen kleinen, aber teuren Supermarkt namens Independent Grocers Alliance, der auch als IGA bekannt ist. Während es der einzige Supermarkt in der gesamten Stadt ist, halten viele nur für ein oder zwei Artikel an; die meisten fahren nach Batesburg-Leesville, um den Großteil ihrer Lebensmittel zu kaufen. Der beliebteste Laden in der gesamten Stadt ist Dollar General; dieser Verkaufspunkt bietet eine große Auswahl an Alltagsartikeln und ist oft von morgens bis abends stark frequentiert! Es gibt einen sehr kleinen Möbelladen, Possibilities Furniture & More, der von einer freundlichen Frau betrieben wird, die in der Gemeinschaft gut bekannt ist. Der Laden ist seit vielen Jahren in Johnston und beschäftigt sogar zwei Möbelpacker, die die gekauften Möbel ausliefern! An das Möbelladengebäude ist ein kleiner Tierfrisiersalon namens Clark's Cuts und Kennels angeschlossen. Sie bieten eine Vielzahl von Dienstleistungen wie Tagesbetreuung, Unterbringung, Frisieren, Nagelbeschleifen, Baden und mehr an. Sowohl eine Arzt- als auch eine Tierarztpraxis befinden sich abseits vom Hauptteil der Stadt; sie sind beide sehr klein, aber gut ausgestattet, um den Bewohnern von Johnston zu helfen. Es gibt eine einzige Grundschule namens Johnston Elementary School. Sobald die Schüler die fünfte Klasse abgeschlossen haben, müssen sie die weiterführende Schule und die High School in der nächsten Stadt besuchen. Es gibt technisch gesehen keine Parks in der Stadt, aber sie sind gerade dabei, einen 2,5-Acres-Recreation-Bereich zu schaffen, um den Familien mehr Möglichkeiten für Ausflüge zu bieten und mehr Besucher oder potenzielle Bewohner anzuziehen.Man muss zugeben, es gibt nicht viel zu tun; es gibt keine Kinos, Bowlingbahnen, \"Hängestellen\", Spielplätze für Kinder, Bereiche zum Spazierengehen mit Haustieren oder eine große Auswahl an Restaurants. Trotz allem ist es eine nette Stadt, so klein, dass man sie in der Minute, in der man sie passiert, nicht bemerkt!\n\n**Translation back to English:**\n\n[REWRITE] My neighborhood is a charming little town.

    "original": "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",

Das war etwas überraschend. Fast jede Wohnung in der Gegend ging für über tausend Dollar pro Monat über den Tisch. Ich hatte noch nie davon gehört und auch keines meiner Freunde. Vielleicht liegt es an der Not. Ich weiß, dass einige meiner Freunde sich jede Nacht in Tränen auflösen. Die Dinge sind teuer, aber wir haben im Laufe der Jahre gelernt, klug zu sein. Du gewöhntest dich an den staubigen Geruch von Flohmarktspielzeugen und muffelnden Kleidern. Du riechst in der Erwachsenenwelt weniger. Du könntest anfangen zu rauchen oder einfach nur zu sehr daran gewöhnt sein. Aber der Flohmarkt stellt sich immer wieder ein. Der Geruch der Erwachsenenwelt ist staubige Magazine auf einem geschlossenen Klavier. Er setzt sich in das Leder fest und bleibt selbst nach dem Waschen. Hier gibt es drei Second-Hand-Läden in Gehweite. Wenn du auf der anderen Seite anfängst, kannst du zwei Wohltätigkeitsvereins-Läden, eine Bibliothek, einen Antiquariat und einen Souvenirladen besuchen. Downtown ist dicht, Autos und Menschen füllen die Straßen jeden Morgen, aber du würdest es in den Läden nicht hören. Egal wie viele Menschen oder Autos vorbeifahren, der Laden ist still. Es ist ein netter Ort, um einen Nachmittag zu verbringen. Jedes Jahr gibt es immer mehr von denen. Autos und Menschen füllen es. Es ist eine wachsende Stadt, sagen sie. Mit Hauptsitz einer der größten Online-Handels- und Lieferunternehmen, zeigt es noch wachsende Schmerzen. Es erinnert mich an New York. Alles und jeder hat seine eigenen Ziele, und niemand fragt wirklich nach etwas von dir. Du kannst allein, ruhig und unabhängig sein, und die Stadt lässt dich in Ruhe. Es ist nicht wie im Süden, wo es bedeutet, dass man sich um den anderen kümmert. Hier fragt man nicht wirklich nach dem Leben eines anderen. Du kannst deinen Mantel so lange tragen, wie du möchtest, und die Stadt rollt wie Wellen am Strand zurück. Es ist ein lebhafter Ort. Zwischen dem Pianisten nebenan und den zwei Amateur-Sängern oben gibt es immer etwas zu hören. Auf eine Weise haben wir weniger als eine Wohnung voller Fremder und mehr eine Gemeinschaft von Freunden. Wir kommen zusammen für unsere Bedürfnisse, feiern Geburtstage, trauern um die Toten und helfen einander, wenn wir können. Auf eine Weise habe ich Glück hier zu sein. Ich mag die meisten meiner Nachbarn und sie behandeln mich gut. Ich bemühe mich, sauber zu bleiben und ihnen Lebensmittel zu hinterlassen und sie tun das Gleiche für mich. Ich bringe ihnen Post und sie bringen mir welche. Es ist schön, sie zu sehen und ich denke, sie genießen meine Gesellschaft so sehr wie ich ihre. Ich lebe in einem riesigen, entmenschlichenden modernistischen Ausbreitung, aber es sind Menschen wie meine Nachbarn, die mir das Gefühl geben, dass ich mein Leben nicht völlig ruiniert habe.\n\nNow, let's translate the German version back to English.\n\n[REWRITE]The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing.

Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.[/REWRITE]",

In meinem Stadtteil ist die Anwesenheit einer Eigentümergemeinschaft besonders auffällig. Wenn man dort eintritt, sieht man nichts als gut gepflegte Einfamilienhäuser, wofür wir der Eigentümergemeinschaft danken können. Die Vorgärten sind alle sehr ähnlich. Es gibt eine kleine Fläche mit Landschaftsrasen, einige dekorative Kieselsteine und relativ kurze Einfahrten. Gelegentlich sieht man auch kleine Bäume. Jeder hat einen zweiachsigen Carport. Wenn man weiter durch die Nachbarschaft fährt, sieht man frisch asphaltierte Betonstraßen. Trotz vieler verschiedener Familien, die dort leben, sind die Straßen in hervorragendem Zustand. Man findet keine Schlaglöcher oder dergleichen hier. Die meisten Häuser sind einstockig, aber manchmal sieht man auch zweigeschossige Häuser. Wir haben keinen typischen Briefkastenaufbau, den man für Einfamilienhäuser erwarten würde. Stattdessen erinnert es eher an Wohnungen, wo es am Ende der Straße eine große Gruppe von Briefkasten gibt. Jeder verwendet einen Schlüssel, um Zugang zu seinem spezifischen Briefkasten zu erhalten. Und es gibt zwei größere Schließfächer für Pakete. Wieder einmal kann man der HOA und ihrer Obsession für Uniformität danken. Die Lage meines Hauses liegt am äußersten Rand der nahegelegenen Stadt, sodass mein Stadtteil sowohl ländlich als auch städtisch geprägt ist. Als Folge haben wir viel Land für alles. Es gibt mehrere Gemeinschaftsbereiche, die jeder hier lebende Person zugänglich sind. Sie sind gut gepflegt und abgesperrt. Und es gibt verschiedene Wanderwege, auf denen man seinen Hund ausführen oder einfach abends spazieren gehen kann. Man muss keine Parks besuchen, um sich zu bewegen. Die Nachbarschaft ist groß genug, dass man einfach um sie herumlaufen kann und mehr als genügend Bewegung bekommt. Die meisten Bewohner sind Rentner. Es ist ein sehr sicheres Gebiet, und alle passen aufeinander auf. Mischt man das mit ein, haben wir auch einige Menschen mittleren Alters und Young Professionals. Was die Stadt betrifft, so ist sie überraschend groß - zumindest was die Bevölkerung angeht - aber auch wie eine Kleinstadt. Wir haben die überwiegende Mehrheit der Annehmlichkeiten, die man erwarten und auf die man sich verlassen kann. Zum Beispiel gibt es genau ein Einkaufszentrum. Es ist nicht riesig, aber es tut seinen Job. Für mich dauert es etwa 15 Minuten Autofahrt, um zu einem richtigen Ziel zu gelangen, aber sobald ich das gemacht habe, begrüßt mich eine Vielzahl von Geschäften. Es gibt alles von hochwertigen Supermärkten, in denen man Bio-Lebensmittel bekommt, bis hin zu Schnäppchenläden, die nur eine kleine Auswahl an Artikeln führen und mit minimalem Personal ausgestattet sind, um die Kosten zu senken. Alles in allem ist mein Stadtteil sicher, gepflegt und sehr typisch. Wir haben viele schöne Dinge wie Pools und Wanderwege. Und obwohl wir nicht direkt neben einem Einkaufszentrum wohnen, kann man einfach in ein Auto steigen und zu jeder großen Kette fahren, die man möchte.\n\n**Back Translation to English:**\n[REWRITE]\nThe general area where I live can be described as typical cookie-cutter suburbia.

Mein unmittelbares Umfeld, auf der Ostseite der Stadt, könnte als das am wenigsten wirtschaftlich begünstigte Gebiet der Stadt beschrieben werden. Immobilienwerte sind niedrig, Haushalte werden meist von Menschen mit niedrigem Einkommen gemietet oder besessen. Es ist jedoch nicht unattraktiv oder unangenehm. Meine Nachbarn sind im Allgemeinen freundliche Menschen, die lächeln und hallo sagen, wenn ich die Straße entlang gehe. Die Kriminalitätsrate ist zwar etwas höher als in anderen Teilen der Stadt, aber im Allgemeinen niedrig. In den letzten zehn Jahren gab es in wenigen Blocks von meinem Zuhause einige gewalttätige Kriminalität, einschließlich Schusswaffenvergehen und mindestens einer Ermordung. Unsere direkten Nachbarn verloren ihren Sohn in einem Schusswaffenverbrechen vor einem letzten Jahr vor einer Bar. Glücklicherweise hat unsere Familie nichts direkt mit der Kriminalität zu tun gehabt, außer dass gelegentlich ein Gegenstand von unserer Veranda verschwindet, wenn wir ihn nicht hereingeholt haben. Die Stadt, in der ich lebe, wurde stark von der „Opioid-Epidemie“ beeinflusst, die viele Teile der Vereinigten Staaten betrifft. Viele Leben wurden durch Fentanyl-Überdosen verloren. Glücklicherweise gibt es in meiner Stadt viele Ressourcen zum Bekämpfen dieser Epidemie, einschließlich mehrerer Suchtbehandlungszentren und Narcan-Schulungen für Familien und Freunde von Betroffenen. Trotz dieser Herausforderungen hat die Stadt viele positive Merkmale. Die Grundschule meines Sohnes hat einen exzellenten Mitarbeiterstab, von der Schulleitung bis zu den Lehrern und dem Support-Team. Trotz seiner besonderen Bedürfnisse hat er bisher keine Mobbing-Erfahrungen gesammelt, weil die Schulatmosphäre so positiv ist und er es liebt. Wir haben einen aktiven Eltern-Lehrer-Verband, der regelmäßig Veranstaltungen plant, um den Familieneinfluss und den Bildungsfortschritt zu fördern. Da über 20% der Bevölkerung der Stadt unter der Armutsgrenze leben, bietet die Grundschule allen Schülern kostenloses Frühstück und Mittagessen an, sodass kein Kind hungrig gehen muss. Kein Kind oder Elternteil wird aufgrund seiner finanziellen Lage als „weniger von etwas“ betrachtet, und die Kosten für Schulgebühren, Materialien und Schulausflüge sind sehr angemessen. Der Stadtrat und die Mitarbeiter haben viele Verbesserungen am Aussehen der Stadt vorgenommen, einschließlich Straßenpflasterung, Landschaftsgestaltung und Renovierung von Stadtparks. Leider fanden die meisten dieser Verbesserungen in der Stadtmitte und auf der Westseite statt, wo sich alle Einkaufsbereiche befinden und der meiste Verkehr durchfährt. Die Ostseite, auf der ich lebe, wird vernachlässigt, was in meinem Viertel zu Unmut führt. Insgesamt genieße ich das Leben in dieser Stadt. Die Menschen sind im Allgemeinen freundlich, die Schulen sind gut, es gibt genügend Einkaufsmöglichkeiten (ob kleine Geschäfte oder größere Einzelhandelsgeschäfte) für die Bedürfnisse meiner Familie, und unser Zuhause mag nicht viel wert sein, aber es ist bequem und ausreichend. Unsere Familie lebt schon seit über 16 Jahren hier und können uns keinen anderen Ort vorstellen.\"\n\n**Back to English:**\n[REWRITE]I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city.

    "original": "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",

Ich wohne in einem 7-geschossigen Appartementgebäude direkt gegenüber vom alten Live-Theater und ein paar Blocks weiter, in der Nähe von \"The Hill\", befindet sich eine coole kleine Bowlingbar, die von verschiedenen Menschen auf warmen Sommerabenden besucht wird. Manchmal, besonders an den Wochenenden im Juni und Juli, sieht man eine Schlange an Wartenden, die in die Bar wollen. Einige Blocks weiter oben liegt der nächste Stadtpark. Er ist groß, vor allem für diesen Stadtteil. Die Parkumgebung besteht aus Beton, mit hoher Treppe, die in die Wand integriert ist. In den kalten Wintermonaten stellen Obdachlose ihre Zelte in ordentlichen Reihen entlang des Bürgersteigs und der breiten Treppen auf. Es schneit nicht viel, aber es regnet stark, und die sintflutartigen Regenfälle im Mittwinter machen es oft schwierig, warm zu bleiben. Da sie ihre Zelte eng zusammenstellen, im Stadtzentrum statt am Rand, bleiben sie wärmer. Sie sind auch in bequemer Reichweite zu Fuß oder mit öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln zum einzigen Familienzentrum in der Umgebung, wo sie baden und duschen können. Was ich an meiner Stadt liebe, ist nicht die Schönheit der historischen Architektur – die hohen stolzen Gebäude, die Architektur, die sich über die verschiedenen Ebenen der Hügel erstreckt, die zum Meer hin abfallen. Was ich an meinem Stadtteil liebe, ist die Kultur der Menschen selbst. Sie erzählen von den alten Zeiten, als Hilltop der berüchtigtste Stadtteil auf der Westküste für Gangs war. Man hört immer noch Geschichten, selbst drei Jahrzehnte später, über die Bundesbeamten und die DEA, die wie ein Besen durch die Straßen fegten, um die Straßen zu säubern. Die Menschen vergessen nicht. Geschichten werden von Generation zu Generation weitererzählt, einschließlich an Neuankömmlinge wie mich, von diesen Tagen. Die Menschen arbeiten hart, auch wenn es immer noch als einer der raueren 'Hoods' in der ganzen Stadt gilt, um es sauber zu halten. Sie kümmern sich immer noch um das, was in ihrer Stadt, auf ihrer Straße passiert. Sie sagen, wenn man weiß ist, sollte man nicht nach dark durch die Hills laufen. Eher auf die alten Zeiten zurückzuführen, hat diese Warnung einen bitteren Beigeschmack von gesellschaftlicher Konditionierung. Vielleicht bin ich einfach dunkel genug, um nicht vollständig als \"weiße Frau\" durchzugehen, oder vielleicht erkennt Hilltop in mir eine der Ihren, eine, die genauso schmerzlich der ständigen Erinnerung bewusst ist, die unser Land plagt. Schließlich eines weiß ich: egal wie weit ich reise, Hilltop ist mein Zuhause. Ich fühle mich lebendig, wenn ich nachts durch die Straßen gehe, Menschen, die mir seltener ein Jackett anbieten als mich zu bestehlen. Es ist ein Ort, an dem die Wäschereibesitzer ein paar Minuten später aufbleiben, um mein Handy aufladen zu können, wenn ich nirgends vor dem Regen flüchten kann. Es ist ein Ort, an dem ich mich an kalten, grauen Nächten gegen den Beton der Ladenvorderseiten gedrängt habe, nur um jemanden anzuhalten, der mich ansieht, mir einen $5 gegeben und mir sagt, dass ich schön und wertvoll sei.\n\n**Rewritten English Translation:**\n[REWRITE] My neighborhood is teeming with culture. It sits atop a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical significance. I live in a 7-story apartment building right across from the old live Theatre, and just a block down from \"The Hill,\" is a cool little arcade bar where various types of people flock to on warm summer nights. On weekends in June and July, you'll often see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park, which is quite large for the part of town it's in. Surrounding the park is concrete, with tall steps integrated into the wall. During the cold winter months, homeless people set up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains heavily, and the torrential downpours in the mid-winter months often make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents close together, in the city center rather than out on the outskirts, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower.\n\nWhat I love about my city, though, isn't the beauty of the historic architecture – the tall, proud buildings, the architecture that's scattered throughout the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop was once the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. Even three decades later, you still hear stories about federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people don't forget. Stories are still passed down from generation to generation, to transplants like me, about those days. The people work hard, regardless of it still being considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it clean. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe this warning is a remnant of the old days, tinged with the bitter taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it's because I'm dark enough to pass as not entirely \"white,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who's just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are born out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that's supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have offered me a jacket more readily than to rob me. It's a place where laundry owners have stayed open a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had nowhere to escape from the rain. It's a place where I've huddled against concrete storefronts on the grayest of nights, feeling invisible, only to have someone stop and hand me $5, telling me I'm beautiful and valuable. [/REWRITE]",

    "original": "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",

    "raw_output": "**German Translation:**\n\"I lebe in ländlichem Amerika, genauer gesagt in einer Kleinstadt in Michigan. Von Ackerland zu kleinen Touristenstädten führt die Straße. Es gibt hier keine großen Einkaufszentren, keine Walmart, Target oder auch keine Applebee’s. Für alles, was man braucht, muss man fahren. Trotz allem lebe ich in einer der schönsten Orte der Welt, umgeben von Wasser. Meine 'Stadt' ist von Wasser umgeben. Auf einer Seite liegt der schöne Lake Michigan, auf der anderen Seite der Lake Charlevoix. Überall, wo man hingeht, findet man einen Strand, um die Füße ins Wasser zu tauchen. Mein Wohnviertel spiegelt das Bild einer Kleinstadt wider. Die Häuser sind nicht übereinandergestapelt. Sie sind keine Fertighäuser, sondern ältere Häuser, einige renoviert und andere alt. Die meisten Häuser haben Kellerräume, die von der Straße aus sichtbar sind. Viele Häuser im Viertel haben alte Aluminiumverkleidungen. Es gibt Häuser in jeder Farbe, die man sich vorstellen kann, in den Blocks, die mein Haus umgeben. Die meisten Häuser haben Gärten. Dort stehen Trampoline, Spielgeräte und bei einigen auch Gartenanlagen und Zäune für Tiere. Die Häuser ähneln dem typischen Amerika. Es sind hart arbeitende Menschen, die von ihrem Verdienst leben und entweder Familien großziehen oder schon eine Familie haben. Tagsüber sieht man Kinder auf den Straßen laufen, Menschen mit Hunden Gassi führen, Rad fahren und Inline skaten. Nachbarn kennen sich und man erkennt, wer dazugehört und wer nicht. Man sieht jemanden im Garten grillieren und winkt, oder jemand, der ein paar Blocks entfernt einen Hund ausführt und freundlich lächelt. Die Rasen sind gut gepflegt. Niemand hat abgefallene Blätter von der letzten Saison liegen gelassen. Die Rasen sind gemäht und die Pflanzen und Sträucher im Garten gestutzt. Es ist kein besonders schöner Stadtteil, aber einer, in den man fährt und denkt, dass dies ein guter Ort zum Leben und Erziehen von Familien wäre. Es ist ruhig, friedlich und sicher. Direkt in der Nähe gibt es das Bezirksgefängnis und die Gesundheitsbehörde. Das Recyclingzentrum liegt nur ein paar Blocks weiter. Nachbarn und Einwohner aus der Stadt nutzen die angebotenen Dienstleistungen. In der Nähe gibt es Baseball- und Softballfelder, wo man die Ansager die Punktestände und Spielernamen rufen hört. Unser kleiner Flughafen liegt daneben. Man kann draußen spielen oder drinnen und die Geräusche der kleinen Flugzeuge beim Starten und Landen hören. Man kann zu Fuß Eis von der lokalen Eisdiele holen, und wenn man wirklich will, kann man auch zu Fuß in die Innenstadt kommen. Unsere Kinder können mit dem Rad zum Park fahren, der nur 8 Blocks entfernt liegt. Es ist wirklich ein toller Ort zum Leben.\"\n\n**Back to English:**\n[REWRITE] I live in rural America, specifically in a small town in Michigan. From farmland to small tourist cities, you go by car.
