    "original": "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",

Es gibt keine großen Einkaufszentren, kein Wal-Mart, Target oder sogar ein Applebee's. Wohin man auch will, muss man mit dem Auto fahren. Dennoch lebe ich in einer der schönsten Gegenden der Welt, umgeben von Wasser. Meine \"Stadt\" ist von Wasser umgeben. Der schöne Lake Michigan auf der einen Seite und der Lake Charlevoix auf der anderen. Überall kann man einen Strand finden, um seine Zehen ins Wasser zu tauchen. Meine Nachbarschaft spiegelt die Idee einer Kleinstadt wider. Die Häuser stehen nicht dicht nebeneinander. Es sind keine standardisierten Häuser, die alle gleich gebaut sind. Es sind ältere Häuser, einige werden renoviert und modernisiert, andere sind noch älter. Die meisten Häuser haben Keller. Vollständige Keller, die man von der Straße aus sehen kann. Viele Häuser in der Nachbarschaft haben ältere Aluminiumverkleidungen. Wir haben Häuser in jeder vorstellbaren Farbe in den Straßen rund um mein Haus. Die meisten Häuser haben Gärten. Gärten mit Trampolinen und Spielplätzen. Manche Leute haben Gärten und Zäune für ihre Tiere. Die Häuser ähneln dem Bild des mittleren Amerikas. Fleißige Menschen, die arbeiten, um ihren Lebensunterhalt zu verdienen, und die entweder Familien großziehen oder bereits großgezogen haben. An jedem beliebigen Tag sieht man Kinder, die die Straßen auf und ab laufen. Man sieht auch Leute, die Hunde ausführen, Rad fahren und Rollschuh laufen. Nachbarn kennen Nachbarn und man kann erkennen, wer dazugehört und wer nicht. Man sieht jemanden draußen grillen und winkt, oder jemand, der mit seinem Hund ein paar Blocks weiter spazieren geht und freundlich lächelt. Die Rasenflächen sind in gutem Zustand. Niemand hat Blätter vom Herbst aufgetürmt. Grünes Gras wird gemäht und unter Kontrolle gehalten. Wenn Menschen Pflanzen und Büsche in ihren Gärten haben, werden sie gestutzt. Es ist keine wunderschöne Nachbarschaft, in die man hineinfährt und denkt, wow, schau dir die schönen Häuser an, sondern eine, in die man hineinfährt und denkt, dass es ein guter Ort wäre, um eine Familie großzuziehen. Es ist ruhig, friedlich und sicher. Auch wenn es nur durchschnittlich aussieht, ist es außergewöhnlich, weil es das repräsentiert, was Menschen in der Welt wollen: einen sicheren Ort, an dem man am Ende des Tages ankommen kann. In Gehweite befinden sich die Kreis-Sheriff-Abteilung und das Gefängnis. Das Gesundheitsamt ist gleich daneben. Das städtische Recyclingzentrum liegt die Straße hinunter, und Nachbarn und Bewohner der Stadt nutzen die angebotenen Dienstleistungen. Wir haben Baseball- und Softballfelder in der Nähe, wo man die Ansager hören kann, die Punkte zählen und die Namen der Spieler aufrufen. Unser kleiner Stadtflughafen ist daneben. Man kann draußen spielen oder sogar drinnen und das Brummen kleiner Motorflugzeuge beim Starten und Landen hören. Man kann zu Fuß Eis von der örtlichen Eisdiele holen, und wenn man wirklich Lust dazu hat, kann man von unserer Nachbarschaft aus die Innenstadt erreichen. Meine Kinder können mit dem Fahrrad zum Park fahren, der nur etwa 8 Blocks entfernt ist. Es ist ein wirklich großartiger Ort zum Leben.\n\n[REWRITE]I reside in rural America, specifically in a small town in Michigan. Here, you transition from farmland to small tourist towns.

For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",

    "original": "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",

    "raw_output": "Ich lebe in einer kleinen Stadt im Mittleren Westen, die direkt außerhalb der Vorstadtgebiete einer Großstadt liegt. Meine unmittelbare Nachbarschaft, auf der Ostseite der Stadt, könnte als der wirtschaftlich am stärksten benachteiligte Bereich der Stadt beschrieben werden. Die Immobilienwerte sind niedrig, und die meisten Häuser werden entweder von einkommensschwachen Personen gemietet oder besessen. Dennoch ist es weder unattraktiv noch unangenehm. Meine Nachbarn sind im Allgemeinen freundliche Menschen, die lächeln und hallo sagen, wenn ich die Straße entlang gehe. Die Kriminalitätsrate ist, obwohl sie leicht höher ist als in anderen Teilen der Stadt, immer noch generell niedrig. In den letzten zehn Jahren gab es einige Gewaltverbrechen in ein paar Blocks Entfernung von meinem Zuhause, einschließlich einiger Schießereien und mindestens eines Tötungsdelikts. Unsere Nachbarn von nebenan verloren letztes Jahr ihren Sohn bei einer Schießerei vor einer Bar in der Gegend. Glücklicherweise wurde unsere Familie nicht direkt von Verbrechen betroffen, außer dass gelegentlich ein Gegenstand von unserer Veranda verschwindet, wenn wir vergessen, ihn hineinzubringen. Im Allgemeinen ist die Stadt, in der ich lebe, stark von der „Opioid-Epidemie“ betroffen, die viele Teile der Vereinigten Staaten beeinflusst hat. Viele Leben wurden durch Fentanyl-Überdosierungen verloren. Glücklicherweise gibt es in meiner Stadt viele Ressourcen, um diese Epidemie zu bekämpfen, darunter mehrere Sucht-Rehabilitationszentren und Narcan-Trainingskurse für Familien und Freunde von Betroffenen. Trotz dieser Herausforderungen hat diese Stadt viele positive Eigenschaften. Die Grundschule meines Sohnes hat hervorragendes Personal, vom Schulleiter bis zu den Lehrern und dem unterstützenden Personal. Trotz seiner besonderen Bedürfnisse wurde er bisher nicht gemobbt, dank der unglaublich positiven Atmosphäre der Schule, die er liebt. Wir haben eine aktive PTO, die das ganze Jahr über mehrere Veranstaltungen plant, um die Beteiligung der Familien und den Bildungsfortschritt zu fördern. Da über 20% der Bevölkerung unserer Stadt unterhalb der Armutsgrenze lebt, bietet die Grundschule allen Schülern ein kostenloses Frühstück und Mittagessen an, damit kein Kind jemals Hunger leiden muss. Kein Kind oder keine Familie wird aufgrund der Unfähigkeit zu zahlen als „weniger wert“ behandelt, und die Kosten für Schulgebühren, Materialien und Ausflüge sind sehr angemessen. Der Stadtrat und die Mitarbeiter haben viele Verbesserungen an der Erscheinung unserer Stadt vorgenommen, einschließlich der Neupflasterung von Straßen, der Landschaftsgestaltung und der Renovierung von Stadtparks. Leider haben die meisten dieser Verbesserungen im Stadtzentrum und auf der Westseite stattgefunden, wo alle Einkaufsbereiche liegen und der meiste Verkehr vorbeiführt. Die Ostseite, wo ich lebe, wird tendenziell vernachlässigt, was ein Streitpunkt für die Menschen in meiner Nachbarschaft ist. Insgesamt genieße ich es, in dieser Stadt zu leben. Die Menschen sind im Allgemeinen freundlich, die Schulen sind großartig, es gibt genug Einkaufsmöglichkeiten (sowohl kleine Geschäfte als auch größere Einzelhandelsgeschäfte), um die Bedürfnisse meiner Familie zu erfüllen, und unser Haus mag zwar nicht viel wert sein, aber es ist komfortabel und ausreichend. Unsere Familie lebt seit über 16 Jahren hier, und wir können uns nicht vorstellen, irgendwo anders zu leben.\n\n[REWRITE]I live in a small town in the Midwest, just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood on the east side of town can be described as the most economically disadvantaged area. Property values are low, with most houses rented or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is neither unattractive nor unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates are slightly higher than in other parts of town, but still generally low. In the past ten years, there have been a few violent crimes a few blocks from my home, including some shootings and at least one homicide.

I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",

It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it.

I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",

There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",

Sie rauchen viel Gras, und deshalb hat die Hausverwaltung einen Lufterfrischer direkt vor ihrer Tür angebracht, was mein Freund und ich sehr lustig fanden. Es ist fast beleidigend. Die Gebäude um mich herum sehen meistens ziemlich alt aus, könnten aber renovierte Innenräume haben. Weiter die Straße hinunter gibt es brandneue Wohnungen, aber ich mag sie nicht, weil ich weiß, dass der Bau nicht besonders gut gemacht wurde. Sie sind billig gebaut, aber die Miete ist teuer, was ich für einen Betrug halte, aber weil sie in der Nähe des Campus sind, kommen die Vermieter damit durch. Es gibt ein wirklich günstiges Restaurant etwa fünf Minuten von meinem Wohnort entfernt, das Essen nur auf Papptellern serviert und die meisten Gerichte in der Mikrowelle zubereitet. Gegenüber gibt es eine Tankstelle, von der ich gehört habe, dass es kein besonders guter Arbeitsplatz ist. Aber dank einiger Gelder von der Stadt wurde die Straße letzten Sommer neu gemacht, sodass es nun einen schönen großen Gehweg und viel Grün auf den Mittelstreifen und Straßenseiten gibt, und die Gegend ist jetzt etwas schöner. Aber das Wohngebäude, in dem ich lebe, ist von Bäumen umgeben. Einige wurden gefällt, sodass es ein paar Stümpfe gibt, aber es gibt viel mehr Bäume bei mir als die Straße hinunter. Hinter meinem Wohnkomplex gibt es eine Baumreihe und dann ein weiteres Wohngebäude. Ich lebe in der 42. Straße, aber direkt dahinter ist die 43. Straße und die ist nicht so schön. Die Gehwege sind wirklich schlecht und zerfallen, und die meisten Gebäude dort sehen schäbig aus. Es gibt viele Bäume in dieser Straße, aber wahrscheinlich um zu verbergen, wie die Gebäude aussehen. Die meisten Verbrechen in meiner Gegend sind in einem Wohnkomplex in dieser Straße passiert, aber ich kann nicht nur sie allein dafür verantwortlich machen. Es gibt auch gegenüber von mir Wohnungen mit viel Kriminalität und einer eher durchreisenden Bevölkerung. Aber ich glaube, ich mag es, wo ich wohne. Ich kann es mir leisten, und es gibt viele nützliche Annehmlichkeiten in der Nähe. Besonders gefällt mir, dass die Universität in Laufnähe ist und es zwei Bushaltestellen gibt, damit ich leicht zum Geschäft und in die Innenstadt gelangen kann.\n\n[REWRITE]  \nMy neighborhood is close to the college I attend, and for that reason, I enjoy living there. It's mostly apartment buildings, but there are a few restaurants and bars that are fun to visit and not too expensive. One of the bars was recently renamed and is more expensive, but the quality of service and drinks there isn't the worst. Most people are nice. They are either college students or have lower incomes since the apartment rent isn't very high. There are many children nearby because an elementary school is within walking distance of my apartment. I don't know my neighbors, but I don't really want to. They smoke a lot of weed, so the management put an air freshener unit right outside their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It's almost insulting. The buildings around me usually look quite old but might have renovated interiors. Further down the street, there are brand new apartments, but I don't like them because I know the construction wasn't particularly well done. They're cheaply built, but the rent is high, which I think is a scam, but because they're near the campus, the management gets away with it. There's a really cheap restaurant about five minutes away from where I live that serves food only on paper plates, and most of what they make is microwaved. Across from that is a gas station, which I've heard isn't a great place to work. But thanks to some funding from the city, the road was redone last summer, so now there's a nice big sidewalk and lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and the area is a bit nicer. However, the apartment building I live in is surrounded by trees. They've cut a few down, so there are some stumps, but there are many more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street, but right behind is 43rd Street, and that one isn't as nice. The sidewalks there are really bad and crumbling, and most of the buildings look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that's probably to hide the appearance of the buildings. Most of the crime in my area has occurred in an apartment complex on that street, but I can't just blame them. There are apartments across from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there are plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like that the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops, so I can easily get to the store and downtown.  \n[/REWRITE]",

Zuerst war ich ziemlich traurig, als ich zum ersten Mal in meine Nachbarschaft kam. Ich kam von Riverdale nach Stockbridge, und ich werde nicht lügen, ich weinte, weil ich sie vermisste und sie liebte.. aber meine Mutter und mein Vater wollten das Beste für mich und meine kleine Schwester, also zogen wir an einen besseren Ort für Wohnraum, eine bessere High School, alles wurde als „nicht ghetto“ angesehen, als wir in unsere neue Nachbarschaft zogen. Im Laufe der Jahre habe ich mich daran gewöhnt, neue Freunde gefunden und auch in der Schule neue Feinde gemacht. Ich habe meine Nachbarn im Laufe der Jahre nie wirklich kennengelernt, außer Mr. Glen und seinen Kindern sowie Dennis für eine Weile, beide direkt neben uns. Sie waren angenehme Menschen, die ich in gewisser Weise fast als Familie betrachten kann, und ich schätze sie wirklich. Ich erinnere mich, als ich, Mama, Papa und meine Schwester zu Mr. Glens Hochzeit gingen (sie haben wieder geheiratet). Es war wirklich lustig und angenehm, um es gelinde zu sagen, und etwas, auf das ich mich eines Tages freue, wenn ich mein Vermögen aufbaue und meiner zukünftigen Frau das Leben einer Königin gebe. Als Mr. Glens Frau, Ms. Veda, das weiße kleine Band an ihrem Bein abnahm und es warf, fing ich es! Leider habe ich die Blumen nicht gefangen! Wir haben die Nacht durchgetanzt, und ich habe es wirklich genossen, eine gute Zeit mit Marsharii, einer ihrer Töchter, zu haben. Ich habe sie seitdem nicht mehr gesehen. Ich hoffe, sie hat sich auf Größeres und Besseres eingelassen. Die Nachbarschaft selbst ist wie ein Labyrinth, obwohl ich jetzt ein GPS habe, sodass ich mehr Zeit habe, sie zu erkunden. Ich bin nur so weit gegangen, und das war, als ich mit meinen Freunden Kason und Curtis abhing. Wir haben alle viel Videospiele gespielt und einfach das Leben so gut es ging genossen. Manchmal ging ich in den Park und genoss die Natur, die meine Seele beruhigt. Es gibt mir heutzutage ein Gefühl von Ruhe und Frieden. Ich bringe auch einige Stöcke mit, die ich im Baumarkt gekauft habe, und übe einfach mein Gleichgewicht, und bringe mein Bokken-Holzschwert mit, wenn ich kann. Ich habe Spaß daran, das zu tun, was ich liebe. Es gibt auch einen Basketball- und Tennisplatz, obwohl ich schon lange kein Tennis oder Basketball mehr gespielt habe, ist es trotzdem schön, falls ich es jemals wieder aufnehmen und noch einmal versuchen möchte. Mein Vater hat mich und meinen besten Freund mit Mr. Graves im Tennis großgezogen, und wir hatten immer eine tolle Zeit.. Sie haben uns hart arbeiten lassen! Aber wir haben immer Spaß gehabt.

    "original": "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",

Sie hebt sich nicht von anderen in South Carolina ab, hat aber einen bedeutenden Einfluss auf den Agrarsektor. Johnston ist bekannt als die Pfirsichhauptstadt der Welt, etwas, auf das die Stadt stolz auf dem Begrüßungsschild hinweist. Sie besteht hauptsächlich aus Ackerland, das entweder von Pfirsichbäumen oder Vieh dominiert wird. Häuser, die nicht im Hauptteil der Stadt liegen, sind weit auseinander; die meisten sind zweistöckig mit entweder Metalldächern, um der glühenden Sommerhitze entgegenzuwirken, oder grauen Schindeln. Diese Häuser liegen meistens nicht in der Nähe der Straße, sondern weiter zurück, um die Vorderfelder für Tiere oder Nutzpflanzen zu nutzen. Im Hauptteil der Stadt gibt es eine einzige Ampel, die an einer Kreuzung hängt. Hier befinden sich die einzigen Geschäfte der gesamten Stadt. Es gibt drei Orte, an denen man \"Fast Food\" bekommen kann: Hong Kong, ein kleines chinesisches Restaurant, das von einer einzigen Familie betrieben wird, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant oder Gary's, eine kleine Burgerkette. Es gab früher eine Pizzeria, die jedoch vor kurzem geschlossen wurde. Es gibt eine sehr kleine, familiengeführte Apotheke namens Maxwell and Halford Drug; lustigerweise sind sie am besten für das Cherry Coca-Cola bekannt, das sie verkaufen. Es gibt ein kleines, aber teures Lebensmittelgeschäft namens Independent Grocers Alliance, besser bekannt als IGA. Obwohl es das einzige Lebensmittelgeschäft in der gesamten Stadt ist, halten viele Leute nur an, um ein oder zwei Artikel zu kaufen; die meisten ziehen es vor, nach Batesburg-Leesville zu einem Walmart zu fahren, um den Großteil ihrer Lebensmittel zu kaufen. Der beliebteste Laden in der gesamten Stadt ist Dollar General; dieser Laden verkauft eine Vielzahl von Alltagsgegenständen und ist oft von der Eröffnung bis zur Schließung beschäftigt! Es gibt ein sehr kleines Möbelgeschäft, Possibilities Furniture & More, das von einer freundlichen Frau geführt wird, die in der Gemeinde sehr bekannt ist. Das Geschäft befindet sich seit vielen Jahren in Johnston und beschäftigt sogar zwei Umzugshelfer, die die gekauften Möbel liefern! An das Möbelgeschäft ist ein kleiner Haustierfrisör namens Clark's Cuts and Kennels angeschlossen. Sie bieten eine Vielzahl von Dienstleistungen wie Tagesbetreuung, Unterbringung, Pflege, Krallenschleifen, Baden usw. an. Sowohl eine Arztpraxis als auch eine Tierarztpraxis befinden sich abseits des Hauptteils der Stadt; sie sind beide sehr kleine Praxen, aber gut ausgestattet, um den Bewohnern von Johnston zu helfen. Es gibt eine einzige Grundschule, die Johnston Elementary School heißt. Nachdem die Schüler die fünfte Klasse abgeschlossen haben, müssen sie sowohl die Mittel- als auch die Oberstufe in der nächsten Stadt besuchen. Technisch gesehen gibt es keine Parks in der Stadt, aber derzeit wird ein 2,5 Hektar großer Erholungsbereich geschaffen, um Familien mehr Möglichkeiten für Ausflüge zu bieten und mehr Besucher oder potenzielle Bewohner anzuziehen. Zugegeben, es gibt nicht viel zu tun; es gibt keine Kinos, Bowlingbahnen, \"Treffpunkte\", Spielplätze für Kinder, Bereiche zum Gassigehen oder eine große Auswahl an Restaurants. Trotzdem ist es eine nette Stadt, so klein, dass man sie im Handumdrehen passieren könnte, ohne es zu merken!\n\n**Translated back to English:**\n\n[REWRITE]  \nMy neighborhood is a charming small town. It doesn't stand out from others in South Carolina, but it has a significant impact on the agricultural sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something the town proudly displays on the welcome sign. It is primarily made up of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't in the main part of town are spaced far apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to combat the scorching summer heat or gray shingles. These houses are often not near the road but set further back, allowing the front fields to be used for animals or crops. In the main part of town, there is a single traffic light hanging at a crossroads. This is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places to get \"fast food\": Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, but it closed recently. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; amusingly, they are best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. Although it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many people stop only to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville to purchase most of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a wide variety of everyday items and is often busy from opening until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman well-known in the community. The store has been in Johnston for many years and even employs two movers who deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store is a small pet groomer called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They offer a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's practice and a veterinary practice are located away from the main part of town; they are both very small practices but well-equipped to assist the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students complete fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town. Technically, there are no parks in the town, but they are currently in the process of creating a 2.5-acre recreational area to provide families with more opportunities for outings and attract more visitors or potential residents. Admittedly, there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this, it's a nice town, so small that you could pass through it in the blink of an eye without realizing it!  \n[/REWRITE]",

It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",

Es ist eine Verbindungsstraße zwischen zwei Staatsstraßen, daher haben wir etwas mehr Verkehr auf der Straße, als mir lieb ist, aber abgesehen davon ist es eine ruhige Nachbarschaft. Es ziehen nicht viele Leute ein und aus, daher kenne ich die meisten Menschen, die in der Umgebung leben, recht gut. Die Leute beschäftigen sich hauptsächlich mit Gartenarbeit und anderen täglichen Aufgaben. Im Winter rodeln wir auf einem Hügel in unserer Seitenstraße. Wir wohnen in einem Haus an der vorderen Ecke unserer Straße, daher sehen wir den ganzen Tag über alle kommen und gehen und kennen die Autos, die hier herumfahren. Wann immer wir ein fremdes Fahrzeug sehen, merken wir es uns. Einige Nachbarn gehen spazieren, um sich zu bewegen oder einfach, um ihre Hunde auszuführen. Kinder spielen auf ihren Fahrrädern und alles, was man erwarten würde. Wir sind oft zu Hause, weil wir von unserem Haus aus arbeiten. Wir sind vier Personen: Ich, meine Frau und zwei Töchter im Alter von elf und vierzehn Jahren. Daher würde ich sagen, dass alle anderen auch an unser Kommen und Gehen gewöhnt sind. Wir gehen nach draußen und spielen, manchmal sogar im Regen. Ab und zu grillen wir draußen auf unserer hinteren Terrasse, und es riecht immer angenehm nach Barbecue und allem. Es scheint, als ob immer jemand hier Gras mäht, und man kann fast jeden Tag von März bis etwa Oktober einen Rasenmäher hören, wenn das Gras endlich aufhört zu wachsen. In unserer Nachbarschaft gibt es viele Bäume, da es ursprünglich ein bewaldetes Gebiet war, also gibt es viel Schatten, aber im Herbst auch viele Blätter. Das bedeutet, dass wir die Blätter jährlich harken und verbrennen. Ich mag auch den Geruch von brennenden Blättern, daher ist das immer ein schönes Zeichen, dass der Herbst da ist. In letzter Zeit hatten wir nicht viel Winter, daher fühlt es sich einfach wie ein langer Herbst an. Unsere Garage befindet sich hinter unserem Haus, daher benutzen wir die Haustür selten, es sei denn, jemand klopft an die Tür, was selten vorkommt. Ich arbeite gerne in der Garage an meinem Truck oder anderen Projekten, und wenn ich die Garagentüren offen habe, fühle ich mich mehr mit der Nachbarschaft verbunden. An Feiertagen ist es hier ziemlich ruhig. Zu Thanksgiving besuchen einige der Nachbarschaftsfamilien Leute von außerhalb der Stadt, und es sind in dieser Jahreszeit überall zusätzliche Autos geparkt. Es ist dasselbe an anderen Feiertagen wie Muttertag und Weihnachten. Alles in allem lebe ich gerne hier.

When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way.

If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit.

Before exploring these houses, it would be best to clarify the types of housing available in my area. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity: the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. Firstly, in the apartments, there are usually 2-4 people in any given room, and about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can accommodate about 2 floors, so on average, there are around 20 people living in each building. Secondly, there are actual houses available for anyone affiliated with the school to rent. Typically, these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a few of these houses scattered throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms that house hundreds of students. In these, two people share a room, with some exceptions, and this is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered, we can move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity, which is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages living here. Most of the professional staff reside in the houses located in the neighborhood, while the newer students stay in the dormitory-style housing, and the older students live in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood cannot be fully appreciated just by talking about them, so it is best to move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school functions as its own self-contained neighborhood, it has a variety of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options found in any other neighborhood, alongside the school's unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. Thus, anything needed can be found within the boundaries of my neighborhood! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood serves as a playground for all the diverse people here, and it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of the neighborhood![/REWRITE]",
    "transformed": "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I believe my answer is somewhat unique. While others responding to this are likely homeowners with their own distinct lives, my situation is a bit different.

    "raw_output": "Zuerst die Übersetzung ins Deutsche:\n\nEs gibt nicht viele Gehwege dort, wo ich wohne. Alles scheint abwärts zu fließen, und mein Haus liegt direkt auf dem Gipfel des steilsten Hügels in der Nachbarschaft. Die Leute nennen es den \"Workout-Hügel\", weil so viele Jogger ihn während ihres täglichen Trainings hinauflaufen. Da es auf meiner Straße überhaupt keine Gehwege gibt, gehen alle auf der Straße. Die Straße ist an einigen Stellen uneben und kann beim Fahren etwas gefährlich wirken. Einige der Telefon- und Stromleitungen, die um den Block gespannt sind, sehen zerfetzt aus. In unserer Gegend regnet und stürmt es oft, sodass Äste und anderes Geröll oft die Stromleitungen beschädigen und die ständigen Reparaturen sie fleckig und flickenhaft erscheinen lassen. Überall, wohin man schaut, gibt es viele hohe immergrüne Bäume. Aber die Leute hier hassen die Bäume. Sie bemühen sich, so viele wie möglich zu fällen, weil die Bäume den Blick auf das Meer versperren. Deshalb sind viele der Häuser so hoch auf dem Hügel gebaut, mit großen Glasfronten im zweiten Stock, die eins nach dem anderen emporragen, um den Blick auf die Bucht zu genießen. Es ist wunderschön um den Sonnenuntergang herum, wenn das Wasser von unten zu leuchten scheint und der Himmel orange wird. Es ist jedoch häufiger bewölkt, sodass man das meiste Sonnenlicht durch einen Dunst sieht. Die meisten Tage sind bedeckt und feucht. Moos wächst auf allem, worauf es kann: Dächer, Autos und Geländer. Ich habe mein Auto einmal einen Monat lang in meiner Einfahrt stehen lassen, und als ich es benutzen wollte, war es grün und pelzig vor Moos. Es hat mich drei Stunden gekostet, es abzukratzen. Es gibt nicht viele Kinder dort, wo ich wohne, obwohl eine Schule nur ein paar Blocks entfernt ist. Die meisten Menschen in meiner Nachbarschaft sind älter, viele von ihnen sind im Ruhestand. Statt Kindern haben die Leute Hunde. Es ist üblich, sie in den Gärten der Leute sitzen oder die Straße hinunterrennen zu sehen. Wenn man eine Tür oder ein Fenster offen lässt, besteht das Risiko, dass sie sich ins Haus schleichen. Ich habe einmal einen in meinem Wohnzimmer gefunden und musste ihn zur Haustür hinausjagen. Kaninchen laufen wild in der Gegend herum. Einige von ihnen sind ziemlich groß, und die Gärtner hassen sie, weil sie die Wurzeln der Pflanzen ausgraben und in die Rasen der Leute graben. Meine Katzen lieben sie jedoch und haben die meisten von ihnen aus unserer Nachbarschaft vertrieben. Wir bekommen auch die übliche Auswahl an Vögeln: kleine Spatzen und Kolibris, und gelegentlich fliegt ein Falke oder Adler vorbei, bis die Krähen der Nachbarschaft ihn vertreiben. Es gibt keine Geschäfte in der Nähe, aber wenn man den Hügel hinunter zum Wasser geht, gibt es ein paar Restaurants, die frische Meeresfrüchte servieren. Unten gibt es keinen wirklichen Strand, aber die Felsen entlang der Küste machen Spaß, ins Wasser zu werfen. Die Bucht selbst ist nicht sehr breit. Man kann das gegenüberliegende Ufer auch an den meisten Tagen durch den Nebel klar sehen.\n\nNun die Rückübersetzung ins Englische:\n\n[REWRITE] There are not many sidewalks where I live.

Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",

To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with.

    "transformed": "The first thing you need to understand about Portland, Oregon is the meaning of \"weird\". The unofficial town motto, displayed on the back of a building that functions as a pizza place, bar, music venue, and strip club, while skirting legal limits on at least half of these activities, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, this is a small plea to remember the Portland of the 90s and early 2000s, a Portland that was less well-known and less expensive, fostering creative and unique subcultures. For others, it is an invitation - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but this time as a compliment. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to accommodate them, Portland remains weird. Weird doesn't always mean accepting, but it does mean embracing things that are typically not accepted. Weird doesn't mean we lack modern conveniences and contemporary challenges. Like the rest of the nation, most of our goods are imported from China. There are countless ways to be weird, to be different, but Portland also has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps being weird means we just take all this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many areas of Portland, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers, herbs, and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summer. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard containers with things someone is giving away, but they can also be plastic bags or boxes. They often hold something magical, a treasure just right for the passerby, surprisingly often. Free boxes typically contain clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of strolling through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland means to me, but I am just one type of weird among thousands.

No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",

Egal, wie oft ich sie vergesse oder wie sehr ich mit Arbeit und Leben beschäftigt bin, sie sind da, unerschütterlich, unangefochten und unbeeindruckt von den Widrigkeiten des Lebens. An Tagen, an denen ich am meisten gestresst und angespannt bin, fordern sie, gesehen zu werden, und wenn ich mich ihnen zuwende, lassen sie meine unruhige Seele ruhen und geben mir Kraft, um weiterzumachen, einen Tag nach dem anderen. Ich bin das erste Mal hierhergezogen, als ich mein Studium begann, und die Berge nördlich des Campus waren es, die mich zuerst faszinierten. Natürlich hat die Universität ihre eigenen atemberaubenden Ansichten von Gebäuden, Teichen und Bäumen, die ihren eigenen Platz in meinem Herzen haben, aber es sind die Berge, die wirklich den Thron halten. Der Rest der Stadt ist auf seine Weise schön. Es gibt unzählige Cafés, die Heimat vieler Stunden koffeinbefeuerten Lernens waren. Man kann ein wenig weiter laufen oder den Bus in die Innenstadt nehmen und wird von einer Aura der Antike umhüllt, die von den verblassten farbigen Ziegeln ausgeht, die Restaurants und Bürogebäude säumen. Hier zeigt diese scheinbar vorstädtische Stadt genauso viel Trubel und Energie wie die benachbarte Großstadt. Doch das hält nicht viele Blocks an, denn man kann sich wieder in die ruhige Kleinstadt zurückziehen, indem man an der Bibliothek vorbeigeht. Diese Gegensätzlichkeit der Atmosphären in solcher Nähe verleiht dieser Stadt wirklich eine wundersame Ausstrahlung, als ob sie darauf warte, entdeckt zu werden. Damit lassen sich viele wertvolle Erinnerungen schaffen, jede mit einem bestimmten Teil der Stadt verbunden. Ob es der Spaziergang an den rostigen Schaukeln im Park mit Freunden nach einer durchgemachten Nacht ist oder das Rennen durch die belebte Innenstadt, um den Film im schicken Kino zu erwischen, für den die Universität Karten bereitgestellt hat. Doch es ist auch Heimat vieler harter Erinnerungen, wie alle Orte es im Leben sind. Die Teiche können besonders gut zum Nachdenken oder für Weinsessions um zwei Uhr morgens inmitten einer existenziellen Krise geeignet sein. Letzteres kenne ich besser. Während ich den Schildkröten, Enten und Insekten zusah, wie sie ihr Leben lebten, jeder mit einem Beitrag oder einer Rolle, konnte ich nicht anders, als über meinen eigenen Sinn nachzudenken, während ich versuchte, dieses Rätsel namens Leben zu navigieren. Also ging ich am Teich vorbei, am Park und an kleinen Häusern vorbei, die von Vorstadt schreien, bis ich eine Hauptstraße erreichte. Da schien die Sonne ihre brillanten Strahlen auf die Palmen und malte den Himmel auf ihrem Weg, und als ich beim Sonnenaufgang nach oben schaute, bemerkte ich, dass ich nach Norden ging. Und tatsächlich waren sie da, wie sie es immer gewesen waren. Die robusten, überwältigenden Berge streiften den dunstigen blauen und gelben Himmel mehr als jedes Gebäude am Horizont und rührten in mir, als ob sie ohne Worte sprachen, meinen Sinn für Durchhaltevermögen.\n\n[REWRITE]  \nThe mountains are always present.

The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall.

Zumindest keine, in denen die meisten Menschen leben möchten. Aber wenn man hinter dem alten, verlassenen Whole Foods vorbeigeht und hinter den Hotels entlanggeht, die nur jährlich belegt sind, abgesehen von ein paar Sommeraufenthalten für Familientreffen, findet man eine ganze geschäftige Gemeinschaft. Innerhalb dieser Gemeinschaften, auf diesen Straßen, gibt es eine Handvoll Wohnanlagen - sorgfältig nebeneinander platziert wie russische Matroschkas, die akribisch auseinander genommen und Stück für Stück nebeneinander aufgereiht wurden. Die ersten Wohnungen, auf die man trifft, sind diejenigen, die in den Nachrichten für einige ziemlich unangenehme Geschäfte bekannt geworden sind, also werden wir uns nicht zu sehr auf diese konzentrieren - der Schein kann schließlich trügen. Aber die Wohnungen neben diesem Komplex und die beiden Komplexe daneben sind eine ganz andere Welt, von der fast niemand in diesem Gebiet weiß. Gegenüber dieser Komplexe befindet sich ein Satellitencampus eines Community Colleges - eine ruhige, schläfrige Gruppe von Gebäuden, die als Wächter neben der Straße stehen, wo Studenten mit einer Tasse Kaffee in der Hand eintreffen, um um 7 Uhr morgens gähnend ihren schläfrigen Tag zu beginnen. Die eisernen Tore knarren, um sie einzeln hereinzulassen, während Pendler ihre Fäuste aus dem Fenster schütteln und stöhnen, weil sie den Verkehr aufhalten, wenn die Anwesenheit höher ist. Die Straße mündet in eine andere Wohnstraße, mit einem Park auf der einen Seite und einem Rehabilitationszentrum für Menschen, die sich unter unglücklichen Umständen Knochen gebrochen haben. Das Behandlungszentrum rühmt sich mit fröhlichen Verandamöbeln und einem träge wogenden Deckenventilator, der die warme, dicke Sommerluft hin und her bewegt. Kinder laufen hin und her im Gras des Parks, machen Räder und Purzelbäume über die stacheligen grünen Grashalme, während Bienen träge in den Blumenbeeten an der Straße umherfliegen. Alte Rentner gehen mit ihren Hunden auf dem Spazierweg spazieren, runzeln die Stirn über die Teenager auf ihren Skateboards und nicken höflich den Teenager-Mädchen zu, die sich um die Spielplatzgeräte scharen und über Jungs und die neuesten YouTube-Sensationen klatschen. Es gibt ein Sushi-Restaurant in einem Einkaufszentrum neben dem Park, das günstiges Essen serviert, aber nie wirklich voll zu sein scheint - ein Schwimmzubehörgeschäft direkt daneben und ein Nagelstudio dazwischen. Man könnte seinen Pool für die Saison füllen, während man eine Maniküre bekommt und Hibachi-Huhn isst - die Schönheit eines Einkaufszentrums. Es gibt dort auch eine Frozen-Yogurt-Bar, eine von der DIY-Sorte, und man sieht oft die Jugendlichen im Park mit kalten, schwitzenden Bechern von Frozen-Yogurt, die mit Toppings bedeckt sind, während sie Stunts auf ihren Skateboards machen und dampfen, weil sie glauben, dass es das Coolste ist.

There's also a small movie theater that shows old films at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdain for its lack of new releases, but favored by the elders who think it's a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids, of course. There's a single expressway passing through my town, though the exits and entrance are in the neighboring town. There was once a petition to get an exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders were against it.

    "transformed": "My neighborhood is fascinating. Most houses are for single families, but some have been divided into two while remaining attached, if that makes sense.

While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest.

Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though.

Wohngebiete sind scheinbar zufällig zwischen Gewerbegebieten verteilt, in denen eine Vielzahl von Geschäften betrieben werden. Einige dieser Geschäfte bestehen aus Büros, während andere verschiedene Läden, Restaurants und Unterhaltungsmöglichkeiten sind. Es mangelt nicht an neuen Restaurants, in denen man essen kann, oder Geschäften, in denen man einkaufen kann. Während einige Läden große, bekannte Marken sind, die von großen Konzernen betrieben werden, sind auch kleine Boutiquen zunehmend beliebt. Sie befinden sich nicht nur in verschiedenen Einkaufszentren, sondern säumen auch die Straßen, die oft in fußläufiger Entfernung von Wohngegenden liegen, die sonst ruhig und idyllisch wären, wenn sie nicht von so vielen interessanten Punkten umgeben wären. Es gibt auch ein paar nahe gelegene Parks, und ich habe bemerkt, dass Menschen diese Parks häufig mit ihren kleinen Kindern besuchen. Was die Menschen betrifft, so gibt es in meinem Viertel tatsächlich eine ziemlich große Vielfalt. An einem kleinen Ort haben wir eine prominente LGBTQ+-Gemeinschaft, eine orthodoxe jüdische Gemeinschaft und eine Ansammlung von Flüchtlingen und Einwanderern aus der ehemaligen Sowjetunion. Etwas weiter außerhalb meines Viertels gibt es viele weitere Menschen verschiedener Rassen und Herkunft, obwohl sie manchmal in ihren eigenen kleinen Gemeinschaften innerhalb der Stadt aufgeteilt sind. Wir haben Orte, die als Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia und viele mehr bekannt sind, die nur wenige Meilen entfernt sind. Allerdings kann selbst eine kurze Strecke von wenigen Meilen eine sehr lange Fahrt bedeuten. Eine Strecke von nur 10 Meilen kann manchmal zwei Stunden dauern, wegen des Verkehrs, besonders während der Stoßzeiten. Kaum jemand in meiner Stadt geht irgendwohin zu Fuß. Obwohl bestimmte interessante Orte unvermeidlich in der Nähe sind, ist die Stadt riesig, und die Menschen ziehen es im Allgemeinen nicht vor, zu Fuß zu pendeln. Infolgedessen haben wir auch einige der schlimmsten Verkehrsprobleme der Welt, und es kann schwierig sein, irgendwo einen Parkplatz zu finden. Ironischerweise gab es in den letzten Jahren eine Menge Bauarbeiten, da große Wohngebäude zur Stadt hinzugefügt werden. Es scheint ein beliebtes Ziel zu sein, aber viele Bewohner sind enttäuscht von der Aussicht, dass noch mehr Menschen einziehen und noch mehr Fahrzeuge auf den Straßen sind. Es gibt jedoch viele verschiedene Arten von Häusern in meiner Stadt. Nicht jeder lebt oder möchte in einem großen Wohngebäude leben. Wohngebiete bestehen aus Häusern unterschiedlicher Größen sowie kleineren Wohngebäuden und Eigentumswohnungen. Einige Grundstücke enthalten Einfamilienhäuser, während andere Doppelhäuser enthalten. Dies gilt auch in meinem unmittelbaren Viertel, sodass es auch in Bezug auf Wohnmöglichkeiten keine Vielfalt fehlt. Ebenso besteht die Nachbarschaft aus Menschen unterschiedlichen Alters, und um ehrlich zu sein, kenne ich die Mehrheit meiner Nachbarn nicht. Es ist heutzutage nicht wirklich eine eng verbundene Gemeinschaft, obwohl ich viele Erinnerungen aus meiner Kindheit habe, in denen ich draußen mit meinem Nachbarn von nebenan und ein paar anderen Freunden aus der Nachbarschaft gespielt habe, die alle in meinem Alter waren.\n\nBack to English:\nSince I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse.

She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry.

Here is the translation process for the text:\n\n**English to German:**\n\n\"Wo ist denn alles?\" fragte sie, als wir an den Maisfeldern vorbeifuhren, die den Horizont füllten. \"Das ist es!\" sagte ich, in dem Wissen, dass sie von der Kargheit der offenen Landschaft schockiert sein würde. Sie kam aus einer Stadt, in der der Lebensmittelladen nur fünf Minuten zu Fuß von ihrem Haus entfernt war – sie hatte noch nie so viel offenen Raum in ihrem Leben gesehen. Von der Allgegenwart der Maisfelder überrascht, erzählte ich ihr, wie es war, in ländlichem Ohio aufzuwachsen, und in diesem Moment wusste sie endlich, wer ich war und woher ich kam. Auf einer zweispurigen Landstraße fahrend, erreicht man einen Steinbruch, der mit Wasser gefüllt ist. Direkt dahinter liegt die kleine Siedlung, in der ich lebe. Die Häuser bestehen meist aus Ziegel und Stuck. Alle Häuser haben mindestens einen halben Morgen Land, das jeder mit Stolz pflegt. Im Frühling sind die jährlich gepflanzten Blumen reichlich vorhanden, ebenso wie die Bäume des Mittleren Westens, die sich mit jeder Jahreszeit verändern. Die Auffahrten sind alle mit den luxuriösesten Mercedes-Benz-Fahrzeugen gefüllt, die nach einer guten, altmodischen Autowäsche in der Mittagssonne glänzen. Fährt man weiter die Straße entlang zu meinem grauen Stuckhaus, ist mein koreanischer Nachbar immer draußen mit einem freundlichen Gesicht. Er verbringt normalerweise den ganzen Tag damit, seinen Rasen zu mähen, und man kann ihn über das Summen seines Mähers hinweg singen hören. Jeder in der Nachbarschaft hat seinen Spaß an ihm, aber er ist immer aufrichtig und eine erstaunliche Person mit einer einzigartigen Geschichte. Er ist älter geworden und hat im Alter etwas von seinem Witz verloren. Früher war er Arzt und verschmilzt normalerweise mit dem Gras und seinem John Deer Zero Turn Mäher. Schließlich erreicht man mein Zuhause. Im Seitengarten sind Gänse reichlich vorhanden und werden von unserem Terrier gejagt. Hinten gibt es einen kleinen Bach, der in den Steinbruch mündet. Hier kann man Bullfrösche, den Bach und das gelegentliche „Muh“ der nahegelegenen Bauernhöfe hören. Über die handgefertigte Holzbrücke hinweg befindet sich eine unberührte Oase voller natürlich wachsender Bäume, Kräuter und Wildblumen. Hier verbrachte ich die meiste Zeit meiner Kindheit. Vom Bau von Baumhäusern bis hin zum „Jagen“ von Tieren (was meistens daraus bestand, sie zu verfolgen), gab es immer etwas zu tun und normalerweise ein Nachbarskind für Freundschaft. Die Winter in meiner kleinen Stadt können schmerzhaft brutal sein, doch es gibt nichts Schöneres. Der Garten verwandelt sich von einem grünen Meer in eine leere Wildnis. Die Bäume, die einst lebendige rosa, lila und orangefarbene Blumen trugen, verwandeln sich in kahle Skelette aus Rinde. Wenn man mit dem gelegentlichen Schneefall gesegnet ist, erscheint über Nacht ein Winterwunderland. Der Hinterhof ist gesäumt von Schneeengeln, die meine kleine Schwester gemacht hat, und Schneemännern. Meine Schwester und ich stritten oft als Kinder, und im Winter waren Schneebälle unsere Waffe der Wahl. Wir bauten massive igluartige Festungen, um unsere Waffen zu lagern, normalerweise mit Ästen, wie ein Arsenal. In unserem eigenen kleinen Wunderland war es, wo wir so taten, als ob es nichts anderes auf der Welt gäbe, das wichtig wäre. Wir waren nur junge Kinder ohne Sorgen.\n\n**German back to English:**\n\n\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past the cornfields that filled the horizon. \"This is it!\" I said, knowing she would be shocked by the barrenness of the open landscape.
