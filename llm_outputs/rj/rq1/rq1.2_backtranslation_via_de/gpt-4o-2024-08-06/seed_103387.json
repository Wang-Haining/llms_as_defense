    "original": "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",

Es gibt keine großen Einkaufszentren, kein Wal-Mart, Target oder sogar ein Applebee's. Wohin man auch muss, man muss fahren, um dorthin zu gelangen. Trotzdem lebe ich an einem der schönsten Orte der Welt, umgeben von Wasser. Meine \"Stadt\" ist von Wasser umgeben. Auf der einen Seite liegt der wunderschöne Lake Michigan und auf der anderen Seite der Lake Charlevoix. Überall, wo man hingeht, findet man einen Strand, um die Zehen ins Wasser zu tauchen. Meine Nachbarschaft spiegelt die Idee einer Kleinstadt wider. Die Häuser sind nicht dicht aneinander gebaut. Sie sind keine identischen Häuser, sondern ältere, von denen einige renoviert und umgebaut werden, während andere älter bleiben. Die meisten Häuser haben Keller. Vollständige Keller, die man von der Straße aus sehen kann. Viele Häuser in der Nachbarschaft haben ältere Aluminiumverkleidungen. In den Straßen, die mein Haus umgeben, gibt es Häuser in jeder erdenklichen Farbe. Die meisten Häuser haben Gärten. Gärten mit Trampolinen und Spielgeräten. Einige Leute haben Gärten und Zäune für ihre Tiere. Die Häuser erinnern an das mittlere Amerika. Hart arbeitende Menschen, die ihren Lebensunterhalt verdienen und entweder Familien großziehen oder großgezogen haben. An jedem Tag sieht man Kinder die Straßen auf und ab rennen. Man sieht auch Menschen, die Hunde ausführen, Rad fahren und Inlineskaten. Nachbarn kennen Nachbarn und man erkennt, wer dazugehört und wer nicht. Man sieht jemanden draußen grillen und winkt, oder jemanden, der seinen Hund ein paar Straßen weiter spazieren führt und freundlich lächelt. Die Rasenflächen sind in einem ordentlichen Zustand gehalten. Niemand hat Blätter vom Herbst aufgetürmt. Grünes Gras wird gemäht und kontrolliert. Wenn Leute Pflanzen und Büsche in ihren Gärten haben, sind diese gestutzt. Es ist keine wunderschöne Nachbarschaft, in die man hineinfährt und denkt, wow, schau dir die schönen Häuser an, sondern eine, in die man hineinfährt und denkt, hier wäre ein guter Ort, um eine Familie großzuziehen. Es ist ruhig, friedlich und sicher. Auch wenn es nur durchschnittlich aussieht, ist es außergewöhnlich, weil es das repräsentiert, was Menschen sich in der Welt wünschen: einen sicheren Ort, um am Ende des Tages anzukommen. In Laufnähe befinden sich die Bezirks-Sheriff-Behörde und das Gefängnis. Das Gesundheitsamt ist direkt daneben. Das städtische Recyclingzentrum liegt gleich die Straße runter, und Nachbarn und Bewohner aus der Umgebung nutzen die angebotenen Dienstleistungen. Wir haben Baseball- und Softballfelder in der Nähe, wo man die Ansager hören kann, die Punkte zählen und die Namen der Spieler aufrufen. Unser kleiner Stadtflughafen ist gleich daneben. Man kann draußen oder sogar drinnen spielen und hört das Grollen der kleinen Motorflugzeuge, die starten und landen. Man kann zu Fuß zur örtlichen Eisdiele gehen, und wenn man wirklich Lust hat, kann man es von unserer Nachbarschaft bis in die Innenstadt schaffen. Meine Kinder können mit ihren Fahrrädern zum Park fahren, der nur etwa 8 Blocks entfernt ist. Es ist wirklich ein großartiger Ort zum Leben.\n\n[REWRITE]I live in rural America, specifically in a small town in Michigan. Here, you transition from farmland to small tourist towns.

For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",

    "original": "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses.

The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through.

    "raw_output": "I translate the text to German and then back to English for you:\n\nGerman Translation:\nIch lebe in einer kleinen Stadt im Mittleren Westen, die direkt außerhalb der Vororte einer Großstadt liegt. Meine unmittelbare Nachbarschaft, auf der Ostseite der Stadt, könnte als das wirtschaftlich am stärksten benachteiligte Gebiet der Stadt beschrieben werden. Die Immobilienwerte sind niedrig, und die meisten Häuser werden an einkommensschwache Personen vermietet oder von ihnen gekauft. Dennoch ist es weder unattraktiv noch unangenehm. Meine Nachbarn sind im Allgemeinen freundliche Menschen, die lächeln und Hallo sagen, wenn ich die Straße entlang gehe. Die Kriminalitätsraten sind, obwohl sie etwas höher sind als in anderen Teilen der Stadt, immer noch allgemein niedrig. In den letzten zehn Jahren gab es einige Gewaltverbrechen in ein paar Blocks Entfernung von meinem Zuhause, darunter einige Schießereien und mindestens einen Mord. Unsere Nachbarn nebenan verloren ihren Sohn letztes Jahr bei einer Schießerei vor einer Bar in der Gegend. Zum Glück wurde unsere Familie nicht direkt von Kriminalität betroffen, abgesehen davon, dass gelegentlich ein Gegenstand von unserer Veranda verschwindet, wenn wir vergessen, ihn hineinzubringen. Im Allgemeinen wurde die Stadt, in der ich lebe, stark von der „Opioid-Epidemie“ betroffen, die viele Teile der Vereinigten Staaten beeinflusst hat. Viele Leben wurden durch Fentanyl-Überdosierungen verloren. Glücklicherweise gibt es in meiner Stadt viele Ressourcen, um dieser Epidemie entgegenzuwirken, darunter mehrere Sucht-Rehabilitationszentren und Narcan-Schulungen für die Familien und Freunde der von Sucht Betroffenen. Trotz dieser Herausforderungen hat diese Stadt viele positive Eigenschaften. Die Grundschule meines Sohnes hat hervorragendes Personal, vom Schulleiter bis zu den Lehrern und dem unterstützenden Personal. Trotz seiner besonderen Bedürfnisse wurde er bisher nicht gemobbt, dank der unglaublich positiven Atmosphäre der Schule, und er liebt es dort. Wir haben einen aktiven Eltern-Lehrer-Verein, der das ganze Jahr über mehrere Veranstaltungen plant, um die Beteiligung der Familien und den Bildungserfolg zu fördern. Da über 20 % der Bevölkerung unserer Stadt unterhalb der Armutsgrenze leben, bietet die Grundschule allen Schülern ein kostenloses Frühstück und Mittagessen an, damit kein Kind jemals hungern muss. Kein Kind oder keine Familie wird aufgrund der Unfähigkeit zu zahlen als „weniger wert“ behandelt, und die Kosten für Schulgebühren, Materialien und Ausflüge sind sehr angemessen. Der Stadtrat und die Mitarbeiter haben viele Verbesserungen am Erscheinungsbild unserer Stadt vorgenommen, darunter die Neupflasterung von Straßen, die Landschaftsgestaltung und die Renovierung von Stadtparks. Leider haben die meisten dieser Verbesserungen im Zentrum der Stadt und auf der Westseite stattgefunden, wo sich alle Einkaufsgebiete befinden und der meiste Verkehr durchgeht. Die Ostseite, auf der ich lebe, wird oft vernachlässigt, was für die Menschen in meiner Nachbarschaft ein Streitpunkt ist. Insgesamt genieße ich es, in dieser Stadt zu leben. Die Menschen sind im Allgemeinen freundlich, die Schulen sind großartig, es gibt genug Einkaufsmöglichkeiten (sowohl kleine Geschäfte als auch größere Einzelhandelsgeschäfte), um den Bedürfnissen meiner Familie gerecht zu werden, und unser Zuhause mag nicht viel wert sein, aber es ist komfortabel und angemessen. Unsere Familie lebt seit über 16 Jahren hier, und wir können uns nicht vorstellen, woanders zu leben.\n\nBack to English Translation:\nI live in a small Midwestern town just outside the suburbs of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented or owned by low-income individuals. Nevertheless, it is neither unattractive nor unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, although slightly higher than in other parts of town, are still generally low. In the past ten years, there have been some violent crimes a few blocks from my home, including some shootings and at least one homicide. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime, apart from occasionally having an item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town I live in has been profoundly affected by the \"opioid epidemic\" that has impacted many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses.

I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",

Es liegt auf einem Hügel, umgeben von Gebäuden mit historischer Bedeutung. Ich wohne in einem siebengeschossigen Wohnhaus direkt gegenüber dem alten Live-Theater, und einen Block den Hügel hinunter gibt es eine coole kleine Arcade-Bar, zu der in warmen Sommernächten Menschen unterschiedlichster Art strömen. Oft sieht man, besonders an den Wochenenden im Juni und Juli, eine Schlange von Menschen, die darauf warten, hineinzukommen. Ein paar Blocks weiter oben ist der nächste Stadtpark. Er ist ziemlich groß, wenn man bedenkt, in welchem Teil der Stadt er liegt. Der Park ist von Beton umgeben, mit hohen Treppen, die in die Wand gegossen sind. Während der eisigen Wintermonate stellen Obdachlose ihre Zelte in ordentlichen Reihen entlang des Bürgersteigs und der breiten Stufen auf. Es schneit nicht viel, aber es regnet, und der sintflutartige Regen in den Wintermonaten macht es oft schwer, warm zu bleiben. Wenn sie ihre Zelte eng beieinander im Stadtzentrum statt draußen im Dschungel aufstellen, bleiben sie viel wärmer. Sie sind auch in angemessener Geh- und Transitdistanz zum einzigen Familienzentrum in Meilenweite, wo sie sich waschen und duschen können. Was ich an meiner Stadt liebe, ist jedoch nicht die Schönheit der historischen Natur - die hohen stolzen Gebäude, die Architektur, die sich durch die verschiedenen Ebenen der Hügel zieht, die zum Ozean hinabrollen. Was ich an meinem Viertel liebe, ist die Kultur der Menschen selbst. Wissen Sie, Hilltop war einst das berüchtigtste Viertel an der Westküste für Bandenkriminalität. Man hört immer noch Geschichten, selbst drei Jahrzehnte später, über die Bundesbeamten und die DEA, die wie ein Besen durchkehrten und versuchten, die Straßen zu säubern. Die Menschen vergessen nicht. Geschichten werden immer noch von Generation zu Generation weitergegeben, auch an Zugezogene wie mich, aus jenen Tagen. Die Menschen arbeiten hart, obwohl es immer noch als eines der härteren Viertel der ganzen Stadt gilt, um es sauber zu halten. Sie kümmern sich immer noch darum, was in ihrer Stadt, auf ihrem Block passiert. Man sagt, wenn man weiß ist, sollte man nach Einbruch der Dunkelheit nicht um den Hügel herumlaufen. Ich glaube wirklich, dass diese Warnung an die alten Zeiten erinnert und mit dem bitteren Geschmack der sozialen Konditionierung gefärbt ist. Vielleicht bin ich nur dunkel genug, um nicht ganz als \"weiße Mädchen\" durchzugehen, oder vielleicht erkennt Hilltop mich als eine der ihren, jemand, der ebenso schmerzlich an die ständigen Erinnerungen erinnert ist, die unsere Nation plagen. Erinnerungen daran, dass Rassismus, kulturelle Konditionierung und Annahmen aus Unwissenheit und Angst gemacht werden, selbst in einer Stadt, die eine kulturelle Schmelztiegel-Utopie sein soll. Ich weiß eines: Egal wie weit ich reise, Hilltop ist mein Zuhause. Ich fühle mich lebendig, wenn ich nachts durch diese Straßen gehe und Menschen treffe, die mir eher und selten böswillig eine Jacke angeboten haben, als mich auszurauben. Es ist ein Ort, an dem Wäschereibesitzer nur ein paar Minuten länger offen geblieben sind, damit ich mein Handy aufladen konnte, als ich keinen Ort hatte, um dem Regen zu entkommen. Es ist ein Ort, an dem ich gesessen habe, mich für unsichtbar gehalten habe, an Betonladenfronten an den grauesten, trostlosesten Nächten gekauert, nur um jemanden anzuhalten, mir in die Augen zu sehen, mir 5 Dollar zu geben und mir zu sagen, dass ich schön und wertvoll bin.\n\n[REWRITE]  \nMy neighborhood is rich in culture.

It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",

Meine Nachbarschaft ist ziemlich ähnlich wie eine durchschnittliche amerikanische Vorstadtnachbarschaft. Es gibt viele zweistöckige Häuser in der Gegend. Jedes Wochenende oder wann immer es draußen warm ist, höre ich die Kinder draußen spielen. Die Nachbarschaft ist die meisten Tage der Woche ruhig.

Ich habe viele Pakete online bestellt und noch nie wurde eines von meiner Veranda gestohlen. Ich habe das Gefühl, dass ich meinen Nachbarn vertrauen kann.

Every weekend or whenever it's warm, I hear kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days. I've never had any issues with anyone here; you're left alone unless you need help. I've ordered many packages online, and none have ever been stolen from my porch. I feel I can trust my neighbors. There's a park a minute or two from my house, which holds many memories for me. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with other neighborhood guys. I also have one of my worst memories from there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, I go to that park to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger and love playing on swings and slides. Just the thought of going to the park excites them. The park now makes me nostalgic for various reasons. The neighborhood is very diverse, and you can find all kinds of food nearby. Within a mile, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, many people now use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for food delivery. Fast food places are the most popular, but you find those in nearly every suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here have everything you need. Several dry cleaners are nearby. There’s a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street, along with a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some stores are diverse, like an Indian-owned store for anyone in the mood for homemade or ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading social media and seeing the news about the horror stories others face with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.[/REWRITE]",

Es gibt hauptsächlich Wohnhäuser, aber auch ein paar Restaurants und Bars, die Spaß machen und nicht allzu teuer sind. Eine der Bars wurde gerade umbenannt, und diese ist teurer, aber die Qualität von Service und Getränken ist dort nicht die schlechteste. Die meisten Leute sind nett. Sie sind entweder Studenten oder haben ein geringeres Einkommen, da die Mietpreise für Wohnungen nicht sehr hoch sind. Es gibt viele Kinder in der Nähe, da eine Grundschule in Gehweite meiner Wohnung ist. Ich kenne meine Nachbarn nicht, aber ich möchte es auch nicht wirklich. Sie rauchen viel Gras, und deshalb hat die Verwaltung meines Gebäudes einen Lufterfrischer direkt gegenüber ihrer Tür installiert, was mein Freund und ich sehr lustig fanden. Es ist fast beleidigend. Die Gebäude um mich herum sehen meistens ziemlich alt aus, könnten aber renovierte Innenräume haben. Ein Stück die Straße runter gibt es brandneue Wohnungen, aber ich mag sie nicht, weil ich weiß, dass die Bauarbeiten daran nicht besonders gut waren. Sie sind billig gebaut, aber die Miete ist teuer, was ich für einen Betrug halte. Aber da sie in der Nähe des Campus liegen, kommen die Verwalter dieser Gebäude damit durch. Es gibt ein wirklich günstiges Restaurant etwa fünf Minuten von meinem Wohnort entfernt, das nur auf Papptellern serviert und die meisten Gerichte in der Mikrowelle zubereitet. Gegenüber befindet sich eine Tankstelle, von der ich gehört habe, dass sie kein sehr guter Arbeitsplatz ist. Aber dank einiger städtischer Gelder wurde die Straße letzten Sommer neu gemacht, sodass es jetzt einen schönen breiten Gehweg, viel Gras auf den Mittelstreifen und an den Straßenrändern gibt, und die Gegend ist jetzt ein wenig schöner. Doch das Wohnhaus, in dem ich lebe, ist von Bäumen umgeben. Sie haben ein paar von ihnen gefällt, sodass es ein paar Stümpfe gibt, aber es gibt viel mehr Bäume dort, wo ich lebe, als die Straße hinunter. Hinter meinem Wohnkomplex gibt es eine Baumgrenze und dann eine weitere Reihe von Wohnungen. Ich wohne in der 42. Straße, aber direkt dahinter ist die 43. Straße, und die ist nicht so schön. Die Gehwege sind wirklich schlecht und zerfallen, und die meisten Gebäude dort sehen heruntergekommen aus. Es gibt viele Bäume in dieser Straße, aber das ist wahrscheinlich, um zu verbergen, wie die Gebäude aussehen. Die meisten Verbrechen in meiner Gegend sind in einem Wohnkomplex in dieser Straße passiert, aber andererseits kann ich nicht nur sie dafür verantwortlich machen. Es gibt Wohnungen auf der anderen Straßenseite, die auch viel Kriminalität und eine ziemlich wechselnde Bevölkerung haben. Aber ich glaube, ich mag es, wo ich lebe. Ich kann es mir leisten, und es gibt viele nützliche Annehmlichkeiten in der Nähe. Besonders gefällt mir, dass die Universität zu Fuß erreichbar ist und es zwei Bushaltestellen gibt, sodass ich bequem zum Laden und in die Innenstadt gelangen kann.\n\n[REWRITE]My neighborhood is close to the college I attend, and because of that, I really enjoy living there.

We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",

Der einzige Unterschied ist, dass jedes gelb mit weißen Veranden und grünen Metalldächern gestrichen ist. Fast alle, aber nicht jeder, sind miteinander befreundet. An einigen Abenden stehen wir am Ende einer nicht vorher festgelegten Einfahrt und plaudern, während die kleinen Kinder der Nachbarschaft mit ihren Spielzeugen, Straßenkreide oder Drachen spielen. Es ist sehr erfrischend in dieser modernen, allzu mechanischen/computergefüllten Welt. Es ist eher wie ein Schritt zurück in die Zeit. Wir sind umgeben von Feldern und Bäumen, die von blauem Himmel und weißen, wogenden Wolken umrahmt sind. Der einzige Nachteil? In dieser Saison erleben wir Tornadowarnungen und hörten letzte Nacht zum ersten Mal tatsächlich Tornadosirenen, sodass wir Schutz suchen mussten. Und tatsächlich, man hätte mich in meiner Badewanne gefunden, wie ich meinen kleinsten Hund zusammen mit meiner Handtasche und ein paar Kissen festhalte. Mein großer Hund wollte nichts mit dem Badezimmer zu tun haben und blieb nervös und bellend im Wohnzimmer, nervös wegen der seltsamen Umstände. Die Nachbarschaft war still, abgesehen vom Geräusch großer Hagelkörner, die zu Boden fielen. Nach dem Sturm dampfte die Straße buchstäblich aufgrund des Temperaturwechsels. Innerhalb von Minuten sank die Temperatur von 92 auf 75. Der Hagel schmolz sofort, als er auf den heißen Asphalt traf. Als ich zu den sich aufklarenden Himmel aufschaute, kam die Sonne heraus und es begann zu regnen. Ein doppelter Regenbogen erschien. Ich rannte ins Haus und schnappte mir meine Kamera. Schnell machte ich Bilder, um sie mit meinen Facebook-Freunden und der Familie zu teilen. Sie waren erstaunt, ebenso wie ich. Die Straßen blieben noch eine Stunde lang ruhig, bevor einige Leute schließlich von wo auch immer sie waren, als das Gewitter kam, nach Hause kamen. Dann ging alles wie gewohnt weiter, Mütter und Kinder waren draußen, während das Abendessen kochte. So eine freundliche Nachbarschaft für dieses Mädchen, das kürzlich von NH nach NC gezogen ist. Ich liebe den südlichen Akzent, mit dem die Leute sprechen. Ich habe eine Wohnung mit zwei Schlafzimmern und zwei Bädern, wie jeder hier. Obwohl alle Häuser von außen gleich aussehen, sind nicht alle Wohnungen innen gleich. Einige sind tatsächlich ziemlich klein. Das ergibt für mich keinen Sinn. Ich liebe es, entlang des größten Feldes hinter meinem Wohnort zu spazieren und zum Teich zu schlendern, der nicht zum Schwimmen gedacht ist. Ich habe Rehe gesehen und am Morgen kann man den riesigen Ochsenfrosch sein Lied singen hören. Es ist ein fantastischer Ort zum Leben, nur vierzig Minuten außerhalb der Stadt Charlotte. Jeder Morgen wird vom Krähen der Hähne auf den umliegenden Bauernhöfen begrüßt. Es ist eher wie das Leben in einem kleinen Dorf. Wir haben sogar einen Esel auf einem nahegelegenen Bauernhof, den man abends hört, wenn er brüllt, um uns wissen zu lassen, dass er da ist.

Zuerst war ich ziemlich traurig, als ich zum ersten Mal in mein Viertel kam. Ich kam von Riverdale nach Stockbridge, und ich werde nicht lügen, ich habe geweint, weil ich sie vermisst habe und sie geliebt habe.. aber meine Mutter und mein Vater wollten das Beste für mich und meine kleine Schwester, also zogen wir an einen besseren Ort für Wohnraum, eine bessere High School, alles wurde als \"nicht ghetto\" angesehen, als wir in unser neues Viertel zogen. Im Laufe der Jahre habe ich mich daran gewöhnt, habe einige neue Freunde gefunden und auch einige neue Feinde in der Schule. Ich habe nie wirklich meine Nachbarn kennengelernt, außer Herrn Glen und seinen Kindern, sowie Dennis für eine Weile, die beide direkt neben uns waren. Sie waren angenehme Menschen, die ich in gewisser Weise fast als Familie betrachten kann, und ich schätze sie wirklich. Ich erinnere mich, als ich, Mama, Papa und meine Schwester zur Hochzeit von Herrn Glen gingen (sie haben wieder geheiratet). Es war wirklich lustig und angenehm, um es gelinde auszudrücken, und etwas, worauf ich mich eines Tages freue, während ich mein Vermögen aufbaue und meiner zukünftigen Frau das Leben einer Königin schenke. Als Herr Glens Frau, Frau Veda, das weiße kleine Band an ihrem Bein abnahm und warf, habe ich es gefangen! Leider habe ich die Blumen nicht gefangen! Wir tanzten die ganze Nacht, und ich hatte wirklich eine gute Zeit mit Marsharii, einer ihrer Töchter. Ich habe sie seitdem nicht mehr gesehen. Ich hoffe, sie hat sich zu größeren und besseren Dingen weiterentwickelt. Das Viertel selbst ist wie ein Labyrinth, obwohl ich jetzt ein GPS habe, sodass ich mehr Zeit habe, es zu erkunden. Ich bin nur so weit gegangen, und das war, als ich mit meinen Freunden Kason und Curtis unterwegs war. Wir haben alle viel Videospiele gespielt und das Leben so gut es ging genossen. Manchmal ging ich in den Park und genoss die Natur, die meine Seele beruhigt. Es gibt mir heutzutage ein Gefühl von Ruhe und Frieden.

We all used to play video games a lot and enjoyed life as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I also bring some sticks that I bought from Home Depot and practice my balance, and bring my bokken wooden sword if I can. I have fun doing what I love. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, it’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it up again. My dad raised me and my best friend on tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time. They worked us hard! But we always had fun.

    "transformed": "Well, considering I've been here for about 10 years, I think I can share what I know. Initially, I was quite sad when I first arrived in my neighborhood. I moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I won’t lie, I cried because I missed them and loved them... but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better place for housing, a better high school, where everything was considered \"not ghetto\" when we moved to our new neighborhood. Over the years, I got used to it and made some new friends, and a few new enemies at school too. I never really got to know my neighbors over the years, except for Mr. Glen and his children, and Dennis for a while, both of whom lived right next to us. They were enjoyable people who I can almost consider family in some ways, and I truly appreciate them. I remember when my mom, dad, sister, and I went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (they got re-married). It was really fun and enjoyable, to say the least, and something I look forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the little white strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Unfortunately, I didn’t catch the flowers!

    "original": "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",

    "raw_output": "Mein Viertel ist eine idyllische kleine Stadt. Es unterscheidet sich nicht von anderen in South Carolina, aber es hat einen bedeutenden Einfluss auf den Agrarsektor. Johnston ist als die Pfirsichhauptstadt der Welt bekannt, was die Stadt stolz auf dem Willkommensschild verkündet. Es besteht hauptsächlich aus landwirtschaftlichen Flächen, die entweder von Pfirsichbäumen oder Vieh dominiert werden. Die Häuser, die nicht im Hauptteil der Stadt liegen, sind weit auseinander; die meisten haben zwei Stockwerke mit entweder Metalldächern, um der sengenden Sommerhitze entgegenzuwirken, oder grauen Schindeln. Diese Häuser liegen oft nicht in der Nähe der Straße, sondern weiter hinten, sodass die vorderen Felder für Tiere oder Pflanzen genutzt werden können. Im Hauptteil der Stadt gibt es eine einzige Ampel, die an einer Kreuzung hängt. Hier befinden sich die einzigen Geschäfte der ganzen Stadt. Es gibt drei Orte, an denen man \"Schnellimbiss\" bekommen kann: Hong Kong, ein kleines chinesisches Restaurant, das von einer Familie betrieben wird, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant oder Gary's, eine kleine Burger-Kette. Es gab früher eine Pizzeria, aber sie wurde vor kurzem geschlossen. Es gibt eine sehr kleine familiengeführte Apotheke namens Maxwell und Halford Drug; lustigerweise sind sie am bekanntesten für das Cherry Coca-Cola, das sie verkaufen. Es gibt einen kleinen, aber teuren Lebensmittelladen namens Independent Grocers Alliance, besser bekannt als IGA. Obwohl es der einzige Lebensmittelladen in der ganzen Stadt ist, halten viele nur an, um ein oder zwei Artikel zu kaufen; die meisten ziehen es vor, nach Batesburg-Leesville zu einem Walmart zu fahren, um den Großteil ihrer Lebensmittel zu kaufen. Der beliebteste Laden in der ganzen Stadt ist Dollar General; dieser Laden verkauft eine Vielzahl von Alltagsgegenständen und ist oft von der Öffnung bis zur Schließung gut besucht! Es gibt ein sehr kleines Möbelgeschäft, Possibilities Furniture & More, das von einer freundlichen Frau geführt wird, die in der Gemeinde bekannt ist. Das Geschäft ist seit vielen Jahren in Johnston und beschäftigt sogar zwei Möbelpacker, die die gekauften Möbel liefern! An das Möbelgeschäftsgebäude ist ein kleiner Tierfriseur namens Clark's Cuts and Kennels angeschlossen. Sie bieten eine Vielzahl von Dienstleistungen an, wie z.B. Tagesbetreuung, Unterbringung, Pflege, Krallenschleifen, Baden usw. Sowohl eine Arzt- als auch eine Tierarztpraxis befinden sich abseits des Hauptteils der Stadt; beide sind sehr kleine Praxen, aber gut ausgestattet, um den Bewohnern von Johnston zu helfen. Es gibt eine einzige Grundschule namens Johnston Elementary School. Sobald die Schüler die fünfte Klasse abgeschlossen haben, müssen sie sowohl die Mittel- als auch die Oberschule in der nächsten Stadt besuchen. Technisch gesehen gibt es keine Parks in der Stadt, aber sie sind gerade dabei, einen 2,5 Hektar großen Freizeitbereich zu schaffen, um den Familien mehr Möglichkeiten für Ausflüge zu bieten und mehr Besucher oder potenzielle Bewohner anzuziehen. Zugegeben, es gibt nicht viel zu tun; es gibt keine Kinos, Bowlingbahnen, \"Treffpunkte\", Spielplätze für Kinder, Bereiche zum Spazierengehen mit Haustieren oder eine große Auswahl an Restaurants. Trotzdem ist es eine nette Stadt, so klein, dass man sie im Handumdrehen passieren könnte, ohne es zu merken!\n\n[REWRITE]My neighborhood is a charming little town.

    "original": "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",

High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit.

The most common jobs in my city, as far as I can tell without any official demographics, are in construction. I believe this is because the city is still not very developed, with lots of open spaces left to build on. That kind of worries me because I like things as they are now. I left a big city and I'm not interested in going back. Speaking of construction, that's the field of my full-time job; I'm a drywall and T-bar installer. What I enjoy about my home is the variety of animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, including the stark beauty of the desert itself. The high desert climate and landscape have created challenging ecosystems that need protection and are home to various types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment to coexist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted well to the wildlife. I have three children, and they are all fascinated by lizards and desert bugs; as I'm writing this, they're outside trying to catch different specimens. Regarding attractions, we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can offer a unique experience. If possible, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun in the Victorville way. Visit the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to round out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of Victorville's development in society and industry.",

Die Leute nennen ihn den \"Workout-Hügel\", weil so viele Jogger gern hinauflaufen während ihres täglichen Trainings. Da es auf meiner Straße überhaupt keine Gehwege gibt, laufen alle auf der Straße. Die Straße ist an einigen Stellen uneben und kann beim Fahren etwas gefährlich erscheinen. Einige der Telefon- und Stromleitungen, die um den Block gespannt sind, sehen zerfleddert aus. Es regnet und stürmt viel in unserer Gegend, sodass Äste und anderer Schutt oft die Stromleitungen treffen und die ständigen Reparaturen lassen sie schachbrettartig und flickenhaft erscheinen. Überall, wohin man schaut, stehen viele hohe immergrüne Bäume. Aber die Leute hier hassen die Bäume. Sie bemühen sich, so viele wie möglich zu fällen, weil die Bäume die Sicht auf den Ozean versperren. Deshalb sind viele der Häuser hoch oben auf dem Hügel gebaut, mit riesigen gläsernen zweiten Etagen, die eine nach der anderen emporragen, um den Blick auf die Bucht zu genießen. Es ist wunderschön rund um den Sonnenuntergang, wenn das Wasser von unten beleuchtet scheint und der Himmel sich orange färbt. Allerdings ist es meistens bewölkt, sodass man das meiste Sonnenlicht durch einen Dunst sieht. Die meisten Tage sind bewölkt und feucht. Moos wächst auf allem, worauf es kann: Dächer, Autos und Geländer. Einmal ließ ich mein Auto einen Monat lang draußen in meiner Einfahrt stehen, und als ich es benutzen wollte, war es grün und pelzig vor Moos geworden. Es dauerte drei Stunden, alles abzukratzen. Es gibt nicht viele Kinder in der Gegend, in der ich lebe, obwohl es nur ein paar Blocks entfernt eine Schule gibt. Die meisten Menschen in meiner Nachbarschaft sind älter, viele von ihnen im Ruhestand. Statt Kinder haben die Leute Hunde. Es ist üblich, sie auf den Rasen der Leute sitzen zu sehen oder die Straße entlangrennen zu sehen. Wenn Sie eine Tür oder ein Fenster offen lassen, riskieren Sie, dass sie sich in Ihr Haus schleichen. Einmal fand ich einen in meinem Wohnzimmer und musste ihn zur Haustür hinaus scheuchen. Kaninchen laufen wild in der Gegend herum. Einige von ihnen sind ziemlich groß, und die Gärtner hassen sie, weil sie die Wurzeln von Pflanzen ausgraben und in die Rasen der Leute graben. Meine Katzen lieben sie jedoch und haben die meisten von ihnen aus unserer Nachbarschaft verjagt. Wir haben auch die übliche Auswahl an Vögeln: kleine Spatzen und Kolibris, und gelegentlich fliegt ein Falke oder Adler vorbei, bis die Krähen der Nachbarschaft ihn vertreiben. Es gibt keine Geschäfte in der Nähe, aber wenn Sie den Hügel hinunter zum Wasser laufen, gibt es ein paar Restaurants, die frische Meeresfrüchte servieren. Es gibt dort unten keinen wirklichen Strand, aber die Felsen entlang der Küste sind lustig, um sie ins Wasser zu werfen. Die Bucht selbst ist nicht sehr breit.

You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago.

Der öffentliche Nahverkehr ist sehr gut erreichbar und eine der beliebtesten Verkehrsarten in New York City. Bensonhurst ist ein ziemlich urbanes Viertel, sodass Sie sich immer noch fühlen werden, als wären Sie in New York City. Während Ihres Besuchs sollten Sie darauf vorbereitet sein, die verschiedenen asiatischen Geschäfte überall zu sehen. In den letzten zwei Jahrzehnten hat Bensonhurst einen Zustrom asiatischer Einwohner erhalten. Deshalb werden Sie beim Gehen mindestens in jedem Block ein asiatisch geführtes Geschäft sehen. Besonders beliebt sind Supermärkte und Wäschereien. Zufälligerweise sind diese Geschäfte bei den Einheimischen sehr beliebt, da die Qualität der Lebensmittel in den Supermärkten hervorragend ist, die Preise viel günstiger sind und es letztendlich sehr praktisch ist. Gleich in der Nähe von mir gibt es vier asiatische Supermärkte, die nur zwei Gehminuten voneinander entfernt sind. Das trägt zur Bequemlichkeit bei, Lebensmittel einzukaufen. Ich sage nicht, dass Bensonhurst ausschließlich von asiatischen Einwohnern bewohnt ist. Es ist insgesamt sehr vielfältig, mit Einwanderern und ihren Erst- und Zweitgenerations-amerikanischen Kindern hier. Die meisten großen und beliebten Geschäfte in der Gegend sind in asiatischem Besitz. Zusätzlich zu diesen asiatischen Geschäften gibt es auch einen kürzlich renovierten Park in der Nähe, der etwa zehn Basketballplätze, ein großes Feld für Fußball oder Baseball, vier Handballplätze, Schaukeln, einen Spielplatz für Kinder und sogar einen Brunnen für Kinder, um im Sommer Wasser zu genießen, bietet. Da wir in New York City sind, sind die Parks natürlich sehr vielfältig. Sie werden hier alle möglichen Arten von Vielfalt sehen, die gut zusammen spielen und auskommen können. In diesem Viertel gibt es nicht viele große Firmengebäude. Die einzigen Gebäude, die Sie finden werden, sind für kooperatives Wohnen oder Eigentumswohnungen. Die meisten Wohnräume hier sind jedoch Zweifamilienhäuser. Die meisten Menschen sind ziemlich nett, jedoch sehr laut. Jeden Tag hören Sie Autos, die ihre Musik laut abspielen, während sie an Ihrem Haus vorbeifahren, oder ständig Gas geben, was Sie am Morgen wecken wird. Wenn Sie planen, nachts zu besuchen, sollten Sie auf der Hut sein. Diese Nachbarschaft ist ziemlich sicher, aber Menschen sind unberechenbar. Sie könnten auf Leute treffen, die aus keinem Grund Ärger machen wollen, auf Schläger und Diebe. Ich selbst wurde in dieser Nachbarschaft in der Vergangenheit durch körperliche Angriffe gemobbt, aber das war vor vielen Jahren. Ein weiterer kürzlicher Vorfall betraf Paketdiebstahl. Obwohl es eine häufige Sache ist, gibt es in dieser Nachbarschaft Paketdiebe. Zu guter Letzt, obwohl New York City eine Geldstrafe für Menschen hat, die nach ihren Hunden nicht sauber machen, halten sich die Leute hier nicht an die Regeln. Jeden Morgen werden Sie auf dem Weg zur U-Bahn-Station oder auf dem Weg zum Supermarkt mindestens einen Hundekot sehen. Mein größtes Ärgernis ist Hundekot überall auf dem Boden, wo ich in dieser Nachbarschaft gehe.

To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights.

That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",

No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",

Egal, wie oft ich sie vergesse oder wie sehr ich mit Arbeit und Leben beschäftigt bin, um sie zu bemerken, sie sind da, unerschütterlich, unangefochten und unbeeindruckt von den Herausforderungen des Lebens. An Tagen, an denen ich am meisten gestresst und angespannt bin, fordern sie, gesehen zu werden, und wenn ich mich zu ihnen wende, lassen sie mich meine ängstliche Seele beruhigen und geben mir die Kraft, weiterzumachen, Tag für Tag. Ich zog hierher, als ich mein Studium begann, und die Berge nördlich des Campus waren das, was mich zuerst faszinierte. Sicher, die Universität hat ihre eigenen atemberaubenden Anblicke in Gebäuden, Teichen und Bäumen, die ebenfalls mein Herz eroberten, aber es sind die Berge, die wirklich ihren Thron halten. Der Rest der Stadt ist auf seine Weise schön. Es gibt unzählige Cafés, die viele Stunden voller koffeingeladenem Büffeln beherbergten. Man kann ein Stück zu Fuß gehen oder den Bus nehmen, um in die Innenstadt zu gelangen und von einer Aura der Antike umhüllt zu werden, die die verblassten Ziegelsteine ausstrahlen, welche die Restaurants und Bürogebäude säumen. Hier zeigt diese scheinbar vorstädtische Stadt ebenso viel Trubel und Lebendigkeit wie ihre benachbarte Großstadt. Doch das dauert nicht viele Blocks, denn man kann wieder in die ruhige Kleinstadt entkommen, indem man an der Bibliothek vorbeigeht. Diese Nähe von unterschiedlichen Atmosphären verleiht dieser Stadt ein wunderbares Flair, als würde sie zur Erkundung einladen. So ist es einfach, viele wertvolle Erinnerungen zu schaffen, jede mit einem bestimmten Teil der Stadt verbunden. Sei es, mit Freunden nach einer durchgemachten Nacht an den verrosteten Schaukeln im Park vorbeizugehen oder durch die geschäftige Innenstadt zu rennen, um den Film im schicken Kino zu sehen, für das die Universität Tickets bereitstellte. Doch auch viele harte Erinnerungen sind hier zu Hause, wie es an allen Orten des Lebens der Fall ist. Die Teiche sind besonders ein passender Ort für Reflexionen sowie für nächtliche Heulattacken mitten in einer existenziellen Krise – Letzteres kenne ich nur zu gut. Während ich die Schildkröten, Enten und Insekten beobachte, die ihr Leben leben, jeder mit einem Beitrag oder einer Rolle, konnte ich nicht umhin, über meinen eigenen Sinn nachzudenken, während ich versuchte, dieses Mysterium namens Leben zu entschlüsseln. Also ging ich am Teich vorbei, am Park und an den kleinen Häusern, die nach Vorstadt schreien, bis ich eine Hauptstraße erreichte. Dann schien die Sonne ihre strahlenden Strahlen auf die Palmen und malte den Himmel dabei, und als ich den Sonnenaufgang betrachtete, merkte ich, dass ich nach Norden ging. Und tatsächlich, da waren sie, wie sie immer gewesen waren. Die mächtigen, überwältigenden Berge streiften den dunstigen blauen und gelben Himmel mehr als jedes Gebäude am Horizont, und als ob sie ohne Worte sprachen, weckten sie in mir meinen Durchhaltewillen.\n\n[REWRITE]The mountains are ever-present.

At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community.

The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between.

Innerhalb dieser Gemeinschaften, auf diesen Straßen, befinden sich einige Wohnkomplexe - sorgfältig nebeneinander angeordnet wie russische Puppen, die sorgfältig auseinander genommen und Stück für Stück nebeneinander aufgereiht wurden. Die ersten Wohnungen, auf die Sie stoßen, sind diejenigen, die wegen einiger ziemlich unschöner Geschäfte in den Nachrichten waren, daher werden wir uns nicht zu sehr auf diese konzentrieren - Erscheinungen können schließlich täuschen. Aber die Wohnungen neben diesem Komplex und die beiden Komplexe daneben sind eine ganz andere Welt, von der fast niemand in dieser Gegend weiß. Gegenüber diesen Komplexen befindet sich der Satellitencampus eines Community College - eine ruhige, verschlafene Ansammlung von Gebäuden, die wie Wächter an der Straße stehen, wo Studenten mit Kaffee in der Hand hereintreiben und um 7 Uhr morgens gähnen, um ihre verschlafenen Tage zu beginnen. Die eisernen Tore knarren auf, um sie einzeln hereinzulassen, während Pendler die Fäuste aus dem Fenster schütteln und über sie stöhnen, weil sie an Tagen, an denen die Anwesenheit höher ist, den Verkehr aufhalten. Die Straße mündet in eine andere Wohnstraße, mit einem Park auf der einen Seite und einem Rehabilitationszentrum für Menschen, die sich unter unglücklichen Umständen Knochen gebrochen haben. Das Behandlungszentrum rühmt sich mit fröhlichen Verandamöbeln und einem faul rotierenden Deckenventilator, der die warme, dicke Sommerluft hin und her wälzt. Kinder rennen im Gras des Parks auf der anderen Straßenseite hin und her, machen Radschläge und drehen sich über die stacheligen grünen Halme, während Bienen träge in den Blumenbeeten an der Straße kreisen. Alte Pensionäre führen ihre Hunde auf dem Spazierweg aus, runzeln die Stirn über die Teenager auf ihren Skateboards und nicken den Teenager-Mädchen, die sich bei den Spielplatzgeräten versammeln, zurückhaltend zu, während sie über Jungs und die neuesten YouTube-Stars tratschen. Es gibt ein Sushi-Restaurant in einem Einkaufszentrum neben dem Park, das preiswertes Essen anbietet, aber nie zu beschäftigt zu sein scheint - ein Schwimmzubehörladen direkt daneben und ein Nagelsalon dazwischen. Man könnte das Schwimmbad für die Saison füllen, während man eine Maniküre bekommt und Hibachi-Hühnchen isst - die Schönheit eines Einkaufszentrums. Dort gibt es auch einen Frozen-Yogurt-Laden, eine der DIY-Arten, und man sieht oft die Teenager im Park, die kalte, schwitzende Becher mit Frozen Yogurt voller Toppings halten, während sie Kunststücke auf ihren Skateboards machen und dampfen, weil sie glauben, dass es das Coolste ist.

My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents.

Wohngebiete sind scheinbar zufällig zwischen Gewerbegebieten verstreut, in denen eine Vielzahl von Geschäften betrieben wird. Einige dieser Geschäfte bestehen aus Büros, während andere verschiedene Läden, Restaurants und Unterhaltungsmöglichkeiten sind. Es mangelt nicht an neuen Restaurants zum Essen oder Geschäften zum Einkaufen. Während einige Geschäfte große, bekannte Marken sind, die großen Konzernen gehören, sind auch kleine Boutiquen zunehmend beliebt. Sie befinden sich nicht nur in verschiedenen Einkaufszentren, sondern säumen auch die Straßen, die oft in Gehweite von Vierteln liegen, die sonst ruhig und idyllisch wären, wenn sie nicht von so vielen interessanten Orten umgeben wären. Es gibt auch ein paar nahegelegene Parks, und ich habe bemerkt, dass Menschen diese Parks häufig mit ihren kleinen Kindern besuchen. Apropos Menschen, in meinem Viertel gibt es tatsächlich eine beträchtliche Vielfalt. An einem kleinen Ort haben wir eine prominente LGBTQ+-Gemeinschaft, eine orthodoxe jüdische Gemeinschaft und eine Sammlung von Flüchtlingen und Einwanderern aus der ehemaligen Sowjetunion. Etwas weiter außerhalb meines Viertels gibt es viele weitere Personen verschiedener Rassen und Herkunft, obwohl sie manchmal in ihren eigenen kleinen Gemeinschaften innerhalb der Stadt aufgeteilt sind. Wir haben Orte, die als Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia und viele mehr bekannt sind, die nur wenige Meilen entfernt sind. Allerdings kann schon eine kurze Strecke eine sehr lange Fahrt bedeuten. Eine Entfernung von nur 10 Meilen kann manchmal aufgrund des Verkehrs, besonders während der Stoßzeiten, zwei Stunden dauern. Kaum jemand in meiner Stadt geht irgendwohin zu Fuß. Während bestimmte interessante Orte unvermeidlich nahe liegen, ist die Stadt riesig, und die Menschen ziehen es im Allgemeinen nicht vor, zu Fuß zu pendeln. Daher haben wir auch eines der schlimmsten Verkehrsprobleme der Welt, und es kann schwierig sein, fast überall Parkplätze zu finden. Ironischerweise gab es in den letzten Jahren eine große Menge an Bauarbeiten, da große Wohngebäude in die Stadt integriert werden. Es scheint ein beliebtes Ziel zu sein, aber viele Bewohner sind von der Aussicht enttäuscht, dass noch mehr Menschen einziehen und noch mehr Fahrzeuge auf den Straßen unterwegs sind. In meiner Stadt gibt es jedoch viele verschiedene Arten von Häusern. Nicht jeder lebt oder möchte in einem großen Wohngebäude leben. Wohngebiete bestehen aus Häusern unterschiedlicher Größe sowie kleineren Wohngebäuden und Eigentumswohnungen. Einige Grundstücke enthalten Einfamilienhäuser, während andere Doppelhaushälften enthalten. Das gilt sogar in meinem unmittelbaren Viertel, sodass es auch in Bezug auf Wohnmöglichkeiten keine Mangel an Vielfalt gibt. Ebenso besteht das Viertel aus Menschen unterschiedlichen Alters, und um ehrlich zu sein, kenne ich die meisten meiner Nachbarn nicht. Es ist heutzutage nicht wirklich eine eng verbundene Gemeinschaft, obwohl ich viele Erinnerungen aus meiner Kindheit habe, als ich draußen mit meinem Nachbarn von nebenan und ein paar anderen Freunden aus der Nachbarschaft gespielt habe, die alle in meinem Alter waren.\n\n**Translation back to English:**\n\nSince I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse.

Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco.

Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home.

Sie kam aus einer Stadt, in der der Supermarkt nur fünf Minuten zu Fuß von ihrem Haus entfernt war – sie hatte noch nie in ihrem Leben so viel offenen Raum gesehen. Überwältigt von der Allgegenwart der Maisfelder, erzählte ich ihr, wie es war, in ländlichen Ohio aufzuwachsen, und in diesem Moment verstand sie endlich, wer ich war und woher ich kam. Wenn Sie die zweispurige Landstraße entlangfahren, erreichen Sie einen mit Wasser gefüllten Steinbruch. Gleich dahinter liegt die kleine Siedlung, in der ich lebe. Die Häuser bestehen größtenteils aus Ziegeln und Stuck. Alle Häuser haben mindestens einen halben Morgen Land, auf dessen Pflege jeder stolz ist. Im Frühling sind die alljährlich gepflanzten Blumen reichlich vorhanden, zusammen mit den mittelwestlichen Bäumen, die sich mit jeder Jahreszeit verändern. Die Einfahrten sind mit den luxuriösesten Mercedes-Benz-Autos gefüllt, die nach einer guten, altmodischen Autowäsche in der Mittagssonne glänzen. Wenn Sie weiter die Straße entlang zu meinem grauen Stuckhaus fahren, ist mein koreanischer Nachbar immer draußen mit einem freundlichen Gesicht. Er verbringt den ganzen Tag damit, seinen Rasen zu mähen, und man kann ihn über das Brummen seines Mähers singen hören. Jeder in der Nachbarschaft lacht über ihn, aber er ist immer aufrichtig und eine erstaunliche Person mit einer einzigartigen Geschichte. Er ist älter geworden und hat im Alter etwas von seinem Witz verloren. Früher war er Arzt und passt normalerweise gut zum Gras und seinem John Deer Zero Turn Mäher. Schließlich erreichen Sie mein Zuhause. Im Seitengarten gibt es viele Gänse, die von unserem Terrier gejagt werden. Hinten gibt es einen kleinen Bach, der in den Steinbruch mündet. Hier kann man Ochsenfrösche, den Bach und gelegentlich das \"Muh\" von den nahegelegenen Bauernhöfen hören. Über die handgefertigte Holzbrücke hinweg liegt eine unberührte Oase mit natürlich wachsenden Bäumen, Kräutern und Wildblumen. Hier habe ich den größten Teil meiner Kindheit verbracht. Vom Bau von Baumhäusern bis zum „Jagen“ von Tieren (was meist aus dem Hinterherjagen bestand) gab es immer etwas zu tun und normalerweise ein Nachbarskind für die Freundschaft. Die Winter in meiner kleinen Stadt können schmerzhaft brutal sein, aber es gibt nichts Schöneres. Der Hof verwandelt sich von einem Meer aus Grün in eine leere Wildnis. Die Bäume, die einst leuchtend pinke, lila und orangefarbene Blumen beherbergten, verwandeln sich in kahle Skelette aus Rinde. Bei gelegentlichem Schneefall erscheint über Nacht ein Winterwunderland. Der Garten ist gesäumt von Schneefiguren, die von meiner kleinen Schwester gemacht wurden, und Schneemännern. Meine Schwester und ich stritten uns häufig als Kinder, und im Winter waren Schneebälle unsere bevorzugte Waffe. Wir bauten massive igluähnliche Festungen, um unsere Waffen zu lagern, normalerweise mit Ästen, wie ein Arsenal.

    "transformed": "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past the cornfields filling the horizon. \"This is it!\" I said, aware she'd be shocked by the sparseness of the open landscape. She came from a town where the grocery store was just a five-minute walk from her home—she had never seen so much open space before. Overwhelmed by the ubiquity of cornfields, I shared with her what it was like growing up in rural Ohio, and at that moment, she finally understood who I was and where I came from. Driving down the two-lane country road, you'll reach a quarry filled with water. Just beyond it is the small development where I live. The houses are mostly made of brick and stucco. Each house has at least half an acre of land, which everyone takes pride in maintaining. In spring, the annually planted flowers are abundant, along with the Midwestern trees that change with each season. The driveways are filled with the most luxurious Mercedes Benz cars, shining in the midday sun after a good old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road to my gray stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He spends the entire day mowing his lawn, and you can hear him singing over the hum of his mower. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he's always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He's grown older and lost some of his wit with age. In the past, he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Finally, you reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and chased by our Terrier. Out back, there's a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and occasionally the \"moo\" from nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This is where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to 'hunting' animals (mostly chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood kid available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet nothing is more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once held vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. With occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I often fought as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice.
