    "original": "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",

    "raw_output": "Ich lebe im ländlichen Amerika, genauer gesagt in einer kleinen Stadt in Michigan. Hier wechselt man von Ackerland zu kleinen Touristenstädten. Es gibt keine großen Einkaufszentren, kein Wal-Mart, Target oder sogar ein Applebee’s. Wohin man auch muss, man muss mit dem Auto fahren, um dorthin zu gelangen. Trotzdem lebe ich an einem der schönsten Orte der Welt, umgeben von Wasser. Meine „Stadt“ ist von Wasser umgeben. Der wunderschöne Lake Michigan liegt auf der einen Seite und der Lake Charlevoix auf der anderen. Überall findet man einen Strand, um die Zehen ins Wasser zu tauchen. Meine Nachbarschaft spiegelt die Vorstellung einer Kleinstadt wider. Die Häuser sind nicht eng aneinander gereiht. Sie sind keine identischen Häuser, die alle gleich gebaut sind. Es sind ältere Häuser, einige werden renoviert und umgebaut, andere sind noch älter. Die meisten Häuser haben Keller. Volle Keller, die man von der Straße aus sehen kann. Viele Häuser in der Nachbarschaft haben älteres Aluminiumverkleidung. Wir haben Häuser in jeder erdenklichen Farbe in den Blocks, die mein Haus umgeben. Die meisten Häuser haben Gärten. Gärten mit Trampolinen und Spielgeräten. Einige Leute haben Gärten und Zäune für ihre Tiere. Die Häuser verkörpern das mittlere Amerika. Fleißige Menschen, die arbeiten, um ihren Lebensunterhalt zu verdienen, und entweder Familien großziehen oder großgezogen haben. An jedem beliebigen Tag sieht man Kinder, die die Straßen auf und ab rennen. Man sieht auch Menschen, die Hunde ausführen, Fahrrad fahren und Inlineskaten. Nachbarn kennen Nachbarn und man erkennt, wer dazugehört und wer nicht. Man sieht jemanden draußen grillen und winkt, oder lächelt jemandem freundlich zu, der seinen Hund ein paar Blocks weiter spazieren führt. Die Rasenflächen werden in gutem Zustand gehalten. Niemand hat Laubhaufen vom Herbst. Grünes Gras wird gemäht und gepflegt. Wenn Menschen Pflanzen und Büsche in ihren Gärten haben, werden sie gestutzt. Es ist keine hübsche Nachbarschaft, in die man hineinfährt und denkt, wow, schau dir die schönen Häuser an, sondern eine, in die man hineinfährt und denkt, dass dies ein guter Ort wäre, um eine Familie großzuziehen. Es ist ruhig, friedlich und sicher. Obwohl es nur durchschnittlich aussieht, ist es außergewöhnlich, weil es das repräsentiert, was Menschen in der Welt wollen, nämlich einen sicheren Ort, um am Ende des Tages zu landen. In Gehweite befinden sich das Büro des County Sheriffs und das Gefängnis. Das Gesundheitsamt liegt direkt daneben. Das städtische Recyclingzentrum befindet sich gleich die Straße runter, und Nachbarn und Bewohner aus der ganzen Stadt nutzen die angebotenen Dienstleistungen. Wir haben in der Nähe Baseball- und Softballfelder, wo man die Ansager hört, die Punkte zählen und die Namen der Spieler aufrufen. Unser kleiner Stadtflughafen liegt daneben. Man kann draußen oder sogar drinnen spielen und das Dröhnen der kleinen Motorflugzeuge beim Starten und Landen hören. Man kann zum örtlichen Eisladen laufen, um Eis zu holen, und wenn man wirklich Lust hat, kann man von unserem Wohnviertel ins Stadtzentrum gelangen. Meine Kinder können mit ihren Fahrrädern zum Park fahren, der nur etwa 8 Blocks entfernt ist. Es ist wirklich ein großartiger Ort zum Leben.\n\n[REWRITE]  \nI live in rural America, specifically in a small town in Michigan. Here, you transition from farmland to small tourist towns.

For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails.

Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",

    "original": "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",

Es fiel mir anfangs schwer, Freunde zu finden, aber ich bin schließlich mit jemandem, der zwei Häuser weiter wohnt, und einem anderen Typen, der in meiner Straße wohnt, eng befreundet gewesen. Keiner von ihnen wohnt dort mehr, aber die Erinnerungen bleiben. Die meisten Menschen, die hier lebten, als ich hierher zog, sind immer noch hier. Mein Viertel ist ziemlich ähnlich wie ein durchschnittliches amerikanisches Vorstadtviertel. Es gibt viele zweistöckige Häuser hier. Jedes Wochenende oder einfach, wann immer es draußen warm ist, höre ich die Kinder draußen spielen. Das Viertel ist die meisten Tage der Woche ruhig. Ich hatte noch nie ein Problem mit jemandem aus der Nachbarschaft. Man wird in diesem Viertel in Ruhe gelassen, es sei denn, man braucht Hilfe. Ich habe mehrere Pakete online bestellt und noch nie wurde ein Paket von meiner Veranda gestohlen. Ich habe das Gefühl, dass ich meinen Nachbarn vertrauen kann. Es gibt einen Park, der ein oder zwei Minuten von meinem Haus entfernt ist. Ich habe dort viele Erinnerungen. Ich habe dort mit den anderen Jungs aus der Nachbarschaft Basketball, Fußball und Baseball gespielt. Ich habe dort auch eine meiner schlimmsten Erinnerungen, als ich beim Fußballspielen einen Ellbogen auf die Nase bekommen habe, aber die guten Erinnerungen überwiegen die schlechten. Heutzutage gehe ich in diesen Park, um Zeit mit den Kindern meiner Cousine zu verbringen. Sie sind viel jünger als ich und spielen immer noch gerne auf Schaukeln und Rutschen und all solchen Dingen. Schon der Gedanke, in den Park zu gehen, macht sie aufgeregt. Der Park macht mich jetzt aus verschiedenen Gründen sehr nostalgisch. Die Nachbarschaft ist sehr vielfältig. In der Nähe finden Sie alle Arten von Lebensmitteln. In einem Umkreis von nur einer Meile finden Sie chinesische, indische, mexikanische und italienische Restaurants. Heutzutage nutzen jedoch viele Menschen einfach Apps wie GrubHub und DoorDash, um sich ihr Essen liefern zu lassen. Die beliebtesten Essensorte sind die Fastfood-Läden, aber die gibt es in fast jedem Vorstadtviertel. Es gibt auch viele Pizzerien. Die Geschäfte hier enthalten alles, was man jemals brauchen könnte. Es gibt mehrere Reinigungen in der Nähe. Es gibt eine Walgreens und eine CVS in derselben Straße sowie einen Jewel-Osco-Laden, der im Mittleren Westen beliebt ist. Einige der Geschäfte sind sogar vielfältig, da es ein indisch geführtes Geschäft gibt, wenn Sie jemals in der Stimmung sind, indisches Essen selbst zu machen oder fertiges indisches Essen zu kaufen. Insgesamt bin ich ein Fan meines Viertels. Wenn ich in den sozialen Medien lese und in den Nachrichten sehe, welche Horrorgeschichten andere Menschen mit ihren Nachbarn durchleben müssen, bin ich dankbar für meine.\n\nTranslation back to English:\n\nI moved to this neighborhood when I was just about to start eighth grade.

    "transformed": "I moved to this neighborhood just as I was about to start eighth grade. Initially, it was tough to make friends, but I eventually got close to someone who lived two houses away and another guy on my street. Neither of them lives here anymore, but the memories remain. Most of the people who were around when I first moved are still here. My neighborhood is quite similar to a typical American suburban area. There are many two-story houses. Every weekend or whenever it's warm, I hear kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I've never had a problem with anyone here. You're left alone unless you need help. I've ordered several packages online without ever having one stolen from my porch. I feel I can trust my neighbors. There's a park a minute or two from my house. I have many memories there. I've played basketball, football, and baseball with the other guys in the neighborhood. I also have one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, I visit the park to spend time with my cousin's kids. They're much younger and still enjoy swings, slides, and all that. Just thinking about going to the park excites them. The park makes me nostalgic for various reasons now.

Es gibt hauptsächlich Wohngebäude, aber auch ein paar Restaurants und Bars, die Spaß machen und nicht allzu teuer sind. Eine der Bars wurde gerade umbenannt, und diese ist teurer, aber der Service und die Getränke sind dort nicht wirklich schlecht. Die meisten Leute sind nett. Sie sind entweder Studenten oder haben ein geringeres Einkommen, da die Wohnungen nicht sehr teuer sind. In der Nähe gibt es viele Kinder, da eine Grundschule in Gehweite meiner Wohnung liegt. Ich kenne meine Nachbarn nicht, aber das will ich auch nicht wirklich. Sie rauchen viel Gras, weshalb die Verwaltung meiner Wohnung ein Lufterfrischungsgerät direkt gegenüber ihrer Tür angebracht hat, was mein Freund und ich sehr lustig fanden. Es ist fast beleidigend. Die Gebäude um mich herum sehen meist ziemlich alt aus, könnten aber renovierte Innenräume haben. Etwas die Straße hinunter gibt es brandneue Wohnungen, aber ich mag sie nicht, weil ich weiß, dass die Bauarbeiten an ihnen nicht besonders gut waren. Sie sind billig gebaut, aber die Miete ist teuer, was ich für einen Betrug halte, aber da sie in der Nähe des Campus liegen, können die Verantwortlichen damit durchkommen. Etwa fünf Minuten von meinem Wohnort entfernt gibt es ein wirklich günstiges Restaurant, das nur auf Papptellern serviert und das meiste davon ist in der Mikrowelle zubereitet. Direkt gegenüber befindet sich eine Tankstelle, von der ich gehört habe, dass es kein besonders guter Arbeitsplatz ist. Aber dank etwas Geld von der Stadt wurde die Straße letzten Sommer erneuert, sodass es jetzt einen schönen großen Gehweg, viel Gras auf den Mittelstreifen und an den Straßenrändern gibt, und die Gegend ist jetzt etwas schöner. Aber das Wohngebäude, in dem ich lebe, ist von Bäumen umgeben. Sie haben einige davon gefällt, sodass ein paar Stümpfe übrig sind, aber es gibt viel mehr Bäume dort, wo ich lebe, als die Straße hinunter. Hinter meinem Wohnkomplex ist eine Baumreihe und dann eine weitere Reihe von Wohnungen. Ich lebe in der 42. Straße, aber direkt dahinter ist die 43. Straße, und die ist nicht so schön. Die Gehwege sind wirklich schlecht und zerfallen, und die meisten Gebäude darauf sehen heruntergekommen aus. Es gibt viele Bäume in dieser Straße, aber das ist wahrscheinlich, um das Aussehen der Gebäude zu verbergen. Die meisten Verbrechen in meiner Gegend haben in einem Wohnkomplex in dieser Straße stattgefunden, aber andererseits kann ich nicht nur ihnen die Schuld geben. Es gibt auch Wohnungen auf der anderen Straßenseite, die viel Kriminalität und eine ziemlich flüchtige Bevölkerung haben. Aber ich denke, ich mag es, wo ich lebe. Ich kann es mir leisten und es gibt viele nützliche Annehmlichkeiten in der Nähe.

The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I.

Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC.

Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own.

I would also bring some sticks from the home depot and practice my balance, and bring my wooden bokken sword if I could. I enjoy doing what I love. There's also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven't played tennis or basketball in a long time. It's still nice to have them in case I want to pick it up again. My dad raised my best friend and me on tennis with Mr. Graves, and we always had a great time. They worked us hard, but we always had fun. I guess I've had a lot of fun in this neighborhood, and there are plenty of stories, but these are the ones that stand out to me. I believe the best is yet to come!",

    "original": "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",

It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",

When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions.

If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now.

What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit.

    "original": "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park.

    "raw_output": "Zuerst, hier ist die Übersetzung ins Deutsche:\n\nWenn man mich bittet, meine Nachbarschaft zu beschreiben, bin ich mir sicher, dass meine Antwort etwas einzigartig ist. Während andere, die darauf antworten, höchstwahrscheinlich Hausbesitzer mit ihrem eigenen individuellen Leben sind, ist meine Situation ein bisschen anders. Ich betrachte meine Nachbarschaft als den College-Campus, auf dem ich wohne, und die Menschen, die in meinem Wohnheim leben, als meine Gemeinschaft. Auch die Umgebung des Campus betrachte ich als meine Nachbarschaft, wenn auch in geringerem Maße. Trotz dieser Besonderheit teilt meine Nachbarschaft einige Gemeinsamkeiten mit den konventionelleren Vorstellungen von einer Nachbarschaft. Genau wie jede konventionelle Nachbarschaft hat auch die Nachbarschaft, in der ich lebe, Häuser, Menschen, Geschäfte und Parks. Beginnen wir mit der Diskussion über die \"Häuser\", die meine Nachbarschaft ausmachen. Bevor ich beginne, die Häuser in meiner Nachbarschaft zu erkunden, wäre es am besten, die Arten von Häusern zu klären, die in meiner Nachbarschaft zu finden sind. In meiner unmittelbaren Umgebung gibt es drei Arten von Wohnmöglichkeiten: die Apartments, die tatsächlichen Häuser und die Wohnheimhäuser. Erstens gibt es in den Apartments normalerweise zwischen 2-4 Personen in einem Raum, und es gibt etwa 4-6 Zimmer auf jeder Etage. Der häufigste Gebäudetyp kann etwa 2 Etagen beherbergen, sodass durchschnittlich etwa 20 Personen in jedem Gebäude leben. Zweitens sind da die tatsächlichen Häuser, die für jeden mit einer Verbindung zur Schule zu mieten sind. Typischerweise sind dies 2-4 Schlafzimmer, in denen normalerweise Alumni wohnen. Es gibt jedoch nur eine Handvoll dieser Art von Häusern, die über die Nachbarschaft verteilt sind, da sie weniger effizient sind. Schließlich gibt es die typischen Wohnheimzimmer, in denen Hunderte von Studenten wohnen. In diesen teilen sich zwei Personen ein Zimmer mit einigen Ausnahmen, und es ist die häufigste Wohnform in meiner Nachbarschaft. Da die Wohnmöglichkeiten abgedeckt sind, sind wir bereit, zu den Menschen überzugehen. Meine Schule ist stolz auf ihre Vielfalt, was sich in der Zusammensetzung meiner Nachbarschaft widerspiegelt. Es gibt Menschen aus allen Kulturen und Altersgruppen, die in meiner Nachbarschaft leben. Die meisten der professionellen Mitarbeiter wohnen in den Häusern, die in der Nachbarschaft platziert sind, während die neuen Studenten in den Wohnheimen wohnen und die älteren Studenten in den Apartment-Wohnungen. Den Menschen in dieser Nachbarschaft kann man nicht gerecht werden, indem man einfach über sie spricht, daher wäre es am besten, einfach zu den Geschäften und Parks in meiner Nachbarschaft überzugehen. Da meine Schule wirklich ihre eigene abgeschlossene Nachbarschaft ist, gibt es eine Vielzahl von Geschäften und einen einzigen Park. Die Geschäfte sind eine Mischung aus Essensmöglichkeiten, die man in jeder anderen Nachbarschaft finden würde, und die einzigartige Marke von Kleidung und Lebensmittelläden der Schule. Daher kann alles, was benötigt wird, innerhalb der Grenzen meiner Nachbarschaft gefunden werden! Zusätzlich ist der Park in meiner Nachbarschaft ein Spielplatz für all die vielfältigen Menschen in meiner Nachbarschaft, er wird von allen Mitgliedern meiner Nachbarschaft sauber und frei von Verbrechen gehalten!\n\nNun zurück ins Englische:\n\n[REWRITE]  \nWhen I'm asked to describe my neighborhood, I believe my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is slightly different. I consider the college campus I reside on as my neighborhood, and the people in my dormitory as my community. I also view the surrounding campus as part of my neighborhood, though to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some similarities with more conventional ideas of a neighborhood. Just like any traditional neighborhood, the one I live in has houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start by discussing the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. Before exploring the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of housing available. There are three types of housing in my immediate area: the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, in the apartments, there are usually 2-4 people per room, with about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type has about 2 floors, so on average, around 20 people live in each building. Second, there are the actual houses available for anyone affiliated with the school to rent. Typically, these are 2-4 bedroom setups usually inhabited by alumni. However, there are only a few of these houses spread around the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Lastly, there are the typical dorm rooms which house hundreds of students. In these, two people share a room with some exceptions, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered, we can move on to the people. My school prides itself on its diversity, which is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages living here. Most professional staff live in the neighborhood houses, while new students stay in dormitory housing and older students in apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be fully captured by simply talking about them, so it's best to move on to the stores and parks. Since my school is really its own self-contained neighborhood, it has a variety of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options you'd find in any other neighborhood, along with the school's unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. Thus, anything needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood serves as a playground for all the diverse people living here, and it is kept clean and crime-free by all the members of my neighborhood!  \n[/REWRITE]",

There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",

Die Leute nennen es den \"Workout-Hügel\", weil so viele Jogger gerne während ihres täglichen Trainings hinauflaufen. Da es auf meiner Straße überhaupt keine Gehwege gibt, gehen alle auf der Straße. Die Straße ist an einigen Stellen löchrig und kann etwas gefährlich zu befahren sein. Einige der Telefon- und Stromleitungen, die um den Block gespannt sind, sehen zerfetzt aus. Es regnet und stürmt viel in unserer Gegend, daher schlagen oft Äste und andere Trümmer auf die Stromleitungen ein, und die ständigen Reparaturen lassen sie kariert und flickenartig aussehen. Es gibt viele hohe immergrüne Bäume überall, wohin man schaut. Aber die Leute hier hassen die Bäume. Sie bemühen sich, so viele wie möglich zu fällen, weil die Bäume den Blick auf den Ozean versperren. Deshalb sind viele der Häuser so hoch oben auf dem Hügel gebaut, mit riesigen verglasten zweiten Stockwerken, die eins nach dem anderen emporragen, um den Blick auf die Bucht zu genießen. Es ist wunderschön bei Sonnenuntergang, wenn das Wasser von unten beleuchtet zu sein scheint und der Himmel orange wird. Es ist jedoch öfter bewölkt, sodass man das meiste Sonnenlicht durch einen Dunst sieht. Die meisten Tage sind trüb und feucht. Moos wächst auf allem, was es kann: Dächer, Autos und Geländer. Ich habe mein Auto einmal einen Monat lang in meiner Einfahrt geparkt gelassen, und als ich es benutzen wollte, war es grün und pelzig mit Moos geworden. Es dauerte drei Stunden, um alles abzukratzen. Es gibt nicht viele Kinder in der Gegend, wo ich wohne, obwohl es nur ein paar Blocks entfernt eine Schule gibt. Die meisten Leute in meiner Nachbarschaft sind älter, viele von ihnen im Ruhestand. Statt Kinder haben die Leute Hunde. Es ist üblich, sie auf den Rasen der Leute sitzen zu sehen oder die Straße hinunter zu rennen. Wenn man eine Tür oder ein Fenster offen lässt, riskiert man, dass sie heimlich ins Haus schleichen. Ich fand einmal einen in meinem Wohnzimmer und musste ihn zur Haustür hinaus scheuchen. Kaninchen laufen wild in der Gegend herum. Einige von ihnen sind ziemlich groß, und die Gärtner hassen sie, weil sie die Wurzeln der Pflanzen ausgraben und in den Rasen der Leute graben. Meine Katzen lieben sie jedoch und haben die meisten von ihnen aus unserer Nachbarschaft gejagt. Wir haben auch die übliche Auswahl an Vögeln: kleine Spatzen und Kolibris, und gelegentlich schwingt sich ein Falke oder Adler vorbei, bis die Krähen der Nachbarschaft ihn verjagen. Es gibt keine Geschäfte in der Nähe, aber wenn man den Hügel hinunter zur Wasserfront wandert, gibt es ein paar Restaurants, die frische Meeresfrüchte servieren. Es gibt dort unten nicht viel Strand, aber die Felsen entlang der Küste sind lustig, ins Wasser zu werfen. Die Bucht selbst ist nicht sehr breit. Man kann das gegenüberliegende Ufer klar sehen, selbst an den meisten Tagen durch den Nebel hindurch.\n\n[REWRITE]There aren't many sidewalks where I live.

Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket.

Öffentliche Verkehrsmittel sind sehr zugänglich und eine der beliebtesten Fortbewegungsarten in New York City. Bensonhurst ist ein ziemlich urbanes Viertel, sodass Sie sich immer noch wie in New York City fühlen werden. Während Ihres Besuchs sollten Sie darauf vorbereitet sein, die verschiedenen asiatischen Geschäfte überall zu sehen. In den letzten zwei Jahrzehnten hat Bensonhurst einen Zustrom asiatischer Einwohner erhalten. Aus diesem Grund werden Sie beim Gehen mindestens in jedem Block ein von Asiaten geführtes Geschäft sehen. Am beliebtesten sind Supermärkte und Waschsalons. Zufälligerweise sind diese Geschäfte bei den Anwohnern sehr beliebt, da die Qualität der Lebensmittel in den Supermärkten hervorragend ist, die Preise viel günstiger sind und es schließlich sehr bequem ist. Gleich in meiner Nähe gibt es vier asiatische Supermärkte, die nur zwei Minuten zu Fuß voneinander entfernt sind. Dies erhöht die Bequemlichkeit des Lebensmitteleinkaufs. Ich sage nicht, dass Bensonhurst ausschließlich von asiatischen Einwohnern bewohnt wird. Es ist überall ziemlich vielfältig, mit Einwanderern und ihren erst- und zweitgeborenen amerikanischen Kindern hier. Die meisten großen und beliebten Geschäfte in der Umgebung sind in asiatischem Besitz. Zusätzlich zu diesen asiatisch geführten Geschäften gibt es auch einen kürzlich renovierten Park in der Nähe, der etwa zehn Basketballplätze, ein großes Feld für Fußball oder Baseball, vier Handballplätze, Schaukeln, einen Spielplatz für Kinder und sogar einen Brunnen hat, damit Kinder im Sommer mit Wasser spielen können. Da wir in New York City sind, sind die Parks natürlich sehr vielfältig. Sie werden hier alle Arten von Vielfalt sehen, die gut miteinander spielen und auskommen können. In diesem Viertel gibt es nicht viele große Firmengebäude. Die einzigen Gebäude, die Sie finden würden, sind solche für Genossenschaftswohnungen oder Eigentumswohnungen. Die Mehrheit der Wohnräume hier sind jedoch Zweifamilienhäuser. Die meisten Menschen sind ziemlich nett, aber sehr laut. Jeden Tag hören Sie Autos, die ihre Musik aufdrehen, während sie an Ihrem Haus vorbeifahren, oder ständig Gas geben, was Sie morgens wecken wird. Wenn Sie planen, nachts zu besuchen, sollten Sie auf der Hut sein. Dieses Viertel ist ziemlich sicher, aber Menschen sind unberechenbar. Sie könnten auf Leute treffen, die ohne Grund Ärger machen wollen, Bullies und Diebe. Ich selbst wurde in diesem Viertel in der Vergangenheit durch körperliche Angriffe gemobbt, aber das war vor vielen Jahren. Ein weiterer kürzlicher Vorfall betraf das Stehlen von Paketen. Obwohl eine häufige Sache, gibt es in diesem Viertel Paketdiebe. Nicht zuletzt, obwohl New York City eine Geldstrafe für Leute hat, die nicht den Kot ihrer Hunde wegräumen, halten sich die Leute hier nicht an die Regeln. Jeden Morgen sehen Sie mindestens einen Hundehaufen auf dem Weg zur U-Bahn-Station oder auf dem Weg zum Supermarkt. Mein größter Ärger ist Hundekot auf dem Boden, wohin ich in diesem Viertel gehe.

The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",

    "raw_output": "Die erste Sache, die man über Portland, Oregon verstehen muss, ist die Definition von \"seltsam\". Das inoffizielle Stadtslogan, auf der Rückseite eines Gebäudes, das als Pizzeria, Bar, Musiklokal, Stripclub dient und das Gesetz bei mindestens der Hälfte dieser Unternehmungen umgeht, lautet \"Keep Portland Weird\". Für einige ist dies ein leiser Ruf, sich an das Portland der 90er und frühen 2000er Jahre zu erinnern, ein Portland, das weniger bekannt und weniger teuer war und kreative und einzigartige Subkulturen hervorbrachte. Für andere ist es ein einladender Ruf – komm nach Portland, wo die Leute dich immer noch seltsam nennen werden, aber diesmal als Kompliment. Trotz des Zustroms wohlhabender Kalifornier und des ständigen Baus von Eigentumswohnungen, um diese Kalifornier unterzubringen, bleibt Portland seltsam. Seltsam bedeutet nicht immer akzeptierend, aber es bedeutet, Dinge zu akzeptieren, die normalerweise nicht akzeptiert werden. Seltsam bedeutet nicht, dass wir keine modernen Annehmlichkeiten und modernen Kämpfe haben. Wie der Rest des Landes kaufen wir die meisten unserer Dinge aus China. Es gibt Millionen von Arten, seltsam zu sein, nicht normal zu sein, aber Portland hat auch viel Normalität. Portland hat Yoga, Hipster und Geschäftsleute. Vielleicht bedeutet seltsam, dass wir all dies einfach weniger ernst nehmen. In meiner Nachbarschaft, wie in vielen Portlander Nachbarschaften, haben wir bunte Häuser, Hausgärten mit Blumen und Kräutern und Gemüse entlang der Straßen und im Sommer kostenlose Kisten. Kostenlose Kisten sind traditionell Pappkartons mit Gegenständen, die jemand loswerden möchte, sie können aber auch Plastiktüten oder -boxen sein. Sie enthalten etwas Magisches, einen Schatz, der für den vorbeigehenden Menschen überraschend oft perfekt ist. Kostenlose Kisten haben oft Kleidung und Bücher, aber sie können alles enthalten. Das magische Potenzial, durch ein Viertel im Südosten Portlands zu schlendern, ist das, worum es in Portland geht. Das heißt, worum es in Portland für mich geht, aber ich bin nur eine von tausenden seltsamen Varianten. Einige Menschen, mit denen ich zusammenlebe, würden niemals daran denken, ihre Kleidung aus einem Karton auf dem Bürgersteig auszuwählen. Diese Leute gehen zu Ziegenyoga (ja, Yoga mit echten lebenden Ziegen) oder zu Timbers-Spielen (der Fußballmannschaft der Stadt). Portland ist voller Menschen, die alle möglichen Dinge lieben. Portland ist voller Menschen, die unsere Träume verfolgen oder davon träumen, unsere Träume zu verfolgen, während sie zu viel Zeit in der Bar verbringen. Ja, Portland hat ein Drogenproblem. Drogenprobleme sind im Kern oft psychische Gesundheitsprobleme, und der ständige Regen über weite Teile des Jahres sowie die düsteren Wolken scheinen dazu beizutragen. Portland hat auch ein Obdachlosenproblem, mit dem niemand zu wissen scheint, was zu tun ist. Die obdachlose Bevölkerung wird von den sozialen Dienstleistungen, die Portland bietet, angezogen, die besser sind als in den meisten Teilen des Landes, aber unsere Dienste sind unzureichend, wie in allen Teilen des Landes. Die nicht-obdachlose Bevölkerung schwankt zwischen Fürsorge und Hass. In diesem Punkt sind wir überhaupt nicht seltsam.\n\n[REWRITE]The first thing to understand about Portland, Oregon, is the definition of \"weird.\" The unofficial city slogan, found on the back of a building that serves as a pizza place, bar, music venue, and strip club, while skirting legality in at least half of these ventures, is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some, this is a gentle reminder of the Portland of the 90s and early 2000s, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, fostering creative and unique subcultures.

No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",

Egal wie oft ich sie vergesse oder zu beschäftigt mit Arbeit und Leben bin, um sie zu bemerken, sie sind da, unverändert, unangefochten und unbeeindruckt von den Widrigkeiten des Lebens. An Tagen, an denen ich am meisten gestresst und angespannt bin, fordern sie, gesehen zu werden, und wenn ich mich ihnen zuwende, lassen sie mich meine ängstliche Seele ausruhen und geben mir die Kraft, weiterzumachen, Tag für Tag. Ich bin hierhergezogen, als ich mein Studium begann, und die Berge nördlich des Campus waren das, was mich zuerst faszinierte. Sicher, die Universität hat auch ihre atemberaubenden Sehenswürdigkeiten in Gebäuden, Teichen und Bäumen, die mir ans Herz gewachsen sind, aber die Berge sind es, die wirklich den Thron halten. Der Rest der Stadt ist auf seine Weise schön. Es gibt unzählige Cafés, die viele Stunden Koffein getriebenen Lernens beherbergt haben. Man kann ein wenig weiter zu Fuß gehen oder den Bus in die Innenstadt nehmen und wird von einem Hauch von Altertum umgeben durch die verblassten bunten Ziegelsteine, die Restaurants und Bürogebäude säumen. Hier zeigt diese scheinbar vorstädtische Stadt genauso viel Trubel und Lebhaftigkeit wie die benachbarte urbane Stadt. Doch das hält nicht viele Straßenblocks lang an, da man wieder in die ruhige Kleinstadt flüchten kann, indem man an der Bibliothek vorbeigeht. Diese Dichotomie von Atmosphären in solcher Nähe verleiht dieser Stadt wirklich einen wunderbaren Charme, als würde sie zur Erkundung einladen. Dadurch ist es leicht, viele geschätzte Erinnerungen zu schaffen, jede verbunden mit einem bestimmten Teil der Stadt. Sei es, mit Freunden nach einer durchgemachten Nacht an den rostigen Schaukeln im Park vorbeizulaufen oder durch die belebte Innenstadt zu rennen, um den Film im schicken Kino zu erwischen, für den die Universität Tickets bereitstellte. Leider ist es auch Heimat vieler harter Erinnerungen, wie es alle Orte im Leben sind. Die Teiche insbesondere können ein passender Ort für Nachdenken sowie nächtliche Heulsitzungen mitten in einer existenziellen Krise sein. Letzteres kenne ich besser. Während ich die Schildkröten, Enten und Insekten beobachtete, die ihr Leben leben, jede mit einem Beitrag oder einer Rolle, konnte ich nicht anders, als über meinen eigenen Sinn des Lebens nachzudenken, während ich versuchte, das Rätsel des Lebens zu entschlüsseln. Also ging ich am Teich vorbei, am Park und an den kleinen Häusern, die von der Vorstadt erzählen, bis ich eine Hauptstraße erreichte. Es war dann, dass die Sonne ihre strahlenden Strahlen auf die Palmen warf und den Himmel dabei malte, und als ich beim Sonnenaufgang nach oben blickte, bemerkte ich, dass ich nach Norden ging. Tatsächlich waren sie da, wie sie es immer gewesen waren. Die mächtigen, überragenden Berge streiften den dunstigen blauen und gelben Himmel mehr als jedes Gebäude am Horizont und riefen in mir, ohne Worte, meinen Sinn für Ausdauer wach.\n\n[REWRITE]The mountains are a constant presence.

Zumindest keine, in denen die meisten Menschen leben möchten. Aber wenn Sie hinter den alten, verlassenen Whole Foods gehen und hinter die Hotels spazieren, die abgesehen von ein paar Aufenthalten im Sommer für Familientreffen nur jährlich belegt sind, finden Sie eine ganze geschäftige Gemeinde. Innerhalb dieser Gemeinschaften, auf diesen Straßen, befinden sich einige Wohnanlagen – sorgfältig nebeneinander platziert wie russische Puppen, die sorgfältig auseinander genommen und nebeneinander entlang der Straße aufgereiht wurden, Stück für Stück. Die ersten Wohnungen, auf die Sie stoßen, sind solche, die wegen einiger ziemlich unschöner Geschäfte in den Nachrichten waren, daher konzentrieren wir uns nicht allzu sehr darauf – der Schein kann schließlich trügen. Aber die Wohnungen neben diesem Komplex und die beiden Komplexe daneben sind eine ganz andere Welt, von der fast niemand in dieser Gegend weiß. Gegenüber diesen Komplexen befindet sich der Satellitencampus eines Community Colleges – eine ruhige, verschlafene Gruppe von Gebäuden, die als Wächter neben der Straße stehen, wo Studenten mit Kaffee in der Hand hereintorkeln und um 7 Uhr morgens gähnen, um ihre verschlafenen Tage zu beginnen. Die Eisentore quietschen, um sie einzeln einzulassen, während Pendler ihre Fäuste aus dem Fenster schütteln und über sie stöhnen, weil sie an Tagen mit höherer Teilnahme den Verkehr aufhalten. Die Straße mündet in eine andere Wohnstraße, mit einem Park auf der einen Seite und einem Rehabilitationszentrum für Menschen, die sich unter unglücklichen Umständen Knochen gebrochen haben. Das Behandlungszentrum rühmt sich mit fröhlichem Verandamobiliar und einem faulen, sich kräuselnden Deckenventilator, der die warme, dichte Sommerluft hin und her wälzt. Kinder rennen im Gras im Park auf der anderen Straßenseite hin und her, machen Radschläge und drehen sich über die stacheligen grünen Halme, während Bienen faul in den Blumenbeeten an der Straße kreisen. Alte Rentner führen ihre Hunde auf dem Gehweg spazieren, runzeln die Stirn über die Teenager auf ihren Skateboards und nicken den Teenager-Mädchen, die sich bei den Spielgeräten versammeln und über Jungen und die neuesten YouTube-Stars klatschen, zurückhaltend zu. Es gibt ein Sushi-Restaurant in einem Einkaufszentrum neben dem Park, das günstiges Essen hat, aber nie wirklich beschäftigt zu sein scheint – ein Schwimmzubehörladen gleich daneben und ein Nagelstudio dazwischen. Sie könnten Ihren Pool für die Saison füllen, während Sie eine Maniküre bekommen und Hibachi-Huhn essen – die Schönheit eines Einkaufszentrums. Es gibt dort auch einen Frozen-Yogurt-Laden, eine dieser Selbstbedienungsarten, und man sieht oft die Teenager im Park mit kalten, schwitzenden Bechern voller Frozen Yogurt, die mit Belägen bedeckt sind, während sie auf ihren Skateboards Kunststücke machen und dampfen, weil sie glauben, dass es das Coolste ist. Das fragliche Viertel ist ein Stück Americana – ein Stück Geschichte im verschlafenen Süden, wo sich kaum etwas ändert, nicht einmal die Zeit.\n\n**Translation back to English:**\n\nYou might overlook it at first glance—after all, it's a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place where one would assume there are living spaces.

Across from these complexes is a community college's satellite campus—a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel by the road, where students shuffle in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 a.m. to start their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to let them in one by one while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days with higher attendance. The road connects to another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones under unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture and a lazily spinning ceiling fan that stirs the warm, thick summer air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, doing cartwheels and spinning over the prickly green blades while bees lazily circle the flower beds by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the path, frowning at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls gathered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi restaurant in a strip mall next to the park that offers inexpensive food but never seems too busy—a swimming supply store right next to it, and a nail salon in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken—all at once—the beauty of a strip mall. There's also a frozen yogurt place there, one of those self-serve kinds, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings as they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they think it's the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana—a piece of history in the sleepy South where hardly anything changes, not even time.",

This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can.

There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request.

Mein Haus hat einen kleinen Garten davor und eine kleine Auffahrt links vom Haus. Es erinnert, wie die meisten anderen, an eine Zeit nicht allzu lange her, in der das Leben in den Vororten der amerikanische Traum war. Dieser Traum schien einst die Menschen dieses Landes zu umarmen, aber jetzt zieht er sich zurück. Doch mein Viertel und viele andere bleiben bestehen, rufen uns und die Besucher immer noch dazu auf, dass der Traum noch lebt und wir ihn so gut wie möglich festhalten. Die Menschen fühlen sich nicht mehr so optimistisch wie früher, die Pflege der kleinen Gärten ist nicht mehr die gleiche, aber es gibt immer noch ein oder zwei Autos in jeder Auffahrt, und die Jugend spielt immer noch, als wäre die Welt um sie herum ihre ganze Existenz. Die öffentliche Schule, die hier seit fast 90 Jahren steht, existiert immer noch, scheint immer noch eine Zukunft in der heutigen Jugend zu beschwören, während sie bei den älteren Bewohnern Nostalgie weckt. Die Kirchen sind selten und meist leer, aber die Basketballplätze sind immer noch voll. Alle Häuser sehen unterschiedlich aus, fühlen sich aber gleich an. Es gibt einen großen Supermarkt namens Super „A“, der von einer großen jemenitischen Familie betrieben wird, die wahrscheinlich die einzige arabische Familie im Viertel ist. Die überwiegende Mehrheit der Bewohner ist afroamerikanisch. Die Straßen sind breit, und die Kinder spielen normalerweise Fußball, nur um den Autos das Durchfahren zu ermöglichen. Die meisten Menschen in meinem Viertel sind seit Generationen hier und die meisten können Geschichten aus einer Vergangenheit erzählen, in der jeder jeden kannte. Es gab eine Karateschule, aber als Hollywood aufhörte, Karate-Kid-Filme zu machen, hörten die Kinder auf, Karate-Kid sein zu wollen, also ist es jetzt eine Apotheke, denn Medikamente machen alles besser, oder so habe ich gehört. Es gibt auch ein kleines Kino, das alte Filme zu ermäßigten Preisen zeigt, verschont von den Massen durch die Abneigung der Jugend wegen des Mangels an neuen Veröffentlichungen, aber von den Älteren geschätzt, die es für einen kleinen Preis für einen Abend draußen halten, natürlich ohne die Kinder. Es gibt eine einzige Schnellstraße, die durch meine Stadt führt. Obwohl die Ausfahrt und der Eingang in der Stadt neben unserer liegen. Es gab einmal eine Petition, um eine Ausfahrt für unsere Stadt zu bekommen. Die Jugend unterstützte sie, während die Älteren sich weigerten. Es scheint, dass die Schnellstraße in unserer Stadt sie ruinieren würde, sagten die Ältesten, die schließlich den Stadtrat dazu brachten, den Antrag abzulehnen. Sie bauen eine neue Highschool, und wir versuchen, ein Maskottchen für unsere Stadt zu finden.

While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest.

In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city.

There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building.

Wohngebiete sind scheinbar zufällig zwischen Gewerbegebieten verstreut, in denen eine Vielzahl von Geschäften betrieben wird. Einige dieser Geschäfte bestehen aus Büros, während andere verschiedene Geschäfte, Restaurants und Unterhaltungsmöglichkeiten sind. Es mangelt nicht an neuen Restaurants, in denen man essen kann, oder Geschäften, in denen man einkaufen kann. Während einige Läden große, bekannte Marken sind, die großen Konzernen gehören, werden auch kleine Boutiquen zunehmend beliebt. Sie befinden sich nicht nur in verschiedenen Einkaufszentren, sondern säumen auch die Straßen, die oft in fußläufiger Entfernung zu Wohngebieten liegen, die ansonsten ruhig und friedlich wären, wenn sie nicht von so vielen Sehenswürdigkeiten umgeben wären. Es gibt auch ein paar nahegelegene Parks, und ich habe bemerkt, dass Menschen diese Parks häufig mit ihren kleinen Kindern besuchen. Apropos Menschen, es gibt tatsächlich ziemlich viel Vielfalt in meinem Viertel. An einem kleinen Ort gibt es eine prominente LGBTQ+-Gemeinschaft, eine orthodoxe jüdische Gemeinschaft und eine Sammlung von Flüchtlingen und Einwanderern aus der ehemaligen Sowjetunion. Etwas weiter außerhalb meines Viertels gibt es viele weitere Menschen verschiedener Rassen und Herkunft, obwohl sie manchmal in ihrer eigenen kleinen Gemeinschaft innerhalb der Stadt aufgeteilt sind. Wir haben Orte, die als Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia und viele mehr bekannt sind, die nur ein paar Meilen entfernt sind. Allerdings kann sich eine Strecke von nur wenigen Meilen als sehr lange Fahrt erweisen. Das Fahren einer Entfernung von nur 10 Meilen kann manchmal aufgrund des Verkehrs, insbesondere während der Hauptverkehrszeiten, zwei Stunden dauern. Kaum jemand in meiner Stadt geht irgendwo zu Fuß, obwohl bestimmte interessante Orte unvermeidlich in der Nähe sind. Die Stadt ist riesig, und die Menschen ziehen es im Allgemeinen nicht vor, zu Fuß zu pendeln. Infolgedessen haben wir auch einige der schlimmsten Verkehrsstaus der Welt, und es kann schwierig sein, überall Parkplätze zu finden. Ironischerweise hat es in den letzten Jahren eine große Menge an Bauarbeiten gegeben, da große Wohngebäude in der Stadt hinzukommen. Es scheint ein beliebtes Ziel zu sein, aber viele Einwohner sind enttäuscht von der Aussicht, dass noch mehr Menschen einziehen und noch mehr Fahrzeuge auf den Straßen unterwegs sind. Es gibt jedoch viele verschiedene Arten von Häusern in meiner Stadt. Nicht jeder lebt oder möchte in einem großen Wohngebäude leben. Wohngebiete bestehen aus Häusern unterschiedlicher Größe sowie kleineren Wohngebäuden und Eigentumswohnungen. Einige Grundstücke enthalten Einfamilienhäuser, während andere Doppelhaushälften enthalten. Dies gilt sogar für mein unmittelbares Viertel, sodass es auch an Wohnmöglichkeiten keine Vielfalt mangelt. Ähnlich besteht das Viertel aus Menschen unterschiedlichen Alters, und um ehrlich zu sein, kenne ich die meisten meiner Nachbarn nicht. Heutzutage ist es nicht wirklich eine eng verbundene Gemeinschaft, obwohl ich viele Erinnerungen aus meiner Kindheit habe, in denen ich mit meinem Nachbarn von nebenan und ein paar anderen Freunden aus der Nachbarschaft, die alle in meinem Alter waren, draußen gespielt habe.\n\nBack to English:\nSince I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse.

    "original": "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",

Sie kam aus einer Stadt, in der das Lebensmittelgeschäft nur fünf Minuten zu Fuß von ihrem Haus entfernt war—sie hatte noch nie in ihrem Leben so viel offenen Raum gesehen. Überwältigt von der Allgegenwart der Maisfelder, erzählte ich ihr, wie es war, in ländlichen Ohio aufzuwachsen, und in diesem Moment verstand sie endlich, wer ich war und woher ich kam. Wenn man eine zweispurige Landstraße hinunterfährt, erreicht man einen Steinbruch, der mit Wasser gefüllt ist. Gleich dahinter liegt die kleine Siedlung, in der ich wohne. Die Häuser bestehen meist aus Backstein und Stuck. Alle Häuser haben mindestens einen halben Hektar Land, das jeder stolz pflegt. Im Frühling gibt es reichlich jährlich gepflanzte Blumen sowie die Bäume des Mittleren Westens, die sich mit jeder Jahreszeit verändern. Die Auffahrten sind alle mit den luxuriösesten Mercedes-Benz-Autos gefüllt, die nach einer guten, altmodischen Autowäsche in der Mittagssonne glänzen. Wenn man die Straße zu meinem grauen Stuckhaus weiterfährt, ist mein koreanischer Nachbar immer draußen mit einem freundlichen Gesicht. Er verbringt den ganzen Tag damit, seinen Rasen zu mähen, und man kann ihn über das Summen seines Mähers singen hören. Jeder in der Nachbarschaft bekommt einen Lacher von ihm, aber er ist immer aufrichtig und eine erstaunliche Person mit einer einzigartigen Geschichte. Er ist älter geworden und hat mit dem Alter etwas von seinem Witz verloren. Früher war er Arzt und verschmilzt normalerweise mit dem Gras und seinem John Deere Zero Turn Mäher. Schließlich erreicht man mein Zuhause. Im Seitenhof sind Gänse zahlreich und werden von unserem Terrier gejagt. Hinten gibt es einen kleinen Bach, der in den Steinbruch mündet. Hier kann man Bullfrösche, den Bach und das gelegentliche \"Muh\" von den nahegelegenen Bauernhöfen hören. Über die handgefertigte Holzbrücke hinweg befindet sich eine unberührte Oase, die mit natürlich wachsenden Bäumen, Kräutern und Wildblumen gefüllt ist. Hier verbrachte ich die meiste Zeit meiner Kindheit. Vom Bau von Baumhäusern bis zum 'Jagen' von Tieren (was meist aus dem Hinterherjagen bestand), gab es immer etwas zu tun und oft ein Nachbarskind für Freundschaft. Die Winter in meiner kleinen Stadt können schmerzlich brutal sein, und dennoch gibt es nichts Schöneres. Der Garten verwandelt sich von einem grünen Meer in eine leere Wildnis. Die Bäume, die einst lebhafte pinke, lila und orangefarbene Blumen beherbergten, werden zu kahlen Skeletten aus Rinde. Wenn man mit dem gelegentlichen Schneefall gesegnet ist, erscheint über Nacht ein Winterwunderland. Der Hinterhof ist gesäumt von Schneefiguren, die meine kleine Schwester gemacht hat, und Schneemännern. Meine Schwester und ich stritten oft als Kinder, und im Winter waren Schneebälle unsere bevorzugte Waffe. Wir bauten massive igluartige Festungen, um unsere Waffen zu lagern, meist mit Ästen, wie ein Arsenal. In unserem kleinen Wunderland spielten wir Rollenspiele in einer Zeit, in der nichts anderes zählte. Wir waren einfach junge Kinder ohne Sorgen in der Welt.\n\n[REWRITE]  \n\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past the cornfields stretching across the horizon. \"This is it!\" I replied, aware that she would be surprised by the openness of the landscape.

In the past, he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Finally, you reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and chased by our Terrier. Out back, there's a small stream feeding into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional \"moo\" from nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge lies an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to 'hunting' animals (mostly chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child to befriend. The winters in my small town can be brutally harsh, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once held vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into bare skeletons of bark. When blessed with occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I often fought as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We would build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time when nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.  \n[/REWRITE]",
    "transformed": "\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past the cornfields stretching across the horizon. \"This is it!\" I replied, aware that she would be surprised by the openness of the landscape. She was from a town where the grocery store was just a five-minute walk from her home—she had never seen so much open space in her life. Taken aback by the omnipresence of cornfields, I shared with her what it was like growing up in rural Ohio, and at that moment, she finally understood who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you reach a quarry filled with water. Just beyond it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly made of brick and stucco. Each house has at least half an acre of land, which everyone takes pride in maintaining. In spring, there are plenty of annually planted flowers, along with Midwestern trees that change with each season. The driveways are filled with top-tier Mercedes-Benz luxury cars that gleam in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. As you continue down the road toward my gray stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face.
