    "original": "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",

For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails.

Fast jede Wohnung in der Gegend kostete über tausend Dollar im Monat. Ich hatte nie etwas über diese Geschichte gehört, und auch keiner meiner Freunde. Vielleicht liegt es an den Schwierigkeiten. Ich kenne ein paar meiner Freunde, die nachts weinend einschlafen. Die Dinge sind teuer, aber im Laufe der Jahre haben wir gelernt, sparsam zu sein. Man beginnt den staubigen Geruch von Flohmarktspielzeug und mottenkugeliger Kleidung zu mögen. Im Erwachsenenalter riecht man viel weniger. Vielleicht fängt man an zu rauchen, oder man gewöhnt sich einfach an den Zustand der Dinge. Aber der Flohmarkt macht sich immer bemerkbar. Der Geruch des Erwachsenseins sind staubige Zeitschriften, die auf einem geschlossenen Klavier gestapelt sind. Er klemmt sich in das Leder und bleibt selbst nach dem Waschen. Hier gibt es drei Secondhand-Läden in Gehweite. Wenn man auf der anderen Seite beginnt, kann man zwei karitative Secondhand-Läden, eine Bibliothek, einen seltenen Buchladen und einen Kuriositätenladen besuchen. Die Innenstadt ist dicht, Autos und Menschen füllen jeden Morgen die Straßen, aber in den Secondhand-Läden hört man davon nichts. Egal, wie viele Menschen oder Autos vorbeigehen, im Laden herrscht Stille. Es ist ein schöner Ort, um einen Nachmittag zu verlieren. Jedes Jahr werden es mehr. Autos und Menschen überfluten es. Es ist eine wachsende Stadt, sagen sie. Als Hauptsitz eines der größten Online-Imperien für E-Commerce und Lieferung zeigt sie immer noch Wachstumsschmerzen. Es erinnert mich an New York. Alles und jeder ist auf seine eigenen Ziele fokussiert, und es gibt nicht viel, was jemand von einem verlangt. Man kann allein, leise und unabhängig sein, und die Leute lassen einen in Ruhe. Es ist nicht wie im Süden, wo ein wenig Besorgnis bedeutet, dass man sich kümmert. Hier dringt man nicht wirklich in das Leben anderer ein. Man kann seine Schale so lange aufrechterhalten, wie man möchte, und die Stadt wird wie Wellen am Strand zurückrollen. Es ist ein lebhafter Ort. Zwischen dem Pianisten nebenan und den beiden Amateur-Sängern oben ist immer etwas los. In gewisser Weise haben wir weniger eine Wohnung voller Fremder und mehr eine Gemeinschaft von Freunden. Wir kommen für unsere Bedürfnisse zusammen, feiern Geburtstage, trauern bei Beerdigungen und helfen uns gegenseitig, wenn wir können. In gewisser Weise habe ich Glück, hier zu sein. Ich mag die meisten meiner Nachbarn sehr und sie behandeln mich ziemlich gut. Ich achte darauf, nach mir sauber zu machen und ihnen Essen zu hinterlassen, und sie tun dasselbe. Ich bringe ihnen Post und sie mir. Es ist schön, sie zu sehen, und ich glaube, sie genießen meine Anwesenheit genauso wie ich ihre.

My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",

I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",

Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it.

I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food.

    "original": "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",

Es gibt hauptsächlich Wohnhäuser, aber auch einige Restaurants und Bars, die Spaß machen und nicht zu teuer sind. Eine der Bars wurde kürzlich umbenannt und ist teurer, aber die Qualität des Service oder der Getränke dort ist nicht wirklich schlecht. Die meisten Leute sind nett. Sie sind entweder Studenten oder haben ein geringes Einkommen, da die Wohnungen nicht sehr teuer sind. In der Nähe gibt es viele Kinder, da eine Grundschule in fußläufiger Entfernung zu meiner Wohnung liegt. Ich kenne meine Nachbarn nicht, aber möchte das auch nicht wirklich. Sie rauchen viel Gras und deshalb hat die Verwaltung meines Gebäudes ein Lufterfrischergerät direkt gegenüber ihrer Tür angebracht, was mein Freund und ich sehr lustig fanden. Es ist fast beleidigend. Die Gebäude um mich herum sehen meist ziemlich alt aus, haben aber vielleicht renovierte Innenräume. Ein Stück die Straße hinunter gibt es brandneue Wohnungen, aber ich mag sie nicht, weil ich weiß, dass die Bauarbeiten nicht besonders gut waren. Sie sind billig gebaut, aber die Miete ist teuer, was ich für einen Betrug halte, aber da sie in der Nähe des Campus liegen, können sich die Verwalter dieser Gebäude das erlauben. Es gibt ein wirklich günstiges Restaurant etwa fünf Minuten von meinem Wohnort entfernt, das Essen nur auf Papptellern serviert und die meisten Gerichte in der Mikrowelle zubereitet. Gegenüber befindet sich eine Tankstelle, von der ich gehört habe, dass sie kein besonders guter Arbeitsplatz ist. Aber dank einiger Gelder der Stadt wurde die Straße letzten Sommer neu gemacht, sodass es jetzt einen schönen großen Gehweg gibt, viel Gras auf den Mittelstreifen und Seiten der Straßen und die Gegend ist jetzt etwas schöner. Aber mein Wohnhaus ist von Bäumen umgeben. Sie haben einige davon gefällt, sodass es ein paar Baumstümpfe gibt, aber es gibt viel mehr Bäume, wo ich wohne, als die Straße hinunter. Hinter meinem Wohnkomplex ist eine Baumreihe und dann eine weitere Wohnanlage. Ich wohne in der 42. Straße, aber direkt dahinter ist die 43. Straße und die ist nicht so schön. Die Gehwege sind wirklich schlecht und zerfallen, und die meisten Gebäude darauf sehen schäbig aus. Es gibt viele Bäume in dieser Straße, aber das ist wahrscheinlich, um zu verbergen, wie die Gebäude aussehen. Die meisten Verbrechen in meiner Gegend sind in einer Wohnanlage auf dieser Straße passiert, aber andererseits kann ich nicht nur ihnen die Schuld geben. Es gibt Wohnungen gegenüber von mir, die auch viel Kriminalität und eine ziemlich wechselhafte Bevölkerung haben. Aber ich denke, ich mag, wo ich wohne. Ich kann es mir leisten, und es gibt viele nützliche Einrichtungen in der Nähe. Besonders gefällt mir, wie die Universität in fußläufiger Entfernung liegt und es zwei Bushaltestellen gibt, sodass ich leicht zum Laden und in die Innenstadt gelangen kann.\n\n[REWRITE]  \nMy neighborhood is close to the college I attend, and for that reason, I really enjoy living there. There are mainly apartment buildings, but also some restaurants and bars that are fun to visit and not too expensive. One of the bars was recently renamed and is more expensive, but the quality of service or drinks there isn't really bad. Most of the people are nice. They are either students or have a low income, since the apartments aren't very expensive. There are many children nearby because there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don't know my neighbors, but I don't really want to. They smoke a lot of weed, so the management of my building placed an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very amusing. It's almost insulting. The buildings around me usually look quite old, but might have renovated interiors. A bit down the street, there are brand new apartments, but I don't like them because I know the construction wasn't particularly good. They're cheaply built, but the rent is high, which I think is a scam, but since they're near the campus, the building management can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and mostly microwaves their dishes. Across from that is a gas station, which I've heard isn't a very good place to work. However, thanks to some city funds, the road was redone last summer, so now there's a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and the area is now a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is surrounded by trees. They cut some of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are many more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street, but right behind is 43rd Street, and that one isn't as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that's probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can't blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there are plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can easily get to the store and downtown.  \n[/REWRITE]",

The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain.

I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte.

I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do.

Ich zog von Riverdale nach Stockbridge, und ich will nicht lügen, ich weinte, weil ich sie vermisste und ich liebte sie. Aber meine Mutter und mein Vater wollten das Beste für mich und meine kleine Schwester, also zogen wir an einen besseren Ort mit besserem Wohnraum und einer besseren High School. Alles wurde als \"nicht Ghetto\" angesehen, als wir in unser neues Viertel zogen. Im Laufe der Jahre gewöhnte ich mich daran, fand neue Freunde und auch einige neue Feinde in der Schule. Ich habe meine Nachbarn nie wirklich kennengelernt, außer Mr. Glen und seine Kinder sowie Dennis, die direkt neben uns waren. Sie waren angenehme Leute, die ich fast als Familie betrachten kann, und ich schätze sie wirklich. Ich erinnere mich, als ich, Mama, Papa und meine Schwester zu Mr. Glens Hochzeit gingen (sie heirateten erneut). Es hat wirklich Spaß gemacht und war sehr angenehm, um es gelinde zu sagen, und etwas, auf das ich mich eines Tages freue, während ich mein Vermögen aufbaue und meiner zukünftigen Frau das Leben einer Königin gebe. Als Mr. Glens Frau, Frau Veda, das weiße kleine Band an ihrem Bein abnahm und warf, habe ich es gefangen! Leider habe ich die Blumen nicht gefangen! Wir tanzten die ganze Nacht und ich genoss es wirklich, eine gute Zeit mit Marsharii, einer ihrer Töchter, zu haben. Ich habe sie seitdem nicht mehr gesehen. Ich hoffe, sie ist zu größeren und besseren Dingen übergegangen. Das Viertel selbst ist wie ein Labyrinth, obwohl ich jetzt ein GPS habe, sodass ich mehr Zeit habe, es zu erkunden. Ich bin bisher nur so weit gegangen, als ich mit meinen Freunden Kason und Curtis unterwegs war. Wir haben früher viel Videospiele gespielt und das Leben so gut wie möglich genossen. Manchmal ging ich in den Park und genoss die Natur, die meine Seele beruhigt. Es gibt mir heutzutage ein Gefühl von Ruhe und Frieden. Ich bringe auch einige Stöcke mit, die ich im Baumarkt gekauft habe, und übe einfach mein Gleichgewicht und bringe, wenn ich kann, mein Bokken-Holzschwert mit. Ich habe Spaß daran, das zu tun, was ich liebe. Es gibt auch einen Basketball- und Tennisplatz, obwohl ich schon lange kein Tennis oder Basketball mehr gespielt habe. Es ist trotzdem schön, ihn zu haben, falls ich es jemals wieder aufgreifen und erneut versuchen möchte. Mein Vater hat mich und meinen besten Freund mit Mr. Graves im Tennis aufwachsen lassen, und wir hatten immer eine großartige Zeit. Sie haben uns hart arbeiten lassen! Aber wir hatten immer Spaß. Ich schätze, es gibt viele Zeiten, in denen ich in diesem Viertel Spaß hatte, und es gibt viele Geschichten, aber diese sind es, die mir wirklich aufgefallen sind, und ich glaube, dass das Beste noch kommen wird!\n\n[REWRITE]Since I've been here for about 10 years, I think I can share what I know.

    "original": "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",

They offer various services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's office and a veterinary practice are located away from the town's center; they are small but well-equipped to assist Johnston's residents. There is one elementary school, Johnston Elementary School. After completing fifth grade, students must attend middle and high school in the next town. Technically, there are no parks in the town, but they are currently developing a 2.5-acre recreational area to provide families with more opportunities for outings and to attract more visitors and potential residents. Admittedly, there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, hangout spots, children's playgrounds, pet walking areas, or a wide variety of restaurants.

It may not stand out from others in South Carolina, but it has a significant impact on agriculture. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, a fact the town proudly displays on its welcome sign. The area is mainly composed of farmland, dominated by peach orchards or cattle pastures. Houses outside the main town area are spaced widely apart; most are two-story buildings with metal roofs to combat the intense summer heat or gray shingles. Often, these homes are set back from the road, allowing the front fields to be used for livestock or crops. In the heart of the town, there's a single traffic light at a four-way intersection.

It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",

When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit.

    "original": "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",

Während andere, die darauf antworten, höchstwahrscheinlich Hauseigentümer mit ihrem eigenen Leben sind, ist meine Situation etwas anders. Ich betrachte meine Nachbarschaft als den College-Campus, auf dem ich wohne, und die Leute, die in meinem Wohnheim leben, als meine Gemeinschaft. Ich betrachte auch den umliegenden Campus als meine Nachbarschaft, wenn auch in geringerem Maße. Trotz dieser Besonderheit teilt meine Nachbarschaft einige Gemeinsamkeiten mit den konventionelleren Vorstellungen von einer Nachbarschaft. Genau wie in einer konventionellen Nachbarschaft gibt es in meiner Nachbarschaft Häuser, Menschen, Geschäfte und Parks. Lassen Sie uns damit beginnen, die \"Häuser\" zu besprechen, die meine Nachbarschaft ausmachen. Bevor ich beginne, die Häuser in meiner Nachbarschaft zu erkunden, wäre es am besten, die Arten von Häusern zu klären, die in meiner Nachbarschaft zu finden sind. In meiner unmittelbaren Umgebung gibt es drei Arten von Wohnraum: die Wohnungen, die eigentlichen Häuser und die Wohnheime. Erstens, in den Wohnungen sind in der Regel 2-4 Personen in einem Zimmer untergebracht, und es gibt etwa 4-6 Zimmer auf jeder Etage. Der häufigste Gebäudetyp hat etwa 2 Etagen, sodass im Durchschnitt etwa 20 Personen in jedem Gebäude leben. Zweitens gibt es die eigentlichen Häuser, die für jeden mit einer Verbindung zur Schule zur Miete zur Verfügung stehen. Typischerweise sind dies 2-4 Schlafzimmer-Einrichtungen, in denen normalerweise Alumni leben. Es gibt jedoch nur eine Handvoll dieser Art von Häusern in der Nachbarschaft verteilt, da sie weniger effizient sind. Schließlich gibt es die typischen Wohnheime, die Hunderte von Studenten beherbergen. In diesen teilen sich zwei Personen ein Zimmer, mit einigen Ausnahmen, und es ist die häufigste Art von Unterkunft in meiner Nachbarschaft. Mit dem Wohnen abgedeckt, sind wir bereit, zu den Menschen überzugehen. Meine Schule ist stolz auf ihre Vielfalt, was sich in der Zusammensetzung meiner Nachbarschaft widerspiegelt. Es gibt Menschen aus allen Kulturen und Altersgruppen, die in meiner Nachbarschaft leben. Die meisten professionellen Mitarbeiter wohnen in den Häusern, die in der Nachbarschaft platziert sind, während die neuen Studenten im Wohnheimstil wohnen und die älteren Studenten im Apartmentstil. Die Menschen in dieser Nachbarschaft können nicht einfach nur durch Worte gerecht beschrieben werden, daher wäre es am besten, einfach zu den Geschäften und Parks in meiner Nachbarschaft überzugehen. Da meine Schule wirklich eine eigene abgeschlossene Nachbarschaft ist, hat sie eine Fülle von Geschäften und einen einzigen Park. Die Geschäfte sind eine Mischung aus Speiseoptionen, die in jeder anderen Nachbarschaft zu finden wären, und der eigenen einzigartigen Marke von Kleidung und Lebensmittelläden der Schule. Daher kann alles, was benötigt wird, innerhalb der Grenzen meiner Nachbarschaft gefunden werden! Zusätzlich ist der Park in meiner Nachbarschaft ein Spielplatz für all die unterschiedlichen Menschen in meiner Nachbarschaft, er wird von allen Mitgliedern meiner Nachbarschaft sauber und frei von Verbrechen gehalten!\n\nJetzt übersetzen wir den Text zurück ins Englische:\n\n[REWRITE]  \nWhen I'm asked to describe my neighborhood, I believe my answer is somewhat unique.

Just like any traditional neighborhood, the area I live in has houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start by discussing the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. Before exploring the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of houses that can be found. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity: the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory buildings. First, in the apartments, there are usually 2-4 people in a room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type has about 2 floors, so on average, there are around 20 people living in each building. Second, there are the actual houses available for anyone affiliated with the school to rent. Typically, these are 2-4 bedroom setups where alumni usually live. However, there are only a few of these types of houses scattered throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorms that house hundreds of students. In these, two people share a room, with some exceptions, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered, we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity, which is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages living in my neighborhood. Most professional staff live in the houses located in the neighborhood, while newer students stay in dormitory-style housing and older students reside in apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be justly described only in words, so it would be best to move on to the stores and parks. Since my school is truly its own self-contained neighborhood, it boasts a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options found in any other neighborhood and the school's unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, everything needed can be found within the boundaries of my neighborhood! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people, kept clean and crime-free by all members of my neighborhood!  \n[/REWRITE]",

There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean.

Die Leute nennen ihn den \"Workout-Hügel\", weil so viele Jogger ihn während ihres täglichen Trainings hinauflaufen möchten. Da es auf meiner Straße überhaupt keine Gehwege gibt, gehen alle auf der Straße. Die Straße ist an einigen Stellen mit Schlaglöchern versehen und kann beim Fahren etwas gefährlich wirken. Einige der Telefon- und Stromleitungen, die um den Block gespannt sind, sehen zerschlissen aus. Es regnet und stürmt viel in unserer Gegend, deshalb schlagen Äste und andere Trümmer oft auf die Stromleitungen und die ständigen Reparaturen lassen sie schachbrettartig und flickenhaft aussehen. Überall, wo man hinschaut, stehen viele hohe immergrüne Bäume. Aber die Leute hier hassen die Bäume. Sie bemühen sich, so viele wie möglich zu fällen, weil die Bäume den Blick auf den Ozean versperren. Deshalb sind viele der Häuser so hoch oben am Hügel gebaut, mit riesigen verglasten zweiten Stockwerken, die eines nach dem anderen aufragen, um den Blick auf die Bucht zu genießen. Es ist wunderschön bei Sonnenuntergang, wenn das Wasser von unten beleuchtet zu sein scheint und der Himmel orange wird. Meistens ist es jedoch bewölkt, sodass man das meiste Sonnenlicht durch einen Schleier sieht. Die meisten Tage sind bedeckt und feucht. Moos wächst auf allem, worauf es kann: Dächern, Autos und Geländern. Ich habe einmal mein Auto einen Monat lang in meiner Einfahrt geparkt gelassen und als ich es benutzen wollte, war es grün und pelzig mit Moos geworden. Es hat mich drei Stunden gekostet, alles abzukratzen. Es gibt nicht viele Kinder in meiner Nähe, obwohl es nur ein paar Blocks entfernt eine Schule gibt. Die meisten Menschen in meiner Nachbarschaft sind älter, viele von ihnen im Ruhestand. Anstelle von Kindern haben die Leute Hunde. Es ist üblich, sie auf den Rasenflächen der Leute sitzen zu sehen oder die Straße hinunter zu rennen. Wenn man eine Tür oder ein Fenster offen lässt, riskiert man, dass sie in das Haus schleichen. Ich fand einmal einen in meinem Wohnzimmer und musste ihn zurück zur Haustür scheuchen. Kaninchen laufen wild in der Gegend herum. Einige von ihnen haben eine gute Größe, und die Gärtner hassen sie, weil sie die Wurzeln der Pflanzen ausgraben und in den Rasen der Leute graben. Meine Katzen lieben sie jedoch und haben die meisten von ihnen aus unserer Nachbarschaft gejagt. Wir bekommen auch die übliche Ansammlung von Vögeln: kleine Spatzen und Kolibris, und gelegentlich schwebt ein Habicht oder Adler vorbei, bis die Krähen in der Nachbarschaft ihn vertreiben. Es gibt keine Geschäfte in der Nähe, aber wenn man den Hügel hinunter zum Wasser wandert, gibt es ein paar Restaurants, die frischen Fisch servieren. Unten gibt es keinen großen Strand, aber die Felsen entlang der Küste machen Spaß, sie ins Wasser zu werfen. Die Bucht selbst ist nicht sehr breit. Man kann die gegenüberliegende Küste klar sehen, selbst an den meisten Tagen durch den Nebel.\n\n[REWRITE]  \nThere aren't many sidewalks in the area where I live.

Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",

Der öffentliche Nahverkehr ist sehr gut erreichbar und eine der beliebtesten Transportmöglichkeiten in New York City. Bensonhurst ist ein ziemlich urbanes Viertel, sodass Sie sich immer noch wie in New York City fühlen werden. Während Ihres Besuchs sollten Sie darauf vorbereitet sein, die zahlreichen asiatischen Geschäfte überall zu sehen. In den letzten zwei Jahrzehnten hat Bensonhurst einen Zustrom asiatischer Bewohner erhalten. Deshalb werden Sie beim Gehen mindestens in jedem Block ein asiatisches Geschäft sehen. Am beliebtesten sind Supermärkte und Wäschereien. Zufälligerweise sind diese Geschäfte bei den örtlichen Bewohnern sehr beliebt, da die Qualität der Lebensmittel in den Supermärkten hervorragend ist, die Preise viel günstiger sind und es schließlich sehr praktisch ist. Ganz in der Nähe, wo ich bin, gibt es vier asiatische Supermärkte, die nur zwei Minuten zu Fuß voneinander entfernt sind. Dies trägt nur zur Bequemlichkeit des Lebensmitteleinkaufs bei. Ich sage nicht, dass Bensonhurst rein von asiatischen Einwohnern bevölkert ist. Es ist ziemlich vielfältig, mit Einwanderern und ihren amerikanischen Kindern der ersten und zweiten Generation hier. Die meisten großen und beliebten Geschäfte in der Umgebung sind in asiatischem Besitz. Zusätzlich zu diesen asiatischen Geschäften gibt es auch einen kürzlich renovierten Park in der Nähe, der etwa zehn Basketballplätze, ein großes Feld für Fußball oder Baseball, vier Handballplätze, Schaukeln, einen Spielplatz für Kinder und sogar einen Brunnen hat, damit Kinder im Sommer Wasser genießen können. Da wir in New York City sind, sind die Parks natürlich sehr vielfältig. Sie werden hier alle möglichen Menschen sehen, die gut miteinander auskommen und spielen können. In diesem Viertel gibt es nicht viele große Firmengebäude. Die einzigen Gebäude, die Sie finden würden, sind für Genossenschaftswohnungen oder Eigentumswohnungen. Die Mehrheit der Wohnräume hier sind jedoch Zweifamilienhäuser. Die meisten Menschen sind ziemlich nett, aber sehr laut. Jeden Tag würden Sie Autos hören, die ihre Musik aufdrehen, während sie an Ihrem Haus vorbeifahren, oder ständig das Gaspedal durchtreten, was Sie morgens wecken wird. Wenn Sie planen, nachts zu besuchen, sollten Sie auf der Hut sein. Diese Gegend ist ziemlich sicher, aber Menschen sind unberechenbar. Sie könnten auf Menschen treffen, die ohne Grund Ärger machen wollen, Rüpel und Diebe. Ich selbst wurde in dieser Nachbarschaft in der Vergangenheit durch körperliche Angriffe gemobbt, aber das war vor vielen Jahren. Ein weiterer Vorfall betraf kürzlich Paketdiebstahl. Obwohl es eine häufige Sache ist, gibt es in dieser Nachbarschaft Paketdiebe. Zu guter Letzt, obwohl es in New York City eine Geldstrafe für Menschen gibt, die den Kot ihrer Hunde nicht beseitigen, halten sich die Leute hier nicht an die Regeln. Jeden Morgen werden Sie auf Ihrem Weg zur U-Bahn-Station oder zum Supermarkt mindestens einen Hundekot sehen. Mein größtes Ärgernis ist Hundekot auf dem Boden, wohin ich in diesem Viertel gehe.

    "transformed": "The first thing to grasp about Portland, Oregon is the meaning of \"weird\". The unofficial town motto, found on the back of a building that doubles as a pizza place, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts legality in at least half of these roles, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, this phrase is a nostalgic call to remember the Portland of the 90s and early 2000s, a Portland that was lesser-known and less pricey, nurturing creative and unique subcultures. For others, it is an enticing call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but now as a compliment. Despite the influx of wealthy Californians and the continuous construction of condos to accommodate them, Portland remains weird. Weird doesn't always mean accepting, but it does mean embracing things that are typically not accepted. Weird doesn't imply a lack of modern amenities or contemporary struggles. Like the rest of the nation, we buy most of our products from China. There are countless ways of being weird, of being not normal, yet Portland also has plenty of normalcy. Portland has yoga, hipsters, and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we simply take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, gardens with flowers, herbs, and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summer.

The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming.

At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest.

Zumindest nicht solche, in denen die meisten Menschen leben möchten. Doch wenn man hinter dem alten, verlassenen Whole Foods vorbei und hinter die Hotels geht, die nur jährlich belegt sind, abgesehen von einigen Sommeraufenthalten für Familientreffen, entdeckt man eine ganze geschäftige Gemeinschaft. In diesen Gemeinschaften, auf diesen Straßen, befinden sich einige Wohnkomplexe - sorgfältig nebeneinander angeordnet wie russische Matrjoschka-Puppen, die sorgfältig auseinandergenommen und nebeneinander aufgereiht wurden, stückweise entlang der Straße. Die ersten Wohnungen, auf die Sie stoßen, sind in den Nachrichten wegen einiger ziemlich unangenehmer Vorfälle gewesen, also werden wir uns auf diese nicht allzu sehr konzentrieren - der Schein kann schließlich trügen. Aber die Wohnungen neben diesem Komplex und die beiden Komplexe daneben sind eine ganz andere Welt, von der fast niemand in dieser Gegend weiß. Gegenüber diesen Komplexen befindet sich ein Satellitencampus eines Community Colleges - eine ruhige, verschlafene Ansammlung von Gebäuden, die wie Wächter am Straßenrand stehen, wo Studenten mit einem Kaffee in der Hand hereintröpfeln, gähnend um 7 Uhr morgens, um ihren verschlafenen Tag zu beginnen. Die eisernen Tore knarren auf, um sie einzeln hereinzulassen, während Pendler ihre Fäuste aus dem Fenster schütteln und über den Verkehr stöhnen, wenn die Anwesenheit höher ist. Die Straße mündet in eine andere Wohnstraße, mit einem Park auf der einen Seite und einem Rehabilitationszentrum für Menschen, die sich unter unglücklichen Umständen Knochen gebrochen haben. Das Behandlungszentrum prahlt mit fröhlichen Verandamöbeln und einem träge schwingenden Deckenventilator, der die warme, dicke Sommerluft hin und her wirbelt. Kinder laufen im Park gegenüber über das Gras, machen Radschläge und Purzelbäume über die stacheligen grünen Halme, während die Bienen träge in den Blumenbeeten am Straßenrand schwirren. Alte Rentner führen ihre Hunde auf dem Gehweg spazieren, runzeln die Stirn über die Teenager auf ihren Skateboards und nicken den Teenager-Mädchen, die sich um die Spielgeräte scharen, bescheiden zu, während sie über Jungs und die neuesten YouTube-Sensationen klatschen. In einem Einkaufszentrum neben dem Park gibt es ein Sushi-Restaurant mit günstigem Essen, das aber nie besonders voll zu sein scheint - direkt daneben ein Schwimmbedarfsgeschäft und dazwischen ein Nagelstudio. Man könnte seinen Pool für die Saison füllen, während man eine Maniküre bekommt und Hibachi-Hühnchen isst - die Schönheit eines Einkaufszentrums. Dort gibt es auch einen Frozen-Yogurt-Laden, eine dieser Selbstbedienungssorten, und oft sieht man die Jugendlichen im Park, wie sie kalte, dampfende Becher mit gefrorenem Joghurt, bedeckt mit Toppings, halten, während sie auf ihren Skateboards Kunststücke machen und dampfen, weil sie glauben, dass es das Coolste ist.

The public school, which has been here for almost 90 years, still stands, igniting a future in today's young people, while stirring nostalgia among older residents. The churches are few and mostly empty, but the basketball courts are bustling. All the homes look different, yet they feel the same. A large supermarket called Super \"A\" is owned by a large Yemeni family, who might be the only Arab family in the area. The majority of the residents are African American. The streets are broad, and kids usually play football, pausing only to let cars through. Many in my neighborhood have been here for generations and can share stories of a past where everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but when Hollywood stopped making Karate Kid movies, kids lost interest in being the Karate Kid, so now it's a pharmacy, because, as they say, drugs make everything better. There's also a small movie theater that shows old films at a discount, avoided by the youth due to its lack of new releases, but appreciated by the elders, who find it a small cost for a night out, without the kids of course. A single expressway runs through my town, though its exit and entrance are in the neighboring town. There was once a petition to get an exit for our town. The youth supported it, but the elders disagreed. They believed that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, convincing the city council to deny the request. A new high school is being built, and we're trying to choose a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would best represent my town.",

    "raw_output": "Sure, here's the translation process:\n\n**Translation to German:**\n\nDa ich in einer großen Stadt lebe, ist mein Viertel äußerst vielfältig. Wohngebiete sind scheinbar zufällig zwischen Gewerbegebieten verstreut, in denen eine Vielzahl von Geschäften betrieben wird. Einige dieser Geschäfte bestehen aus Büros, während andere verschiedene Läden, Restaurants und Unterhaltungsmöglichkeiten sind. Es mangelt nicht an neuen Restaurants, in denen man essen oder in Geschäften einkaufen kann. Während einige Geschäfte große, bekannte Marken sind, die großen Konzernen gehören, werden kleine Boutiquen immer beliebter. Sie befinden sich nicht nur in verschiedenen Einkaufszentren, sondern säumen auch die Straßen, die oft in fußläufiger Entfernung von Vierteln liegen, die ansonsten ruhig und idyllisch wären, wenn sie nicht von so vielen Sehenswürdigkeiten umgeben wären. Es gibt auch ein paar Parks in der Nähe, und ich habe bemerkt, dass Menschen diese Parks mit ihren kleinen Kindern häufig besuchen. Apropos Menschen, es gibt tatsächlich eine ziemliche Vielfalt in meinem Viertel. An einem kleinen Ort gibt es eine prominente LGBTQ+-Gemeinschaft, eine orthodox jüdische Gemeinschaft und eine Sammlung von Flüchtlingen und Einwanderern aus der ehemaligen Sowjetunion. Etwas weiter außerhalb meines Viertels gibt es noch viele weitere Personen verschiedener Rassen und Herkunft, obwohl sie manchmal in ihren eigenen kleinen Gemeinschaften innerhalb der Stadt aufgeteilt sind. Wir haben Orte, die als Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia und viele mehr bekannt sind, die nur wenige Meilen entfernt sind. Allerdings können schon ein paar Meilen eine sehr lange Fahrt bedeuten. Eine Strecke von nur 10 Meilen kann manchmal aufgrund des Verkehrs, besonders während der Hauptverkehrszeit, zwei Stunden dauern. In meiner Stadt geht jedoch kaum jemand zu Fuß. Auch wenn bestimmte interessante Orte unvermeidlich in der Nähe sind, ist die Stadt riesig, und die Menschen ziehen es im Allgemeinen nicht vor, zu Fuß zu pendeln. Deshalb haben wir auch eines der schlimmsten Verkehrsprobleme der Welt, und es kann schwierig sein, fast überall einen Parkplatz zu finden. Ironischerweise gab es in den letzten Jahren viele Bauarbeiten, da große Wohngebäude in die Stadt integriert werden. Es scheint ein beliebtes Ziel zu sein, aber viele Bewohner sind enttäuscht über die Aussicht, dass noch mehr Menschen einziehen und noch mehr Fahrzeuge auf den Straßen sein werden. Es gibt jedoch viele verschiedene Arten von Häusern in meiner Stadt. Nicht jeder lebt oder möchte in einem großen Wohngebäude leben. Wohngebiete bestehen aus Häusern unterschiedlicher Größe sowie kleineren Wohngebäuden und Eigentumswohnungen. Einige Grundstücke enthalten Einfamilienhäuser, während andere Doppelhaushälften enthalten. Das gilt sogar für mein unmittelbares Viertel, sodass es auch in Bezug auf Wohnmöglichkeiten keine Vielfalt fehlt. Ebenso besteht das Viertel aus Menschen unterschiedlichen Alters, und ehrlich gesagt kenne ich die meisten meiner Nachbarn nicht. Es ist heutzutage nicht wirklich eine eng verbundene Gemeinschaft, obwohl ich viele Erinnerungen aus meiner Kindheit habe, als ich draußen mit meinem Nachbarn von nebenan und ein paar anderen Freunden aus der Nachbarschaft spielte, die alle in meinem Alter waren.\n\n**Back to English:**\n\nSince I live in a big city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse.

    "original": "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",

Sie kam aus einer Stadt, in der der Supermarkt nur fünf Minuten zu Fuß von ihrem Haus entfernt war – sie hatte noch nie zuvor so viel offenen Raum gesehen. Überwältigt von der Allgegenwart der Maisfelder, teilte ich ihr mit, wie es war, in ländlichem Ohio aufzuwachsen, und in diesem Moment verstand sie endlich, wer ich war und woher ich kam. Wenn man die zweispurige Landstraße entlangfährt, erreicht man einen Steinbruch, der mit Wasser gefüllt ist. Gleich dahinter liegt die kleine Siedlung, in der ich lebe. Die Häuser bestehen hauptsächlich aus Backstein und Stuck. Alle Häuser haben mindestens ein halbes Morgen Land für sich, das jeder mit Stolz pflegt. Im Frühling sind die jährlich gepflanzten Blumen reichlich vorhanden, zusammen mit den Bäumen des Mittleren Westens, die sich mit jeder Jahreszeit verändern. Die Einfahrten sind alle mit hochklassigen Mercedes Benz Luxusautos gefüllt, die in der Mittagssonne nach einer guten, altmodischen Autowäsche glänzen. Wenn man die Straße zu meinem grauen Stuckhaus entlangfährt, ist mein koreanischer Nachbar immer draußen mit einem freundlichen Gesicht. Er verbringt meist den ganzen Tag damit, seinen Rasen zu mähen und ist über das Brummen seines Mähers hinweg singen zu hören. Jeder in der Nachbarschaft lacht über ihn, aber er ist immer aufrichtig und eine erstaunliche Person mit einer einzigartigen Geschichte. Er ist älter geworden und hat mit der Zeit etwas von seinem Witz verloren. Früher war er Arzt und verschmilzt oft mit dem Gras und seinem John Deere Zero Turn Mäher. Schließlich erreicht man mein Zuhause. Im Seitenhof sind viele Gänse, die von unserem Terrier gejagt werden. Hinten gibt es einen kleinen Bach, der in den Steinbruch fließt. Hier hört man Ochsenfrösche, den Bach und gelegentlich ein „Muh“ von den nahegelegenen Farmen. Über die handgemachte Holzbrücke ist eine unberührte Oase voller natürlich wachsender Bäume, Kräuter und Wildblumen. Hier verbrachte ich den Großteil meiner Kindheit. Vom Bau von Baumfestungen bis zum „Jagen“ von Tieren (was meist aus dem Hinterherjagen bestand), gab es immer etwas zu tun und meistens ein Kind aus der Nachbarschaft, das für Freundschaften verfügbar war. Die Winter in meiner kleinen Stadt können schmerzhaft brutal sein, doch es gibt nichts Schöneres. Der Hof verwandelt sich von einem Meer aus Grün in eine leere Wildnis. Die Bäume, die einst lebendige pinke, violette und orangefarbene Blumen trugen, werden zu kahlen Skeletten aus Rinde. Wenn man mit gelegentlichem Schneefall gesegnet ist, erscheint über Nacht ein Winterwunderland. Der Hinterhof ist gesäumt mit Schneefiguren, die meine kleine Schwester gemacht hat, und Schneemännern. Meine Schwester und ich stritten häufig als Kinder, und im Winter waren Schneebälle unsere bevorzugte Waffe. Wir bauten massive igluartige Festungen, um unsere Waffen zu lagern, meistens mit Ästen, wie ein Arsenal. In unserem eigenen kleinen Wunderland spielten wir so, als gäbe es nichts anderes, was etwas bedeutete. Wir waren nur junge Kinder ohne Sorgen in der Welt.\n\n[REWRITE] \"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past the cornfields stretching to the horizon. \"This is it!\" I replied, aware she would be shocked by the openness of the landscape.
