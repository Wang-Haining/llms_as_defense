    "original": "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",

Hier wechselt man von Farmland zu kleinen Touristenstädten. Es gibt keine großen Einkaufszentren, kein Wal-mart, Target oder gar ein Applebee’s. Wohin man auch muss, man muss mit dem Auto fahren, um dorthin zu gelangen. Trotzdem lebe ich an einem der schönsten Orte der Welt, umgeben von Wasser. Meine „Stadt“ ist von Wasser umgeben. Der wunderschöne Lake Michigan auf der einen Seite und der Lake Charlevoix auf der anderen. Überall, wo man hingeht, kann man einen Strand finden, um die Füße ins Wasser zu tauchen. Meine Nachbarschaft spiegelt die Idee einer Kleinstadt wider. Die Häuser sind nicht dicht aneinandergereiht. Es sind keine gleich aussehenden Häuser. Es sind ältere Häuser, einige werden renoviert und umgebaut, andere sind älter. Die meisten Häuser haben Kellerräume. Vollständige Keller, die man von der Straße aus sehen kann. Viele Häuser in der Nachbarschaft haben ältere Aluminiumverkleidungen. Wir haben Häuser in allen Farben, die man sich vorstellen kann, in den Blöcken, die mein Haus umgeben. Die meisten Häuser haben Gärten. Gärten mit Trampolinen und Spielgeräten. Einige Menschen haben Gärten und Zäune für ihre Tiere. Die Häuser ähneln dem Mittleren Amerika. Hart arbeitende Menschen, die ihren Lebensunterhalt verdienen und entweder Familien großziehen oder großgezogen haben. An einem beliebigen Tag sieht man Kinder, die die Straßen rauf und runter laufen. Man sieht auch Leute, die Hunde ausführen, Rad fahren oder Inlineskaten. Nachbarn kennen Nachbarn und man kann erkennen, wer dazugehört und wer nicht. Man sieht jemanden draußen grillen und winken, oder sogar jemanden, der seinen Hund von ein paar Blocks weiter spazieren führt und freundlich lächelt. Die Rasenflächen sind in einem ordentlichen Zustand gehalten. Niemand hat Blätter vom Herbst aufgetürmt. Das grüne Gras wird gemäht und unter Kontrolle gehalten. Wenn Leute Pflanzen und Büsche in ihren Gärten haben, werden diese zurückgeschnitten. Es ist keine wunderschöne Nachbarschaft, in die man hineinfährt und denkt, wow, schau dir die schönen Häuser an, sondern eine, in die man hineinfährt und denkt, hier wäre ein guter Ort, um eine Familie großzuziehen. Es ist ruhig, friedlich und sicher. Obwohl es nur durchschnittlich aussieht, ist es bemerkenswert, weil es das repräsentiert, was Menschen in der Welt wollen, nämlich einen sicheren Ort, um am Ende des Tages anzukommen. In Gehweite gibt es die Abteilung des Landessheriffs und das Gefängnis. Das Gesundheitsamt ist direkt daneben. Das städtische Recyclingzentrum befindet sich die Straße hinunter, und Nachbarn und Bewohner der Stadt nutzen die angebotenen Dienstleistungen. Wir haben in der Nähe Baseball- und Softballfelder, wo man die Ansager hören kann, die Punkte zählen und die Namen der Spieler rufen. Unser kleiner Stadtflughafen liegt daneben. Man kann draußen oder sogar drinnen spielen und das Dröhnen kleiner Motorflugzeuge hören, die starten und landen. Man kann zu Fuß Eis vom örtlichen Eisladen holen, und wenn man wirklich Lust darauf hat, kann man von unserem Wohnviertel aus die Innenstadt erreichen. Meine Kinder können mit ihren Rädern zum Park fahren, der nur etwa 8 Blocks entfernt ist. Es ist wirklich ein großartiger Ort zum Leben.\n\nBack to English:\nI live in rural America, specifically in a small town in Michigan. Here, you transition from farmland to small tourist towns.

    "original": "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",

Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me.

You might start smoking, or perhaps you're just too used to the way things are. But the flea market always makes its presence felt. The scent of adulthood is dusty magazines piled on a closed piano. It seeps into the leather and remains even after washing. Here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, with cars and people filling the streets every morning, but you wouldn't hear it inside the thrift stores. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store remains silent. It's a pleasant place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there are more and more cars and people. It's a city that's developing, they say. It's home to one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, yet it's still experiencing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone and everything is focused on their own goals, and not much is demanded of you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you be. It's not like the South, where showing concern means you care. Here, you don't intrude into anyone's life. You can maintain your distance as long as you wish, and the city will ebb and flow like waves on the shore. It's a vibrant place to be. With the pianist next door and the two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something happening. In a way, we have less of an apartment complex of strangers and more of a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn losses, and help each other when we can. In some ways, I'm fortunate to be here. I really like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to clean up after myself and leave them food, and they do the same for me. I bring them their mail, and they bring mine. It's nice to see them, and I believe they enjoy my company as much as I enjoy theirs. I live in a massive, impersonal modern sprawl, but it's people like my neighbors who make me feel like I haven't completely messed up my life.",

    "original": "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",

Meine unmittelbare Nachbarschaft, auf der Ostseite der Stadt, könnte als der wirtschaftlich benachteiligteste Bereich der Stadt beschrieben werden. Die Immobilienwerte sind niedrig, wobei die meisten Häuser an einkommensschwache Personen vermietet oder von ihnen besessen werden. Dennoch ist es nicht unattraktiv oder unangenehm. Meine Nachbarn sind im Allgemeinen freundliche Menschen, die lächeln und hallo sagen, wenn ich die Straße entlang gehe. Die Kriminalitätsraten sind zwar etwas höher als in anderen Teilen der Stadt, aber immer noch allgemein niedrig. In den letzten zehn Jahren gab es innerhalb weniger Blocks von meinem Zuhause einige Gewaltverbrechen, darunter einige Schießereien und mindestens einen Mord. Unsere direkten Nachbarn haben im letzten Jahr ihren Sohn bei einer Schießerei vor einer Bar in der Gegend verloren. Zum Glück wurde unsere Familie nicht direkt von Verbrechen betroffen, abgesehen davon, dass gelegentlich ein Gegenstand von unserer Veranda verschwindet, wenn wir vergessen, ihn hereinzubringen. Im Allgemeinen wurde die Stadt, in der ich lebe, stark von der \"Opioid-Epidemie\" beeinflusst, die viele Teile der Vereinigten Staaten betroffen hat. Viele Leben gingen durch Fentanyl-Überdosen verloren. Glücklicherweise gibt es in meiner Stadt viele Ressourcen, um diese Epidemie zu bekämpfen, darunter mehrere Sucht-Rehabilitationszentren und Narcan-Trainings für Familien und Freunde von Süchtigen. Trotz dieser Herausforderungen hat dieser Ort viele positive Eigenschaften. Die Grundschule meines Sohnes hat exzellentes Personal, vom Direktor bis zu den Lehrern und dem Unterstützungspersonal. Trotz besonderer Bedürfnisse hat er bisher kein Mobbing erlebt aufgrund der unglaublich positiven Atmosphäre der Schule, und er liebt es dort. Wir haben einen aktiven Elternbeirat, der das ganze Jahr über mehrere Veranstaltungen plant, um die Familienbeteiligung und den Bildungserfolg zu fördern. Da über 20% der Bevölkerung unserer Stadt unterhalb der Armutsgrenze lebt, bietet die Grundschule allen Schülern kostenloses Frühstück und Mittagessen an, damit kein Kind jemals hungern muss. Kein Kind oder keine Familie wird als \"weniger wert\" behandelt aufgrund der Unfähigkeit zu zahlen, und die Kosten für Schulgebühren, Materialien und Ausflüge sind sehr vernünftig. Der Stadtrat und das Personal haben viele Verbesserungen am Erscheinungsbild unserer Stadt vorgenommen, einschließlich der Erneuerung von Straßen, der Landschaftsgestaltung und der Renovierung von Stadtparks. Leider fanden die meisten dieser Verbesserungen im Stadtzentrum und auf der Westseite statt, wo sich alle Einkaufsbereiche befinden und der meiste Verkehr hindurchgeht. Die Ostseite, wo ich lebe, wird oft vernachlässigt, was ein Streitpunkt für diejenigen in meiner Nachbarschaft ist. Insgesamt genieße ich es, in dieser Stadt zu leben. Die Menschen sind im Allgemeinen freundlich, die Schulen sind hervorragend, es gibt genügend Einkaufsmöglichkeiten (sowohl kleine Geschäfte als auch größere Einzelhandelsgeschäfte), um die Bedürfnisse meiner Familie zu erfüllen, und unser Zuhause mag nicht viel wert sein, aber es ist bequem und ausreichend. Unsere Familie lebt seit über 16 Jahren hier und wir können uns nicht vorstellen, woanders zu leben.\n\nEnglish Translation:\n[REWRITE]I live in a small Midwestern town just outside the suburbs of a major city.

    "original": "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",

The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food.

Keiner von ihnen lebt mehr dort, aber die Erinnerungen sind geblieben. Die meisten der Menschen, die hier lebten, als ich hierher zog, sind immer noch da. Meine Nachbarschaft ähnelt ziemlich einer durchschnittlichen amerikanischen Vorstadtgegend. Die Nachbarschaft hat viele zweistöckige Häuser. Jedes Wochenende oder wann immer es draußen warm ist, höre ich die Kinder draußen spielen. Die Nachbarschaft ist an den meisten Tagen der Woche ruhig. Ich hatte noch nie ein Problem mit den Leuten in der Nachbarschaft. Man wird in Ruhe gelassen, es sei denn, man braucht Hilfe. Ich habe online mehrere Pakete bestellt und es wurde mir nie eines von der Veranda gestohlen. Ich habe das Gefühl, dass ich meinen Nachbarn vertrauen kann. Es gibt einen Park ein oder zwei Minuten von meinem Haus entfernt. Ich habe viele Erinnerungen dort. Ich habe dort mit den anderen Jungs in der Nachbarschaft Basketball, Fußball und Baseball gespielt. Ich habe dort auch eine meiner schlimmsten Erinnerungen gemacht, als ich beim Fußballspielen einen Ellenbogen auf die Nase bekam, aber die guten Erinnerungen überwiegen die schlechten. Heutzutage gehe ich in diesen Park, um Zeit mit den Kindern meines Cousins zu verbringen. Sie sind viel jünger als ich und mögen immer noch Schaukeln und Rutschen und all solche Dinge.

Just the thought of going to the park excites them. The park makes me nostalgic for various reasons. The neighborhood is very diverse. You can find all kinds of food nearby. Within a mile, there are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, many people now use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to have their food delivered. The most popular spots are fast food places, but you can find those in almost every suburb. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here have everything you might need. There are several dry cleaners nearby. There's a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street, along with a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some stores are diverse too, like the Indian-owned store for when you're in the mood for homemade or ready-made Indian food. Overall, I'm quite fond of my neighborhood. Reading about and seeing the horror stories others face with their neighbors on social media and the news makes me grateful for mine.",

Es gibt hauptsächlich Wohnhäuser, aber auch ein paar Restaurants und Bars, die Spaß machen und nicht allzu teuer sind. Eine der Bars wurde gerade umbenannt, und diese ist teurer, aber die Qualität der Getränke und des Service dort ist nicht die schlechteste. Die meisten Leute sind nett. Sie sind entweder Studenten oder haben ein geringeres Einkommen, da die Wohnungen nicht sehr teuer sind. In der Nähe gibt es viele Kinder, da eine Grundschule in Gehweite meiner Wohnung liegt. Ich kenne meine Nachbarn nicht und möchte es auch nicht wirklich. Sie rauchen viel Gras, daher hat die Verwaltung meines Gebäudes einen Lufterfrischer direkt gegenüber ihrer Tür aufgestellt, was mein Freund und ich sehr lustig fanden. Es ist fast beleidigend. Die Gebäude um mich herum sehen meist ziemlich alt aus, könnten aber renovierte Innenräume haben. Die Straße hinunter gibt es brandneue Wohnungen, aber ich mag sie nicht, weil ich weiß, dass der Bau nicht besonders gut war. Sie sind billig gebaut, aber die Miete ist teuer, was ich für einen Betrug halte, aber da sie in der Nähe des Campus liegen, kommen die Betreiber damit durch. Es gibt ein wirklich günstiges Restaurant etwa fünf Minuten von meinem Wohnort entfernt, das nur auf Papptellern serviert und das meiste davon wird in der Mikrowelle zubereitet. Gegenüber davon ist eine Tankstelle, von der ich gehört habe, dass es kein guter Arbeitsplatz ist. Aber dank einiger Gelder von der Stadt wurde die Straße letzten Sommer neu gemacht, sodass es jetzt einen schönen großen Bürgersteig gibt, viel Gras auf den Mittelstreifen und an den Straßenrändern, und jetzt sieht die Gegend etwas besser aus. Aber das Wohngebäude, in dem ich wohne, ist von Bäumen umgeben. Einige wurden gefällt, sodass es ein paar Baumstümpfe gibt, aber es gibt viel mehr Bäume dort, wo ich wohne, als die Straße hinunter. Hinter meinem Wohnkomplex ist eine Baumreihe und dann ein weiteres Wohngebäude. Ich wohne in der 42. Straße, aber direkt dahinter ist die 43. Straße, und die ist nicht so schön. Die Bürgersteige sind wirklich schlecht und bröckeln, und die meisten Gebäude darauf sehen schäbig aus. Es gibt viele Bäume in dieser Straße, aber das ist wahrscheinlich, um die Gebäude zu verdecken. Die meisten Verbrechen in meiner Gegend passierten in einem Wohnkomplex in dieser Straße, aber andererseits kann ich nicht nur ihnen die Schuld geben. Es gibt Wohnungen gegenüber von mir, die auch viel Kriminalität und eine recht wechselnde Bevölkerung haben. Aber ich glaube, ich mag es, wo ich wohne. Ich kann es mir leisten und es gibt viele nützliche Annehmlichkeiten in der Nähe. Besonders gefällt mir, dass die Universität in Gehweite ist und es zwei Bushaltestellen gibt, sodass ich leicht zum Laden und in die Innenstadt gelangen kann.\n\n[REWRITE]  \nMy neighborhood is close to the college I attend, which makes me enjoy living there.

We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter.

My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own.

Zuerst war ich ziemlich traurig, als ich in meine Nachbarschaft kam. Ich kam von Riverdale nach Stockbridge, und ich werde nicht lügen, ich habe geweint, weil ich sie vermisste und sie liebte... aber meine Mutter und mein Vater wollten das Beste für mich und meine kleine Schwester, also zogen wir in eine bessere Gegend für Wohnraum, eine bessere High School, alles wurde als \"nicht Ghetto\" betrachtet, als wir in unsere neue Nachbarschaft zogen. Im Laufe der Jahre habe ich mich daran gewöhnt und einige neue Freunde gefunden, aber auch einige neue Feinde in der Schule. Ich habe meine Nachbarn nie wirklich kennengelernt, außer Mr. Glen und seinen Kindern sowie Dennis für eine Weile, da sie direkt neben uns wohnten. Sie waren angenehme Menschen, die ich fast als Familie betrachten kann, und ich schätze sie wirklich. Ich erinnere mich, als ich, Mama, Papa und meine Schwester zu Mr. Glens Hochzeit gingen (sie haben wieder geheiratet). Es war wirklich lustig und angenehm, um es gelinde auszudrücken, und etwas, worauf ich mich eines Tages freue, während ich mein Vermögen aufbaue und meiner zukünftigen Frau das Leben einer Königin ermögliche. Als Mr. Glens Frau, Frau Veda, das weiße kleine Band an ihrem Bein abnahm und warf, fing ich es! Leider habe ich die Blumen nicht gefangen! Wir haben die ganze Nacht getanzt, und ich habe es wirklich genossen, mit Marsharii, einer ihrer Töchter, eine gute Zeit zu haben. Ich habe sie seitdem nicht mehr gesehen. Ich hoffe, sie hat größere und bessere Dinge erreicht. Die Nachbarschaft selbst ist wie ein Labyrinth, obwohl ich jetzt ein GPS habe, sodass ich mehr Zeit damit verbringen kann, sie zu erkunden. Ich bin nur so weit gegangen, und das war, als ich mit meinen Freunden Kason und Curtis abhing. Wir haben alle früher viele Videospiele gespielt und das Leben so gut es ging genossen. Manchmal ging ich in den Park und genoss die Natur, die meine Seele beruhigt. Es gibt mir heutzutage ein Gefühl von Ruhe und Frieden. Ich bringe auch einige Stöcke mit, die ich bei Home Depot gekauft habe, und übe einfach mein Gleichgewicht, und bringe mein Bokken-Holzschwert mit, wenn ich kann. Ich habe Spaß daran, das zu tun, was ich liebe.

However, my parents wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we relocated to a better area for housing, a better high school; everything was considered \"not ghetto\" when we moved to our new neighborhood. Over the years, I adjusted and made some new friends, but also some new enemies at school. I never really got to know my neighbors, except for Mr. Glen and his children, and Dennis for a while, since they lived right next to us. They have been pleasant people whom I can almost consider family, and I truly appreciate them. I remember when my family and I attended Mr. Glen's wedding (they got remarried). It was really fun and enjoyable, and something I look forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a queen. When Mr. Glen's wife, Ms. Veda, took off the little white band on her leg and tossed it, I caught it! Sadly, I didn't catch the flowers! We danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven't seen her since then. I hope she has moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I've only gone so far, and that was when I hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We used to play video games a lot and enjoy life to the fullest. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I'll also bring some sticks I bought from Home Depot and practice my balance, and bring my bokken wooden sword if I can. I have fun doing what I love. There's also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven't played tennis or basketball in a long time, it's still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad raised me and my best friend on tennis with Mr. Graves, and we always had a great time. They worked us hard, but we always had fun. I guess I've had many fun times in this neighborhood, and there are many stories, but these are the ones that really stood out to me, and I believe the best is yet to come!",

Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",

    "raw_output": "Mein Viertel ist eine malerische kleine Stadt. Sie fällt nicht besonders auf im Vergleich zu anderen in South Carolina, aber sie hat einen bedeutenden Einfluss auf den Agrarsektor. Johnston ist als die Pfirsichhauptstadt der Welt bekannt, etwas, worauf die Stadt stolz auf dem Willkommensschild hinweist. Sie besteht hauptsächlich aus landwirtschaftlichen Flächen, die entweder von Pfirsichbäumen oder Vieh dominiert werden. Häuser, die nicht im Hauptteil der Stadt liegen, sind weit auseinander; die meisten sind zweistöckig und haben entweder Metalldächer, die helfen, die glühende Sommerhitze zu bekämpfen, oder graue Schindeln. Oftmals sind diese Häuser nicht in der Nähe der Straße, sondern weiter zurückgesetzt, sodass die vorderen Felder für Tiere oder Pflanzen genutzt werden können. Im Hauptteil der Stadt gibt es eine einzige Ampel an einer Kreuzung. Hier befinden sich die einzigen Geschäfte der gesamten Stadt. Es gibt drei Orte, an denen man „Fast Food“ bekommen kann: Hong Kong, ein kleines chinesisches Restaurant, das von einer einzigen Familie betrieben wird, das Fiesta Mexican Restaurant oder Gary's, eine kleine Burgerkette. Früher gab es eine Pizzeria, die jedoch vor kurzem geschlossen wurde. Es gibt eine sehr kleine familiengeführte Apotheke namens Maxwell and Halford Drug; lustigerweise sind sie am bekanntesten für die Cherry Coca-Cola, die sie verkaufen. Es gibt einen kleinen, aber teuren Lebensmittelladen namens Independent Grocers Alliance, allgemein bekannt als IGA. Obwohl es das einzige Lebensmittelgeschäft in der gesamten Stadt ist, halten viele Leute nur an, um ein oder zwei Artikel zu kaufen; die meisten ziehen es vor, nach Batesburg-Leesville zu fahren, um den Großteil ihrer Lebensmittel in einem Walmart zu kaufen. Der beliebteste Laden der gesamten Stadt ist der Dollar General; dieser Laden verkauft eine Vielzahl von Alltagsgegenständen und ist oft von der Öffnung bis zur Schließung beschäftigt! Es gibt ein sehr kleines Möbelgeschäft, Possibilities Furniture & More, das von einer freundlichen Frau geführt wird, die in der Gemeinde bekannt ist. Das Geschäft ist seit vielen Jahren in Johnston und beschäftigt sogar zwei Umzugshelfer, die die gekauften Möbel liefern! An das Möbelgeschäftsgebäude ist ein kleiner Tierfriseur namens Clark's Cuts and Kennels angeschlossen. Sie bieten eine Vielzahl von Dienstleistungen wie Tagesbetreuung, Unterbringung, Pflege, Nagelschleifen, Baden usw. Sowohl eine Arzt- als auch eine Tierarztpraxis befinden sich abseits des Hauptteils der Stadt; beide sind sehr kleine Praxen, aber gut ausgestattet, um den Bewohnern von Johnston zu helfen. Es gibt eine einzige Grundschule namens Johnston Elementary School. Nachdem die Schüler die fünfte Klasse abgeschlossen haben, müssen sie sowohl die Mittel- als auch die Oberschule in der nächsten Stadt besuchen. Technisch gesehen gibt es keine Parks in der Stadt, aber derzeit wird ein 2,5 Hektar großes Erholungsgebiet geschaffen, um Familien mehr Möglichkeiten für Ausflüge zu bieten und mehr Besucher oder potenzielle Einwohner anzuziehen. Zugegebenermaßen gibt es nicht viel zu tun; es gibt keine Kinos, Bowlingbahnen, „Treffpunkte“, Spielplätze für Kinder, Bereiche zum Spazierengehen mit Haustieren oder eine große Auswahl an Restaurants. Trotzdem ist es eine schöne Stadt, so klein, dass man sie im Handumdrehen passieren könnte, ohne es zu merken!\n\n[REWRITE]  \nMy neighborhood is a charming little town.

    "original": "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",

Es ist eine Verbindungsstraße zwischen zwei Staatsstraßen, daher gibt es etwas mehr Verkehr, als mir lieb ist, aber abgesehen davon ist es eine ruhige Nachbarschaft. Es gibt nicht viele Leute, die ein- und ausziehen, daher kenne ich die meisten Menschen, die hier wohnen. Die Leute beschäftigen sich hauptsächlich mit Gartenarbeit und anderen täglichen Aufgaben. Im Winter rodeln wir einen Hügel auf unserer Seitenstraße hinunter. Wir wohnen in einem Haus an der vorderen Ecke unserer Straße, also sehen wir den ganzen Tag über, wer kommt und geht, und sind mit den Autos vertraut, die hier herumfahren. Wann immer wir ein fremdes Fahrzeug sehen, merken wir es uns. Einige Nachbarn gehen spazieren, um sich zu bewegen oder einfach, um ihre Hunde auszuführen. Kinder spielen mit ihren Fahrrädern und all das, was man erwarten würde. Wir sind oft zu Hause, da wir von zu Hause aus arbeiten. Wir sind zu viert, ich, meine Frau und zwei Töchter, elf und vierzehn Jahre alt. Ich würde sagen, dass jeder andere auch daran gewöhnt ist, uns kommen und gehen zu sehen. Wir gehen nach draußen und spielen, manchmal sogar im Regen. Ab und zu grillen wir draußen auf unserer hinteren Terrasse, und es riecht immer angenehm nach Barbecue und all dem. Es scheint, dass hier immer jemand Rasen mäht, und man hört fast jeden Tag von März bis etwa Oktober einen Rasenmäher, wenn das Gras endlich aufhört zu wachsen. In unserer Nachbarschaft gibt es viele Bäume, da es ursprünglich ein Waldgebiet war, also gibt es viel Schatten, aber im Herbst auch viele Blätter. Das bedeutet, dass man die Blätter jedes Jahr harken und verbrennen muss. Ich mag auch den Geruch von brennenden Blättern, daher ist das immer ein schönes Zeichen, dass der Herbst da ist. In letzter Zeit haben wir nicht viel Winter, also fühlt es sich einfach wie ein langer Herbst an. Unsere Garage befindet sich hinter unserem Haus, daher benutzen wir die Vordertür selten, es sei denn, es klopft jemand, was selten vorkommt. Ich arbeite gerne in der Garage an meinem Truck oder an anderen Projekten und wenn die Garagentüren offen sind, fühle ich mich mehr mit der Nachbarschaft verbunden. An Feiertagen ist es hier ziemlich ruhig. An Thanksgiving besuchen einige der Familien in der Nachbarschaft Leute von außerhalb der Stadt und zu dieser Jahreszeit stehen überall zusätzliche Autos. Es ist dasselbe an anderen Feiertagen wie Muttertag und Weihnachten. Alles in allem lebe ich gerne hier.

There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people.

Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores.

Alles scheint abwärts zu fließen, und mein Haus liegt direkt auf dem höchsten Punkt des steilsten Hügels in der Nachbarschaft. Die Leute nennen ihn den \"Workout-Hügel\", weil so viele Jogger ihn während ihres täglichen Trainings hinauflaufen. Da es auf meiner Straße überhaupt keine Gehwege gibt, gehen alle auf der Straße. Die Straße hat an einigen Stellen Schlaglöcher und kann etwas gefährlich zu befahren sein. Einige der Telefon- und Stromleitungen, die um den Block gespannt sind, sehen zerfetzt aus. In unserer Gegend regnet und stürmt es viel, sodass Äste und andere Trümmer oft die Stromleitungen beschädigen, und die ständigen Reparaturen lassen sie gescheckt und flickenhaft aussehen. Überall, wohin man schaut, gibt es viele hohe immergrüne Bäume. Aber die Leute hier hassen die Bäume. Sie bemühen sich, so viele wie möglich zu fällen, weil die Bäume den Blick auf das Meer versperren. Deshalb sind viele der Häuser so hoch auf dem Hügel gebaut, mit riesigen verglasten zweiten Stockwerken, die einer nach dem anderen aufragen, um die Aussicht auf die Bucht zu genießen. Es ist wunderschön bei Sonnenuntergang, wenn das Wasser von unten beleuchtet zu sein scheint und der Himmel orange wird. Meistens ist es jedoch bewölkt, sodass man das meiste Sonnenlicht durch einen Schleier sieht. Die meisten Tage sind bedeckt und feucht. Moos wächst auf allem, was es kann: Dächer, Autos und Geländer. Ich habe einmal mein Auto einen Monat lang in meiner Einfahrt geparkt und als ich es benutzen wollte, war es grün und pelzig vor Moos. Es hat mich drei Stunden gekostet, alles abzuschaben. Es gibt nicht viele Kinder dort, wo ich lebe, obwohl nur ein paar Blocks entfernt eine Schule ist. Die meisten Menschen in meiner Nachbarschaft sind älter, viele von ihnen im Ruhestand. Anstelle von Kindern haben die Leute Hunde. Es ist üblich, sie auf den Rasenflächen der Leute sitzen oder die Straße hinunterrennen zu sehen. Wenn man eine Tür oder ein Fenster offen lässt, riskiert man, dass sie sich ins Haus schleichen. Ich habe einmal einen in meinem Wohnzimmer gefunden und musste ihn zur Vordertür hinaus scheuchen. Kaninchen laufen wild in der Gegend herum. Einige von ihnen sind ziemlich groß, und die Gärtner hassen sie, weil sie die Wurzeln von Pflanzen ausgraben und in den Rasenflächen der Leute graben. Meine Katzen lieben sie jedoch und haben die meisten von ihnen aus unserer Nachbarschaft vertrieben. Wir haben auch die übliche Auswahl an Vögeln: kleine Spatzen und Kolibris, und gelegentlich fliegt ein Habicht oder Adler vorbei, bis die Krähen der Nachbarschaft ihn vertreiben. Es gibt keine Geschäfte in der Nähe, aber wenn man den Hügel hinunter zum Wasser wandert, gibt es ein paar Restaurants, die frische Meeresfrüchte servieren. Es gibt dort unten keinen großen Strand, aber die Felsen entlang der Küste machen Spaß, ins Wasser zu werfen. Die Bucht selbst ist nicht sehr breit. Man kann das gegenüberliegende Ufer an den meisten Tagen sogar durch den Nebel hindurch deutlich sehen.\n\nBack to English:\n\n[REWRITE]  \nThere aren't many sidewalks where I live.

Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",

Bensonhurst ist ein ziemlich urbanes Viertel, sodass Sie sich weiterhin fühlen werden, als wären Sie in New York City. Während Ihres Besuchs sollten Sie darauf vorbereitet sein, die verschiedenen asiatischen Geschäfte überall zu sehen. In den letzten zwei Jahrzehnten hat Bensonhurst einen Zustrom asiatischer Einwohner erhalten. Deshalb werden Sie bei jedem Block, den Sie entlanggehen, mindestens ein asiatisches Geschäft sehen. Am beliebtesten sind Supermärkte und Waschsalons. Zufällig sind diese Geschäfte bei den Anwohnern sehr beliebt, da die Qualität der Lebensmittel in den Supermärkten hervorragend ist, die Preise viel günstiger sind und es zudem sehr praktisch ist. In meiner Nähe gibt es vier asiatische Supermärkte, die jeweils nur zwei Minuten zu Fuß voneinander entfernt sind. Dies erhöht nur die Bequemlichkeit beim Einkaufen. Ich sage nicht, dass Bensonhurst nur von asiatischen Einwohnern bevölkert ist. Es ist hier ziemlich vielfältig, mit Einwanderern und ihren ersten und zweiten Generationen amerikanischer Kinder. Die meisten großen und beliebten Unternehmen in der Gegend sind im Besitz von Asiaten. Zusätzlich zu diesen asiatischen Unternehmen gibt es auch einen kürzlich renovierten Park in der Nähe, der etwa zehn Basketballplätze, ein großes Feld für Fußball oder Baseball, vier Handballplätze, Schaukeln, einen Spielplatz für Kinder und sogar einen Brunnen hat, in dem Kinder im Sommer mit Wasser spielen können. Da wir in New York City sind, sind die Parks natürlich sehr vielfältig. Sie werden hier alle möglichen Arten von Vielfalt sehen, die gut miteinander spielen und auskommen. In diesem Viertel gibt es nicht viele große Firmengebäude. Die einzigen Gebäude, die Sie finden würden, sind solche für Genossenschaftswohnungen oder Eigentumswohnungen. Die Mehrheit der Wohnräume hier sind jedoch Zweifamilienhäuser. Die meisten Menschen sind ziemlich freundlich, aber sehr laut. Jeden Tag hören Sie Autos, die ihre Musik aufdrehen, während sie an Ihrem Haus vorbeifahren, oder ständig aufs Gas treten, was Sie morgens wecken wird. Wenn Sie planen, nachts zu besuchen, sollten Sie auf der Hut sein. Dieses Viertel ist ziemlich sicher, aber Menschen sind unberechenbar. Sie könnten auf Menschen treffen, die ohne Grund Ärger machen wollen, Schläger und Diebe. Ich selbst wurde in der Vergangenheit in diesem Viertel durch körperliche Angriffe schikaniert, aber das war vor vielen Jahren. Ein weiteres kürzliches Ereignis betraf Paketdiebstahl. Obwohl es eine häufige Sache ist, gibt es in diesem Viertel Paketdiebe. Zu guter Letzt, obwohl New York City eine Geldstrafe für Menschen hat, die den Kot ihrer Hunde nicht beseitigen, halten sich die Leute hier nicht an die Regeln.

    "original": "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously.

Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall.

The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",

There used to be a karate school, but when Hollywood stopped making Karate Kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the Karate Kid, so it's now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There's also a small movie theater that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdain for its lack of new releases, but favored by the elders, who think it's a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids, of course. There is a single expressway that runs through my town, though the exit and entrance are in the neighboring town. There was once a petition to get an exit for our town. The youth supported it, but the elders opposed it. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, according to the elders, who eventually convinced the city council to deny the request. They are building a new high school, and we're trying to decide on a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would best represent my town.\n\n[REWRITE]My neighborhood is intriguing. Most homes are single-family, but there are a few that have been split into two while remaining attached, if that makes sense. My house has a small front yard and a driveway to the left. Like most houses here, it brings back memories of a time not so long ago when the American dream was to live in the suburbs. This dream once welcomed the people of this nation, but now it seems to be fading. Nevertheless, my neighborhood and many others still exist, still inviting us and visitors, reminding us that the dream is still alive, and we cling to it as best we can. People don't feel as hopeful as before; the maintenance of the small yards isn't what it used to be, but there are still cars in every driveway, and the youth still play as if the world around them is all that matters.

Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes.

    "raw_output": "Sure, here is the text translated to German and then back to English:\n\nGerman Translation:\nDa ich in einer großen Stadt lebe, ist meine Nachbarschaft äußerst vielfältig. Wohngebiete sind scheinbar zufällig zwischen Gewerbegebieten verstreut, in denen eine Vielzahl von Unternehmen betrieben werden. Einige dieser Unternehmen bestehen aus Büros, während andere aus verschiedenen Geschäften, Restaurants und Unterhaltungsmöglichkeiten bestehen. Es mangelt nicht an neuen Restaurants, in denen man essen kann, oder Geschäften, in denen man einkaufen kann. Während einige Geschäfte große, bekannte Marken sind, die großen Konzernen gehören, werden auch kleine Boutiquen immer beliebter. Sie befinden sich nicht nur in verschiedenen Einkaufszentren, sondern säumen auch die Straßen, die oft zu Fuß von Vierteln erreichbar sind, die ansonsten ruhig und idyllisch wären, wenn sie nicht von so vielen interessanten Punkten umgeben wären. Es gibt auch ein paar nahegelegene Parks, und ich habe bemerkt, dass Menschen diese Parks häufig mit ihren kleinen Kindern besuchen. Apropos Menschen, es gibt tatsächlich eine große Vielfalt in meiner Nachbarschaft. An einem kleinen Ort gibt es eine prominente LGBTQ+-Gemeinschaft, eine orthodoxe jüdische Gemeinschaft und eine Gruppe von Flüchtlingen und Einwanderern aus der ehemaligen Sowjetunion. Wenn man etwas weiter über meine Nachbarschaft hinausgeht, gibt es viele weitere Individuen verschiedener Rassen und Herkunft, obwohl sie manchmal in ihren eigenen kleinen Gemeinschaften innerhalb der Stadt aufgeteilt sind. Wir haben Orte, die als Korea-Stadt, China-Stadt, Klein Armenien und viele mehr bekannt sind, die nur ein paar Meilen entfernt sind. Allerdings können nur wenige Meilen eine sehr lange Fahrt bedeuten. Eine Strecke von nur 10 Meilen kann aufgrund des Verkehrs, insbesondere während der Hauptverkehrszeiten, manchmal zwei Stunden dauern. Kaum jemand in meiner Stadt geht irgendwohin zu Fuß. Obwohl bestimmte interessante Orte unweigerlich nahe sind, ist die Stadt riesig und die Menschen ziehen es im Allgemeinen nicht vor, zu Fuß zu pendeln. Infolgedessen haben wir auch einige der schlimmsten Verkehrsstaus der Welt, und es kann schwierig sein, fast überall Parkplätze zu finden. Ironischerweise hat es in den letzten Jahren viel Bauaktivität gegeben, da große Wohngebäude zur Stadt hinzugefügt werden. Es scheint ein beliebtes Ziel zu sein, aber viele Einwohner sind enttäuscht von der Aussicht, dass noch mehr Menschen einziehen und noch mehr Fahrzeuge auf den Straßen sein werden. Es gibt jedoch viele verschiedene Arten von Häusern in meiner Stadt. Nicht jeder wohnt oder möchte in einem großen Wohngebäude wohnen. Wohngebiete bestehen aus Häusern verschiedener Größen und kleineren Wohngebäuden und Eigentumswohnungen. Einige Grundstücke enthalten Einfamilienhäuser, während andere Doppelhaushälften enthalten. Das gilt auch für meine unmittelbare Nachbarschaft, sodass es auch in Bezug auf Wohnmöglichkeiten keine Vielfalt gibt. Ebenso besteht die Nachbarschaft aus Menschen unterschiedlichen Alters, und um ehrlich zu sein, kenne ich die meisten meiner Nachbarn nicht. Heutzutage ist es nicht wirklich eine eng verbundene Gemeinschaft, obwohl ich viele Erinnerungen aus meiner Kindheit habe, in denen ich mit meinem Nachbarn von nebenan und ein paar anderen Freunden aus der Nachbarschaft draußen spielte, die alle in meinem Alter waren.\n\nBack to English:\nSince I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse.

She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight.

    "raw_output": "„Wo ist alles?“ fragte sie, als wir an den endlosen Maisfeldern vorbeifuhren. „Das ist alles!“, sagte ich, wohlwissend, dass sie von der Weite der offenen Landschaft überrascht sein würde. Sie kam aus einer Stadt, in der der Lebensmittelladen nur fünf Minuten zu Fuß von ihrem Haus entfernt war – sie hatte noch nie in ihrem Leben so viel Freiraum gesehen. Überwältigt von der Allgegenwart der Maisfelder, erzählte ich ihr, wie es war, in ländlichem Ohio aufzuwachsen, und in diesem Moment erkannte sie endlich, wer ich war und woher ich kam. Wenn man die zweispurige Landstraße entlangfährt, erreicht man einen Steinbruch, der mit Wasser gefüllt ist. Gleich dahinter liegt die kleine Siedlung, in der ich wohne. Die Häuser bestehen hauptsächlich aus Ziegeln und Stuck. Alle Häuser haben mindestens einen halben Morgen Land, auf das jeder stolz ist und das gepflegt wird. Im Frühling sind die jährlich gepflanzten Blumen reichlich vorhanden, ebenso wie die Bäume des Mittleren Westens, die sich mit jeder Jahreszeit verändern. Die Einfahrten sind alle voll mit den luxuriösesten Mercedes-Benz-Autos, die nach einer guten, altmodischen Autowäsche im Mittagssonnenschein glitzern. Weiter die Straße entlang zu meinem grauen Stuckhaus ist mein koreanischer Nachbar immer draußen mit einem freundlichen Gesicht. Er verbringt den ganzen Tag damit, seinen Rasen zu mähen, und man hört ihn über das Brummen seines Mähers singen. Alle in der Nachbarschaft lachen über ihn, aber er ist immer aufrichtig und eine erstaunliche Person mit einer einzigartigen Geschichte. Er ist älter geworden und hat im Alter etwas von seinem Scharfsinn verloren. In seiner Vergangenheit war er Arzt und verschmilzt normalerweise mit dem Gras und seinem John Deere Zero Turn-Mäher. Schließlich erreicht man mein Zuhause. Im Vorgarten gibt es viele Gänse, die von unserem Terrier gejagt werden. Hinten gibt es einen kleinen Bach, der in den Steinbruch mündet. Hier hört man Ochsenfrösche, den Bach und gelegentlich ein „Muh“ von den nahegelegenen Bauernhöfen. Über die handgemachte Holzbrücke gelangt man zu einer unberührten Oase, die mit natürlich wachsenden Bäumen, Kräutern und Wildblumen gefüllt ist. Hier verbrachte ich die meiste Zeit meiner Kindheit. Vom Bau von Baumhäusern bis zum „Jagen“ von Tieren (was meist daraus bestand, sie zu verfolgen), gab es immer etwas zu tun und normalerweise ein Kind aus der Nachbarschaft, das Freundschaft suchte. Die Winter in meiner kleinen Stadt können schmerzhaft hart sein, aber es gibt nichts Schöneres. Der Garten verwandelt sich von einem Meer aus Grün in eine leere Wildnis. Die Bäume, die einst leuchtend pinke, violette und orangefarbene Blumen trugen, werden zu kahlen Skeletten aus Rinde. Wenn wir mit dem gelegentlichen Schneefall gesegnet sind, erscheint über Nacht ein Winterwunderland. Der Hinterhof ist mit Schneeengeln und Schneemännern gesäumt, die meine kleine Schwester gemacht hat. Meine Schwester und ich stritten oft als Kinder, und im Winter waren Schneebälle unsere Waffe der Wahl. Wir bauten massive igluartige Festungen, um unsere Waffen zu lagern, normalerweise mit Zweigen, wie ein Arsenal. In unserem eigenen kleinen Wunderland spielten wir in einer Zeit, in der nichts anderes zählte. Wir waren nur junge Kinder ohne Sorgen auf der Welt.\n\n[REWRITE]  \n\"Where is everything?\" she asked as we drove past the endless cornfields. \"This is it!\" I replied, knowing she would be surprised by the vast openness of the landscape.
