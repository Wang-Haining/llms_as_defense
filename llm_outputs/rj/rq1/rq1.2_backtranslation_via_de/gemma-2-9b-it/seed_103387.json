Wohnbereiche sind scheinbar zufällig zwischen Gewerbegebieten verteilt, in denen eine Vielzahl von Unternehmen betrieben werden. Einige dieser Unternehmen bestehen aus Büros, während andere verschiedene Geschäfte, Restaurants und Unterhaltungsmöglichkeiten bieten. Es mangelt nicht an neuen Restaurants zum Essen oder Geschäften zum Einrichten. Während einige Geschäfte große, bekannte Marken sind, die von großen Unternehmen gehören, werden auch kleine Boutiquen immer beliebter. Sie befinden sich nicht nur in verschiedenen Einkaufszentren, sondern säumen auch die Straßen, die oft zu Fuß erreichbar sind von Wohngegenden, die ansonsten ruhig und friedlich wären, wenn sie nicht von so vielen Sehenswürdigkeiten umgeben wären. Es gibt auch ein paar nahegelegene Parks, und ich habe bemerkt, dass die Menschen diese Parks mit ihren kleinen Kindern besuchen. Apropos Menschen, es gibt tatsächlich eine ziemliche Vielfalt in meiner Nachbarschaft. An einem kleinen Ort haben wir eine prominente LGBTQ+ -Gemeinschaft, eine orthodoxjüdische Gemeinde und eine Sammlung von Flüchtlingen und Einwanderern aus der ehemaligen Sowjetunion. Etwas außerhalb meiner Nachbarschaft leben viele mehr Menschen verschiedener Rassen und Herkunft, obwohl sie manchmal in ihre eigenen kleinen Gemeinschaften innerhalb der Stadt aufgeteilt sind. Wir haben Orte, die als Koreatown, Chinatown, Little Armenia und viele mehr bekannt sind, die nur wenige Meilen entfernt sind. Allerdings können nur wenige Meilen ein sehr langer Weg sein. Eine Entfernung von nur 10 Meilen kann manchmal zwei Stunden dauern, aufgrund des Verkehrs, besonders zur Stoßzeit. Kaum jemand in meiner Stadt geht irgendwohin zu Fuß. Obwohl bestimmte Sehenswürdigkeiten unweigerlich in der Nähe sind, ist die Stadt riesig und die Menschen bevorzugen es im Allgemeinen nicht, zu Fuß zu pendeln. Als Ergebnis haben wir auch einige der schlimmsten Verkehrsstaus der Welt, und es ist fast überall schwierig, Parkplätze zu finden. Ironischerweise gab es in den letzten Jahren eine große Baustellenentwicklung, da in der Stadt große Wohnhäuser hinzugefügt werden. Es scheint ein beliebtes Reiseziel zu sein, aber viele Bewohner sind enttäuscht von der Aussicht auf noch mehr Menschen, die einziehen, und noch mehr Fahrzeuge auf den Straßen. In meiner Stadt gibt es viele verschiedene Arten von Häusern. Nicht jeder lebt oder möchte in einem großen Apartmentgebäude leben. Wohnbereiche bestehen aus Häusern verschiedener Größen und kleineren Apartmentgebäuden und Eigentumswohnungen. Einige Immobilien enthalten Einfamilienhäuser, während andere Doppelhäuser enthalten. Das gilt auch für meine unmittelbare Nachbarschaft, daher gibt es auch keinen Mangel an Vielfalt bei den Wohnmöglichkeiten. Ebenso besteht die Nachbarschaft aus Menschen unterschiedlichen Alters, und um ehrlich zu sein, kenne ich die meisten meiner Nachbarn nicht. Es ist heutzutage keine wirklich enge Gemeinschaft, obwohl ich viele Erinnerungen aus meiner Kindheit habe, wie ich mit meinem Nachbarn und ein paar anderen Freunden aus der Nachbarschaft, die ungefähr mein Alter hatten, draußen spielte. \n\n\n\n[REWRITE]\n\nSince I live in a big city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse.

Die meisten Häuser sind Einfamilienhäuser, aber es gibt einige Häuser, die in zwei Teile aufgeteilt wurden, während sie immer noch miteinander verbunden sind, wenn das Sinn macht. Mein Haus hat einen kleinen Garten vor sich und eine kleine Einfahrt links vom Haus. Es erinnert, wie die meisten anderen, an eine Zeit nicht allzu lange her, in der Wohnen in den Vororten der amerikanische Traum war. Dieser Traum schien die Menschen dieses Landes einst zu umarmen, aber jetzt zieht er sich zurück. Aber meine Nachbarschaft und viele mehr bleiben noch bestehen, rufen uns und den Besuchern immer noch zu, dass der Traum noch lebt, und wir halten so gut wir können daran fest. Die Menschen fühlen sich nicht mehr so optimistisch wie früher, die Pflege der kleinen Gärten ist nicht mehr das, was sie mal war, aber es steht immer noch ein Auto oder zwei auf jeder Einfahrt, die Kinder spielen immer noch, als ob die Welt um sie herum das Ganze ihres Daseins wäre. Die öffentliche Schule, die seit fast 90 Jahren hier ist, steht noch immer, und scheint in der Jugend von heute eine Zukunft zu zeichnen, während sie bei den älteren Bewohnern Nostalgie hervorruft. Die Kirchen sind weit auseinander, mostly leer, aber die Basketballplätze sind immer noch voll. Alle Häuser sehen anders aus, fühlen sich aber gleich an. Es gibt einen großen Supermarkt namens \"Super A\", der von einer großen jemenitischen Familie betrieben wird, die wahrscheinlich die einzige arabische Familie in der Nachbarschaft ist. Die überwältigende Mehrheit der Bewohner ist afroamerikanisch. Die Straßen sind breit und die Kinder spielen normalerweise Fußball, und lassen nur die Autos passieren. Die meisten Menschen in meiner Nachbarschaft leben hier seit Generationen und können Geschichten von einer Zeit erzählen, in der jeder jeden kannte. Es gab eine Karateschule, aber als Hollywood mit der Produktion von Karate Kid Filmen aufhörte, wollten die Kinder nicht mehr Karate Kid sein, also ist sie jetzt eine Apotheke, denn Drogen machen alles besser, oder so habe ich gehört. Es gibt auch ein kleines Kino, das alte Filme zu einem ermäßigten Preis zeigt, das von den Jugendlichen aufgrund ihres Mangels an aktuellen Filmen gemieden wird, aber von den Älteren bevorzugt wird, die es als kleinen Preis für einen Abend auswärts halten, natürlich ohne Kinder. Es gibt eine einzige Schnellstraße, die durch meine Stadt führt. Obwohl die Aus- und Einfahrt sich in der Nachbarstadt befindet. Es gab einmal eine Petition, um eine Ausfahrt für unsere Stadt zu erhalten. Die Jugendlichen unterstützten es, während die Älteren sich weigerten.

Aber die Wohnungen neben diesem Komplex und die beiden Komplexen daneben sind eine ganz andere Welt, von fast niemanden in diesem Gebiet. \n\nGegenüber diesen Komplexen befindet sich ein Satellitencampus einer Fachhochschule - ein ruhiges, schlafendes Gebäude, das am Straßenrand steht, wo Studenten mit Kaffee in der Hand eintreten und mit müden Blicken um 7 Uhr morgens ihren müden Tag beginnen. Die eisernen Tore knistern auf und lassen sie einzeln herein, während Pendler aus dem Fenster mit den Fäusten fuchteln und sie wegen der Verkehrsbehinderungen an Tagen mit höherer Beteiligung beschimpfen. Die Straße mündet in eine weitere Wohnstraße, mit einem Park auf einer Seite und einem Reha-Zentrum für Menschen mit Knochenbrüchen in unglücklichen Umständen. Das Behandlungszentrum verfügt über freundliche Veranda-Möbel und einen träge schwingenden Deckenventilator, der die warme, dichte Sommerluft hin und her bewegt. Kinder rennen im Park über das Gras hin und her, machen Rad schlagende und Windspielbewegungen über den stacheligen grünen Halmen, während Bienen faul in den Blumenbeeten an der Straße kreisen. Alte Rentner führen ihre Hunde auf dem Gehweg spazieren, starren die Jugendlichen mit Skateboards an und nickt bescheiden den Teenagerinnen zu, die sich bei den Spielplatzgeräten versammelt haben, und plaudern über Jungen und die neuesten YouTube-Sensationen. \n\nEs gibt ein Sushi-Restaurant in einem Einkaufszentrum neben dem Park, das billiges Essen serviert, aber nie zu voll zu sein scheint - direkt daneben ein Schwimmbadbedarfgeschäft und ein Nagelstudio zwischen ihnen versteckt.

She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",

    "raw_output": "\"Wo ist alles?\", fragte sie, während wir an den Maisfeldern vorbeifuhren, die den Horizont füllten. \"Das ist es!\", sagte ich, wissend, dass sie vom Mangel an Landschaft überrascht sein würde. Sie kam aus einer Stadt, in der man zum Supermarkt in 5 Minuten zu Fuß gehen konnte - sie hatte noch nie so viel freie Fläche im Leben gesehen. Verblüfft von der Überfülle an Maisfeldern, erzählte ich ihr, wie es war, in ländlichem Ohio aufzuwachsen, und in diesem Moment wusste sie endlich, wer ich war und woher ich kam. Fahren Sie die zweispurige Landstraße entlang, erreichen Sie einen See, der mit Wasser gefüllt ist. Direkt daneben liegt die kleine Siedlung, in der ich wohne. Die Häuser bestehen hauptsächlich aus Ziegel und Stuck. Jedes Haus hat mindestens ein halbes Morgenland, das jeder mit Stolz pflegt. Während des Frühlings sind neben den mittelwestlichen Bäumen, die sich mit jeder Jahreszeit verändern, üppige, jährlich gepflanzte Blumen zu sehen. Die Zufahrten sind alle mit den luxuriösen Mercedes-Benz-Fahrzeugen der High-End-Klasse gefüllt, die nach einer guten, alten fashioned Autowäsche in der Mittagsonne funkeln. Fahren Sie weiter entlang der Straße zu meinem grauen Stuckhaus, mein koreanischer Nachbar ist immer draußen mit einem freundlichen Gesicht. Er verbringt den ganzen Tag damit, seinen Rasen zu mähen, und man kann ihn über das Summen seines Rasenmähers singen hören. Jeder im Viertel lacht darüber, aber er ist immer echt und eine erstaunliche Person mit einer einzigartigen Geschichte. Er ist älter geworden und hat im Laufe der Zeit etwas von seinem Verstand verloren. In seiner Vergangenheit war er Arzt und mischt sich normalerweise mit dem Gras und seinem John Deere Zero Turn Rasenmäher. Schließlich erreichen Sie mein Haus. Auf der Seite des Gartens sind Gänse zahlreich und werden von unserem Terrier verfolgt. Auf der Rückseite befindet sich ein kleiner Bach, der in den See mündet. Hier kann man Bullfrogs, den Bach und das gelegentliche \"Mäh\" der nahegelegenen Bauernhöfe hören. Über die handgefertigte Holzhängebrücke gelangt man zu einer unberührten Oase, gefüllt mit natürlich wachsenden Bäumen, Kräutern und Wildblumen. Hier verbrachte ich den größten Teil meiner Kindheit. Von Baumhäusern bauen bis zum \"Jagen\" von Tieren (was hauptsächlich darin bestand, sie zu verfolgen), es gab immer etwas zu tun und in der Regel ein Nachbarskind, mit dem man Freundschaft schließen konnte. Die Winter in meiner kleinen Stadt können schmerzhaft brutal sein, aber es gibt nichts Schöneres. Der Garten verwandelt sich von einem grünen Meer in eine leere Wildnis. Die Bäume, die einst leuchtende rosa, violette und orangefarbene Blumen beherbergten, werden zu kahlen Skeletten aus Rinde. Wenn es gelegentlich schneit, erscheint über Nacht ein Wintermärchen. Der Garten ist mit Schneemännern und Schneeflöcken, die von meiner kleinen Schwester gemacht wurden, gesäumt. Meine Schwester und ich haben uns als Kinder oft gestritten, und im Winter waren Schneebälle unser Waffe der Wahl. Wir bauten massive Iglu-ähnliche Festungen, um unsere Waffen zu beherbergen, meist mit Zweigen, wie eine Waffenkammer. In unserem eigenen kleinen Wunderland spielten wir Verstecken, während einer Zeit, in der nichts anderes zählte. Wir waren nur kleine Kinder, denen nichts ausgemachte Sorgen bereitete.\n\n\n[REWRITE] Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the cornfields that filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be shocked by the sparseness of the open landscape.

    "raw_output": "## German Translation:\n\nDas Erste, was man über Portland, Oregon verstehen muss, ist die Definition von „weird“. Das inoffizielle Stadtmotto, auf einem Gebäude, das als Pizzeria, Bar, Musikklub, Strip-Club dient und in mindestens der Hälfte dieser Unternehmungen mit dem Gesetz streitet, lautet „Keep Portland Weird“. Für manche ist es ein kleiner Aufruf, an das Portland der 90er und frühen 2000er Jahre zu erinnern, ein Portland, das weniger bekannt und weniger teuer war, und kreative und einzigartige Subkulturen hervorbrachte. Für andere ist es ein Ruf – kommt nach Portland, wo die Leute dich immer noch für „weird“ halten, aber dieses Mal als Kompliment. Trotz des Zustroms wohlhabender Kalifornier und des stetigen Baus von Eigentumswohnungen für diese Kalifornier bleibt Portland „weird“. „Weird“ bedeutet nicht immer akzeptierend, aber es bedeutet, Dinge zu akzeptieren, die normalerweise nicht akzeptiert werden. „Weird“ bedeutet nicht, dass wir keine modernen Annehmlichkeiten und moderne Kämpfe haben. Wie der Rest des Landes kaufen wir die meisten unserer Dinge aus China. Es gibt eine Million Möglichkeiten, „weird“ zu sein, nicht normal zu sein, aber Portland hat auch viel Normalität. Portland hat Yoga-Studios, Hipster und Geschäftsleute. Vielleicht bedeutet „weird“, dass wir all das einfach weniger ernst nehmen. In meiner Nachbarschaft, wie in vielen Portlander Nachbarschaften, haben wir farbenfrohe Häuser, Hausgärten mit Blumen, Kräutern und Gemüse, die die Straßen säumen, und kostenlose Kisten im Sommer. Die kostenlosen Kisten sind traditionell Kartons, die Gegenstände enthalten, die jemand loswerden möchte, aber sie können auch Plastiktüten oder Kisten sein. Sie enthalten etwas Magisches, ein Schatz, der genau dem Vorbeiziehenden perfekt passt, oft überraschend. In kostenlosen Kisten gibt es in der Regel Kleidung und Bücher, aber sie können alles enthalten. Das magische Potenzial, durch ein Viertel im Südosten von Portland zu schlendern, ist das, worum es in Portland geht. Das ist zumindest das, worum es in Portland geht, für mich, aber ich bin nur eine Variante von „weird“ unter Tausenden. Einige meiner Nachbarn würden niemals träumen, ihre Kleidung aus einer Box am Bürgersteig auszusuchen. Diese Leute gehen zu Ziegenyoga (ja, Yoga mit echten Ziegen) oder zu Timbers-Spielen (dem Fußballteam der Stadt). Portland ist voller Menschen, die alle möglichen Dinge lieben. Portland ist voller Menschen, die ihre Träume verfolgen oder davon träumen, ihre Träume zu verfolgen, während sie zu viel Zeit in der Bar verbringen. Ja, Portland hat ein Drogenproblem. Drogenprobleme neigen dazu, (in ihren Wurzeln) psychische Gesundheitsprobleme zu sein, und der konstante Regen über einen Großteil des Jahres, plus die düstere Bewölkung, scheinen einen Beitrag zu leisten. Portland hat auch ein Obdachlosenproblem, mit dem niemand etwas anfangen kann. Die Obdachlosenpopulation wird durch die sozialen Dienste angezogen, die Portland im Vergleich zu den meisten Teilen des Landes bietet, aber unsere Dienste sind unzureichend, wie in allen Teilen des Landes. Die nicht obdachlose Bevölkerung schwankt zwischen Fürsorge und Hass. Darin sind wir überhaupt nicht „weird“. \n\n\n\n[REWRITE] The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird.\"  The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90s and early 2000s, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures.

Egal wie sehr ich sie vergesse oder wie sehr ich mit Arbeit und Leben beschäftigt bin, sie sind da, standhaft, unbeeindruckt und unbeeindruckt von den Schwierigkeiten des Lebens. Dann an Tagen, an denen ich am gestresstesten und am meisten aufgewühlt bin, fordern sie Aufmerksamkeit, und wenn ich mich ihnen zuwende, lassen sie mich meine ängstliche Seele ruhen und verleihen mir etwas Kraft, weiterzumachen, einen Tag nach dem anderen. Ich bin hierhergezogen, als ich mein Studium begann, und die Berge nördlich des Campus waren das, was mich zuerst fesselte. Sicher, die Universität hat auch ihre eigenen atemberaubenden Sehenswürdigkeiten in Gebäuden, Teichen und Bäumen, die ihren eigenen Teil meines Herzens haben, aber es sind die Berge, die den Thron wirklich besetzen. Der Rest der Stadt ist auf seine eigene Weise schön. Es gibt unzählige Cafés, in denen ich viele Stunden mit Koffein getriebenem Lernen verbracht habe. Man kann zu Fuß oder mit dem Bus nur ein Stück weiter in die Innenstadt gehen und sich von einer Aura der Antike umgeben lassen, die von den verblassten bunten Ziegeln geprägt ist, die Restaurants und Bürogebäude säumen. Hier zeigt sich diese scheinbar vorstädtische Stadt so viel Trubel und Lebensfreude wie ihre benachbarte Großstadt. Das hält aber nicht lange an, denn man kann einmal wieder in die friedliche Kleinstadt entkommen, indem man an der Bibliothek vorbeigeht. Diese Dichotomie der Atmosphären in solcher Nähe verleiht dieser Stadt wirklich eine wunderbare Stimmung, als würde sie zum Entdecken eingeladen. Mit diesem Aufklärungsangebot lassen sich viele geliebte Erinnerungen schaffen, jede in Verbindung mit einem bestimmten Teil der Stadt. Sei es das Vorbeischlendern an den rostigen Schaukeln im Park mit Freunden nach einem ganzen Nachtstudium oder das Rennen durch die belebte Innenstadt, um den Film im schicken Kino zu sehen, für das die Universität Tickets bereitgestellt hat. Leider ist es auch der Ort vieler harter Erinnerungen, denn all die Orte sind im Leben dazu bestimmt, so zu sein. Die Teiche sind besonders ein passabler Ort zum Nachdenken sowie für Tränen in der Nacht um zwei Uhr mitten in einer existentiellen Krise. Letzteres habe ich mehr Erfahrung. \n\nWährend ich zusah, wie die Schildkröten, Enten und Insekten ihr Leben führten, jeder mit einem Beitrag oder einer Rolle, konnte ich mir nicht helfen, über meinen eigenen Sinn für den Zweck nachzudenken, als ich versuchte, dieses Mysterium namens Leben zu navigieren. Also ging ich am Teich, am Park und den kleinen Häusern vorbei, die von Vorstädte winken, bis ich eine Hauptstraße erreichte. Da schien die Sonne ihre strahlenden Strahlen auf die Palmen, malte den Himmel auf dem Weg und als ich zum Sonnenaufgang aufblickte, merkte ich, dass ich nach Norden ging. Sicher genug, sie waren da, wie sie immer da gewesen waren. Die stämmigen, übermächtigen Berge streiften den zerstäubten blau-gelben Himmel mehr als jedes Gebäude am Horizont und als ob sie ohne Worte sprachen, erregten sie in mir das Gefühl der Ausdauer.\n\n\n\n**[REWRITE]\n\nThe mountains are always there.

It was then that the sun shone its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy, imposing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building on the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.",

Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here.

Öffentliche Verkehrsmittel sind sehr gut erreichbar und eine der beliebtesten Verkehrsmittel in New York City. Bensonhurst ist ein ziemlich städtisches Viertel, also werden Sie sich immer noch in New York City fühlen. Bereiten Sie sich während Ihres Besuchs darauf vor, die verschiedenen Asia-Läden in der Umgebung zu sehen. In den letzten zwei Jahrzehnten hat Bensonhurst einen Zustrom asiatischer Einwohner erlebt. Deshalb werden Sie bei jedem Spaziergang mindestens einen asiatisch geführten Laden sehen. Am beliebtesten sind Supermärkte und Wäscherien. Zufällig sind diese Unternehmen bei den Anwohnern sehr beliebt, da die Lebensmittelqualität in den Supermärkten hervorragend ist, die Preise viel günstiger sind und schließlich, und nicht minder wichtig, es sehr praktisch ist. In unmittelbarer Nähe, wo ich bin, gibt es vier asiatische Supermärkte, die jeweils zwei Minuten zu Fuß voneinander entfernt sind. Das trägt einfach zur Erreichbarkeit von Lebensmitteln bei. Ich sage nicht, dass Bensonhurst ausschließlich von asiatischen Einwohnern bevölkert wird. Es ist ziemlich vielfältig, mit Einwanderern und ihren ein- und zweitgenerationen Kindern. Die meisten großen und beliebten Unternehmen in der Gegend sind von Asiaten geführt. Neben diesen asiatisch geführten Unternehmen gibt es auch einen kürzlich renovierten Park in der Nähe, der etwa zehn Basketballplätze, ein großes Feld für Fußball oder Baseball, vier Handballplätze, Schaukeln, einen Spielplatz für Kinder und sogar einen Wasserbrunnen, den Kinder im Sommer genießen können. Da wir uns in New York City befinden, sind die Parks natürlich sehr vielfältig. Sie werden hier alle möglichen Arten von Menschen sehen, die gut miteinander spielen und sich verstehen. In diesem Viertel gibt es nicht viele große Firmengebäude. Die einzigen Gebäude, die Sie finden würden, sind solche für Genossenschaftswohnungen oder Eigentumswohnungen. Die meisten Wohnräume sind jedoch Mehrfamilienhäuser. Die meisten Menschen sind zwar sehr nett, aber auch sehr laut. Jeden Tag würden Sie Autos hören, die ihre Musik laut aufdrehen, während sie an Ihrem Haus vorbeifahren, oder ständig das Gaspedal voll durchtreten, was Sie morgens aus dem Bett weckt. Wenn Sie nachts besuchen möchten, sollten Sie auf der Hut sein. Diese Gegend ist ziemlich sicher, aber die Menschen sind unberechenbar. Sie könnten auf Leute stoßen, die aus dem Nichts Ärger anfangen wollen, Mobber und Diebe. Ich selbst wurde in der Vergangenheit in diesem Viertel Opfer von körperlicher Gewalt, aber das war vor vielen Jahren. Ein anderes kürzlich bekannt gewordenes Ereignis betraf den Diebstahl von Paketen. Obwohl es gängig ist, gibt es in diesem Viertel Paketdiebe. Letztendlich, obwohl es in New York City eine Strafe für Leute gibt, die nicht nach ihren Hunden aufräumen, halten sich die Leute hier nicht an die Regeln. Jeden Morgen sehen Sie mindestens einen Hundekot auf dem Weg zum Bahnhof oder zum Supermarkt. Mein größter Dorn im Auge ist Hundekot auf dem Boden überall, wo ich in diesem Viertel hinführe. Seien Sie vorsichtig und halten Sie Ihre Schuhe sauber!\n\n\n##  Final English Translation:\n\n\n[REWRITE]If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it!

We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well.

Es kommen nicht viele Leute ein und aus, also habe ich mich an die meisten Menschen in der Nachbarschaft gewöhnt. Die Leute beschäftigen sich hauptsächlich mit Gartenarbeit und anderen täglichen Arbeiten. Im Winter fahren wir auf einer Hügel auf unserer Seitenstraße Schlitten. Wir wohnen in einem Haus in der Ecklage unserer Straße, daher sehen wir jeden Tag, wer kommt und geht, und sind mit den Autos vertraut, die hier herumfahren. Wenn wir ein seltsames Fahrzeug sehen, achten wir darauf. Einige Nachbarn gehen spazieren, um sich zu bewegen oder nur ihre Hunde auszuführen. Kinder spielen mit ihren Fahrrädern und all das, was man erwartet. Wir sind oft zu Hause, da wir von zu Hause aus arbeiten. Wir sind vier Personen: meine Frau, ich und zwei Töchter, die elf und vierzehn Jahre alt sind. Also würde ich sagen, dass sich alle anderen an unsere Auf- und Abwesenheit gewöhnt haben. Wir gehen nach draußen und spielen, manchmal sogar im Regen. Manchmal grillen wir draußen auf unserer Hinterterrasse und der Geruch vom Grill ist immer angenehm. Es scheint, als würde hier immer jemand Rasen mähen und man kann fast jeden Tag von März bis ungefähr Oktober, wenn das Gras endlich aufhört zu wachsen, einen Rasenmäher hören.

Das bedeutet also, dass wir die Blätter jährlich kehren und verbrennen müssen. Ich mag auch den Geruch von brennendem Laub, also ist das immer ein schöner Hinweis darauf, dass der Herbst gekommen ist. In letzter Zeit hatten wir nicht viele Winter, also fühlt es sich einfach wie ein langer Herbst an. Unsere Garage befindet sich hinten am Haus, daher benutzen wir die Haustür nur selten, es sei denn, jemand klingelt, was selten vorkommt.

I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent.

There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building.

    "raw_output": "Here is the German translation followed by the back-translation to English:\n\n**German Translation:**\n\nWenn man mich fragt, wie meine Nachbarschaft ist, bin ich sicher, dass meine Antwort etwas einzigartig ist. Während andere, die auf diese Frage antworten, höchstwahrscheinlich Hausbesitzer mit eigenem Leben sind, ist meine Situation etwas anders. Ich betrachte meine Nachbarschaft als den Campus, auf dem ich wohne, und die Menschen, die in meinem Studentenwohnheim leben, als meine Gemeinschaft. Ich betrachte auch den umliegenden Campus als meine Nachbarschaft, wenn auch in geringerem Maße. Trotz dieser Besonderheit teilt meine Nachbarschaft einige Gemeinsamkeiten mit den konventionelleren Vorstellungen von einer Nachbarschaft. Genau wie jede konventionelle Nachbarschaft hat die Nachbarschaft, in der ich wohne, Häuser, Menschen, Geschäfte und Parks. Beginnen wir mit der Diskussion über die „Häuser“, die meine Nachbarschaft ausmachen. Bevor ich mit der Erkundung der Häuser in meiner Nachbarschaft beginne, wäre es am besten, die Arten von Häusern zu klären, die in meiner Nachbarschaft zu finden sind. Es gibt drei Arten von Wohnraum in meiner unmittelbaren Nähe: die Wohnungen, die eigentlichen Häuser und die Studentenwohnheime.\n\nErstens gibt es in den Wohnungen in der Regel 2 bis 4 Personen pro Zimmer und etwa 4 bis 6 Zimmer pro Etage. Das häufigste Gebäude kann etwa 2 Etagen beherbergen, sodass durchschnittlich etwa 20 Menschen in jedem Gebäude wohnen. Zweitens gibt es die eigentlichen Häuser, die für jeden mit einer Zugehörigkeit zur Schule zum Mieten zur Verfügung stehen. Typischerweise handelt es sich dabei um Unterkünfte mit 2 bis 4 Schlafzimmern, in denen meist Alumni wohnen. Es gibt jedoch nur wenige dieser Hausarten, die in der Nachbarschaft verteilt sind, da sie weniger effizient sind. Schließlich gibt es die typischen Studentenwohnheime, die Hunderte von Studenten beherbergen. Hier teilen sich zwei Personen ein Zimmer, mit Ausnahme einiger Ausnahmen, und es ist die häufigste Wohnform in meiner Nachbarschaft.\n\nNachdem wir das Thema Wohnen behandelt haben, können wir zum Thema Menschen übergehen. Meine Schule ist stolz auf ihre Vielfalt, und dies spiegelt sich im Charakter meiner Nachbarschaft wider. Es gibt Menschen aus allen Kulturen und Altersgruppen, die in meiner Nachbarschaft leben. Die meisten Mitarbeiter des Kollegiums wohnen in den Häusern, die in der Nachbarschaft stehen, während die jüngeren Studenten in den Studentenwohnheimen und die älteren Studenten in den Wohnungen wohnen. Die Menschen in dieser Nachbarschaft lassen sich nicht einfach nur durch Gespräche beschreiben, daher ist es am besten, einfach zu den Geschäften und Parks in meiner Nachbarschaft überzugehen. Da meine Schule in der Tat eine eigenständige Nachbarschaft ist, verfügt sie über eine Fülle von Geschäften und einen einzigen Park. Die Geschäfte sind eine Mischung aus Essensmöglichkeiten, die man in jeder anderen Nachbarschaft finden würde, und dem eigenen, einzigartigen Markenangebot der Schule an Kleidung und Lebensmittelgeschäften. So kann alles gefunden werden, was man in den Grenzen meiner Nachbarschaft benötigt! Außerdem ist der Park in meiner Nachbarschaft ein Spielplatz für all die vielfältigen Menschen in meiner Nachbarschaft. Er wird von allen Mitgliedern meiner Nachbarschaft sauber und frei von Kriminalität gehalten!\n\n\n\n**[REWRITE]\n\nWhen asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique.

Zunächst war ich ziemlich traurig, als ich zum ersten Mal in meine Nachbarschaft kam. Ich bin aus Riverdale nach Stockbridge gezogen und ich werde nicht lügen, ich habe geweint, weil ich sie vermisst und geliebt habe. Aber meine Eltern wollten das Beste für mich und meine kleine Schwester, also sind wir in einen besseren Wohnort mit einer besseren High School gezogen, alles wurde als \"nicht heruntergekommen\" angesehen, als wir in unsere neue Nachbarschaft gezogen sind. Im Laufe der Jahre habe ich mich daran gewöhnt, habe mir neue Freunde und auch neue Feinde in der Schule gemacht. Ich habe im Laufe der Jahre nie wirklich meine Nachbarn richtig kennengelernt, außer Mr. Glen und seinen Kindern sowie Dennis für kurze Zeit, da sie direkt nebenan wohnten. Sie sind angenehme Leute, die ich auf gewisse Weise fast als Familie betrachten kann, und ich schätze sie wirklich. Ich erinnere mich, als ich, Mama, Papa und meine Schwester zu Mr. Glens Hochzeit gingen (sie haben sich wieder getraut). Es war wirklich lustig und angenehm, gelinde gesagt, und etwas, worauf ich mich freue, wenn ich irgendwann mein Vermögen aufbaue und meiner zukünftigen Frau das Leben einer Königin schenke. Als Frau Glens Frau, Ms. Veda, den weißen, kleinen Gurt an ihrem Bein abnahm und ihn warf, habe ich ihn gefangen! Leider habe ich die Blumen nicht gefasst! Wir haben die ganze Nacht getanzt und ich habe mich wirklich gefreut, eine gute Zeit mit Marsharii, einer ihrer Töchter, zu verbringen. Ich habe sie aber seitdem nicht mehr gesehen. Ich hoffe, sie ist zu größeren und besseren Dingen übergegangen. Die Nachbarschaft selbst ist wie ein Labyrinth, obwohl ich jetzt ein GPS habe, mit dem ich mehr Zeit zum Erkunden aufwenden kann. Ich bin nur so weit gekommen, und das war es, als ich mich mit meinen Freunden Kason und Curtis getroffen habe. Wir haben früher viel Videospiele gespielt und einfach das Leben in vollen Zügen genossen, so viel wir konnten. Manchmal ging ich in den Park und genoss die Natur, was meine Seele beruhigt. Es gibt mir ein Gefühl der Ruhe und des Friedens in diesen Tagen. Ich nehme auch ein paar Stöcke mit, die ich von Home Depot gekauft habe, und übe einfach mein Gleichgewicht. Und wenn es geht, bringe ich mein Holzschwert Bokken mit. Es macht mir Spaß, das zu tun, was ich liebe. Es gibt auch einen Basketball- und Tennisplatz, obwohl ich seit langem kein Tennis oder Basketball mehr gespielt habe. Es ist trotzdem schön, ihn zu haben, falls ich ihn jemals wieder aufnehmen und es noch einmal versuchen möchte. Mein Vater hat mich und meinen besten Freund mit Mr. Graves zum Tennis gebracht, und wir hatten immer eine tolle Zeit. Sie haben uns hart gearbeitet! Aber wir hatten immer Spaß. Ich denke, es gab viele Zeiten, in denen ich in dieser Nachbarschaft Spaß hatte, und es gibt viele Geschichten, aber diese sind es, die mir wirklich in Erinnerung geblieben sind, und ich glaube, das Beste steht noch bevor!\n\n## Rewritten English:\n\n[REWRITE]Well, considering I've been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know.

Es gibt mostly Wohnblöcke, aber ein paar Restaurants und Bars, die lustig sind und nicht so teuer sind. Eine der Bars wurde gerade umbenannt und ist teurer, aber der Service und die Getränke sind nicht wirklich schlecht. Die meisten Leute sind nett. Sie sind entweder Studenten oder haben ein geringeres Einkommen, da die Mietwohnungen nicht sehr teuer sind. In der Nähe gibt es viele Kinder, da es eine Grundschule in Gehweite von meiner Wohnung gibt. Ich kenne meine Nachbarn nicht, aber ich möchte sie auch nicht kennenlernen. Sie rauchen viel Gras und so hat die Verwaltung meines Gebäudes direkt vor ihrer Tür eine Duftstoffanlage angebracht, was meinem Freund und mir sehr lustig vorkommt. Es ist fast beleidigend. Die umliegenden Gebäude sehen meist alt aus, haben aber vielleicht renovierte Innenräume. Ein Stück weiter die Straße runter gibt es brandneue Wohnungen, aber ich mag sie nicht, weil ich weiß, dass die Bauarbeiten nicht besonders gut waren. Sie sind billig gebaut, aber die Miete ist teuer, was ich für einen Betrug halte, aber weil sie in der Nähe des Campus liegen, können die Verwalter dieser Gebäude damit durchkommen. Fünf Minuten von meinem Zuhause entfernt gibt es ein sehr günstiges Restaurant, das Essen nur auf Papiertassen serviert und die meisten Gerichte werden aufgewärmt. Gleich gegenüber befindet sich eine Tankstelle, in der ich gehört habe, dass es nicht sehr angenehm ist zu arbeiten. Dank einiger Gelder der Stadt wurde die Straße letztes Jahr neu asphaltiert, sodass es einen schönen breiten Bürgersteig, viel Gras auf den Mittelstreifen und den Seitenstraßen gibt und die Gegend jetzt etwas schöner ist. Aber das Apartmentgebäude, in dem ich wohne, ist von Bäumen umgeben. Sie haben ein paar gefällt, daher gibt es ein paar Stumps, aber es gibt viel mehr Bäume, wo ich wohne, als weiter die Straße runter. Hinter meinem Wohnkomplex liegt ein Baumsaum und dann ein weiteres Apartmentgebäude. Ich wohne in der 42. Straße, aber direkt dahinter liegt die 43. Straße, die nicht so schön ist. Die Bürgersteige sind wirklich schlecht und zerfallen, und die meisten Gebäude sehen heruntergekommen aus. Auf dieser Straße gibt es viele Bäume, aber das ist wahrscheinlich, um das Aussehen der Gebäude zu verbergen. Die meisten Verbrechen in meiner Gegend ereigneten sich in einem Apartmentkomplex auf dieser Straße, aber ich kann ihnen auch nicht die Schuld geben. Es gibt Wohnungen gegenüber von mir, die ebenfalls viele Verbrechen und eine eher wandernde Bevölkerung haben. Aber ich denke, ich mag, wo ich wohne. Ich kann es mir leisten und es gibt viele nützliche Annehmlichkeiten in der Nähe. Besonders mag ich, dass die Universität in Gehweite ist und es zwei Bushaltestellen gibt, sodass ich bequem zum Laden und in die Innenstadt gelangen kann.\n\n[REWRITE] My neighborhood is close to the college I attend, and for that, I really enjoy living there.

    "raw_output": "## German Translation (Automatic):\n\nMeine Nachbarschaft besteht aus Doppelhäusern in einer Sackgasse. Sie sind unregelmäßig platziert und so beabstandet, dass sie wie einzelne Häuser aussehen. Der einzige Unterschied ist, dass jedes Haus gelb gestrichen ist mit weißen Veranden und grünen Metalldächern. Fast jeder, aber nicht jeder, ist mit jedem anderen befreundet. Wir stehen an einigen Abenden am Ende einer nicht vorherbestimmten Einfahrt und plaudern, während die kleinen Kinder der Nachbarschaft mit ihren Spielzeug, Kreide oder Drachen spielen. Es ist sehr erfrischend in dieser modernen, all zu mechanischen/computergefüllten Welt. Es ist eher wie ein Schritt zurück in der Zeit. Wir sind von Feldern und Bäumen umgeben, die durch blaue Himmel und weiße, aufsteigende Wolken ergänzt werden. Der einzige Nachteil? Diese Saison erleben wir Tornado-Warnungen und zum ersten Mal, letzte Nacht haben wir tatsächlich richtige Warnschirne gehört, also mussten wir uns in Sicherheit begeben. Sicher, du hättest mich in meiner Badewanne gefunden, die kleinste Hündin fest in den Armen, zusammen mit meiner Handtasche und ein paar Kissen. Mein großer Hund wollte nichts mit dem Badezimmer zu tun haben und blieb im Wohnzimmer, nervös und bellend, nervös wegen der ungewöhnlichen Umstände. Die Nachbarschaft war ruhig, außer dem Geräusch großer Hagelkörner, die über den Boden fielen. Nach dem Sturm dampfte die Straße buchstäblich vor dem Temperaturwechsel. Wir sind in wenigen Minuten von 92 auf 75 Grad gesunken. Der Hagel schmolz sofort, als er auf den heißen Asphalt traf. Als ich zum klärenden Himmel hinaufblickte, kam die Sonne hervor und es begann zu regnen. Ein Doppelregenbogen tauchte auf. Ich rannte ins Haus und holte meine Kamera. Schnappte schnell ein paar Fotos, um sie mit meinen Facebook-Freunden und meiner Familie zu teilen. Sie waren wie ich sprachlos. Die Straßen blieben noch eine Stunde ruhig, bevor einige Leute endlich nach Hause kamen, wo sie auch waren, als der Gewittersturm hereinbrach. Dann war es wieder Alltag, Mütter und Kinder draußen, während das Abendessen kochte. Eine so freundliche Nachbarschaft für dieses Mädchen, das kürzlich aus NH nach NC gezogen ist. Ich liebe den südlichen Akzent, mit dem die Leute sprechen. Ich habe eine Zwei-Zimmer-Wohnung mit zwei Bädern, genau wie jeder andere. Obwohl alle Häuser äußerlich gleich aussehen, sind nicht alle Wohnungen innen gleich. Einige sind tatsächlich ziemlich klein. Es macht für mich keinen Sinn. Ich liebe es, entlang des größten Feldes hinter meinem Haus zu spazieren und in Richtung des Teiches zu schlendern, der nicht zum Schwimmen geeignet ist. Ich habe Rehe gesehen und am Morgen kann man das Lied des riesigen Bullfrogs hören. Es ist ein fantastischer Ort zu leben, nur vierzig Minuten außerhalb der Stadt Charlotte. Jeden Morgen wird man vom Gackern von Hühnern aus den umliegenden Bauernhöfen begrüßt. Es ist eher wie im kleinen Dorf einer eigenen Gemeinschaft zu leben. Wir haben sogar ein Esel auf einem nahegelegenen Bauernhof, dessen Brüllen wir abends hören, um uns wissen zu lassen, dass er da ist. Ich hatte Glück, diese Perle einer Nachbarschaft gefunden zu haben.\n\n\n## English Translation:\n\n[REWRITE]My neighborhood is made up of duplexes on a cul-de-sac.

    "original": "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",

Es fiel mir anfangs schwer, Freunde zu finden, aber ich habe mich mit jemandem anfreundet, der zwei Häuser weiter weg wohnt, und einem anderen Typen, der in meiner Straße wohnt. Weder der eine noch der andere wohnt dort mehr, aber die Erinnerungen sind immer noch da. Die meisten Leute, die hier lebten, als ich hierhergezogen bin, sind immer noch hier. Meine Nachbarschaft ist ziemlich ähnlich wie eine durchschnittliche amerikanische Vorstadtsiedlung. Die Nachbarschaft hat viele zweistöckige Häuser. Jedes Wochenende oder wenn es draußen warm ist, höre ich die Kinder draußen spielen. Die Nachbarschaft ist an den meisten Wochentagen ruhig. Ich habe noch nie Probleme mit irgendjemanden in der Nachbarschaft gehabt. Du wirst in dieser Nachbarschaft allein gelassen, es sei denn, du brauchst Hilfe. Ich habe mehrere Pakete online bestellt und habe noch nie ein Paket von meiner Veranda gestohlen. Ich habe das Gefühl, meinen Nachbarn zu vertrauen. Es gibt einen Park, der ein oder zwei Minuten von meinem Haus entfernt ist. Ich habe viele Erinnerungen an diesen Ort. Ich habe dort mit den anderen Jungs aus der Nachbarschaft Basketball, Fußball und Baseball gespielt. Ich habe dort auch eine meiner schlimmsten Erinnerungen, als ich beim Fußballspielen mit dem Ellbogen in die Nase getroffen wurde, aber die guten Erinnerungen überwiegen die schlechten. Heutzutage gehe ich in diesen Park, wenn ich bei meinen Cousins Kindern bin. Sie sind viel jünger als ich und spielen immer noch auf Schaukeln und Rutschen und all dem. Nur der Gedanke, in den Park zu gehen, macht sie aufgeregt. Der Park macht mich aus vielen Gründen sehr nostalgisch. Die Nachbarschaft ist sehr vielfältig. In der Nähe finden Sie alle möglichen Arten von Essen. Innerhalb eines Umkreises von einem Meile finden Sie chinesische, indische, mexikanische und italienische Restaurants. Heutzutage nutzen aber viele Menschen einfach Apps wie GrubHub und DoorDash, um sich Essen liefern zu lassen. Die beliebtesten Essensorte sind die Fast-Food-Läden, aber die finden Sie fast überall in einer Vorstadtsiedlung. Es gibt auch viele Pizzaläden. Die Geschäfte hier enthalten alles, was man je brauchen könnte. Es gibt mehrere Reinigungsservices in der Nähe. Es gibt einen Walgreens und einen CVS auf der gleichen Straße sowie einen Jewel-Osco Lebensmittelmarkt, der im Mittleren Westen beliebt ist. Einige der Geschäfte sind sogar so vielfältig wie ein indisch geführtes Geschäft, falls Sie jemals Lust haben, selbst indisches Essen zuzubereiten oder fertig zubereitetes indisches Essen zu kaufen.

    "original": "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community.

Sie hebt sich nicht von anderen Städten in South Carolina ab, aber sie hat einen bedeutenden Einfluss auf den Agrarsektor. Johnston ist als \"Peach Capital of the World\" bekannt, was die Stadt stolz auf dem Willkommensschild ausweist. Die Stadt besteht hauptsächlich aus Farmland, das entweder von Pfirsichbäumen oder Vieh dominiert wird. Häuser, die nicht im Hauptteil der Stadt liegen, sind weit voneinander entfernt; die meisten sind zweistöckig und haben entweder Metalldächer, um der glühenden Sommerhitze entgegenzuwirken, oder graue Schindeln. Meistens liegen diese Häuser nicht in der Nähe der Straße, sondern weiter hinten, damit die vorderen Felder für Tiere/Kulturen genutzt werden können. Im Hauptteil der Stadt befindet sich eine einzige Ampel, die an einer Kreuzung steht. Hier sind die einzigen Geschäfte in der ganzen Stadt. Es gibt drei Orte, an denen man \"Fast Food\" bekommen kann: Hong Kong, ein kleines chinesisches Restaurant, das von einer einzigen Familie betrieben wird, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant oder Gary's, eine kleine Burgerkette. Früher gab es eine Pizzeria, aber die ist vor kurzem geschlossen. Es gibt eine sehr kleine, familiengeführte Apotheke namens Maxwell and Halford Drug; seltsamerweise sind sie am bekanntesten für die Cherry Coca-Cola, die sie verkaufen. Es gibt einen kleinen, aber teuren Lebensmittelladen namens Independent Grocers Alliance, der gemeinhin als IGA bekannt ist. Obwohl es der einzige Lebensmittelladen in der ganzen Stadt ist, kaufen die meisten Menschen nur ein oder zwei Dinge dort und bevorzugen es, um die meisten ihrer Lebensmittel in einem Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville zu kaufen. Der beliebteste Laden in der ganzen Stadt ist Dollar General; dieser Laden verkauft eine große Auswahl an Alltagsartikeln und ist oft von der Eröffnung bis zur Schließungzeiten gut besucht! Es gibt einen sehr kleinen Möbelladen namens Possibilities Furniture & More, geführt von einer freundlichen Frau, die in der Gemeinde bekannt ist. Der Laden gibt es in Johnston seit vielen Jahren und beschäftigt sogar zwei Umzugshelfer, die die gekauften Möbel liefern! An das Gebäude des Möbelladens ist eine kleine Tierhandlung namens Clark's Cuts and Kennels angebaut. Sie bieten eine Vielzahl von Dienstleistungen an, wie z. B. Tagesbetreuung, Unterbringung, Pflege, Nagelschärfung, Baden usw. Sowohl eine Arztpraxis als auch eine Tierarztpraxis befinden sich außerhalb des Stadtzentrums; beide sind zwar klein, aber gut ausgestattet, um den Bewohnern von Johnston zu helfen. Es gibt eine einzige Grundschule namens Johnston Elementary School. Sobald die Schüler die fünfte Klasse abgeschlossen haben, müssen sie die Mittelschule und die High School in der nächsten Stadt besuchen. Es gibt technisch gesehen keine Parks innerhalb der Stadt, aber es wird derzeit ein 2,5 Hektar großes Erholungsgebiet geschaffen, um Familien mehr Möglichkeiten zum Ausgehen zu bieten und mehr Besucher/potenzielle Bewohner anzulocken. Zugegeben, es gibt nicht viel zu tun; es gibt keine Kinos, Bowlingbahnen, \"Hangout\"-Spots, Spielplätze für Kinder, Bereiche zum Gassi gehen mit Hunden oder eine große Auswahl an Restaurants. Trotzdem ist es eine nette Stadt, so klein, dass man sie im Nu übersehen könnte!\n\n\n\n[REWRITE]My neighborhood is a charming little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it has a significant impact on the agricultural sector. Johnston is known as the \"Peach Capital of the World,\" something the town proudly advertises on its welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not, these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back, allowing the front fields to be used for animals or crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stoplight that hangs at a four-way intersection. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places where you can get \"fast food\": Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however, it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small, family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; coincidentally, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it is often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community.

Fast jede Wohnung in der Gegend kostete über tausend Dollar pro Monat. Ich hatte noch nie von dieser Geschichte gehört, und noch nicht einmal meine Freunde. Vielleicht ist es das Kämpfen. Ich kenne ein paar meiner Freunde, die sich nachts vor Schlafenszeit weinen. Die Dinge sind teuer, aber wir haben im Laufe der Jahre gelernt, sparsam zu sein. Man beginnt, den staubigen Geruch von Flohmarkt-Spielzeug und geplagten Kleidern zu mögen. Man riecht im Erwachsenenalter viel weniger. Man beginnt vielleicht zu rauchen, oder man ist einfach zu sehr an den Zustand der Dinge gewöhnt. Aber der Flohmarkt macht sich immer wieder bemerkbar. Der Geruch vom Erwachsensein ist staubige Zeitschriften, die auf einem geschlossenen Klavier stapelweise liegen. Er setzt sich in das Leder fest und bleibt auch nach dem Waschen darin. Hier gibt es drei Secondhandläden in Gehweite. Wenn man auf der anderen Seite beginnt, kann man zwei karitative Secondhandläden, eine Bibliothek, einen Antiquariat und einen Kuriositätenladen besuchen. Die Innenstadt ist dicht besiedelt, Autos und Menschen füllen jeden Morgen die Straßen, aber man würde es in den Secondhandläden nie hören. Egal wie viele Menschen oder Autos vorbeifahren, der Laden ist still. Es ist ein schöner Ort, um einen Nachmittag zu versäumen. Jedes Jahr kommen immer mehr davon. Autos und Menschen überschwemmen es. Es ist eine wachsende Stadt, sagen sie. Da das Hauptquartier eines der größten Online-Imperien für E-Commerce und Lieferung ist, zeigt es immer noch Wachstumsschmerzen. Es erinnert mich an New York. Alles und jeder hat seine eigenen Ziele, und man bittet niemanden um viel. Man kann allein, ruhig und unabhängig sein, und die Leute lassen einen in Ruhe. Es ist nicht wie im Süden, wo ein bisschen Besorgtsein bedeutet, dass man sich kümmert. Man erkundigt sich hier nicht wirklich nach dem Leben der anderen. Man kann seine Hülle so lange aufrechterhalten, wie man möchte, und die Stadt rast und rollt wie Wellen am Strand zurück. Es ist ein lebhafter Ort, an dem man sein kann. Zwischen dem Pianisten nebenan und den zwei Amateuren, die oben singen, gibt es immer etwas los. In gewisser Weise haben wir weniger eine Wohnung von Fremden und mehr eine Gemeinschaft von Freunden. Wir kommen zusammen, um unsere Bedürfnisse zu befriedigen, Geburtstage zu feiern, Beerdigungen zu trauern und einander zu helfen, wenn wir können. In gewisser Weise bin ich glücklich hier. Ich mag die meisten meiner Nachbarn und sie behandeln mich ziemlich gut. Ich versuche, darauf zu achten, dass ich mich sauber halte und ihnen Essen hinterlasse, und sie tun dasselbe. Ich bringe ihnen Post und sie mir. Es ist schön, sie zu sehen, und ich glaube, sie genießen meine Gegenwart so sehr wie ich die ihre. Ich wohne in einem riesigen, entmenschlichendem modernen Gebäudekomplex, aber es sind Menschen wie meine Nachbarn, die mir das Gefühl geben, dass ich mein Leben nicht völlig ruiniert habe.\n\n\n[REWRITE]\n\nThe first time I heard of my neighborhood, I was listening to a podcast about missing people.

    "original": "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff.

    "raw_output": "Ich wohne in einer kleinen Stadt im Mittleren Westen, die sich direkt außerhalb der Vororte einer Großstadt befindet. Meine unmittelbare Nachbarschaft, auf der Ostseite der Stadt, könnte als das wirtschaftlich am stärksten benachteiligte Gebiet der Stadt bezeichnet werden. Die Immobilienwerte sind niedrig, wobei die meisten Häuser an einkommensschwache Personen vermietet oder von ihnen bewohnt werden. Es ist jedoch nicht unattraktiv oder unangenehm. Meine Nachbarn sind im Allgemeinen freundliche Menschen, die mir lächeln und Hallo sagen, wenn ich die Straße entlang gehe. Die Kriminalitätsraten sind zwar etwas höher als in anderen Stadtteilen, liegen aber im Allgemeinen immer noch niedrig. In den letzten zehn Jahren gab es innerhalb weniger Blocks von meinem Haus einige gewaltsame Verbrechen, darunter einige Schüsse und mindestens ein Mord. Unsere Nachbarn verloren letztes Jahr ihren Sohn bei einem Schusswechsel vor einem Barbereich. Glücklicherweise hat unsere Familie keine direkten Auswirkungen von Kriminalität erfahren, außer dass gelegentlich ein Gegenstand von unserem Veranda verschwindet, wenn wir vergessen, ihn nach drinnen zu bringen. Im Allgemeinen hat die Stadt, in der ich wohne, unter der „Opioid-Epidemie“ gelitten, die viele Teile der Vereinigten Staaten betroffen hat. Viele Leben sind durch Fentanyl-Überdosierungen verloren gegangen. Glücklicherweise gibt es in meiner Stadt viele Ressourcen, um diese Epidemie zu bekämpfen, darunter mehrere Einrichtungen zur Behandlung von Sucht und Narcan-Schulungen für Familien und Freunde von Menschen, die von Sucht betroffen sind. Trotz dieser Herausforderungen hat diese Stadt viele positive Eigenschaften. Die Grundschule meines Sohnes verfügt über ein ausgezeichnetes Personal, vom Schulleiter über die Lehrer bis hin zum Betreuungspersonal. Trotz seiner besonderen Bedürfnisse hat er bisher aufgrund der unglaublich positiven Atmosphäre der Schule keine Mobbing erlebt und er liebt es dort. Wir haben einen aktiven Förderverein, der das ganze Jahr über mehrere Veranstaltungen plant, um die Familienbeteiligung und den Bildungserfolg zu fördern. Da über 20 % der Bevölkerung unserer Stadt unterhalb der Armutsgrenze leben, stellt die Grundschule allen Schülern kostenloses Frühstück und Mittagessen bereit, damit kein Kind hungern muss. Keine Familie oder kein Kind wird aufgrund mangelnder finanzieller Mittel als „weniger“ behandelt, und die Kosten für Schulgebühren, Unterrichtsmaterialien und Schulausflüge sind sehr angemessen. Der Stadtrat und das Personal haben viele Verbesserungen an der Optik unserer Stadt vorgenommen, darunter die Umgestaltung von Straßen, die Bepflanzung und die Renovierung von Stadtparks. Leider haben die meisten dieser Verbesserungen im Zentrum der Stadt und auf der Westseite stattgefunden, wo sich die meisten Einkaufsmöglichkeiten befinden und der größte Teil des Verkehrs fließt. Die Ostseite, wo ich wohne, wird in der Regel vernachlässigt, was für die Menschen in meiner Nachbarschaft ein Streitpunkt ist. Insgesamt genieße ich es, in dieser Stadt zu leben. Die Menschen sind im Allgemeinen freundlich, die Schulen sind großartig, es gibt genügend Einkaufsmöglichkeiten (beide, kleine Geschäfte und größere Einzelhandelsgeschäfte), um den Bedürfnissen meiner Familie gerecht zu werden, und unser Haus mag nicht viel wert sein, aber es ist komfortabel und ausreichend. Unsere Familie lebt hier seit über 16 Jahren und wir können uns nicht vorstellen, irgendwo anders zu leben.\n\n\n[REWRITE]\nI live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction.

    "original": "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",

    "raw_output": "## German Translation:\n\nMein Viertel ist voller Kultur. Es liegt auf einem Hügel, umgeben von Gebäuden mit historischer Bedeutung. Ich wohne in einem siebenstöckigen Apartmentgebäude direkt gegenüber dem alten Theater und ein Block den Hügel hinunter befindet sich eine coole kleine Spielhalle, die an warmen Sommerabenden von verschiedenen Menschen besucht wird. Oft, besonders an den Wochenenden im Juni und Juli, sieht man eine Schlange von Menschen, die darauf warten, hineinzukommen. Ein paar Blocks weiter oben befindet sich der nächste Stadtpark. Er ist ziemlich groß, wenn man bedenkt, in welchem Stadtteil er liegt. Der Park ist von Beton umgeben, mit hohen Treppen, die in die Wand gegossen sind. Während der frostigen Wintermonaten schlagen Obdachlose ihre Zelte in ordentlichen Reihen entlang des Gehwegs und der breiten Treppen auf. Es schneit nicht viel, aber es regnet, und der sintflutartige Regen in den Monaten Mittewinter macht es oft schwierig, warm zu bleiben. Indem sie ihre Zelte dicht beieinander aufstellen, mitten in der Stadt anstatt im Dschungel, bleiben sie viel wärmer. Sie sind außerdem in vernünftiger Geh- und Transportentfernung zum einzigen Familienzentrum für Meilen, wo sie baden und duschen können. Was ich an meiner Stadt liebe, ist nicht die Schönheit der historischen Umgebung - die hohen stolzen Gebäude, die Architektur, die durch die verschiedenen Ebenen der Hügel verteilt ist, die zum Meer hinabrollen. Was ich an meinem Viertel liebe, ist die Kultur der Menschen selbst. Sieht du, Hilltop war einst das berüchtigteste Viertel an der Westküste für Gang-Gewalt. Man hört immer noch Geschichten, selbst drei Jahrzehnte später, von Bundesbeamten und der DEA, die wie ein Besen durchziehen, um die Straßen zu säubern. Die Menschen vergessen das nicht. Geschichten werden immer noch von Generation zu Generation weitergegeben, bis hin zu Transplantaten wie mir, von diesen Tagen. Die Menschen arbeiten hart, obwohl es immer noch eines der raueren Viertel der gesamten Stadt gilt, um es sauber zu halten. Sie kümmern sich immer noch um das, was in ihrer Stadt, in ihrem Block passiert. Sie sagen, wenn du weiß bist, solltest du nicht nach Einbruch der Dunkelheit durch den Hügel laufen. Wirklich glaube ich, dass diese Warnung an die alten Tage erinnert und mit dem sauren Geschmack der sozialen Konditionierung angehaucht ist. Vielleicht bin ich einfach dunkel genug, um als nicht ganz \"weiße Mädchen\" durchzugehen, oder vielleicht erkennt Hilltop mich als einen von ihnen, als jemanden, der sich genauso schmerzhaft bewusst ist der Erinnerungen, die unsere Nation ständig verfolgen. Erinnerungen daran, dass Rassismus, kulturelle Konditionierung und Annahmen aus Ignoranz und Angst entstehen, selbst in einer Stadt, die ein kulturelles Schmelztiegel-Utopie sein soll. Ich weiß eines: egal wie weit ich reise, der Hilltop ist Heimat. Ich fühle mich lebendig, wenn ich nachts auf diesen Straßen spaziere und Menschen treffe, die mir schneller und seltener aus Schurkenmotiven ein Jackett angeboten haben als um mich auszurauben. Es ist ein Ort, an dem Waschsalonbesitzer etwas länger geblieben sind, damit ich mein Telefon aufladen konnte, als ich nirgendwo vor dem Regen fliehen konnte. Es ist ein Ort, an dem ich mich, glaube ich, unsichtbar, an Beton-Ladenzäunen an den grauesten und trostlosesten Nächten versteckt habe, nur um von jemandem angehalten zu werden, der mir in die Augen schaut, mir 5 Dollar gibt und mir sagt, ich sei schön und wertvoll.\n\n[REWRITE] My neighborhood is full of culture.

Arbeitsame Menschen, die arbeiten, um ihren Lebensunterhalt zu verdienen, und entweder Familien großziehen oder aufgewachsen sind. An jedem Tag siehst du Kinder, die auf den Straßen auf und ab rennen. Du siehst auch Menschen, die Hunde Gassi führen, Rad fahren und Rollschlittschuhe tragen. Nachbarn kennen Nachbarn und man erkennt, wer dazugehört und wer nicht dazugehört. Du siehst jemanden, der draußen grillt und winkt, oder sogar jemanden, der seinen Hund ein paar Blocks entfernt spazieren führt und freundlich lächelt. Die Rasenflächen sind in einem anständigen Zustand. Niemand hat Laub von der Herbstzeit angehäuft. Der grüne Rasen wird gemäht und im Zaum gehalten.
