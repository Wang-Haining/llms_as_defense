Wohnbereiche sind scheinbar zufällig zwischen Gewerbegebieten verteilt, in denen eine Vielzahl von Unternehmen betrieben werden. Einige dieser Unternehmen bestehen aus Büros, während andere verschiedene Geschäfte, Restaurants und Unterhaltungsmöglichkeiten bieten. Es gibt keine Mangel an neuen Restaurants, in denen man essen kann, oder an Geschäften, in denen man einkaufen kann. Während einige Geschäfte große, bekannte Marken sind, die von großen Unternehmen betrieben werden, gewinnen auch kleine Boutiquen immer an Popularität. Sie befinden sich nicht nur in verschiedenen Einkaufszentren, sondern säumen auch die Straßen, die oft in Gehweite von Vierteln liegen, die sonst ruhig und friedlich wären, wenn sie nicht von so vielen Sehenswürdigkeiten umgeben wären. Es gibt auch ein paar nahegelegene Parks, und ich habe bemerkt, dass die Leute diese Parks mit ihren kleinen Kindern besuchen. Apropos Menschen, es gibt tatsächlich eine ziemliche Vielfalt in meiner Nachbarschaft. An einem kleinen Ort haben wir eine prominente LGBTQ+ -Gemeinschaft, eine orthodoxe jüdische Gemeinschaft und eine Sammlung von Flüchtlingen und Immigranten aus der ehemaligen Sowjetunion. Etwas weiter außerhalb meiner Nachbarschaft gibt es viele mehr Menschen verschiedener Rassen und Herkunft, obwohl sie manchmal in eigenen kleinen Gemeinschaften innerhalb der Stadt leben. Wir haben Orte wie Koreatown, Chinatown, Little Armenia und viele mehr, die nur wenige Kilometer entfernt sind. Allerdings können ein paar Meilen sich als sehr lange Fahrt erweisen. Eine Fahrstrecke von nur 10 Meilen kann manchmal zwei Stunden dauern, aufgrund des Verkehrs, insbesondere zur Stoßzeit. Fast niemand in meiner Stadt läuft irgendwohin. Während bestimmte Sehenswürdigkeiten unweigerlich in der Nähe sind, ist die Stadt riesig und die Leute bevorzugen es im Allgemeinen nicht, zu Fuß zu pendeln. Als Ergebnis haben wir auch einen der schlimmsten Verkehrsstaus der Welt, und es ist schwierig, Parkplätze fast überall zu finden. Ironischerweise gab es in den letzten Jahren eine große Zahl an Bauarbeiten, da große Wohnblocks in die Stadt gebaut werden. Es scheint ein beliebtes Ziel zu sein, aber viele Anwohner sind enttäuscht von der Aussicht auf noch mehr Menschen, die einziehen, und noch mehr Fahrzeuge auf den Straßen. Es gibt viele verschiedene Arten von Häusern in meiner Stadt. Nicht jeder lebt oder möchte in einem großen Apartmentgebäude leben. Wohnbereiche bestehen aus Häusern verschiedener Größen und kleineren Apartment buildings und Eigentumswohnungen. Einige Grundstücke enthalten Einfamilienhäuser, während andere Doppelhäuser enthalten. Dies gilt sogar innerhalb meiner unmittelbaren Nachbarschaft, daher gibt es auch keinen Mangel an Vielfalt in Bezug auf Wohnmöglichkeiten. Ähnlich ist die Nachbarschaft aus Menschen unterschiedlichen Alters zusammengesetzt, und um ehrlich zu sein, kenne ich die Mehrheit meiner Nachbarn nicht. Es ist heutzutage keine wirklich enge Gemeinschaft, obwohl ich viele Erinnerungen aus meiner Kindheit habe, wie ich mit meinem Nachbarn und ein paar anderen Freunden aus der Nachbarschaft gespielt habe, die alle in meinem Alter waren.\n\n\n\n## English Translation:\n\n[REWRITE]\n\nSince I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse.

Es erinnert, wie die meisten anderen auch, an eine Zeit nicht so lange her, als das Leben im Vorort der amerikanische Traum war. Dieser Traum schien die Menschen dieses Landes einst zu umarmen, aber jetzt zieht er sich zurück. Aber meine Nachbarschaft und viele andere bleiben noch bestehen, rufen uns und den Besuchern immer noch zu, dass der Traum noch am Leben ist, und wir halten so gut wir können daran fest. Die Leute fühlen sich nicht mehr so optimistisch wie früher, die Pflege der kleinen Gärten ist nicht mehr so gut wie früher, aber es steht immer noch ein Auto oder zwei in jeder Einfahrt, und die Kinder spielen immer noch so, als wäre die Welt um sie herum der ganze Inhalt ihres Daseins. Die öffentliche Schule, die fast 90 Jahre hier steht, steht immer noch und scheint in den Jugendlichen von heute eine Zukunft zu wecken, während sie bei den älteren Anwohnern Nostalgie hervorruft. Die Kirchen sind weit auseinander und größtenteils leer, aber die Basketballplätze sind immer noch voller Leben. Alle Häuser sehen anders aus, fühlen sich aber gleich an. Es gibt einen großen Supermarkt namens Super \"A\", der in Besitz einer großen jemenitischen Familie ist, die wahrscheinlich die einzige arabische Familie in der Nachbarschaft ist. Die überwältigende Mehrheit der Bewohner ist afroamerikanisch. Die Straßen sind breit und die Kinder spielen normalerweise Fußball, und halten nur inne, um dem vorbeifahrenden Verkehr Platz zu machen. Die meisten Menschen in meiner Nachbarschaft leben schon seit Generationen hier und die meisten können Geschichten von einer Zeit erzählen, in der jeder jeden kannte. Es gab eine Karate-Schule, aber als Hollywood damit aufhörte, Karate Kid Filme zu produzieren, wollten die Kinder nicht mehr Karate Kid sein, also ist es jetzt eine Apotheke, denn Drogen machen alles besser, oder so habe ich gehört. Es gibt auch ein kleines Kino, das alte Filme zu ermäßigten Preisen zeigt und von den Massen verschont wird, weil die Jugendlichen ihre Abneigung gegenüber fehlenden Neuerscheinungen haben, aber von den Älteren bevorzugt wird, die es für einen kleinen Preis für einen Ausflug halten, natürlich ohne die Kinder. Es gibt eine einzige Schnellstraße, die durch meine Stadt führt. Obwohl die Ein- und Ausfahrt sich in der Nachbarstadt befinden. Es gab einst eine Petition, um eine Ausfahrt für unsere Stadt zu bekommen. Die Jugendlichen unterstützten es, während die Älteren sich weigerten. Es scheint, als würde die Schnellstraße in unserer Stadt alles ruinieren, sagten die Älteren, die schließlich den Stadtrat davon überzeugten, den Antrag abzulehnen. Sie bauen eine neue Highschool und wir versuchen, uns für einen Maskottchen für unsere Stadt zu entscheiden.

Zumindest nicht einen Ort, an dem die meisten Menschen leben wollen würden. Aber wenn man hinter dem alten, verlassenen Whole Foods geht und hinter den Hotels zurückgeht, die nur für ein paar Familien-Wiedersehensfeste im Sommer bewohnt sind, findet man eine ganze belebte Gemeinschaft. In diesen Gemeinschaften, auf diesen Straßen, befinden sich einige Apartmentkomplexe - nebeneinander platziert, sorgfältig wie russische Matrjoschka-Puppen, die akribisch und sorgfältig auseinandergenommen und in einer Reihe an der Straße aufgestellt wurden. Die ersten Apartments, die man sieht, sind in den Nachrichten für einige weniger wünschenswerte Geschäfte bekannt geworden, also werden wir uns nicht zu sehr darauf konzentrieren - denn das Aussehen kann schließlich täuschen. Aber die Apartments neben diesem Komplex und die beiden Komplexe daneben sind eine ganz andere Welt, von fast niemanden in diesem Gebiet.  \n\nGegenüber diesen Komplexen befindet sich ein Satellitencampus einer Fachhochschule - ein ruhiger, verschlafener Gebäudekomplex, der an der Straße wie ein Wachmann steht, wo Studenten mit einem Kaffee in der Hand morgens um sieben Uhr mit müden Augen ihren Tag beginnen. Die eisernen Tore knarren auf und lassen sie einzeln herein, während Pendler mit faustzornigen Gesten aus dem Fenster wütend auf sie zucken und sie für die Verkehrsbehinderung am Tag mit höherer Studentenzahl kritisieren. Die Straße mündet in eine weitere Wohngegend, auf einer Seite befindet sich ein Park und auf der anderen Seite eine Rehabilitationsstätte für Menschen, die sich bei unglücklichen Umständen Knochen gebrochen haben. Das Behandlungszentrum verfügt über fröhliche Verandafurnituren und einen träge schwingenden Deckenventilator, der die warme, dichte Sommerluft hin und her bewegt. Kinder laufen im Park auf der anderen Straßenseite hin und her, wirbeln und drehen sich über die stacheligen grünen Stängel, während Bienen in den Blumenbeeten am Straßenrand träge kreisen. Alte Rentner spazieren mit ihren Hunden über den Gehweg, knurren den Jugendlichen auf ihren Skateboards und nickt demütig den Teenagerinnen zu, die sich am Spielplatz versammelt haben und über Jungs und die neuesten YouTube-Stars klatschen. \n\nEs gibt ein Sushi-Restaurant in einem Gewerbegebiet neben dem Park, das günstiges Essen anbietet, aber nie zu voll ist - direkt daneben ein Schwimmbadfachgeschäft und ein Nagelstudio dazwischen. Man könnte seinen Pool für die Saison füllen lassen, während man sich die Nägel machen und Hähnchen-Hibachi essen lässt – die Schönheit eines Einkaufszentrums. Es gibt auch ein Selbstbedienung-Frozen-Yogurt-Fachgeschäft dort, und man sieht oft die Jugendlichen im Park mit kalten, schwitzenden Bechern mit Frozen Yogurt, bedeckt mit Toppings, während sie auf ihren Skateboards Stunts machen und rauchen, weil sie es für das Coolste halten.

She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",

    "raw_output": "\"Wo ist alles?\" fragte sie, als wir an den Maisfeldern vorbeifuhren, die den Horizont füllten. \"Das ist es!\" sagte ich, sicher, dass sie den sparsamen Charakter der offenen Landschaft schockieren würde. Sie stammte aus einer Stadt, in der der Supermarkt nur 5 Minuten zu Fuß von ihrem Haus entfernt war - sie hatte noch nie so viel offene Fläche in ihrem Leben gesehen. Überrascht von der Allgegenwärtigkeit der Maisfelder erzählte ich ihr, wie es war, in ländlichem Ohio aufzuwachsen, und in diesem Moment erfuhr sie endlich, wer ich war und woher ich kam. Fahren Sie auf einer zwei Fahrspuren Landstraße, erreichen Sie ein Steinbruch, das mit Wasser gefüllt ist. Direkt danach liegt die kleine Wohnanlage, in der ich wohne. Die Häuser bestehen hauptsächlich aus Ziegel und Stuck. Jedes Haus hat mindestens ein halbes Morgenland, das jeder mit Stolz pflegt. Während des Frühlings gibt es neben den Bäumen des Mittleren Westens, die sich in jeder Jahreszeit verändern, reichlich gepflanzte Blumen. Die Zufahrten sind alle mit den luxuriösen Mercedes-Benz-Fahrzeugen der obersten Klasse gefüllt, die nach einer guten, alten, mit Leib und Seele durchgeführten Waschanlage in der Mittagssonne glänzen. Weiter auf dem Weg zu meinem grauen Stucco-Haus ist mein koreanischer Nachbar immer draußen mit einem freundlichen Gesicht. Er verbringt den ganzen Tag damit, seinen Rasen zu mähen, und man kann ihn über das Summen seines Mäher hören. Jeder im Viertel lacht über ihn, aber er ist immer echt und eine außergewöhnliche Person mit einer einzigartigen Geschichte. Er ist älter geworden und hat mit zunehmendem Alter etwas an seinem Witz verloren. In seiner Vergangenheit war er Arzt und mischt sich normalerweise mit dem Gras und seinem John Deere Zero Turn Rasenmäher. Schließlich erreichen Sie mein Haus. Auf der Seite des Gartens sind Enten reichlich vorhanden und werden von unserem Terrier verfolgt. Dahinter befindet sich ein kleiner Bach, der in den Steinbruch mündet. Hier kann man Frösche, den Bach und das gelegentliche „Mooo“ der nahegelegenen Bauernhöfe hören. Über die handgefertigte Holzhängebrücke gelangt man zu einer unberührten Oase, gefüllt mit natürlich wachsenden Bäumen, Kräutern und Wildblumen. Hier verbrachte ich den größten Teil meiner Kindheit. Von Baumhäusern bis hin zum „Jagen“ von Tieren (was hauptsächlich darin bestand, sie zu jagen), gab es immer etwas zu tun und normalerweise war ein Nachbarkind für die Freundschaft da. Die Winter in meiner kleinen Stadt können schmerzhaft brutal sein, aber es gibt nichts Schöneres. Der Garten verwandelt sich von einem Meer aus Grün in eine leere Wildnis. Die Bäume, die einst bunte rosa, lila und orangefarbene Blumen beherbergten, verwandeln sich in kahle Skelette aus Rinde. Wenn man gelegentlich mit Schnee gesegnet wird, erscheint über Nacht ein Wintermärchen. Der Garten ist mit Schneemännern und Schneemännern gesäumt, die von meiner kleinen Schwester gemacht wurden. Meine Schwester und ich haben in unserer Kindheit oft gestritten, und im Winter waren Schneebälle unsere Waffe der Wahl. Wir bauten massive, igluartige Festungen, um unsere Waffen aufzubewahren, normalerweise mit Ästen, wie ein Arsenal. In unserer eigenen kleinen Wunderwelt spielten wir Schlaraffenland, in einer Zeit, in der nichts anderes zählte. Wir waren einfach kleine Kinder ohne Sorgen.\n\n\n[REWRITE]\n“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the cornfields that filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock at the sparseness of the open landscape.

    "raw_output": "## German Translation: \n\nDas Erstes, was man über Portland, Oregon verstehen muss, ist die Definition von \"weird\". Das inoffizielle Stadtmotto, auf einem Gebäude, das gleichzeitig als Pizzeria, Bar, Musikclub, Strip-Club dient und sich in mindestens der Hälfte dieser Unternehmungen an der Grenze des Gesetzes befindet, lautet \"Keep Portland Weird\". Für manche ist dies ein kleiner Aufruf, sich an das Portland der 90er und frühen 2000er Jahre zu erinnern, ein Portland, das weniger bekannt und weniger teuer war und kreative und einzigartige Subkulturen hervorgebracht hat. Für andere ist es ein Aufruf - komm nach Portland, wo die Leute dich immer noch seltsam nennen werden, aber diesmal als Kompliment. Trotz des Zustroms wohlhabender Kalifornier und des ständigen Baus von Eigentumswohnungen, um diese Kalifornier unterzubringen, bleibt Portland fremd. \"Weird\" bedeutet nicht immer Akzeptanz, aber es bedeutet die Akzeptanz von Dingen, die normalerweise nicht akzeptiert werden. \"Weird\" bedeutet nicht, dass wir keine modernen Annehmlichkeiten und moderne Kämpfe haben. Wie der Rest des Landes kaufen wir die meisten unserer Dinge aus China. Es gibt Millionen von Möglichkeiten, seltsam zu sein, nicht normal zu sein, aber Portland hat auch viel Normalität. Portland hat Yoga, Hipster und Geschäftsleute. Vielleicht bedeutet \"weird\" einfach, dass wir all das weniger ernst nehmen. In meiner Nachbarschaft, wie in vielen Portlander Nachbarschaften, haben wir bunte Häuser, Hausgärten mit Blumen, Kräutern und Gemüse, die die Straßen säumen, und kostenlose Boxen im Sommer. Freie Boxen sind traditionell Kartons, in denen jemand Gegenstände loswird, können aber auch Plastiktüten oder Kartons sein. Sie enthalten etwas Magisches, ein Schatz, der genau für den Vorbeikommenden perfekt ist, überraschenderweise oft. Freie Boxen enthalten oft Kleidung und Bücher, aber sie können alles enthalten. Das magische Potenzial, durch einen Stadtteil im Südosten von Portland zu spazieren, ist das, worum es in Portland geht. Das ist zumindest das, worum es in Portland für mich geht, aber ich bin nur eine von Tausenden Variationen von \"weird\". Manche Menschen, mit denen ich zusammenlebe, würden nie träumen, ihre Kleidung aus einer Box am Bürgersteig zu nehmen. Diese Leute gehen zum Ziegen-Yoga (ja, Yoga mit echten Ziegen) oder zu Timbers-Spielen (dem Fußballteam der Stadt). Portland ist voll von Menschen, die alle möglichen Dinge lieben. Portland ist voll von Menschen, die ihre Träume verfolgen oder träumen davon, ihre Träume zu verfolgen, während sie zu viel Zeit in der Bar verbringen. Ja, Portland hat ein Drogenproblem. Drogenprobleme neigen dazu, (an ihrer Wurzel) psychische Gesundheitsprobleme zu sein, und der konstante Regen während eines großen Teils des Jahres, gepaart mit den trüben Wolken, scheint einen Beitrag zu leisten. Portland hat auch ein Obdachlosenproblem, mit dem niemand etwas anfangen kann. Die Obdachlosenpopulation wird von den Sozialdiensten angezogen, die Portland bietet, die in den meisten Teilen des Landes besser sind, aber unsere Dienstleistungen sind unzureichend, wie in allen Teilen des Landes. Die nicht obdachlose Bevölkerung schwankt zwischen Fürsorge und Hass. Dabei sind wir überhaupt nicht seltsam.\n\n[REWRITE]\nThe first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\".

Egal, wie sehr ich sie vergesse oder wie sehr ich mit Arbeit und Leben beschäftigt bin, um sie zu bemerken, sie sind da, unbeeindruckt, unbeeinflusst und unbeeindruckt von den Lebensnöten. Dann an Tagen, an denen ich am meisten gestresst und aufgewühlt bin, fordern sie, gesehen zu werden, und wenn ich mich ihnen zuwende, lassen sie mich meine ängstliche Seele ruhen und verleihen mir etwas Stärke, um weiterzumachen, Tag für Tag. Ich bin hierher gezogen, als ich mein Studium begann, und die Berge nördlich des Campus, die waren es, die mich zuerst gefangen haben. Sicher, die Universität hat auch ihre eigenen atemberaubenden Sehenswürdigkeiten in Gebäuden, Seen und Bäumen, die ihren eigenen Platz in meinem Herzen haben, aber es sind die Berge, die wirklich den Thron besetzen. Der Rest der Stadt ist auf seine Weise schön. Es gibt unzählige Cafés, in denen viele Stunden mit Koffein getriebenem Lernen verbracht wurden. Man kann zu Fuß oder mit dem Bus nur einen kurzen Weg weiter in die Innenstadt gehen und in eine Aura der Antike eintauchen, die von den verblassten bunten Ziegeln geprägt ist, die Restaurants und Bürogebäude säumen. Hier zeigt sich diese scheinbar vorstädtische Stadt so voller Trubel und Lebendigkeit wie ihre benachbarte Großstadt. Dies hält aber nicht lange an, denn man kann, indem man die Bibliothek passiert, erneut in das ruhige Städtchen entfliehen. Diese Dichotomie der Atmosphären in solcher Nähe verleiht dieser Stadt wirklich eine wundersame Atmosphäre, als ob sie zum Entdecken eingeladen wäre. Mit dieser Umgebung lässt sich leicht viele kostbare Erinnerungen schaffen, jede in Verbindung mit einem bestimmten Teil der Stadt. Ob es darum geht, nach einem langen Nachtstudium mit Freunden an den rostigen Schaukeln im Park vorbeizugehen oder durch die geschäftige Innenstadt zu laufen, um den Film im schicken Kino zu sehen, für das die Universität Tickets besorgt hat. Leider ist es auch das Zuhause vieler Schmerzlicher Erinnerungen, wie es allen Orten im Leben passieren muss. Die Seen sind besonders ein geeigneter Ort für die Reflexion sowie für Tränen in der Nacht um zwei Uhr morgens mitten in einer existentiellen Krise. Letzteres habe ich mehr Erfahrung mit. Während ich beobachtete, wie Schildkröten, Enten und Insekten ihr Leben auslebten, jeder mit einem Beitrag oder einer Rolle, konnte ich mir meine eigene Sinnfrage nicht helfen, als ich versuchte, dieses Rätsel namens Leben zu meistern. Also ging ich am See vorbei, am Park und den kleinen Häusern vorbei, die von Vorstädtischem Charakter strotzen, bis ich eine Hauptstraße erreichte. Es war dann, dass die Sonne ihre strahlenden Strahlen auf die Palmen warf und den Himmel entlangmalte, und als ich zum Sonnenaufgang aufblickte, wurde mir klar, dass ich nach Norden ging. Sicher genug, sie waren da, wie immer. Die stämmigen, imposanten Berge streiften den nebeligen blau-gelben Himmel mehr als jedes Gebäude am Horizont, und als ob sie ohne Worte sprachen, lösten sie in mir das Gefühl der Ausdauer aus.\n\n\n\n[REWRITE] The mountains are always there.

While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn't help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that the sun shone its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy, imposing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building on the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.",

I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy.

Öffentliche Verkehrsmittel sind sehr gut erreichbar und eine der beliebtesten Verkehrsmittel in New York City. Bensonhurst ist ein relativ städtisches Viertel, daher werden Sie sich immer noch in New York City fühlen. Bereiten Sie sich während Ihres Besuchs darauf vor, die vielen asiatischen Geschäfte in der Umgebung zu sehen. In den letzten zwei Jahrzehnten hat Bensonhurst einen Zustrom asiatischer Einwohner erfahren. Deshalb sehen Sie auf jedem Block mindestens ein asiatisches Geschäft, wenn Sie spazieren gehen. Am beliebtesten sind Supermärkte und Waschsalons. Zufällig sind diese Geschäfte auch sehr beliebt bei den Anwohnern, da die Lebensmittelqualität in den Supermärkten hervorragend ist, die Preise viel günstiger sind und schließlich, aber nicht minder wichtig, es sehr praktisch ist. Gleich in der Nähe von mir gibt es vier asiatische Supermärkte, die jeweils zwei Gehminuten voneinander entfernt sind. Das trägt zusätzlich zur Bequemlichkeit bei, Lebensmittel zu besorgen. Ich sage nicht, dass Bensonhurst ausschließlich von asiatischen Einwohnern bewohnt wird, obwohl. Es ist ziemlich vielfältig, mit Einwanderern und ihren Erst- und Zweitgenerationen-Amerikanern hier. Die meisten großen und beliebten Geschäfte in der Gegend sind in asiatischer Hand. Zusätzlich zu diesen asiatisch geführten Unternehmen gibt es auch einen kürzlich renovierten Park in der Nähe, der etwa zehn Basketballplätze, ein großes Feld für Fußball oder Baseball, vier Handballplätze, Schaukeln, einen Spielplatz für Kinder und sogar einen Wasserspeier, damit Kinder im Sommer Wasser genießen können. Da wir uns in New York City befinden, sind die Parks natürlich sehr vielfältig. Sie sehen hier allerhand Vielfalt und die Menschen können gut miteinander spielen und sich verstehen. In diesem Viertel gibt es nicht viele große Firmengebäude. Die einzigen Gebäude, die Sie finden würden, sind solche für Genossenschaftswohnungen oder Eigentumswohnungen. Die meisten Wohnräume hier sind aber zweifamilienhäuser. Die meisten Menschen sind zwar sehr nett, aber sehr laut. Jeden Tag hören Sie Autos, die Musik aufdrehen, wenn sie an Ihrem Haus vorbeifahren, oder ständig das Gaspedal durchtreten, was Sie morgens weckt. Wenn Sie planen, nachts zu besuchen, sollten Sie auf der Hut sein. Dieses Viertel ist ziemlich sicher, aber die Leute sind unberechenbar. Man kann auf Leute stoßen, die aus dem Nichts Ärger anfangen wollen, Randalierer und Diebe. Ich selbst wurde in diesem Viertel in der Vergangenheit körperlich angegriffen, aber das war vor vielen Jahren. Ein anderes jüngeres Ereignis betraf den Diebstahl von Paketen. Obwohl es üblich ist, gibt es in diesem Viertel Paketdiebe. Zu guter Letzt, obwohl es in New York City eine Strafe für Menschen gibt, die nicht nach ihren Hunden aufräumen, halten sich die Leute hier nicht an die Regeln. Jeden Morgen sehen Sie mindestens einen Hundekot auf dem Weg zum Bahnhof oder zum Supermarkt. Mein größtes Ärgernis ist Hundekot auf dem Boden überall, wo ich in diesem Viertel hinführe. Seien Sie vorsichtig und halten Sie Ihre Schuhe sauber! \n\n## \n\n\n[REWRITE]\nIf you are planning on visiting Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it!

Alles scheint nach unten zu fließen, und mein Haus sitzt genau auf dem Gipfel des steilsten Hügels in der Nachbarschaft. Die Leute nennen es den „Workout-Hügel“, weil so viele Jogger es während ihres täglichen Workouts hinauflaufen. Da es auf meiner Straße überhaupt keine Gehwege gibt, gehen alle auf der Straße. Die Straße ist an einigen Stellen uneben und kann das Fahren ein bisschen gefährlich machen. Einige der Telefon- und Stromleitungen, die um den Block herum gespannt sind, sehen aus wie völlig verwittert. Es regnet und stürmt in unserer Gegend oft, daher treffen Äste und andere Trümmer oft die Stromleitungen und die ständigen Reparaturen lassen sie kariert und Flick-artig aussehen. Es gibt überall viele hohe immergrüne Bäume, wohin man auch schaut. Aber die Leute hier hassen die Bäume. Sie versuchen, so viele wie möglich zu fällen, weil die Bäume den Blick auf den Ozean versperren. Deshalb sind viele der Häuser so hoch auf dem Hügel gebaut, mit riesigen, glasvorderen zweiten Stockwerken, die aufeinander zu- und hintereinander hochragen, um den Blick auf die Bucht zu genießen. Es ist wunderschön bei Sonnenuntergang, wenn das Wasser von unten zu leuchten scheint und der Himmel orange wird. Es ist aber meistens bewölkt, also siehst du den größten Teil des Sonnenlichts durch einen Nebel hindurch. Die meisten Tage sind bewölkt und feucht. Moos wächst auf allem, was es kann: auf Dächern, Autos und Geländern. Ich habe mein Auto einmal einen Monat lang auf meinem Grundstück abgestellt, und als ich es benutzen wollte, war es grün und flauschig mit Moos geworden. Es hat drei Stunden gedauert, bis ich alles abkratzen konnte. Es gibt nicht viele Kinder in meiner Nähe, obwohl es nur ein paar Blocks entfernt eine Schule gibt. Die meisten Menschen in meiner Nachbarschaft sind älter, viele von ihnen im Ruhestand. Anstatt Kinder haben die Leute Hunde. Es ist üblich, sie draußen in den Gärten sitzen oder auf der Straße hintereinander her zu rennen zu sehen. Wenn Sie eine Tür oder ein Fenster offen lassen, riskieren Sie, dass sie in Ihr Haus schlüpfen. Ich habe einmal einen in meinem Wohnzimmer gefunden und musste ihn wieder durch die Eingangstür jagen. Hasen laufen wild in der Gegend herum. Einige davon sind groß, und die Gärtner hassen sie, weil sie die Wurzeln der Pflanzen aufgraben und in die Gärten der Leute gräben. Meine Katzen lieben sie aber und haben die meisten aus unserer Nachbarschaft gejagt. Wir bekommen auch die üblichen Vögel: kleine Spatzen und Kolibris, und gelegentlich kreist ein Falke oder Adler vorbei, bis die Raben der Nachbarschaft ihn vertreiben. Es gibt keine Geschäfte in der Nähe, aber wenn Sie den Hang hinunter zum Wasserfront wandern, gibt es ein paar Restaurants, die frisches Meeresfrüchte servieren. Es gibt nicht viel Strand dort unten, aber die Felsen entlang des Strandes sind lustig, um ins Wasser zu werfen. Die Bucht selbst ist nicht sehr breit.

It's the same at other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.",

If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature.

There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students.

    "raw_output": "## German Translation:\n\nWenn man mich nach einer Beschreibung meiner Nachbarschaft fragt, bin ich sicher, dass meine Antwort etwas einzigartig ist. Während andere, die auf diese Frage antworten, höchstwahrscheinlich Hausbesitzer mit ihren eigenen individuellen Leben sind, ist meine Situation etwas anders. Ich betrachte meine Nachbarschaft als den Universitätscampus, auf dem ich wohne, und die Menschen, die in meinem Wohnheim leben, als meine Gemeinschaft. Ich betrachte auch den umliegenden Campus als meine Nachbarschaft, wenn auch in geringerem Maße. Trotz dieser Besonderheit teilt meine Nachbarschaft einige Gemeinsamkeiten mit den konventionelleren Vorstellungen von einer Nachbarschaft. Genau wie jede konventionelle Nachbarschaft hat die Nachbarschaft, in der ich wohne, Häuser, Menschen, Geschäfte und Parks. Beginnen wir mit der Diskussion der \"Häuser\", die meine Nachbarschaft ausmachen. Bevor ich mit der Erkundung der Häuser in meiner Nachbarschaft beginne, wäre es am besten, die Arten von Häusern zu klären, die in meiner Nachbarschaft zu finden sind. Es gibt drei Arten von Unterkünften in meiner unmittelbaren Umgebung: die Wohnungen, die eigentlichen Häuser und die Wohnheimhäuser. Erstens gibt es in den Wohnungen in der Regel 2-4 Personen pro Zimmer, und es gibt etwa 4-6 Zimmer pro Etage. Der häufigste Gebäudetyp kann etwa 2 Etagen beherbergen, so dass durchschnittlich etwa 20 Menschen in jedem Gebäude leben. Zweitens gibt es die eigentlichen Häuser, die für jeden mit einer Zugehörigkeit zur Schule zur Miete verfügbar sind. Typischerweise handelt es sich dabei um Wohnungen mit 2-4 Schlafzimmern, in denen sich meist Alumni befinden. Es gibt jedoch nur wenige dieser Arten von Häusern, die über die gesamte Nachbarschaft verteilt sind, da sie weniger effizient sind. Schließlich gibt es die typischen Wohnheimzimmer, in denen Hunderte von Studenten untergebracht sind. Hier teilen sich zwei Personen ein Zimmer, mit Ausnahme einiger Ausnahmen, und es ist die häufigste Art der Unterbringung in meiner Nachbarschaft. Nachdem wir die Unterkünfte behandelt haben, können wir zu den Menschen übergehen. Meine Schule ist stolz auf ihre Vielfalt, und dies spiegelt sich im Erscheinungsbild meiner Nachbarschaft wider. In meiner Nachbarschaft leben Menschen aus allen Kulturen und Altersgruppen. Die meisten Mitarbeiter des Fachbereichs wohnen in den Häusern, die sich in der Nachbarschaft befinden, während die jüngeren Studenten in der Wohngemeinschaftsunterkunft wohnen und die älteren Studenten in der Wohnungsbau-Unterkunft. Die Menschen in dieser Nachbarschaft lassen sich nicht nur durch Gespräche über sie gerecht werden, daher ist es am besten, einfach zu den Geschäften und Parks in meiner Nachbarschaft überzugehen. Da meine Schule wirklich eine eigene, abgeschlossene Nachbarschaft ist, verfügt sie über eine Fülle an Geschäften und einen einzigen Park. Die Geschäfte sind eine Mischung aus Speisemöglichkeiten, die man in jeder anderen Nachbarschaft finden würde, und dem eigenen, einzigartigen Sortiment an Kleidung und Lebensmittelgeschäften der Schule. So ist alles, was benötigt wird, innerhalb der Grenzen meiner Nachbarschaft zu finden! Darüber hinaus ist der Park in meiner Nachbarschaft ein Spielplatz für die vielfältigen Menschen in meiner Nachbarschaft. Er ist sauber und frei von Kriminalität, da alle Mitglieder meiner Nachbarschaft dafür sorgen!\n\n## Rewritten English:\n\n[REWRITE]\n\nWhen asked to describe my neighborhood, I’m sure my answer is somewhat unique.

Ich bin aus Riverdale nach Stockbridge gezogen und ich werde nicht lügen, ich habe geweint, weil ich sie vermisste und sie liebte. Aber meine Eltern wollten das Beste für mich und meine kleine Schwester, also sind wir in einen besseren Ort für die Wohnung, eine bessere High School, alles wurde als \"nicht heruntergekommen\" angesehen, als wir in unsere neue Nachbarschaft gezogen sind. Im Laufe der Jahre habe ich mich daran gewöhnt und habe mir neue Freunde gemacht, und auch ein paar neue Feinde in der Schule. Ich habe im Laufe der Jahre meine Nachbarn nie wirklich kennengelernt, außer Mr. Glen und seinen Kindern sowie Dennis für eine Weile, da beide direkt neben uns wohnten. Sie sind angenehme Menschen, die ich fast als Familie betrachten kann, und ich schätze sie wirklich. Ich erinnere mich, als ich, Mama, Papa und meine Schwester zu Mr. Glens Hochzeit gingen (sie haben sich wiedergetraut). Es war wirklich lustig und angenehm, um es milde auszudrücken, und etwas, worauf ich mich freue, wenn ich meinen Reichtum aufbaue und meiner zukünftigen Frau das Leben einer Königin schenke. Als Frau Glens Frau, Frau Veda, das kleine weiße Band an ihrem Bein nahm und es warf, habe ich es gefangen! Leider habe ich die Blumen nicht gefangen! Wir haben die ganze Nacht getanzt und ich habe mich wirklich gefreut, eine gute Zeit mit Marsharii, einer ihrer Töchter, zu verbringen. Seitdem habe ich sie aber nicht mehr gesehen. Ich hoffe, sie ist zu größeren und besseren Dingen gewechselt. Die Nachbarschaft an sich ist wie ein Labyrinth, obwohl ich jetzt ein GPS habe, so dass ich mehr Zeit zum Erkunden habe. Ich bin erst so weit gekommen, und das war, als ich mich mit meinen Freunden Kason und Curtis getroffen habe. Wir haben früher viel Videospiele gespielt und einfach das Leben so gut wie möglich genossen. Manchmal ging ich in den Park und genoss die Natur, die meiner Seele Trost spendet. Es gibt mir ein Gefühl der Ruhe und des Friedens in diesen Tagen. Ich bringe auch ein paar Stöcke mit, die ich vom Home Depot gekauft habe, und übe einfach mein Gleichgewicht, und wenn ich kann, auch mein Bokken-Holzschwert. Ich habe Spaß daran, das zu tun, was ich liebe. Es gibt auch einen Basketball- und Tennisplatz, obwohl ich seit langem kein Tennis oder Basketball mehr gespielt habe, es ist immer noch schön, es zu haben, falls ich es wieder aufnehmen und es noch einmal versuchen möchte. Mein Vater hat mich und meinen besten Freund mit Mr. Graves im Tennis großgezogen, und wir hatten immer eine tolle Zeit. Sie haben uns hart gearbeitet! Aber wir hatten immer Spaß. Ich denke, es gab viele Möglichkeiten, Spaß in dieser Nachbarschaft zu haben, und es gibt viele Geschichten, aber diese sind die, die mir wirklich in Erinnerung geblieben sind, und ich glaube, das Beste kommt noch!\n\n\n[REWRITE]\nWell, since I've been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know.

I guess there's a lot of times I've had fun in this neighborhood, and there's plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!",

Sie sind unregelmäßig angeordnet und so weit auseinander, dass sie wie Einzelhäuser aussehen. Der einzige Unterschied ist, dass jedes Haus gelb gestrichen, mit weißen Veranden und grünen Metalldächern ist. Fast jeder, aber nicht alle, sind sich gegenseitig Freunde. An einigen Abenden stehen wir am Ende einer nicht vorgegebenen Einfahrt und plaudern, während die kleinen Kinder der Nachbarschaft mit ihren Spielzeug, Kreide oder Drachen spielen. Es ist in dieser modernen, alles zu mechanischen / computergefüllten Welt sehr erfrischend. Es ist etwas wie ein Schritt zurück in der Zeit. Wir sind von Feldern und Bäumen umgeben, die durch blauen Himmel und weiße, wallende Wolken noch verstärkt werden. Der einzige Nachteil? In dieser Saison erleben wir Tornado-Warnungen und zum ersten Mal, letzte Nacht haben wir tatsächlich echte Tornado-Sirenen gehört, also mussten wir uns in Sicherheit bringen. Sicher, Sie hätten mich in meiner Badewanne gefunden, wie ich meinen Kleinsten Hund zusammen mit meiner Handtasche und ein paar Kissen festhielt. Mein großer Hund wollte nichts mit dem Badezimmer zu tun haben und blieb nervös und bellend im Wohnzimmer. Die Nachbarschaft war ruhig, bis auf das Geräusch von großen Hagelkörnern, die über den Boden fielen. Nach dem Sturm dampfte die Straße buchstäblich vom Temperaturwechsel. Wir sind in wenigen Minuten von 92 auf 75 Grad gesunken. Der Hagel schmolz sofort, als er auf den heißen Asphalt traf. Als ich zum klärenden Himmel aufsah, kam die Sonne heraus und es begann zu regnen. Ein Doppelregenbogen erschien. Ich rannte ins Haus und nahm meine Kamera. Ich schoss schnell Fotos, um sie mit meinen Facebook-Freunden und meiner Familie zu teilen. Sie waren wie ich, begeistert. Die Straßen blieben noch eine Stunde ruhig, bevor einige Leute endlich von dort heimkamen, wo sie waren, als der Gewittersturm hereinbrach. Dann war es wie gewohnt, Mütter und Kinder draußen, während das Abendessen gekocht wurde. Eine so freundliche Nachbarschaft für dieses Mädchen, das kürzlich aus NH nach NC gezogen ist. Ich liebe den südlichen Akzent, den die Leute sprechen. Ich habe eine Wohnung mit zwei Schlafzimmern und zwei Bädern, genau wie jeder andere. Auch wenn alle Häuser außen gleich aussehen, sind nicht alle Wohnungen innen gleich. Einige sind tatsächlich ziemlich klein. Es macht keinen Sinn für mich. Ich liebe es, entlang des größten Feldes hinter meinem Haus zu spazieren und zum Teich zu gehen, der nicht zum Schwimmen gedacht ist. Ich habe Rehe gesehen und morgens kann man den Gesang des riesigen Bullfrogs hören. Es ist ein fantastischer Ort zu leben, nur vierzig Minuten außerhalb der Stadt Charlotte. Jeden Morgen wird man vom Glocken der Hähne der umliegenden Bauernhöfe begrüßt. Es ist etwas wie in einem kleinen Dorf zu leben. Wir haben sogar ein Esel auf einem nahegelegenen Bauernhof, dessen Brüllen man abends hört, um uns zu wissen, dass er da ist.

Keiner von ihnen wohnt dort mehr, aber die Erinnerungen sind immer noch da. Die meisten Menschen, die hier lebten, als ich hierher zog, sind immer noch hier. Meine Nachbarschaft ist ziemlich ähnlich wie eine durchschnittliche amerikanische Vorstadtsiedlung. Die Nachbarschaft hat viele zweistöckige Häuser. Jedes Wochenende oder wann immer es draußen warm ist, höre ich die Kinder draußen spielen. Die Nachbarschaft ist an den meisten Tagen der Woche ruhig. Ich hatte noch nie ein Problem mit irgendjemandem in der Nachbarschaft. Man wird hier in der Nachbarschaft alleine gelassen, es sei denn, man braucht Hilfe. Ich habe mehrere Pakete online bestellt und habe noch nie ein Paket von meinem Vorgarten gestohlen bekommen. Ich habe das Gefühl, meinen Nachbarn zu vertrauen. Es gibt einen Park eine Minute oder zwei von meinem Haus entfernt. Ich habe viele Erinnerungen daran. Ich habe dort mit den anderen Jungs aus der Nachbarschaft Basketball, Fußball und Baseball gespielt. Ich habe dort auch eine meiner schlimmsten Erinnerungen, als ich beim Fußballspielen einen Ellbogen in die Nase bekam, aber die guten Erinnerungen überwiegen die schlechten. Heutzutage gehe ich in diesen Park, um Zeit mit den Kindern meines Cousins zu verbringen. Sie sind viel jünger als ich und spielen immer noch auf Schaukeln und Rutschen und so weiter. Schon der Gedanke daran, in den Park zu gehen, macht sie aufgeregt. Der Park macht mich aus verschiedenen Gründen sehr sentimental. Die Nachbarschaft ist sehr vielfältig. In der Nähe finden Sie alle möglichen Arten von Essen. In einem Umkreis von nur einem Kilometer finden Sie chinesische, indische, mexikanische und italienische Restaurants. Heutzutage nutzen jedoch viele Menschen einfach Apps wie GrubHub und DoorDash, um sich ihr Essen liefern zu lassen. Die beliebtesten Essensstände sind die Fast-Food-Restaurants, aber diese finden Sie fast in jeder Vorstadtsiedlung. Es gibt auch viele Pizzaläden. Die Geschäfte hier bieten alles, was Sie je brauchen könnten. In der Nähe gibt es mehrere Reinigungsservices. Es gibt einen Walgreens und einen CVS auf derselben Straße sowie einen Jewel-Osco Supermarkt, der im Mittleren Westen beliebt ist. Einige der Geschäfte sind sogar vielfältig, denn es gibt einen indisch besitzenden Laden, wenn Sie Lust auf selbstgemachtes indisches Essen haben oder fertig zubereitetes indisches Essen kaufen möchten. Insgesamt bin ich ein Fan meiner Nachbarschaft.

    "original": "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle.

There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels.

Sie hebt sich nicht von anderen Städten in South Carolina ab, aber sie hat einen bedeutenden Einfluss auf den Agrarsektor. Johnston ist als „Peach Capital of the World“ bekannt, was die Stadt stolz auf ihrem Willkommensschild ausruft. Es besteht hauptsächlich aus Bauernland, das entweder von Pfirsichbäumen oder Rindern dominiert wird. Häuser, die sich nicht im Hauptbereich der Stadt befinden, sind weit voneinander entfernt; die meisten sind zweistöckig und haben entweder Metalldächer, um der sengenden Sommerhitze entgegenzuwirken, oder graue Schindeln. Meistens befinden sich diese Häuser nicht in der Nähe der Straße, sondern weiter hinten, sodass die vorderen Felder für Tiere/Kulturen genutzt werden können. Im Zentrum der Stadt gibt es eine einzige Ampel, die an einer Kreuzung steht. Hier befinden sich die einzigen Geschäfte der ganzen Stadt. Es gibt drei Orte, an denen man „Fast Food“ bekommen kann: Hong Kong, ein kleines chinesisches Restaurant, das von einer einzigen Familie geführt wird, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant oder Gary's, eine kleine Burgerkette. Es gab früher eine Pizzeria, die jedoch vor kurzem geschlossen hat. Es gibt eine sehr kleine, familiengeführte Apotheke namens Maxwell and Halford Drug; seltsamerweise sind sie bekannt für den Cherry Coca-Cola, den sie verkaufen. Es gibt einen kleinen, aber teuren Lebensmittelladen namens Independent Grocers Alliance, der gemeinhin als IGA bekannt ist. Obwohl es der einzige Lebensmittelladen in der ganzen Stadt ist, kaufen viele Leute nur ein oder zwei Artikel und bevorzugen es, zu einem Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville zu fahren, um den größten Teil ihrer Lebensmittel zu kaufen. Der beliebteste Laden in der ganzen Stadt ist Dollar General; dieser Laden verkauft eine große Auswahl an Alltagsartikeln und ist oft von der Eröffnung bis zur Schließzeit voll. Es gibt einen sehr kleinen Möbelladen, Possibilities Furniture & More, geführt von einer freundlichen Frau, die in der Gemeinde bekannt ist. Der Laden gibt es schon seit vielen Jahren in Johnston und beschäftigt sogar zwei Umzugshelfer, die die gekauften Möbel liefern! An das Gebäude des Möbelladens angegliedert ist ein kleiner Hundesalon namens Clark's Cuts and Kennels. Sie bieten eine Vielzahl von Dienstleistungen an, wie z. B. Tagesbetreuung, Pensionierung, Grooming, Nägel schleifen, Baden usw. Sowohl eine Arztpraxis als auch eine Tierarztpraxis befinden sich außerhalb des Hauptbereichs der Stadt; beide Praxen sind zwar sehr klein, aber gut ausgestattet, um den Bewohnern von Johnston zu helfen. Es gibt eine einzige Grundschule namens Johnston Elementary School. Sobald die Schüler die fünfte Klasse abgeschlossen haben, müssen sie die weiterführende Schule in der nächsten Stadt besuchen. Technisch gesehen gibt es keine Parks in der Stadt, aber es wird gerade ein 2,5 Hektar großes Erholungsgebiet geschaffen, um Familien mehr Möglichkeiten zum Ausflug zu bieten und mehr Besucher/potenzielle Bewohner anzuziehen. Zugegeben, es gibt nicht viel zu tun; es gibt keine Kinos, Bowlingbahnen, „Treffpunkte“, Spielplätze für Kinder, Bereiche zum Gassigehen mit Haustieren oder eine große Auswahl an Restaurants. Trotzdem ist es eine schöne Stadt, so klein, dass man sie im Nu übersehen könnte!\n\n\n\n## English Translation:\n\n[REWRITE]My neighborhood is a quaint little town.

And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on.

For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails.

Für meine Nachbarschaft ist die Präsenz eines Hausbesitzerverbands sehr offensichtlich. Wenn Sie einfahren, sehen Sie nichts als gepflegte Einfamilienhäuser, wofür wir den Hausbesitzerverband danken können. Die Vorgärten sind alle sehr ähnlich. Es gibt ein kleines Stück bepflanzte Rasenfläche, einige dekorative Kieselsteine und relativ kurze Zufahrten. Manchmal sehen Sie auch kleine Bäume. Jeder hat eine Garage für zwei Autos. Wenn Sie weiter durch die Nachbarschaft fahren, sehen Sie neu gelegte Betonstraßen. Trotz der Tatsache, dass hier viele verschiedene Familien leben, sind die Straßen in ausgezeichnetem Zustand. Hier finden Sie keine Schlaglöcher oder dergleichen. Die meisten Häuser sind einstöckig, aber manchmal sieht man auch zweistöckige Häuser. Wir haben kein typisches Briefkasten-Setup, das man für Einfamilienhäuser erwarten würde. Es gibt keine einzelnen Briefkästen vor jedem Haus. Stattdessen ist es eher wie in einem Apartmentgebäude, wo sich eine große Gruppe von Briefkästen am Ende der Straße befindet. Jeder benutzt einen Schlüssel, um Zugang zu seinem spezifischen Briefkasten zu erhalten. Und es gibt zwei größere Schließfächer für Pakete. Auch dafür kann man den Hausbesitzerverein und seine Besessenheit von Einheitlichkeit danken. Die Lage meines Hauses liegt am Rande der nahegelegenen Stadt, daher kann meine Nachbarschaft als teilweise ländlich und teilweise suburban beschrieben werden. Als Folge davon haben wir viel Land für, nun ja, alles. Es gibt mehrere Gemeinschaftspools, die jeder hier nutzen kann. Es ist gepflegt und mit einem Zaun versehen. Und dann gibt es verschiedene Wanderwege, auf denen Sie Ihren Hund spazieren führen oder einfach einen Abendspaziergang machen können. Sie müssen nicht in einen Park gehen, um Sport zu treiben. Die Nachbarschaft ist groß genug, dass Sie einfach darin herumlaufen können und mehr als genug Bewegung bekommen. Der größte Teil der Gemeinde besteht aus Rentnern. Es ist ein sehr sicherer Bereich, und jeder sieht sich gegenseitig zu. Dazugemischt haben wir auch eine kleine Anzahl von mittleren und jungen Fachleuten. Was die Stadt betrifft, so ist sie überraschend groß - zumindest nach Einwohnerzahl - aber hat auch ein kleines, dörfliches Flair. Wir haben die überwiegende Mehrheit der Annehmlichkeiten, auf die Sie angewiesen sind. Zum Beispiel haben wir genau ein Einkaufszentrum. Es ist nicht riesig, aber es erfüllt seinen Zweck. Für mich dauert es ungefähr 15 Minuten Autofahrt, um an einen bedeutenden Ort zu gelangen, aber sobald ich das getan habe, werde ich mit vielen verschiedenen Geschäften begrüßt. Wir haben alles, von hochwertigen Supermärkten, in denen Sie Bio-Lebensmittel kaufen können, bis hin zu Billit-Läden, die nur eine kleine Auswahl an Artikeln führen und nur ein Mindestpersonal beschäftigen, um die Kosten niedrig zu halten. Alles in allem ist meine Nachbarschaft sicher, gepflegt und ziemlich typisch. Wir haben viele schöne Dinge, wie Pools und Wanderwege. Und obwohl wir nicht direkt neben Einkaufszentren wohnen, können Sie einfach ins Auto steigen und zu jeder großen Kette fahren, die Sie möchten.\n\n[REWRITE] The general area where I live can be described as typical suburban sprawl.

We have everything from high-end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.",

Meine unmittelbare Nachbarschaft, an der Ostseite der Stadt, könnte als die wirtschaftlich am stärksten benachteiligte Gegend der Stadt bezeichnet werden. Die Immobilienwerte sind niedrig, wobei die meisten Häuser von einkommensschwachen Einzelpersonen vermietet oder erworben werden. Es ist jedoch nicht unattraktiv oder unangenehm. Meine Nachbarn sind im Allgemeinen freundliche Menschen, die lächeln und grüßen, wenn ich die Straße entlang gehe. Die Kriminalitätsraten sind zwar etwas höher als in anderen Stadtteilen, liegen aber im Allgemeinen noch niedrig. In den letzten zehn Jahren gab es einige gewaltsame Verbrechen in den wenigen Blocks in meiner Nähe, darunter einige Schießereien und mindestens ein Mord. Unsere Nachbarn verloren letztes Jahr ihren Sohn in einer Schießerei vor einer Bar in der Gegend. Glücklicherweise wurde unsere Familie bisher nicht direkt von Verbrechen betroffen, abgesehen davon, dass gelegentlich ein Gegenstand von unserem Vorgarten verschwindet, wenn wir ihn nicht nach drinnen bringen.\n\nIm Allgemeinen hat die Stadt, in der ich wohne, sehr stark unter der „Opioid-Epidemie“ gelitten, die viele Teile der Vereinigten Staaten betroffen hat. Zahlreiche Leben wurden durch Heroin-Überdosierungen verloren. Glücklicherweise gibt es in meiner Stadt viele Ressourcen, um diese Epidemie zu bekämpfen, darunter mehrere Entgiftungsstationen und Narcan-Schulungen für Familien und Freunde von Menschen, die von der Sucht betroffen sind. \n\nTrotz dieser Herausforderungen hat diese Stadt viele positive Eigenschaften. Die Grundschule meines Sohnes hat ein exzellentes Personal, von der Schulleitung über die Lehrer bis hin zum Betreuungspersonal. Obwohl er besondere Bedürfnisse hat, hat er bisher aufgrund der unglaublich positiven Atmosphäre der Schule keine Mobbing erlebt und liebt es dort. Wir haben einen aktiven Elternausschuss, der das ganze Jahr über mehrere Veranstaltungen plant, um die Familienbeteiligung und den Bildungserfolg zu fördern. Da über 20 % der Einwohner unserer Stadt unterhalb der Armutsgrenze leben, bietet die Grundschule allen Schülern kostenlose Frühstück und Mittagessen, damit kein Kind hungern muss. Keine Schülerin oder kein Schüler und keine Familie wird aufgrund mangelnder finanzieller Mittel als „weniger“ behandelt, und die Kosten für Schulgebühren, Materialien und Schulausflüge sind sehr erschwinglich. Der Stadtrat und das Personal haben viele Verbesserungen an dem Erscheinungsbild unserer Stadt vorgenommen, darunter die Wiederherstellung von Straßen, die Bepflanzung und die Renovierung von Stadtparks. Leider haben die meisten dieser Verbesserungen im Stadtzentrum und auf der Westseite stattgefunden, wo sich die meisten Einkaufsbereiche befinden und der größte Teil des Verkehrs fließt. Die Ostseite, wo ich wohne, wird eher vernachlässigt, was bei den Leuten in meiner Nachbarschaft zu Unzufriedenheit führt.\n\nInsgesamt genieße ich es, in dieser Stadt zu leben. Die Menschen sind im Allgemeinen freundlich, die Schulen sind großartig, es gibt genügend Einkaufsmöglichkeiten (beide kleine und große Einzelhandelsgeschäfte), um den Bedürfnissen meiner Familie gerecht zu werden, und unser Haus ist zwar nicht viel wert, aber es ist bequem und ausreichend.

    "original": "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",

Ich wohne in einem siebenstöckigen Apartmentgebäude direkt gegenüber dem alten Theater und ein paar Häuser weiter den Hügel hinauf befindet sich ein cooler kleiner Arcade-Bar, zu dem an warmen Sommerabenden Menschen unterschiedlicher Art strömen. Oft, besonders an Wochenenden im Juni und Juli, sieht man eine Schlange von Menschen, die darauf warten, hineinzukommen. Ein paar Blocks weiter oben befindet sich der nächste Stadtpark. Er ist für den Stadtteil, in dem er liegt, ziemlich groß. Der Park ist von Beton umgeben, mit hohen Treppen, die in die Mauer gegossen sind. Während der kalten Wintermonate errichten Obdachlose ihre Zelte in regelmäßigen Reihen entlang des Gehwegs und der breiten Stufen. Es schneit dort nicht viel, aber es regnet, und der sintflutartige Regen in den mittleren Wintermonaten macht es oft schwer, warm zu bleiben. Ihre Zelte in der Nähe zu platzieren, mitten in der Stadt anstatt im Wald, hält sie viel wärmer. Sie sind außerdem innerhalb angemessener Entfernung zu Fuß und mit öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln zum einzigen Familienzentrum in den Meilen, wo sie baden und duschen können. Was ich an meiner Stadt liebe, ist aber nicht die Schönheit der historischen Natur - die hohen stolzen Gebäude, die Architektur, die durch die verschiedenen Ebenen der Hügel verteilt ist, die zum Ozean hinunterrollen. Was ich an meiner Nachbarschaft liebe, ist die Kultur der Menschen selbst. Hilltop war einst die bekannteste Gegend an der Westküste für Gewalt in Gangs. Man hört selbst drei Jahrzehnte später noch Geschichten darüber, wie Bundesbeamte und die DEA durch die Straßen fegten, um die Straßen zu säubern. Die Menschen vergessen das nicht. Geschichten werden von Generation zu Generation weitergegeben, bis hin zu Zugezogenen wie mir, von diesen Tagen. Die Menschen arbeiten hart, auch wenn es immer noch eine der raueren Gegenden der gesamten Stadt gilt, um sie sauber zu halten. Sie kümmern sich immer noch darum, was in ihrer Stadt, in ihrem Viertel passiert. Sie sagen, wenn du weiß bist, solltest du nach Einbruch der Dunkelheit nicht auf dem Hügel herumlaufen. Wahrlich, ich glaube, dass diese Warnung an die alten Tage erinnert und mit dem sauren Geschmack der sozialen Konditionierung durchtränkt ist. Vielleicht bin ich einfach dunkel genug, um als nicht ganz \"weiße Mädchen\" durchzugehen, oder vielleicht erkennt Hilltop mich als eines ihrer eigenen an, als jemand, der sich genauso schmerzhaft der Erinnerungen bewusst ist, die unsere Nation ständig plagen. Erinnerungen daran, dass Rassismus, kulturelle Konditionierung und Annahmen aus Ignoranz und Angst gemacht werden, selbst in einer Stadt, die ein kulturelles Schmelztiegel-Utopia sein soll. Ich weiß eines: egal wie weit ich mich bewege, der Hilltop ist Heimat. Ich fühle mich lebendig, wenn ich nachts auf diesen Straßen spaziere und Menschen treffe, die mir schneller und seltener böswillig eine Jacke angeboten haben, als mich auszurauben. Es ist ein Ort, an dem Wäschereibesitzer etwas später geöffnet haben, damit ich mein Telefon aufladen konnte, als ich nirgendwohin entkommen konnte, um vor dem Regen zu fliehen. Es ist ein Ort, an dem ich mich für einen Moment unsichtbar gehalten und mich an Betonfassaden an den grauensten, grässlichsten Abenden verkrochen habe, nur um von jemandem angehalten zu werden, der mir in die Augen blickt, mir 5 Dollar gibt und mir sagt, dass ich schön und wertvoll bin.\n\n\n\n## Final English Translation:\n\n[REWRITE] My neighborhood is full of culture.

On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day.

Arbeitsame Menschen, die arbeiten, um ihren Lebensunterhalt zu verdienen und entweder Familien gründen oder Familien aufgezogen haben. An jedem Tag siehst du Kinder, die die Straßen hinunter rennen. Du wirst auch Leute sehen, die Hunde ausführen, Fahrrad fahren und Rollschuhe benutzen. Nachbarn kennen Nachbarn und man erkennt, wer dazugehört und wer nicht dazugehört. Du siehst jemanden grillen, draußen und winkst, oder sogar jemanden, der seinen Hund aus ein paar Blocks Entfernung spazieren führt und freundlich lächelt. Die Rasenflächen sind in einem ordentlichen Zustand. Niemand hat Laubstapel von der Herbstzeit. Der grüne Rasen wird gemäht und im Zaum gehalten. Wenn die Leute in ihren Gärten Pflanzen und Sträucher haben, werden diese zurückgeschnitten.

My kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is only 8 blocks or so away. It's a really great place to live.

    "transformed": "I live in Rural America, specifically in a small town in Michigan. It's a transition from farmland to small tourist towns. There are no big city malls, no Walmarts, Targets, or even an Applebee's. You have to drive to get to any destination. Despite that, I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world, surrounded by water. My \"town\" is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go, you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood reflects the idea of small town living. Houses aren't stacked on top of each other. They aren't cookie-cutter houses built the same. They are older homes, some updated and remodeled, some older. Most homes have basements. Full basements visible from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses in every color imaginable in the blocks surrounding my house. Most houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, playsets, some with gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America - hardworking people who work to make a living, either raising families or having raised families. On any given day you'll see kids running up and down the streets. You'll also see people walking dogs, biking, and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors, and you can tell who belongs and who doesn't. You'll see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone walking their dog a few blocks down and smiling pleasantly.  The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall. Green grass is mowed and kept under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards, they are kept trimmed down. It isn't a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think \"Wow, look at the nice homes,\" but one you drive into and think \"This would be a good place to raise a family.\" It's quiet, peaceful, and safe. While only average looking, it's exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world - a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance, there's the county sheriff's department and jail. The Health department is right next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside, and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you're really into it, you can make it downtown from our neighborhood. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is only 8 blocks or so away. It's a really great place to live.",
