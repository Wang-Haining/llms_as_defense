Wohngebiete sind scheinbar zufällig zwischen Gewerbegebieten verteilt, in denen eine Vielzahl von Unternehmen betrieben werden. Einige dieser Unternehmen bestehen aus Büros, während andere verschiedene Geschäfte, Restaurants und Unterhaltungsstätten sind. Es mangelt nicht an neuen Restaurants zum Essen gehen oder Geschäften zum Einkaufen. Während einige Geschäfte große, bekannte Marken sind, die von großen Unternehmen dimiliki werden, sind auch kleine Boutiquen zunehmend beliebt. Sie befinden sich nicht nur in verschiedenen Einkaufszentren, sondern säumen auch die Straßen, die oft zu Fuß erreichbar sind von Wohngebieten, die sonst ruhig und friedlich wären, wenn sie nicht von so vielen Sehenswürdigkeiten umgeben wären. Es gibt auch ein paar nahe gelegene Parks, und ich habe festgestellt, dass die Menschen diese Parks mit ihren kleinen Kindern besuchen. Apropos Menschen, es gibt tatsächlich eine ziemliche Vielfalt in meiner Nachbarschaft. An einem kleinen Ort haben wir eine prominente LGBTQ+-Gemeinde, eine orthodox-jüdische Gemeinde und eine Sammlung von Flüchtlingen und Einwanderern aus der ehemaligen Sowjetunion. Etwas außerhalb meiner Nachbarschaft gibt es viele mehr Menschen verschiedener Rassen und Herkunft, obwohl sie manchmal in ihre eigenen kleinen Gemeinschaften innerhalb der Stadt aufgeteilt sind. Es gibt Orte, die als Koreatown, Chinatown, Little Armenia und viele mehr bekannt sind, die nur wenige Meilen entfernt sind. Allerdings können nur wenige Meilen eine sehr lange Fahrt bedeuten. Eine Distanz von nur 10 Meilen kann manchmal zwei Stunden dauern, aufgrund des Verkehrs, besonders zur Stoßzeit. Kaum jemand in meiner Stadt geht irgendwo hin, obwohl bestimmte Sehenswürdigkeiten unweigerlich in der Nähe sind, die Stadt ist riesig und die Menschen bevorzugen es im Allgemeinen nicht, zu Fuß zu pendeln. Als Ergebnis haben wir auch einen der schlimmsten Verkehr in der Welt, und es kann schwierig sein, Parkplätze fast überall zu finden. Ironischerweise gab es in den letzten Jahren eine große Menge an Bauarbeiten, da große Wohnhäuser in die Stadt gebaut werden. Es scheint ein beliebtes Reiseziel zu sein, aber viele Einwohner sind enttäuscht von der Aussicht auf noch mehr Menschen, die einziehen und noch mehr Fahrzeuge auf den Straßen sind. Es gibt jedoch viele verschiedene Arten von Häusern in meiner Stadt. Nicht jeder lebt oder möchte in einem großen Mehrfamilienhaus leben. Wohngebiete bestehen aus Häusern in verschiedenen Größen und kleineren Mehrfamilienhäusern und Eigentumswohnungen. Einige Immobilien enthalten Einfamilienhäuser, während andere Doppelhaushälften enthalten. Dies gilt auch in meiner unmittelbaren Nachbarschaft, daher gibt es auch keinen Mangel an Vielfalt in Bezug auf die Wohnmöglichkeiten. Ähnlich wie das Viertel ist aus Menschen unterschiedlichen Alters zusammengesetzt, und um ehrlich zu sein, kenne ich die meisten meiner Nachbarn nicht. Es ist heutzutage keine eng verbundene Gemeinschaft mehr, obwohl ich viele Erinnerungen aus meiner Kindheit habe, in denen ich draußen mit meinem Nachbarn und ein paar anderen Freunden aus dem Viertel gespielt habe, die alle ungefähr mein Alter waren.\n\n\n[REWRITE]\nSince I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse.

There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town.

Aber meine Nachbarschaft und viele andere bleiben noch übrig und rufen uns und den Besuchern noch immer zu, dass der Traum noch lebt, und wir halten ihn so gut es geht fest. Die Menschen fühlen sich nicht mehr so optimistisch wie früher, die Pflege der kleinen Gärten ist nicht mehr das, was sie einmal waren, aber es steht immer noch ein Auto oder zwei in jeder Einfahrt, und die Jugend spielt immer noch, als wäre die Welt um sie herum das ganze Universum. Die öffentliche Schule, die hier seit fast 90 Jahren besteht, steht noch immer und scheint in der Jugend von heute eine Zukunft zu wecken, während sie bei den älteren Bewohnern Nostalgie auslöst. Die Kirchen sind weit voneinander entfernt, größtenteils leer, aber die Basketballplätze sind immer noch voll. Alle Häuser sehen unterschiedlich aus, fühlen sich aber gleich an. Es gibt einen großen Supermarkt namens Super \"A\", der von einer großen jemenitischen Familie betrieben wird, die wahrscheinlich die einzige arabische Familie in der Nachbarschaft ist. Die überwiegende Mehrheit der Bewohner ist afroamerikanisch. Die Straßen sind breit und die Kinder spielen in der Regel Fußball, und halten nur an, um den Autos Platz zu machen. Die meisten Menschen in meiner Nachbarschaft leben hier seit Generationen und können Geschichten von einer Zeit erzählen, in der sich alle kannten. Es gab eine Karatsschule, aber als Hollywood damit aufhörte, Karate Kid Filme zu produzieren, wollten die Kinder nicht mehr Karate Kid sein, also ist es jetzt eine Apotheke, denn Drogen machen alles besser, oder so habe ich gehört. Es gibt auch ein kleines Kino, das alte Filme zu ermäßigten Preisen zeigt, wird von der Jugend ignoriert, weil es keine aktuellen Filme hat, aber von den älteren bevorzugt, die denken, dass es ein kleiner Preis für einen Abend außerhalb des Hauses ist, natürlich ohne die Kinder. Es gibt eine einzige Schnellstraße, die durch meine Stadt führt. Obwohl die Anschlussstelle und die Abfahrt in der Nachbarstadt sind. Es gab einst eine Petition, um eine Anschlussstelle für unsere Stadt zu erhalten. Die Jugend unterstützte es, während die Älteren sich weigerten. Es scheint, als ob die Schnellstraße in unserer Stadt alles ruinieren würde, sagten die Älteren, die schließlich den Stadtrat davon überzeugten, den Antrag abzulehnen.

Zumindest nicht Orte, die die meisten Menschen sich wünschen würden. Aber wenn man hinter dem alten, verlassenen Whole Foods geht und hinter die Hotels zurückgeht, die nur einige wenige Wochen im Sommer für Familienfeiern bewohnt sind, findet man eine ganze geschäftige Gemeinschaft. Innerhalb dieser Gemeinschaften, auf diesen Straßen, befinden sich ein paar Wohnanlagen - dicht aneinander gebaut wie russische Matrjoschka-Puppen, die sorgfältig zerlegt und schrittweise nebeneinander an der Straße aufgestellt wurden. Die ersten Wohnungen, die man erreicht, waren in den Nachrichten wegen einiger ziemlich unangenehmer Geschäfte, also werden wir uns nicht zu sehr darauf konzentrieren - denn wie man so schön sagt, kann das Aussehen täuschen. Aber die Wohnungen neben dieser Anlage, und die beiden Anlagen neben der anderen, sind eine ganz andere Welt, von fast niemanden in diesem Gebiet bekannt. Gegenüber diesen Anlagen befindet sich der Satellitencampus eines Community Colleges - ein ruhiger, ruhiger Gebäudekomplex, der wie ein Wächter an der Straße steht, wo die Studenten mit Kaffee in der Hand kommen, um 7 Uhr morgens mit müden Augen ihren Tag zu beginnen. Die eisernen Tore knarren auf und lassen sie einzeln herein, während Pendler aus den Fenstern mit Fäusten kreisen und über sie motzen, weil sie den Verkehr an Tagen mit höherer Anwesenheit behindern. Die Straße mündet in eine weitere Wohnstraße, auf der sich auf einer Seite ein Park und auf der anderen Seite ein Reha-Zentrum für Menschen mit Knochenbrüchen in unglücklichen Umständen befindet. Das Behandlungszentrum verfügt über fröhliche Veranda-Möbel und einen faul schwingenden Deckenventilator, der die warme, dicke Sommerluft hin und her bewegt. Kinder rennen im Park auf der gegenüberliegenden Straßenseite hin und her, machen Handstand und Handstand-Übungen über den spikligen grünen Stängeln, während Bienen faul in den Blumenbeeten an der Straße kreisen. Alte Rentner führen ihre Hunde auf dem Gehweg entlang, knurren den Jugendlichen auf ihren Skateboards zu und nickt schüchtern den Teenagerinnen zu, die sich in der Nähe des Spielplatzausrüstung versammelt haben und über Jungen und die neuesten YouTube-Sensationen plaudern. In einem Einkaufszentrum neben dem Park gibt es ein Sushi-Restaurant mit günstigem Essen, das aber nie zu überlaufen erscheint - direkt daneben ein Schwimmbad-Versorgungsgeschäft und ein Nagelstudio, das sich dazwischen versteckt. Man könnte in der Saison seinen Pool füllen, sich eine Maniküre machen und gleichzeitig Hibachi-Hähnchen essen - die Schönheit eines Einkaufszentrums. Es gibt dort auch einen Selbstbedienungs-Frozen-Yogurt-Laden, und oft sieht man die Jugendlichen im Park mit kalten, schwitzenden Bechern mit Frozen Yogurt, garniert mit Toppings, während sie auf ihren Skateboards Stunts machen und dampfen, weil sie es für cool halten.

She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",

Sie stammte aus einer Stadt, in der der Supermarkt fünf Minuten zu Fuß von ihrem Haus entfernt war – sie hatte in ihrem Leben noch nie so viel offene Fläche gesehen. Überrascht von der Allgegenwärtigkeit der Maisfelder teilte ich ihr mit, wie es war, in ländlichem Ohio aufzuwachsen, und in diesem Moment kannte sie endlich mich und meinen Ursprung. \n\nFahren Sie auf einer zwei Fahrspuren Landstraße, erreichen Sie ein Steinbruch, das mit Wasser gefüllt ist. Direkt darüber liegt die kleine Wohnanlage, in der ich wohne. Die Häuser bestehen größtenteils aus Ziegelstein und Stuck. Alle Häuser haben mindestens ein halbes Morgenland, das jeder mit Stolz pflegt. Während der Frühlingszeit sind neben den mitteleuropäischen Bäumen, die sich mit jeder Jahreszeit verändern, reichlich jährlich gepflanzte Blumen vorhanden. Die Einfahrten sind alle mit den luxuriösesten Mercedes-Benz-Fahrzeugen gefüllt, die nach einem guten, alten, traditionellen Autowaschgang in der Mittagssonne glänzen. Fahren Sie weiter die Straße entlang in Richtung meines grauen Stuckhauses, mein koreanischer Nachbar ist immer draußen mit einem freundlichen Gesicht. Er verbringt den ganzen Tag damit, seinen Rasen zu mähen, und man hört sein Gesang über das Summen seiner Maschine. Jeder in der Nachbarschaft lacht darüber, aber er ist immer echt und eine erstaunliche Person mit einer einzigartigen Geschichte. Er ist älter geworden und hat im Laufe der Zeit etwas von seinem Witz verloren. Früher war er Arzt und mischt sich in der Regel mit dem Gras und seinem John Deer Zero Turn Rasenmäher. Schließlich erreichen Sie mein Haus. Auf dem Seitengarten sind Gänse reichlich vorhanden und werden von unserem Terrier verfolgt. Im Garten befindet sich ein kleiner Bach, der in den Steinbruch mündet. Hier können Sie Frösche, den Bach und das gelegentliche „Mäh“ der nahegelegenen Bauernhöfe hören. Über die handgemachte Holzhängebrücke liegt eine unberührte Oase, gefüllt mit natürlich wachsenden Bäumen, Kräutern und Wildblumen. Hier habe ich den größten Teil meiner Kindheit verbracht. Vom Bau von Baumhäusern bis zum „Jagen“ von Tieren (was hauptsächlich darin bestand, sie zu verfolgen), gab es immer etwas zu tun und in der Regel ein Nachbarskind zur Freundschaft. Die Winter in meiner kleinen Stadt können erbarmungslos sein, aber es gibt nichts Schöneres. Der Garten verwandelt sich von einem Meer aus Grün in eine leere Wildnis. Die Bäume, die einst leuchtend rosa, violette und orangefarbene Blüten beherbergten, werden zu kahlen Skeletten aus Rinde. Wenn man gelegentlich mit Schnee gesegnet wird, erscheint über Nacht ein Winterwunderland. Der Garten ist mit Schneemännern und Schneemännern von meiner kleinen Schwester gesäumt. Meine Schwester und ich haben uns in unserer Kindheit oft gestritten, und im Winter waren Schneebälle unsere Waffe der Wahl. Wir bauten massive igluartige Festungen, um unsere Waffen unterzubringen, normalerweise mit Ästen, wie ein Arsenal. In unserem eigenen kleinen Wunderland spielten wir Fantasie, in einer Zeit, in der nichts anderes zählte. Wir waren einfach nur kleine Kinder ohne Sorgen auf der Welt.\n\n[REWRITE]  “Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the cornfields that filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be shocked by the sparseness of the open landscape.

Egal, wie sehr ich sie vergesse oder wie sehr ich mit Arbeit und Leben beschäftigt bin, um sie zu bemerken, sie sind da, unerschütterlich, unverändert und unbeeindruckt von den Schwierigkeiten des Lebens. An Tagen, an denen ich am gestresst und am meisten aufgewühlt bin, fordern sie mich auf, sie zu sehen, und wenn ich mich ihnen zuwende, lassen sie mich meine ängstliche Seele ruhen und verleihen mir etwas Stärke, um weiterzumachen, Tag für Tag.\n\nIch bin hierher umgezogen, als ich mein Studium begann, und die Berge im Norden des Campus waren das, was mich zuerst fesselte. Sicher, die Universität hat auch ihre eigenen atemberaubenden Sehenswürdigkeiten in Gebäuden, Teichen und Bäumen, die ihren eigenen Platz in meinem Herzen haben, aber es sind die Berge, die wirklich den Thron besetzen. Der Rest der Stadt ist auf seine eigene Weise schön. Es gibt unzählige Cafés, in denen ich viele Stunden mit Koffein angetriebenem Lernen verbracht habe. Man kann zu Fuß oder mit dem Bus nur ein bisschen weiter zum Stadtzentrum gehen und sich in eine Aura der Antike einhüllen lassen, die von den verblassten Farbröhren, die Restaurants und Bürogebäude säumen. Hier zeigt sich dieser scheinbar vorstädtische Ort so viel Trubel und Tatendrang wie seine benachbarte Großstadt. Dies hält jedoch nicht lange an, denn man kann, indem man an der Bibliothek vorbeigeht, wieder in die ruhige Kleinstadt entkommen. Diese Dichotomie der Atmosphären in solcher Nähe verleiht dieser Stadt wirklich eine wunderbare Atmosphäre, als ob sie zum Entdecken einlädt. Mit diesem Gefühl lässt sich leicht viele geliebte Erinnerungen schaffen, jede in Verbindung mit einem bestimmten Teil der Stadt. Ob es darum geht, nach einer Nächtschicht mit Freunden an den rostigen Schaukeln im Park vorbeizugehen oder durch die geschäftige Innenstadt zu rennen, um den Film im eleganten Kino zu sehen, für das die Universität Tickets beschafft hat.\n\nEs ist jedoch auch ein Ort vieler harter Erinnerungen, wie es allen Orten im Leben passieren muss. Die Teiche, insbesondere, sind ein besonders geeigneter Ort für die Reflektion sowie für Tränen in der Nacht um zwei Uhr morgens mitten in einer existentiellen Krise. Letzteres bin ich mehr erfahren. Während ich beobachtete, wie Schildkröten, Enten und Insekten ihr Leben ausleben, jeder mit seinem Beitrag oder seiner Rolle, konnte ich nicht anders, als mich über mein eigenes Sinnverständnis zu fragen, während ich versuchte, dieses Mysterium namens Leben zu meistern. Also ging ich am Teich vorbei, an dem Park und den kleinen Häusern vorbei, die nach Vorstadtluft schrien, bis ich eine Hauptstraße erreichte.\n\nEs war dann, als die Sonne ihre strahlenden Strahlen auf die Palmen warf und den Himmel entlang malte, und als ich zum Sonnenaufgang hinaufblickte, merkte ich, dass ich nach Norden ging. Sicher genug, waren sie da, wie sie immer da gewesen waren. Die robusten, mächtigen Berge streiften den trüben blauen und gelben Himmel mehr als jedes Gebäude am Horizont, und als ob sie ohne Worte sprachen, erwachte in mir mein Gefühl der Ausdauer.\n\n[REWRITE]\n\nThe mountains are always there.

Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats.

I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer.

In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning.

Öffentliche Verkehrsmittel sind sehr zugänglich und eine der beliebtesten Transportmittel in New York City. Bensonhurst ist ein ziemlich städtisches Viertel, deshalb werden Sie sich immer noch wie in New York City fühlen. Während Ihres Besuchs sollten Sie sich darauf vorbereiten, die verschiedenen asiatischen Geschäfte in der ganzen Umgebung zu sehen. In den letzten zwei Jahrzehnten hat Bensonhurst einen Zustrom asiatischer Einwohner erlebt. Deshalb sehen Sie in der Regel mindestens alle paar Straßenblöcke einen asiatisch geführten Laden, wenn Sie spazieren gehen. Am beliebtesten sind Supermärkte und Waschsalons. Zufälligerweise sind diese Geschäfte auch bei den Anwohnern sehr beliebt, da die Lebensmittelqualität in den Supermärkten hervorragend ist, die Preise viel günstiger sind und schließlich und doch wichtig ist, dass es sehr praktisch ist. In unmittelbarer Nähe wo ich bin, gibt es vier asiatische Supermärkte, die von einander aus zu Fuß in zwei Minuten erreichbar sind. Das trägt nur zur Bequemlichkeit bei, Lebensmittel einzukaufen. Ich sage nicht, dass Bensonhurst rein von asiatischen Einwohnern besiedelt ist. Es ist ziemlich vielfältig, mit Einwanderern und ihren Kindern der ersten und zweiten Generation amerikanischer Herkunft. Die meisten großen und beliebten Geschäfte in der Umgebung sind in asiatischer Hand. Zusätzlich zu diesen asiatisch geführten Geschäften gibt es in der Nähe auch einen kürzlich renovierten Park mit etwa zehn Basketballplätzen, einem großen Feld für Fußball oder Baseball, vier Handballplätzen, Schaukeln, einem Spielplatz für Kinder und sogar einem Wasserspielplatz, damit Kinder im Sommer Wasser genießen können. Da wir uns in New York City befinden, sind die Parks natürlich sehr vielfältig. Hier sieht man alle Arten von Menschen, die gut miteinander spielen und sich verstehen können. In diesem Viertel gibt es nicht viele große Firmengebäude. Die einzigen Gebäude, die Sie finden würden, sind solche für Genossenschaftswohnungen oder Eigentumswohnungen. Die Mehrheit der Wohnräume sind jedoch Reihenhäuser. Die meisten Menschen sind zwar sehr nett, aber sehr laut. Jeden Tag hören Sie Autos, die Musik abspielen, wenn sie an Ihrem Haus vorbei fahren, oder ständig das Gaspedal durchtreten, was Sie morgens weckt. Wenn Sie nachts planen, zu besuchen, sollten Sie auf der Hut sein. Dieses Viertel ist ziemlich sicher, aber die Menschen sind unberechenbar. Man kann auf Menschen stoßen, die aus dem Nichts Probleme suchen wollen, Schläger und Diebe. Ich selbst wurde in der Vergangenheit in diesem Viertel Opfer von Mobbing durch körperliche Gewalt, aber das war vor vielen Jahren. Ein anderes kürzlich bekannt gewordenes Ereignis war ein Diebstahl von Paketen. Obwohl es ein häufiges Phänomen ist, gibt es in diesem Viertel Paketdiebe. Zu guter Letzt beachten Sie bitte, dass New York City eine Strafe für Personen verhängt, die nicht nach ihren Hunden aufräumen, aber in diesem Viertel wird sich niemand daran halten. Jeden Morgen sehen Sie mindestens einen Hundekot auf dem Weg zum Bahnhof oder zum Supermarkt. Mein größter Groll ist Hundekot auf dem Boden überall, wo ich in diesem Viertel unterwegs bin. Seien Sie vorsichtig und halten Sie Ihre Schuhe sauber!\n\n\n\n[REWRITE]\n\nIf you are planning on visiting Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you will not have a hard time finding it!

Alles scheint bergab zu fließen, und mein Haus sitzt direkt am Gipfel des steilsten Hügels in der Nachbarschaft. Die Leute nennen es den \"Trainingshügel\", weil so viele Jogger gerne darauf laufen, während ihres täglichen Trainings. Da es auf meiner Straße überhaupt keine Gehwege gibt, gehen die Leute auf der Straße. Die Straße ist an einigen Stellen uneben und kann sich etwas gefährlich zum Befahren anfühlen. Einige der Telefon- und Stromkabel, die um den Block herum aufgehängt sind, sehen alt und zerrissen aus. Es regnet und stürmt oft in unserer Gegend, daher schlagen Äste und andere Trümmer oft auf die Stromleitungen und die ständigen Reparaturen lassen sie wie ein kariertes und Flickenteppich ausschauen. Es gibt überall viele hohe immergrüne Bäume. Aber die Leute hier hassen die Bäume. Sie bemühen sich, so viele wie möglich zu fällen, weil die Bäume den Blick auf den Ozean versperren. Deshalb sind viele der Häuser so hoch oben auf dem Hügel gebaut, mit riesigen, glasverkleideten Obergeschossen, die aneinanderreihen, um den Blick auf die Bucht zu genießen. Es ist wunderschön zur Dämmerung, wenn das Wasser so aussieht, als würde es von unten beleuchtet und der Himmel orange gefärbt. Es ist aber meist bewölkt, daher siehst du den größten Teil des Sonnenlichts durch einen Schleier. Die meisten Tage sind bewölkt und feucht. Moos wächst auf allem, was es kann: Dächer, Autos und Geländer. Ich habe meinen Wagen einmal einen Monat auf meiner Einfahrt geparkt, und als ich ihn benutzen wollte, war er grün und pelzig mit Moos bedeckt. Es dauerte drei Stunden, bis ich es alles abkratzen konnte. Es gibt nicht viele Kinder in meiner Gegend, obwohl es nur ein paar Blocks weiter eine Schule gibt. Die meisten Menschen in meiner Nachbarschaft sind älter, viele von ihnen im Ruhestand. Anstatt Kinder haben die Leute Hunde. Man sieht sie oft auf den Rasen oder im rennen die Straße entlang. Wenn du eine Tür oder ein Fenster offen lässt, riskierst du, dass sie in dein Haus schleichen. Ich fand einmal einen in meinem Wohnzimmer und musste ihn wieder durch die Eingangstür hinausjagen. Kaninchen laufen wild in der Gegend herum. Einige davon sind groß, und die Gärtner hassen sie, weil sie die Wurzeln von Pflanzen ausgraben und in die Rasenflächen graben. Meine Katzen mögen sie aber, und haben die meisten aus unserer Nachbarschaft gejagt. Wir bekommen auch die üblichen Vogelarten: kleine Spatzen und Kolibris, und gelegentlich segelt ein Falke oder Adler vorbei, bis ihn die Hauskrähen vertreiben. Es gibt keine Geschäfte in der Nähe, aber wenn du bergab zum Wasserfront wandern gehst, gibt es ein paar Restaurants, die fangfrische Meeresfrüchte servieren. Es gibt nicht viel Strand, aber die Felsen entlang des Strandes sind lustig, um ins Wasser zu werfen. Die Bucht selbst ist nicht sehr breit.

We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood.

I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood.

Während andere, die auf diese Frage antworten, höchstwahrscheinlich Hausbesitzer mit eigenem Leben sind, ist meine Situation etwas anders. Ich betrachte meine Nachbarschaft als den College-Campus, auf dem ich wohne, und die Menschen, die in meinem Studentenwohnheim leben, als meine Gemeinschaft. Ich betrachte auch den umliegenden Campus als meine Nachbarschaft, wenn auch in geringerem Maße. Trotz dieser Besonderheit teilt meine Nachbarschaft einige Gemeinsamkeiten mit den konventionelleren Vorstellungen von einer Nachbarschaft. Genau wie jede herkömmliche Nachbarschaft hat die Nachbarschaft, in der ich wohne, Häuser, Menschen, Geschäfte und Parks. Lass uns zunächst die \"Häuser\" besprechen, aus denen meine Nachbarschaft besteht. Bevor ich mit der Erkundung der Häuser in meiner Nachbarschaft beginne, wäre es am besten, die Arten von Häusern zu klären, die in meiner Nachbarschaft zu finden sind. In meiner unmittelbaren Nähe gibt es drei Arten von Wohnräumen: Wohnungen, eigentliche Häuser und Studentenwohnheimhäuser. Erstens gibt es in den Wohnungen in der Regel 2-4 Personen pro Zimmer, und es gibt etwa 4-6 Zimmer pro Etage. Die häufigste Gebäudeart kann etwa 2 Etagen beherbergen, sodass durchschnittlich etwa 20 Personen in jedem Gebäude wohnen. Zweitens gibt es die eigentlichen Häuser, die für alle mit einer Verbindung zur Schule mieten können. Typischerweise handelt es sich um 2-4 Schlafzimmerwohnungen, in denen in der Regel Absolventen wohnen. Es gibt jedoch nur wenige dieser Hausarten, die im ganzen Viertel verteilt sind, da sie weniger effizient sind. Schließlich gibt es die typischen Studentenwohnheimg rooms, in denen Hunderte von Studenten wohnen. Hier teilen sich zwei Personen ein Zimmer, mit einigen Ausnahmen, und es ist die häufigste Wohnform in meiner Nachbarschaft. Nachdem wir den Wohnraum behandelt haben, können wir zu den Menschen übergehen. Meine Schule ist stolz auf ihre Vielfalt, und dies spiegelt sich im Aufbau meiner Nachbarschaft wider. In meiner Nachbarschaft leben Menschen aus allen Kulturen und Altersgruppen. Die meisten Mitarbeiter des Fachpersonals wohnen in den Häusern, die sich in der Nachbarschaft befinden, während die jüngeren Studenten in den Studentenwohnheimen und die älteren Studenten in den Wohnungen wohnen. Die Menschen in dieser Nachbarschaft lassen sich nicht einfach nur beschreiben, daher ist es am besten, einfach zu den Geschäften und Parks in meiner Nachbarschaft überzugehen. Da meine Schule wirklich wie ein eigenständiges Viertel ist, hat sie eine Vielzahl von Geschäften und einen einzigen Park. Die Geschäfte sind eine Mischung aus Speisemöglichkeiten, die man in jedem anderen Viertel finden würde, und der eigenen Marke der Schule für Kleidung und Lebensmittelgeschäfte. So findet man alles, was man braucht, innerhalb der Grenzen meines Viertels! Außerdem ist der Park in meiner Nachbarschaft ein Spielplatz für die vielfältigen Menschen in meiner Nachbarschaft. Er wird von allen Mitgliedern meiner Nachbarschaft sauber und frei von Kriminalität gehalten!\n\n## Rewritten English:\n\n[REWRITE]\nWhen asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure my answer is quite unique.

Zuerst war ich ziemlich traurig, als ich zum ersten Mal in meine Nachbarschaft kam. Ich bin aus Riverdale nach Stockbridge gezogen, und ich werde nicht lügen, ich habe geweint, weil ich sie vermisst habe und sie liebte ... aber meine Eltern wollten das Beste für mich und meine kleine Schwester, also sind wir in einen besseren Ort für die Unterkunft, eine bessere High School, alles wurde als \"nicht heruntergekommen\" angesehen, als wir in unsere neue Nachbarschaft gezogen sind. Im Laufe der Jahre habe ich mich daran gewöhnt und mir neue Freunde gemacht, und auch ein paar neue Feinde in der Schule. Ich habe meine Nachbarn im Laufe der Jahre nie wirklich kennengelernt, außer Mr. Glen und seinen Kindern sowie Dennis für eine Weile, die beide direkt neben uns wohnten. Sie sind angenehme Menschen, die ich in gewisser Weise fast als Familie betrachten kann, und ich schätze sie wirklich. Ich erinnere mich, als meine Mutter, mein Vater und meine Schwester zu der Hochzeit von Mr. Glen gingen (Sie haben sich wieder getraut). Es war wirklich lustig und angenehm, um es milde auszudrücken, und etwas, auf das ich mich freue, wenn ich irgendwann mein Vermögen aufbaue und meiner zukünftigen Frau das Leben einer Königin schenke. Als die Frau von Mr. Glen, Ms. Veda, den weißen kleinen Gurt an ihrem Bein abnahm und ihn warf, habe ich ihn gefangen! Leider habe ich die Blumen nicht gefasst! Wir haben die ganze Nacht getanzt und ich hatte wirklich Spaß, eine gute Zeit mit Marsharii, einer ihrer Töchter, zu verbringen. Ich habe sie aber seitdem nicht mehr gesehen. Ich hoffe, sie ist zu größeren und besseren Dingen übergegangen. Die Nachbarschaft selbst ist wie ein Labyrinth, obwohl ich jetzt ein GPS habe, so dass ich mehr Zeit zum Erkunden habe. Ich bin nur so weit gekommen, und das war, als ich mit meinen Freunden Kason und Curtis herumhang. Wir haben früher oft Videospiele gespielt und einfach das Leben in vollen Zügen genossen, so gut wir konnten. Manchmal ging ich in den Park und genoss die Natur, was meiner Seele Trost spendet. Es gibt mir ein Gefühl der Ruhe und des Friedens heutzutage. Ich nehme auch ein paar Stöcke mit, die ich von Home Depot gekauft habe, und übe einfach mein Gleichgewicht, und wenn ich kann, auch mein Bokken-Holzschwert. Ich habe Spaß daran, das zu tun, was ich liebe. Es gibt auch einen Basketball- und Tennisplatz, obwohl ich seit langem kein Tennis oder Basketball mehr gespielt habe. Es ist trotzdem schön, falls ich es jemals wieder aufgreifen und noch einmal versuchen möchte. Mein Vater hat mich und meinen besten Freund von Mr. Graves mit Tennis großgezogen, und wir hatten immer eine tolle Zeit. Sie haben uns hart gearbeitet! Aber wir hatten immer Spaß. Ich denke, es gibt viele Male, an denen ich in diesem Viertel Spaß hatte, und es gibt viele Geschichten, aber das sind die, die mir wirklich in Erinnerung geblieben sind, und ich glaube, das Beste ist noch zu kommen!\n\n\n## [REWRITE]\nWell, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know.

There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",

Es gibt hauptsächlich Wohnblocks, aber ein paar Restaurants und Bars, die Spaß machen und nicht besonders teuer sind. Eine der Bars wurde gerade umbenannt und ist jetzt etwas teurer, aber der Service oder die Getränke sind nicht wirklich schlecht. Die meisten Menschen sind nett. Sie sind entweder Studenten oder haben ein geringeres Einkommen, da die Wohnraummiete nicht sehr hoch ist. In der Nähe gibt es viele Kinder, da sich eine Grundschule in Gehweite zu meiner Wohnung befindet. Ich kenne meine Nachbarn nicht, aber ich möchte das auch nicht. Sie rauchen viel Marihuana, also hat die Hausverwaltung einen Luftfrischgeräteeinheit direkt gegenüber ihrer Tür installiert, was meinem Freund und mir sehr lustig vorkam. Es ist fast beleidigend. Die umliegenden Gebäude sehen normalerweise ziemlich alt aus, haben aber vielleicht renovierte Innenräume. Ein Stück weiter die Straße runter befinden sich brandneue Apartments, aber ich mag sie nicht, weil ich weiß, dass die Bauarbeiten nicht besonders gut ausgeführt wurden. Sie sind billig gebaut, aber die Miete ist teuer, was ich für einen Betrug halte, aber weil sie in der Nähe des Campus liegen, können die Verwalter dieser Gebäude damit durchkommen. In etwa fünf Minuten Entfernung von meinem Zuhause gibt es ein sehr günstiges Restaurant, das Essen nur auf Papiertassen serviert und die meisten Gerichte im Mikrowellenherd zubereitet werden. Direkt gegenüber befindet sich eine Tankstelle, in der ich gehört habe, dass es nicht sehr angenehm ist zu arbeiten. Dank einiger städtischer Gelder wurde die Straße letztes Sommer neu asphaltiert, sodass es einen schönen breiten Bürgersteig gibt, viel Gras auf den Mittelstreifen und Seiten der Straßen und das Gebiet jetzt ein wenig schöner ist. Aber das Wohnhaus, in dem ich wohne, ist von Bäumen umgeben. Sie haben ein paar gefällt, daher gibt es ein paar Baumstümpfe, aber wo ich wohne, gibt es viel mehr Bäume als auf der Straße. Hinter meinem Apartmentkomplex befindet sich eine Baumreihe und dann ein weiteres Apartmentgebäude. Ich wohne in der 42. Straße, aber direkt dahinter ist die 43. Straße, die nicht so schön ist. Die Bürgersteige sind sehr schlecht und bröckeln, und die meisten Gebäude darauf sehen heruntergekommen aus. Es gibt viele Bäume auf dieser Straße, aber das ist wahrscheinlich, um das Aussehen der Gebäude zu verbergen. Der Großteil der Kriminalität in meinem Viertel ereignete sich in einem Apartmentkomplex auf dieser Straße, aber ich kann ihnen auch nicht die Schuld geben. Gegenüber von mir gibt es Wohnanlagen, die auch viele Kriminalität und eine recht instabile Bevölkerung haben. Aber ich glaube, ich mag es, wo ich wohne. Ich kann es mir leisten, und es gibt viele nützliche Annehmlichkeiten in der Nähe. Besonders mag ich, dass die Universität zu Fuß erreichbar ist und es zwei Bushaltestellen gibt, so dass ich problemlos zum Geschäft und in die Innenstadt gelangen kann.\n\n## Rewritten English\n\n[REWRITE]My neighbourhood is close to the college I attend, and for that, I truly enjoy living there.

We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",

Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it.

I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",

Es war für mich zunächst schwer, Freunde zu finden, aber ich habe mich mit jemandem anvertraut, der zwei Häuser weiter von mir wohnt, und einem anderen Typen, der in meiner Straße wohnt. Keiner von ihnen wohnt dort mehr, aber die Erinnerungen sind immer noch da. Die meisten Leute, die hier wohnten, als ich hierhergezogen bin, sind immer noch hier. Meine Nachbarschaft ist ziemlich ähnlich wie eine durchschnittliche amerikanische Vorstadtnäighborhood. Die Nachbarschaft hat viele zweistöckige Häuser. Jedes Wochenende oder wenn es einfach warm ist, höre ich die Kinder draußen spielen. Die Nachbarschaft ist an den meisten Tagen der Woche ruhig. Ich habe nie Probleme mit irgendeinem der Leute in der Nachbarschaft gehabt. Man wird in dieser Nachbarschaft allein gelassen, es sei denn, man braucht Hilfe. Ich habe mehrere Pakete online bestellt und habe noch nie ein Paket von meinem Vorplatz geklaut bekommen. Ich fühle mich in meinen Nachbarn sicher. Es gibt einen Park nur ein oder zwei Minuten von meinem Haus entfernt. Ich habe dort viele Erinnerungen. Ich habe dort mit den anderen Jungs aus der Nachbarschaft Basketball, Fußball und Baseball gespielt. Ich hatte auch eine meiner schlimmsten Erinnerungen dort, als ich beim Fußballspielen mit dem Ellbogen ins Gesicht getroffen wurde, aber die guten Erinnerungen überwiegen die schlechten. Heutzutage gehe ich immer in den Park, um Zeit mit den Kindern meines Cousins zu verbringen. Sie sind viel jünger als ich und spielen immer noch auf Schaukeln und Rutschen und so weiter. Nur die Vorstellung, in den Park zu gehen, macht sie aufgeregt. Der Park macht mich aus vielen Gründen sehr nostalgisch. Die Nachbarschaft ist sehr vielfältig. In der Nähe finden Sie alle möglichen Arten von Essen. Innerhalb eines Radius von einem Kilometer finden Sie chinesische, indische, mexikanische und italienische Restaurants. Heutzutage bestellen jedoch viele Menschen einfach Apps wie GrubHub und DoorDash, um sich ihr Essen liefern zu lassen. Die beliebtesten Essensstände sind die Fast-Food-Läden, aber die findet man fast in jeder Vorstadtnäighborhood. Es gibt auch viele Pizzerien. Die Geschäfte hier enthalten alles, was man jemals brauchen könnte. Es gibt mehrere Reinigungsservices in der Nähe. Es gibt einen Walgreens und einen CVS in der gleichen Straße sowie einen Jewel-Osco Lebensmittelmarkt, der im Mittleren Westen beliebt ist. Einige der Geschäfte sind sogar vielfältig, da es einen indischen Laden gibt, falls Sie jemals Lust haben, selbst indisches Essen zu kochen oder fertig zubereitetes indisches Essen zu kaufen.

    "original": "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston.

There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries.

Fast jede Wohnung in der Gegend kostete über tausend Dollar pro Monat. Ich hatte noch nie etwas davon gehört, und weder hatten es meine Freunde. Vielleicht ist es der Kampf. Ich kenne ein paar meiner Freunde, die nachts vor Schlafenszeit weinen. Die Dinge sind teuer, aber wir haben im Laufe der Jahre gelernt, sparsam zu sein. Man lernt den staubigen Geruch von Flohmarkt-Spielzeug und mothballierten Kleidern zu mögen. Man riecht im Erwachsenenalter viel weniger. Man könnte anfangen zu rauchen, oder man ist einfach zu sehr an den Zustand der Dinge gewöhnt. Aber der Flohmarkt macht sich immer wieder bemerkbar. Der Geruch des Erwachsenenalters ist staubige Zeitschriften, die auf einem geschlossenen Klavier gestapelt sind. Er drängt sich in das Leder und bleibt auch nach dem Waschen erhalten. Hier gibt es drei Secondhandläden in Gehweite. Wenn man an der weitesten Stelle beginnt, kann man zwei Wohltätigkeitssecondhandläden, eine Bibliothek, einen Antiquariat und einen Kuriositätenladen besuchen. In der Innenstadt ist es dicht, Autos und Menschen füllen jeden Morgen die Straßen, aber man hört es in den Secondhandläden nicht. Egal wie viele Menschen oder Autos vorbeifahren, der Laden ist still. Es ist ein schöner Ort, um einen Nachmittag zu verlieren. Jedes Jahr wird es immer mehr davon. Autos und Menschen überschwemmen es. Es ist eine sich entwickelnde Stadt, sagen sie. Mit dem Hauptsitz eines der größten Online-Imperien für E-Commerce und Lieferung zeigt sie immer noch Wachstumsschmerzen. Es erinnert mich an New York. Alles und jeder hat seine eigenen Ziele, und niemand fragt nach viel von dir. Man kann allein, ruhig und unabhängig sein, und die Leute lassen einen in Ruhe. Es ist nicht wie im Süden, wo man mit einer kleinen Sorge zeigt, dass man sich kümmert. Man drängt hier nicht in das Leben der anderen ein. Man kann seine Hülle so lange wie man möchte beibehalten, und die Stadt rast und rollt wie Wellen am Strand zurück. Es ist ein lebhafter Ort. Zwischen dem Pianisten nebenan und den zwei Amateur-Sängerinnen oben drüben gibt es immer etwas los. In gewisser Weise haben wir weniger eine Wohnung voller Fremder und mehr eine Gemeinschaft von Freunden. Wir kommen zusammen, um unsere Bedürfnisse zu erfüllen, Geburtstage zu feiern, Beerdigungen zu trauern und uns gegenseitig zu helfen, wenn wir können. In gewisser Weise bin ich hier glücklich. Ich mag die meisten meiner Nachbarn und sie behandeln mich ziemlich gut. Ich versuche, sicherzustellen, dass ich mich selbst sauber halte und ihnen Essen hinterlasse, und sie tun das gleiche. Ich bringe ihnen Post und sie mir. Es ist schön, sie zu sehen, und ich glaube, dass sie meine Gegenwart genauso genießen wie ich ihre. Ich wohne in einer massiven, entmenschlichen modernen Sprawl, aber es sind Menschen wie meine Nachbarn, die mir das Gefühl geben, dass ich mein Leben nicht ganz ruiniert habe.\n\n[REWRITE]\nThe first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing.

    "original": "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",

Meine unmittelbare Nachbarschaft, auf der Ostseite der Stadt, könnte als das wirtschaftlich benachteiligste Gebiet der Stadt bezeichnet werden. Die Immobilienwerte sind niedrig, wobei die meisten Häuser an einkommensschwache Personen vermietet oder von ihnen besessen werden. Es ist jedoch nicht unattraktiv oder unangenehm. Meine Nachbarn sind im Allgemeinen freundliche Menschen, die mir lächeln und Hallo sagen, wenn ich die Straße entlang gehe. Die Kriminalitätsraten sind, wenn auch etwas höher als in anderen Stadtteilen, im Allgemeinen niedrig. In den letzten zehn Jahren gab es in den wenigen Blocks in der Nähe meines Hauses ein paar gewalttätige Verbrechen, darunter ein paar Schüssen und mindestens einen Mord. Unsere Nachbarn verloren letztes Jahr ihren Sohn bei einer Schießerei vor einer Bar in der Nähe. Glücklicherweise hat unsere Familie von Kriminalität nur dann direkt betroffen waren, wenn gelegentlich ein Gegenstand von unserem Veranda verschwand, wenn wir ihn vergessen haben nach innen zu bringen. Im Allgemeinen hat die Stadt, in der ich wohne, von der „Opioid-Epidemie“ stark betroffen sein, die viele Teile der Vereinigten Staaten betrifft. Viele Menschen sind an Fentanyl-Überdosierungen gestorben. Glücklicherweise gibt es in meiner Stadt viele Ressourcen, um dieser Epidemie entgegenzuwirken, darunter mehrere Entzugsbehandlungszentren und Narcan-Schulungen für Familien und Freunde von Opioid-Abhängigen. Trotz dieser Herausforderungen hat diese Stadt viele positive Eigenschaften. Die Grundschule meines Sohnes hat ein hervorragendes Team, von der Schulleitung über die Lehrer bis hin zum Betreuungspersonal. Obwohl er besondere Bedürfnisse hat, hat er bisher aufgrund der unglaublich positiven Atmosphäre der Schule keine Mobbing erlebt und liebt es dort. Wir haben einen aktiven Elternausschuss, der das ganze Jahr über mehrere Veranstaltungen plant, um die familiäre Beteiligung und den Bildungserfolg zu fördern. Da über 20 % der Bevölkerung unserer Stadt unterhalb der Armutsgrenze lebt, stellt die Grundschule allen Schülern kostenlose Frühstück und Mittagessen bereit, damit kein Kind hungern muss. Keine Kind oder Familie wird aufgrund von Zahlungsverweigerung als „weniger“ behandelt, und die Kosten für Schulgebühren, Materialien und Schulausflüge sind sehr angemessen. Der Stadtrat und das Personal haben viele Verbesserungen am Erscheinungsbild unserer Stadt vorgenommen, darunter die Wiederherstellung von Straßen, die Gestaltung von Grünanlagen und die Renovierung städtischer Parks. Leider sind die meisten dieser Verbesserungen im Zentrum der Stadt und auf der Westseite stattgefunden, wo sich die meisten Einkaufsmöglichkeiten befinden und der größte Teil des Verkehrs fließt. Die Ostseite, wo ich wohne, wird eher vernachlässigt, was bei den Bewohnern meines Viertels für Unmut sorgt. Insgesamt genieße ich es, in dieser Stadt zu leben. Die Menschen sind im Allgemeinen freundlich, die Schulen sind großartig, es gibt genügend Einkaufsmöglichkeiten (beides kleine Unternehmen und größere Einzelhandelsgeschäfte), um den Bedürfnissen meiner Familie gerecht zu werden, und unser Haus mag nicht viel wert sein, aber es ist komfortabel und ausreichend. Unsere Familie lebt hier seit über 16 Jahren und kann sich nicht vorstellen, woanders zu leben.\n\n\n\n## English Translation:\n\n[REWRITE]\nI live in a small town in the Midwest, just outside the suburbs of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates are, while slightly higher than other parts of town, generally low. In the past ten years, there have been a few violent crimes within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a nearby bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n[/REWRITE] \n\n\n",

I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",

    "raw_output": "## German Translation:\n\nMeine Nachbarschaft ist voller Kultur. Sie liegt auf einem Hügel, umgeben von Gebäuden mit historischer Bedeutung. Ich wohne in einem siebenstöckigen Apartmentgebäude direkt gegenüber dem alten Theater und ein paar Straßen weiter, auf dem Hügel, befindet sich ein cooler kleiner Arcade-Bar, an dem verschiedene Leute an warmen Sommerabenden strömen. Oftmals, besonders an Wochenenden im Juni und Juli, sieht man eine Schlange von Menschen, die darauf warten, hineinzukehren. Ein paar Blocks weiter oben befindet sich der nächste Stadtpark. Er ist für den Stadtteil recht groß. Der Park ist von Beton umgeben, mit hohen Stufen, die in die Wand gegossen sind. Während der frostigen Wintermonate richten obdachlose Menschen ihre Zelte in ordentlichen Reihen entlang des Bürgersteigs und an den breiten Stufen auf. Es schneit nicht viel, aber es regnet, und der sintflutartige Regen in den mittleren Wintermonaten macht es oft schwierig, warm zu bleiben. Indem sie ihre Zelte dicht beieinander aufstellen, mitten in der Stadt anstatt im Dschungel, bleiben sie viel wärmer. Sie sind auch in angemessener Geh- und Verkehrsdistanz zum einzigen Familienzentrum für Meilen, wo sie baden und duschen können. Was ich an meiner Stadt liebe, ist jedoch nicht die Schönheit der historischen Natur - die hohen stolzen Gebäude, die Architektur, die über die verschiedenen Ebenen der Hügel verteilt ist, die zum Meer hinabrollen. Was ich an meiner Nachbarschaft liebe, ist die Kultur der Menschen selbst. Sie sehen, Hilltop war einst die berüchtigtste Nachbarschaft an der Westküste wegen der Bandenkriminalität. Man hört immer noch Geschichten, selbst drei Jahrzehnte später, über die Bundesbeamten und die DEA, die wie ein Besen durchzogen, um die Straßen zu säubern. Die Leute vergessen es nicht. Geschichten werden von Generation zu Generation weitergegeben, bis hin zu Transplantation wie mir, von diesen Tagen. Die Menschen arbeiten hart, obwohl es immer noch eine der rauen Viertel der gesamten Stadt gilt, um es sauber zu halten. Sie kümmern sich immer noch darum, was in ihrer Stadt, in ihrem Block passiert. Sie sagen, wenn du weiß bist, solltest du nach Einbruch der Dunkelheit nicht auf dem Hügel herumlaufen. Wahrlich, ich glaube, diese Warnung erinnert an die alten Zeiten und ist mit dem sauren Geschmack der sozialen Konditionierung durchtränkt. Vielleicht bin ich einfach dunkel genug, um als nicht ganz \"weiße Mädchen\" durchzugehen, oder vielleicht erkennt Hilltop mich als eines ihrer eigenen an, jemanden, der genauso schmerzhaft die Erinnerungen kennt, die unsere Nation ständig plagen. Erinnerungen daran, dass Rassismus, kulturelle Konditionierung und Annahmen aus Ignoranz und Angst entstehen, selbst in einer Stadt, die ein kulturelles Schmelztiegel-Utopie sein soll. Ich weiß eines: egal wie weit ich reise, der Hilltop ist meine Heimat. Ich fühle mich lebendig, wenn ich nachts auf diesen Straßen unterwegs bin und Menschen treffe, die mir schneller und seltener böswillig einen Mantel angeboten haben als mich auszurauben. Es ist ein Ort, an dem Waschsalonbesitzer extra ein paar Minuten geöffnet haben, damit ich mein Handy aufladen konnte, als ich nirgendwohin flüchten konnte, vor dem Regen. Es ist ein Ort, an dem ich gesessen habe, mich für unsichtbar gehalten habe, an Betonfassaden gekuschelt an den grauensten und dümmsten Nächten, nur um von jemandem angehalten zu werden, der mir in die Augen schaut, mir 5 Dollar gibt und mir sagt, dass ich schön und wertvoll bin.\n\n[REWRITE]\n\nMy neighborhood is full of culture.

Viele Häuser in der Nachbarschaft haben ältere Aluminiumverkleidungen. Wir haben Häuser in allen Farben, die du dir vorstellen kannst, in den Blöcken, die meine Haus umgeben. Die meisten Häuser haben Gärten. Gärten mit Trampolinen und Spielplätzen. Manche Leute haben Gärten und Zäune für ihre Tiere. Die Häuser erinnern an Mittelamerika. Arbeiter, die hart arbeiten, um ihren Lebensunterhalt zu verdienen und entweder Familien großziehen oder aufgezogen haben. An jedem Tag siehst du Kinder, die die Straßen hinunterrennen. Du siehst auch Leute, die ihre Hunde ausführen, Fahrrad fahren und Rollerskaten. Nachbarn kennen Nachbarn und du kannst erkennen, wer dazugehört und wer nicht dazugehört. Du siehst jemanden grillen und winkst, oder sogar jemanden, der seinen Hund aus einem paar Häuserblocks entfernt ausführt und lächelt. Die Rasenflächen sind in einem akzeptablen Zustand. Niemand hat Laub vom Herbst liegen. Der grüne Rasen wird gemäht und im Zaum gehalten. Wenn Leute Pflanzen und Sträucher in ihren Gärten haben, werden diese zurückgeschnitten. Es ist keine schöne Nachbarschaft, in die man fährt und denkt: Wow, schau dir die schönen Häuser an, sondern eine, in die man fährt und denkt: Wow, hier wäre es schön, eine Familie großzuziehen. Es ist ruhig, friedlich und sicher. Obwohl es nur durchschnittlich aussieht, ist es außergewöhnlich, weil es das darstellt, was die Menschen sich wünschen, nämlich einen sicheren Ort, an dem man am Ende des Tages landen kann.
