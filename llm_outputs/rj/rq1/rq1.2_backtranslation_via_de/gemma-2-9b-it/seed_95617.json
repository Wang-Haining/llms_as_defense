Wohngebiete sind scheinbar zufällig zwischen Gewerbezonen verteilt, in denen eine Vielzahl von Unternehmen betrieben werden. Einige dieser Unternehmen bestehen aus Büros, während andere verschiedene Geschäfte, Restaurants und Unterhaltungsstätten sind. Es mangelt nicht an neuen Restaurants zum Essen gehen oder Geschäften zum Einkaufen. Während einige Geschäfte große, bekannte Marken sind, die von großen Unternehmen betrieben werden, werden auch kleine Boutiquen immer beliebter. Sie befinden sich nicht nur in verschiedenen Einkaufszentren, sondern säumen auch die Straßen, die oft zu Fuß von Wohngebieten erreichbar sind, die ansonsten ruhig und friedlich wären, wenn sie nicht von so vielen interessanten Punkten umgeben wären. Es gibt auch ein paar nahe gelegene Parks, und ich habe bemerkt, dass Menschen diese Parks mit ihren kleinen Kindern besuchen. Apropos Menschen, es gibt tatsächlich eine ziemliche Vielfalt in meiner Nachbarschaft. An einem kleinen Ort haben wir eine prominente LGBTQ+ -Gemeinschaft, eine orthodox-jüdische Gemeinschaft und eine Sammlung von Flüchtlingen und Einwanderern aus der ehemaligen Sowjetunion. Ein wenig außerhalb meiner Nachbarschaft gibt es viele mehr Menschen verschiedener Herkunft und Hautfarbe, obwohl sie manchmal in eigene kleine Gemeinschaften innerhalb der Stadt aufgeteilt sind. Wir haben Orte, die als Koreatown, Chinatown, Little Armenia und viele mehr bekannt sind, die nur wenige Meilen entfernt sind. Aber nur wenige Meilen können sich als sehr lange Fahrt erweisen. Eine Strecke von nur 10 Meilen kann manchmal zwei Stunden dauern, aufgrund des Verkehrs, besonders zur Stoßzeit. Kaum jemand in meiner Stadt geht irgendwo hin zu Fuß. Während bestimmte Sehenswürdigkeiten unweigerlich in der Nähe sind, ist die Stadt riesig und die Menschen bevorzugen es im Allgemeinen nicht, zu Fuß zu pendeln. Als Ergebnis haben wir auch einen der schlimmsten Verkehrsstaus der Welt, und es kann schwierig sein, Parkplätze fast überall zu finden. Ironischerweise gab es in den letzten Jahren eine große Bautätigkeit, da große Wohnanlagen in die Stadt gebaut werden. Es scheint ein beliebtes Reiseziel zu sein, aber viele Bewohner sind enttäuscht von der Aussicht auf noch mehr Einziehende und noch mehr Fahrzeuge auf den Straßen. In meiner Stadt gibt es viele verschiedene Arten von Häusern. Nicht jeder wohnt oder möchte in einem großen Apartmentgebäude leben. Wohngebiete bestehen aus Häusern in verschiedenen Größen und kleineren Apartmentgebäuden und Eigentumswohnungen. Einige Immobilien enthalten Einfamilienhäuser, während andere Doppelhaushälften enthalten. Das trifft auch auf meine unmittelbare Nachbarschaft zu, daher gibt es auch keinen Mangel an Vielfalt bei den Wohnmöglichkeiten. Ähnlich ist die Nachbarschaft aus Menschen unterschiedlichen Alters zusammengesetzt, und um ehrlich zu sein, kenne ich die Mehrheit meiner Nachbarn nicht. Es ist heutzutage nicht mehr eine enge Gemeinschaft, obwohl ich viele Erinnerungen aus meiner Kindheit habe, in denen ich draußen mit meinem Nachbarn und ein paar anderen Freunden aus der Nachbarschaft gespielt habe, die alle ungefähr mein Alter hatten.\n\n[REWRITE]\nSince I live in a large city, my neighborhood is very diverse.

Die meisten Häuser sind Einfamilienhäuser, aber es gibt ein paar Häuser, die in zwei Teile aufgeteilt wurden, obwohl sie immer noch miteinander verbunden sind, wenn das Sinn macht. Mein Haus hat einen kleinen Garten vor sich und eine kleine Einfahrt links neben dem Haus. Es erinnert, wie die meisten anderen auch, an eine Zeit nicht allzu lange her, in der das Leben in den Vororten der amerikanische Traum war. Dieser Traum schien einst das Volk dieses Landes zu umarmen, aber jetzt zieht er sich zurück. Aber meine Nachbarschaft und viele andere bleiben noch bestehen, rufen immer noch zu uns und den Besuchern, dass der Traum noch lebt, und wir halten ihn so gut wie möglich fest. Die Leute fühlen sich nicht mehr so optimistisch wie früher, die Pflege der kleinen Gärten ist nicht mehr das, was sie mal war, aber es steht immer noch ein Auto oder zwei in jeder Einfahrt, die Kinder spielen immer noch, als ob die Welt um sie herum das Ganze ihres Daseins wäre. Die öffentliche Schule, die seit fast 90 Jahren hier ist, steht noch immer, sie scheint immer noch die Zukunft in den heutigen Jugendlichen zu wecken, während sie bei den älteren Bewohnern Nostalgie hervorruft. Die Kirchen sind weit auseinander, größtenteils leer, aber die Basketballplätze sind immer noch voll. Alle Häuser sehen unterschiedlich aus, fühlen sich aber gleich an. Es gibt einen großen Supermarkt namens \"Super A\", der in Familienbesitz ist, die sehr wahrscheinlich die einzige arabische Familie in der Nachbarschaft sind. Die überwiegende Mehrheit der Bewohner ist afroamerikanisch. Die Straßen sind breit und die Kinder spielen normalerweise Fußball, sie stoppen nur, um den Autos Platz zu machen. Die meisten Menschen in meiner Nachbarschaft leben hier schon seit Generationen und die meisten können Geschichten von einer Zeit erzählen, in der jeder jeden kannte. Es gab eine Karateschule, aber als Hollywood hörte mit dem Machen von Karate Kid-Filmen auf, wollten die Kinder nicht mehr Karate Kid sein, also ist es jetzt eine Apotheke, weil Drogen alles besser machen, oder so habe ich gehört. Es gibt auch ein kleines Kino, das alte Filme zu ermäßigten Preisen ausstrahlt, vom Publikum der Jugend ferngehalten durch ihre Verachtung für den Mangel an aktuellen Titeln, aber von den Älteren bevorzugt, die es für einen kleinen Preis für einen Abend außerhalb des Hauses halten, natürlich ohne die Kinder. Es gibt eine einzige Schnellstraße, die durch meine Stadt führt. Obwohl die Aus- und Einfahrt in der Nachbarstadt ist. Es gab einst eine Petition, um einen Ausgang für unsere Stadt zu bekommen. Die Jugend unterstützte es, während die Älteren sich weigerten. Es scheint, dass die Schnellstraße in unserer Stadt alles ruinieren würde, sagten die Älteren, die schließlich den Stadtrat davon überzeugten, den Antrag abzulehnen. Sie bauen eine neue Highschool, und wir versuchen, uns für ein Maskottchen für unsere Stadt zu entscheiden. Ich denke, ein Cyborg mit südstaaten-Akzent und einer Blockhütte wäre die beste Darstellung meiner Stadt. \n\n\n[REWRITE]\nMy neighborhood is interesting.

    "original": "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face.

    "raw_output": "“Wo ist alles?” fragte sie, als wir an den Maisfeldern vorbeifuhren, die den Horizont füllten. “Das ist es!” sagte ich, in dem Wissen, dass sie vom Mangel an Bebauung der offenen Landschaft schockiert sein würde. Sie kam aus einer Stadt, in der man zum Supermarkt nur 5 Minuten zu Fuß gehen musste – sie hatte noch nie so viel freie Fläche in ihrem Leben gesehen. Ergriffen von der Allgegenwärtigkeit der Maisfelder, erzählte ich ihr, wie es war, in ländlichem Ohio aufzuwachsen, und in diesem Moment erkannte sie endlich, wer ich war und woher ich kam. Auf einer zwei Fahrspuren breiten Landstraße gelangen Sie zu einem Steinbruch, der mit Wasser gefüllt ist. Direkt danach liegt die kleine Siedlung, in der ich wohne. Die Häuser bestehen hauptsächlich aus Ziegel und Stuck. Jedes Haus hat mindestens eine halbe Acre Land, das jeder stolz pflegt. Während des Frühlings sind neben den mittelwestlichen Bäumen, die sich mit jeder Jahreszeit verändern, reichlich Blumen des Jahresanbaus vorhanden. Die Auffahrten sind alle mit den hochwertigsten Mercedes-Benz Luxusautos gefüllt, die nach einer guten alten Autowäsche im Mittagssonnenlicht glänzen. Weiter auf der Straße zu meinem grauen Stuckhaus fährt mein koreanischer Nachbar immer draußen mit einem freundlichen Gesicht am Straßenrand. Er verbringt den ganzen Tag damit, seinen Rasen zu mähen, und man kann sein Singen über das Summen seines Mäher hören. Jeder im Viertel findet ihn lustig, aber er ist immer echt und eine außergewöhnliche Person mit einer einzigartigen Geschichte. Er hat älter geworden und einiges an seinem Witz eingebüßt. In seiner Vergangenheit war er Arzt und mischt sich normalerweise mit dem Gras und seinem John Deere Zero Turn Mäher. Schließlich erreichen Sie mein Haus. Auf dem seitlichen Grundstück sind Gänserenten reichlich vorhanden und werden von unserem Terrier verfolgt. Hinterm Haus fließt ein kleiner Bach in den Steinbruch. Hier kann man Frösche, den Bach und das gelegentliche „Mäh“ der nahe gelegenen Bauernhöfe hören. Über die handgefertigte Holmbrücke führt es zu einer unberührten Oase voller natürlich wachsender Bäume, Kräuter und Wildblumen. Hier verbrachte ich den größten Teil meiner Kindheit. Vom Bau von Baumhäusern bis zum „Jagen“ von Tieren (das hauptsächlich aus ihrem Verfolgen bestand), gab es immer etwas zu tun und in der Regel ein Nachbarskind, mit dem man Freundschaft schließen konnte. Die Winter in meiner kleinen Stadt können schmerzhaft brutal sein, aber es gibt nichts Schöneres. Der Garten verwandelt sich von einem Meer aus Grün in eine leere Wildnis. Die Bäume, die einst von leuchtend rosa, lila und orangefarbenen Blumen beherbergt wurden, verwandeln sich in kahle Skelette aus Rinde. Wenn man manchmal mit Schnee gesegnet ist, erscheint über Nacht ein Winterwunderland. Der Garten ist gesäumt von Schneemännern und Schneefiguren, die von meiner kleinen Schwester geformt wurden. Meine Schwester und ich haben uns in unserer Kindheit oft gestritten, und im Winter waren Schneebälle unsere Waffe der Wahl. Wir bauten riesige Iglu-ähnliche Festungen, um unsere Waffen, normalerweise Äste, aufzubewahren, wie eine Waffenkammer. In unserem eigenen kleinen Wunderland spielten wir verspielt in einer Zeit, in der nichts anderes zählte. Wir waren einfach junge Kinder ohne Sorgen.\n\n[REWRITE]\n“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the cornfields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock at the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town where the grocery store was a 5-minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Overwhelmed by the ubiquity of cornfields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry that is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly made of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least half an acre of land to themselves, which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest-end Mercedes-Benz luxury cars that gleam in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash.

Das inoffizielle Stadtmotto, auf einem Gebäude, das gleichzeitig als Pizzaria, Bar, Musiklokal, Stripclub fungiert und in mindestens der Hälfte dieser Unternehmungen mit dem Gesetz spielt, lautet \"Keep Portland Weird\". Für manche ist dies ein kleiner Aufruf, sich an das Portland der 90er und frühen 2000er Jahre zu erinnern, ein Portland, das weniger bekannt und weniger teuer war, und in dem kreative und einzigartige Subkulturen entstanden. Für andere ist es ein Ruf - komm nach Portland, wo die Leute dich immer noch als \"weird\" bezeichnen, aber diesmal als Kompliment. Trotz des Zustroms wohlhabender Kalifornier und des ständigen Baus von Eigentumswohnungen für diese Kalifornier ist Portland immer noch weird. Weird bedeutet nicht immer Akzeptanz, aber es bedeutet die Akzeptanz von Dingen, die normalerweise nicht akzeptiert werden. Weird bedeutet nicht, dass wir keine modernen Annehmlichkeiten und moderne Kämpfe haben. Wie der Rest des Landes kaufen wir die meisten unserer Dinge aus China. Es gibt eine Million Möglichkeiten, weird zu sein, nicht normal zu sein, aber Portland hat auch viel Normalität. Portland hat Yoga, Hipster und Geschäftsleute. Vielleicht bedeutet Weird, dass wir all das einfach weniger ernst nehmen. In meiner Nachbarschaft, wie in vielen Portland-Vierteln, haben wir bunt gefasste Häuser, Hausgärten mit Blumen, Kräutern und Gemüse, die die Straßen säumen, und kostenlose Kisten im Sommer. Freie Kisten sind traditionell Kartons, die Gegenstände enthalten, die jemand loswerden möchte, können aber auch Plastiktüten oder Kisten sein. Sie enthalten etwas Magisches, ein Schatz, der perfekt für die Person ist, die vorbeikommt, überraschend oft. In kostenlosen Kisten findet man oft Kleidung und Bücher, aber es kann alles sein. Das magische Potenzial, durch ein Viertel in Südost-Portland zu schlendern, ist das, worum es in Portland geht. Das ist zumindest das, worum es in Portland für mich geht, aber ich bin nur eine Variante von weird unter Tausenden. Manche Menschen, die in meinem Umfeld leben, würden niemals träumen, ihre Kleidung aus einer Box am Bürgersteig herauszupicken. Diese Leute gehen zu Ziegen-Yoga (ja, Yoga mit echten Ziegen) oder zu Timbers-Spielen (dem Fußballteam der Stadt). Portland ist voller Menschen, die alle möglichen Dinge lieben. Portland ist voller Menschen, die ihre Träume verfolgen oder träumen, ihre Träume zu verfolgen, während sie zu viel Zeit in der Bar verbringen. Ja, Portland hat ein Drogenproblem. Drogenprobleme haben in der Regel (an ihren Wurzeln) psychische Probleme, und der konstante Regen über einen Großteil des Jahres, plus die düstere Bewölkung, scheinen einen Beitrag zu leisten. Portland hat auch ein Obdachlosenproblem, mit dem niemand etwas anfangen kann. Die Obdachlosenpopulation wird von den Sozialdiensten angezogen, die Portland bietet, die in den meisten Teilen des Landes besser sind, aber unsere Dienste sind unzureichend, wie in allen Teilen des Landes. Die nicht obdachlose Bevölkerung schwankt zwischen Fürsorge und Hass. Dabei sind wir überhaupt nicht weird.\n\n\n[REWRITE]\nThe first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\".

Egal, wie sehr ich sie vergesse oder wie sehr ich mit Arbeit und dem Leben beschäftigt bin, um sie zu bemerken, sie sind da, standhaft, unbeeindruckt und unbeeindruckt von den Schwierigkeiten des Lebens. Dann an Tagen, an denen ich am gestresstesten und am meisten aufgewühlt bin, fordern sie, gesehen zu werden, und wenn ich mich ihnen zuwende, lassen sie mich meine ängstliche Seele ruhen und verleihen mir etwas Kraft, weiterzumachen, von einem Tag zum anderen. Ich bin hierher gezogen, als ich mein Studium begann, und die Berge nördlich des Campus waren es, die mich zuerst fesselten. Sicher, die Universität hat auch ihre eigenen atemberaubenden Sehenswürdigkeiten in Gebäuden, Seen und Bäumen, die ihren eigenen Platz in meinem Herzen haben, aber es sind die Berge, die wirklich den Thron halten. Der Rest der Stadt ist auf seine eigene Art schön. Es gibt unzählige Cafés, in denen viele Stunden mit Koffein getankt wurden. Man kann zu Fuß oder mit dem Bus nur ein Stück weiter in die Innenstadt fahren und von einer Aura der Antike umhüllt werden, die von den verblassten farbig gestrichenen Ziegeln geprägt ist, die Restaurants und Bürogebäude säumen. Hier zeigt sich diese scheinbar vorstädtische Stadt so viel Trubel und Lebendigkeit wie ihre benachbarte Großstadt. Das hält aber nicht lange an, denn man kann, sobald man an der Bibliothek vorbeigeht, wieder in die ruhige Kleinstadt entkommen. Diese Dichotomie der Atmosphären in solcher Nähe verleiht dieser Stadt wirklich eine wunderbare Stimmung, als ob sie zum Entdecken eingeladen würde. Damit ist es leicht, viele geliebte Erinnerungen zu schaffen, jede in Verbindung mit einem bestimmten Teil der Stadt. Sei es das Vorbeigehen an den rostigen Schaukeln im Park mit Freunden nach einer ganzen Nacht, oder das Laufen durch die belebte Innenstadt, um den Film im schicken Kino zu sehen, für den die Universität Tickets besorgt hat. Ach ja, hier gibt es auch viele bittere Erinnerungen, wie all die Orte im Leben dazu neigen. Die Seen sind besonders ein eher passabler Ort für die Reflexion sowie für Traurigkeitssitzungen um zwei Uhr morgens mitten in einer existentiellen Krise. Letzteres habe ich mehr Erfahrung. Während ich zusah, wie Schildkröten, Enten und Insekten ihr Leben auslebten, jeder mit einem Beitrag oder einer Rolle, konnte ich nicht anders, als über meinen eigenen Sinn des Zwecks nachzudenken, als ich versuchte, diesem Mysterium namens Leben zu folgen. Also ging ich am See vorbei, am Park und den kleinen Häusern, die nach Vorstadt so viel ausstrahlen, bis ich eine Hauptstraße erreichte. Dann schien die Sonne ihre strahlenden Strahlen auf die Palmen, malte den Himmel auf dem Weg und als ich zum Sonnenaufgang hinaufblickte, merkte ich, dass ich nach Norden ging. So waren sie da, wie immer. Die robusten, übermächtigen Berge streiften den verschwommenen blau-gelben Himmel mehr als jedes Gebäude am Horizont, und als ob sie ohne Worte sprachen, erwachte in mir mein Gefühl der Ausdauer.\n\n[REWRITE]\nThe mountains are always there.

Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",

Öffentliche Verkehrsmittel sind sehr zugänglich und eine der beliebtesten Verkehrsmittel in New York City. Bensonhurst ist ein ziemlich städtisches Viertel, also werden Sie sich immer noch wie in New York City fühlen. Während Ihres Besuchs sollten Sie sich auf verschiedene asiatische Geschäfte in der Umgebung einstellen. In den letzten zwei Jahrzehnten hat Bensonhurst einen Zustrom asiatischer Bewohner erlebt. Deshalb sehen Sie in der Umgebung jeden Block mindestens einen asiatisch geführten Laden. Am beliebtesten sind Supermärkte und Waschsalons. Zufällig sind diese Geschäfte bei den lokalen Bewohnern sehr beliebt, da die Qualität der Lebensmittel in den Supermärkten hervorragend ist, die Preise viel günstiger sind und schließlich auch wichtig ist, dass es sehr praktisch ist. Direkt in der Nähe wo ich bin, gibt es vier asiatische Supermärkte, die jeweils zwei Minuten zu Fuß voneinander entfernt sind. Das trägt nur zur Erleichterung des Einkaufs bei. Ich sage nicht, dass Bensonhurst ausschließlich von asiatischen Bewohnern bewohnt wird. Es ist in der ganzen Gegend sehr vielfältig, mit Einwanderern und ihren Kindern der ersten und zweiten Generation. Die meisten großen und beliebten Geschäfte in der Gegend sind asiatisch geführt. Zusätzlich zu diesen asiatisch geführten Geschäften gibt es in der Nähe auch einen kürzlich renovierten Park, der etwa zehn Basketballplätze, ein großes Fußball- oder Baseballfeld, vier Handballplätze, Schaukeln, einen Spielplatz für Kinder und sogar eine Wasserstelle für Kinder, die im Sommer Wasser genießen können. Da wir uns in New York City befinden, sind die Parks natürlich sehr vielfältig. Sie werden hier allerhand Vielfalt sehen, die gut miteinander spielen und sich verstehen kann. In diesem Viertel gibt es nicht viele große Firmengebäude. Die einzigen Gebäude, die Sie finden würden, sind Wohnhäuser für Genossenschaften oder Eigentumswohnungen. Die Mehrheit der Wohnräume hier sind jedoch Doppelhäuser. Die meisten Menschen sind ziemlich nett, aber sehr laut. Jeden Tag würden Sie Autos hören, die Musik während der Fahrt spielen, oder ständig das Gaspedal durchtreten, was Sie morgens aus dem Schlaf reißt. Wenn Sie nachts besuchen, sollten Sie auf der Hut sein. Dieses Viertel ist ziemlich sicher, aber die Menschen sind unvorhersehbar. Sie könnten auf Leute stoßen, die aus dem Nichts Streitigkeiten anfangen wollen, Schläger und Diebe. Ich selbst wurde in der Vergangenheit in diesem Viertel körperlich angegriffen, aber das liegt schon viele Jahre zurück. Ein anderes kürzlich bekannt gewordenes Ereignis betraf Diebstahl von Paketen. Obwohl es ein häufiges Problem ist, gibt es in diesem Viertel Paketdiebe. Zu guter Letzt, obwohl New York City eine Strafe für Personen verhängt, die nicht nach ihren Hunden aufräumen, halten sich die Leute hier nicht an die Regeln. Jeden Morgen sehen Sie mindestens einen Hundekot auf dem Weg zum Bahnhof oder zum Supermarkt. Mein größter Pet-Peeve ist Hundekot auf dem Boden überall dort, wo ich in diesem Viertel unterwegs bin. Seien Sie vorsichtig und halten Sie Ihre Schuhe sauber!\n\n\n\n[REWRITE]\nIf you are planning on visiting Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it!

Alles scheint bergab zu fließen, und mein Haus liegt direkt auf dem Scheitelpunkt des steilsten Hügels in der Nachbarschaft. Die Leute nennen es den \"Ausdauerhügel\", weil so viele Jogger gerne hinauflaufen, während ihres täglichen Trainings. Da es an meiner Straße überhaupt keine Bürgersteige gibt, gehen die Leute auf der Straße. Die Straße ist an einigen Stellen uneben und kann sich ein bisschen gefährlich für den Verkehr anfühlen. Einige der Telefon- und Stromleitungen, die im Block herumhängen, sehen morsch aus. Es regnet und stürmt in unserer Gegend häufig, daher treffen Äste und andere Unrat oft die Stromleitungen und die ständigen Reparaturen lassen sie aussehen wie ein gecheckertes und geflickenes Muster. Es gibt überall große, immergrüne Bäume. Aber die Leute hier hassen die Bäume. Sie bemühen sich, so viele wie möglich zu fällen, weil die Bäume den Blick auf den Ozean versperren. Deshalb sind viele der Häuser so hoch auf dem Hügel gebaut, mit riesigen, glasverkleideten Obergeschossen, die wie ein Wuchern aneinandergefügt sind, um den Blick auf die Bucht zu genießen. Es ist wunderschön bei Sonnenuntergang, wenn das Wasser wie von unten beleuchtet zu sein scheint und der Himmel orange wird. Es ist aber meist bewölkt, also sieht man den Großteil des Sonnenlichts durch einen Nebel. Die meisten Tage sind bedeckt und feucht. Moos wächst auf allem, was es kann: auf Dächern, Autos und Geländern. Einmal habe ich mein Auto einen Monat lang auf meiner Auffahrt geparkt, und als ich es benutzen wollte, war es grün und wollig mit Moos bedeckt. Es dauerte drei Stunden, bis ich alles abkratzen konnte. Es gibt nicht viele Kinder in meiner Gegend, obwohl es nur wenige Blocks von einer Schule entfernt ist. Die meisten Leute in meiner Nachbarschaft sind älter, viele von ihnen im Ruhestand. Anstatt Kinder haben die Leute Hunde. Es ist üblich, sie auf den Rasen der Leute sitzen oder die Straße hinunter rennen zu sehen. Wenn man eine Tür oder ein Fenster offen lässt, riskiert man, dass sie in das Haus eindringen. Ich fand einmal einen in meinem Wohnzimmer und musste ihn wieder durch die Haustür schimpfen. Kaninchen tummeln sich in der Gegend. Einige davon sind groß, und die Gärtner hassen sie, weil sie die Wurzeln von Pflanzen ausgraben und sich in die Rasenflächen von Leuten einbuddeln. Meine Katzen lieben sie aber, und haben die meisten von ihnen aus unserer Nachbarschaft gejagt. Es gibt auch die üblichen Vogelarten: kleine Ammern und Kolibris, und gelegentlich kreist ein Falken oder Adler vorbei, bis ihn die Nachbarschaftskrähen vertreiben. Es gibt keine Geschäfte in der Nähe, aber wenn man bergab zum Wasserfront wandert, gibt es ein paar Restaurants, die frisches Meeresfrüchte servieren. Es gibt nicht viel Strand dort unten, aber die Felsen entlang des Strandes sind lustig, um ins Wasser zu werfen. Die Bucht selbst ist nicht sehr breit.

I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here.

Die Leute beschäftigen sich hauptsächlich mit Gartenarbeit und anderen täglichen Arbeiten. Im Winter fahren wir mit Schlitten den Hügel auf unserer Seitenstraße herunter. Wir wohnen in einem Haus an der Eckseite unserer Straße, daher sehen wir jeden Tag alle, die kommen und gehen, und kennen die Autos, die hier herumgefahren werden. Wenn wir ein seltsames Fahrzeug sehen, machen wir uns normalerweise Notiz davon. Einige Nachbarn gehen spazieren, um sich zu bewegen oder einfach nur ihren Hund auszuführen. Kinder spielen mit ihren Fahrrädern und alles, was man erwarten würde. Wir sind viel zu Hause, da wir von zu Hause aus arbeiten. Wir sind zu viert: Ich, meine Frau und unsere zwei Töchter im Alter von elf und vierzehn Jahren. Also, ich würde sagen, dass sich alle anderen an unser Kommen und Gehen gewöhnt haben. Wir gehen draußen und spielen, manchmal sogar bei Regen. Manchmal grillen wir draußen auf unserer Hinterterrasse und es riecht immer angenehm nach Barbecue. Es scheint, als ob hier immer jemand den Rasen mäht und man fast jeden Tag von März bis Oktober, wenn das Gras endlich aufhört zu wachsen, einen Rasenmäher hört. Wir haben viele Bäume in unserer Nachbarschaft, da es ursprünglich ein bewaldetes Gebiet war, daher gibt es viel Schatten, aber im Herbst gibt es auch viele Blätter.

When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way.

High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife.

While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood.

Während andere, die auf diese Frage antworten, höchstwahrscheinlich Hausbesitzer mit eigenem Leben sind, ist meine Situation etwas anders. Ich betrachte meine Nachbarschaft als den Universitätscampus, auf dem ich wohne, und die Menschen, die in meinem Wohnheim leben, als meine Gemeinschaft. Ich betrachte auch den umliegenden Campus als meine Nachbarschaft, wenn auch in geringerem Maße. Trotz dieser Besonderheit teilt meine Nachbarschaft einige Gemeinsamkeiten mit den konventionelleren Vorstellungen von einer Nachbarschaft. Genau wie jede konventionelle Nachbarschaft hat die Nachbarschaft, in der ich wohne, Häuser, Menschen, Geschäfte und Parks. Lassen Sie uns beginnen, indem wir die „Häuser“ diskutieren, die meine Nachbarschaft ausmachen. Bevor ich mit der Erkundung der Häuser in meiner Nachbarschaft beginne, wäre es am besten, die Art der Häuser zu klären, die in meiner Nachbarschaft zu finden sind. Es gibt drei Arten von Wohnräumen in meiner unmittelbaren Umgebung: die Apartments, die eigentlichen Häuser und die Wohnheimhäuser. Zuerst gibt es in den Apartments in einem Raum in der Regel 2-4 Personen und es gibt etwa 4-6 Zimmer pro Etage. Das häufigste Gebäude kann etwa 2 Etagen beherbergen, daher leben durchschnittlich etwa 20 Menschen in jedem Gebäude. Zweitens gibt es die eigentlichen Häuser, die für jeden mit einer Verbindung zur Schule zur Miete verfügbar sind. Typischerweise sind dies 2-4-Zimmer-Einheiten, in denen in der Regel Alumni wohnen. Es gibt jedoch nur eine Handvoll dieser Art von Häusern in der Nachbarschaft verteilt, da sie weniger effizient sind. Schließlich gibt es die typischen Wohnheimzimmer, die Hunderte von Studenten beherbergen. Hier teilen sich zwei Personen ein Zimmer, mit Ausnahme einiger, und es ist die häufigste Art von Wohnraum in meiner Nachbarschaft. Nachdem wir das Thema Wohnen abgedeckt haben, können wir zu den Menschen übergehen. Meine Schule ist stolz auf ihre Vielfalt, und dies spiegelt sich im Erscheinungsbild meiner Nachbarschaft wider. Es gibt Menschen aus allen Kulturen und Altersgruppen, die in meiner Nachbarschaft leben. Die meisten Mitarbeiter des Fachbereichs wohnen in den Häusern, die in der Nachbarschaft stehen, während die jüngeren Studenten in der Wohngemeinschaftswohnungen leben und die älteren Studenten in den Apartments. Die Menschen in dieser Nachbarschaft lassen sich nicht nur durch Worte beschreiben, daher ist es am besten, einfach zu den Geschäften und Parks in meiner Nachbarschaft überzugehen. Da meine Schule wirklich eine eigenständige Nachbarschaft ist, hat sie eine Fülle an Geschäften und einen einzigen Park. Die Geschäfte sind eine Mischung aus Speisemöglichkeiten, die man in jeder anderen Nachbarschaft finden würde, und dem eigenen Markenzeichen der Schule für Kleidung und Lebensmittelgeschäfte. Dadurch kann alles, was benötigt wird, innerhalb der Grenzen meiner Nachbarschaft gefunden werden! Außerdem ist der Park in meiner Nachbarschaft ein Spielplatz für all die verschiedenen Menschen in meiner Nachbarschaft, er wird von allen Mitgliedern meiner Nachbarschaft sauber gehalten und vor Verbrechen geschützt!\n\n\n## Rewritten English:\n\n[REWRITE]\nWhen asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure my answer is somewhat unique.

Zuerst war ich ziemlich traurig, als ich zum ersten Mal in meine Nachbarschaft kam. Ich kam aus Riverdale nach Stockbridge und ich werde nicht lügen, ich habe geweint, weil ich sie vermisst habe und sie liebte. Aber meine Eltern wollten das Beste für mich und meine kleine Schwester, also sind wir in einen besseren Ort für Wohnraum, eine bessere High School, alles wurde als „nicht heruntergekommen“ betrachtet, als wir in unsere neue Nachbarschaft gezogen sind. Im Laufe der Jahre habe ich mich daran gewöhnt und mir neue Freunde und auch neue Feinde in der Schule gemacht. Ich habe im Laufe der Jahre meine Nachbarn nie wirklich kennengelernt, außer Herrn Glen und seinen Kindern sowie Dennis für eine Zeit, beide direkt neben uns. Sie sind angenehme Menschen, die ich fast als Familie betrachten kann, und ich schätze sie wirklich. Ich erinnere mich, als ich, Mama, Papa und meine Schwester zur Hochzeit von Herrn Glen gingen (Sie haben sich erneut getraut). Es war wirklich lustig und angenehm, um es gelinde auszudrücken, und etwas, auf das ich mich freue, wenn ich mein Vermögen aufbaue und meiner zukünftigen Frau das Leben einer Königin schenke. Als die Frau von Herrn Glen, Frau Veda, den weißen kleinen Träger an ihrem Bein abnahm und warf, fing ich ihn! Leider habe ich die Blumen nicht gefasst! Wir haben die ganze Nacht getanzt und ich habe mich wirklich gefreut, eine schöne Zeit mit Marsharii, einer ihrer Töchter, zu verbringen. Ich habe sie aber nicht mehr gesehen. Ich hoffe, sie ist zu größeren und besseren Dingen übergegangen. Die Nachbarschaft selbst ist wie ein Labyrinth, obwohl ich jetzt ein GPS habe, also kann ich mehr Zeit damit verbringen, es zu erkunden. Ich bin nur so weit gekommen, und das war, als ich mich mit meinen Freunden Kason und Curtis getroffen habe. Wir haben alle früher viel Videospiele gespielt und einfach das Leben in vollen Zügen genossen, so viel wie möglich. Manchmal ging ich in den Park und genoss die Natur, die meine Seele beruhigt. Es gibt mir ein Gefühl der Ruhe und des Friedens heutzutage. Ich bringe auch ein paar Stöcke mit, die ich vom Home Depot gekauft habe, und übe einfach mein Gleichgewicht. Und wenn ich kann, bringe ich mein hölzernes Schwert Bokken mit. Es macht mir Spaß, das zu tun, was ich liebe. Es gibt auch einen Basketball- und Tennisplatz, obwohl ich seit langem kein Tennis oder Basketball mehr gespielt habe. Es ist trotzdem schön, falls ich es jemals wieder aufnehmen und nochmal versuchen möchte. Mein Vater hat mich und meinen besten Freund von Mr. Graves mit Tennis großgezogen, und wir hatten immer eine tolle Zeit. Sie haben uns hart gearbeitet! Aber wir hatten immer Spaß. Ich denke, es gab viele Zeiten, in denen ich mich in dieser Nachbarschaft amüsiert habe, und es gibt viele Geschichten, aber das sind die, die mir wirklich im Gedächtnis geblieben sind, und ich glaube, das Beste ist noch zu kommen!\n\n[REWRITE]\nWell, considering that I've been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know.

    "original": "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",

Es gibt hauptsächlich Apartmentgebäude, aber ein paar Restaurants und Bars, die Spaß machen und nicht allzu teuer sind. Eine der Bars wurde gerade umbenannt und ist teurer, aber die Qualität des Service oder der Getränke ist nicht wirklich schlecht. Die meisten Leute sind nett. Sie sind entweder Studenten oder haben ein geringeres Einkommen, da die Mietwohnungen nicht sehr teuer sind. In der Nähe gibt es viele Kinder, da sich eine Grundschule in Gehweite von meiner Wohnung befindet. Ich kenne meine Nachbarn nicht, aber ich möchte das auch nicht. Sie rauchen viel Gras, und deshalb hat die Hausverwaltung eine Luftverfrischer-Einheit direkt gegenüber ihrer Tür installiert, was meinem Freund und mir sehr lustig vorkam. Es ist fast beleidigend. Die umliegenden Gebäude sehen in der Regel ziemlich alt aus, könnten aber innen renoviert sein. Etwas die Straße runter gibt es brandneue Apartments, aber ich mag sie nicht, weil ich weiß, dass die Bauarbeiten nicht besonders gut ausgeführt wurden. Sie sind billig gebaut, aber die Miete ist teuer, was ich für einen Betrug halte, aber weil sie in der Nähe des Campus liegen, können die Hausverwaltungen dieser Gebäude damit durchkommen. Es gibt ein wirklich günstiges Restaurant etwa fünf Minuten von meinem Zuhause entfernt, das Essen nur auf Papiertassen serviert und die meisten ihrer Gerichte im Mikrowellenherd erhitzen. Und gegenüber davon befindet sich eine Tankstelle, in der, wie ich gehört habe, nicht sehr gut gearbeitet wird. Dank einiger Gelder der Stadt wurde die Straße letzten Sommer neu asphaltiert, sodass es einen schönen, breiten Bürgersteig, viel Gras auf den Mittelstreifen und Seiten der Straßen gibt, und die Gegend ist jetzt etwas schöner geworden. Aber das Apartmentgebäude, in dem ich wohne, ist von Bäumen umgeben. Sie haben ein paar davon gefällt, es gibt also ein paar Stümpfe, aber wo ich wohne, sind viel mehr Bäume als weiter die Straße runter. Hinter meinem Wohnkomplex befindet sich eine Baumreihe und dann ein weiteres Apartmentgebäude. Ich wohne in der 42nd Street, aber direkt dahinter ist die 43rd Street und die ist nicht so schön. Die Bürgersteige sind wirklich schlecht und bröckeln, und die meisten Gebäude darauf sehen schäbig aus. Es gibt viele Bäume auf dieser Straße, aber das ist wahrscheinlich, um zu verbergen, wie die Gebäude aussehen. Der Großteil der Kriminalität in meiner Gegend ereignete sich in einem Apartmentkomplex auf dieser Straße, aber ich kann ihnen nicht die Schuld geben. Es gibt Apartments gegenüber meiner Wohnung, die auch viel Kriminalität und eine eher durchreisende Bevölkerung haben. Aber ich denke, ich mag, wo ich wohne. Ich kann es mir leisten, und es gibt in der Nähe viele nützliche Annehmlichkeiten. Besonders mag ich, dass die Universität zu Fuß erreichbar ist und es zwei Bushaltestellen gibt, mit denen ich leicht zum Laden und in die Innenstadt kommen kann.\n\n\n\n**[REWRITE]\nMy neighborhood is close to the college I attend, and for that, I really enjoy living there.

Sie sind unregelmäßig angeordnet und so weit voneinander entfernt, dass sie wie Einzelhäuser aussehen. Der einzige Unterschied ist, dass jedes Haus gelb gestrichen ist mit weißen Veranden und grünen Blechdächern. Fast jeder, aber nicht jeder, ist mit jedem anderen befreundet. Manchmal stehen wir am Ende einer nicht vorherbestimmten Einfahrt und plaudern, während die kleinen Kinder der Nachbarschaft mit ihren Spielsachen, Straßenkreide oder Seifenblasen spielen. Es ist sehr erfrischend in dieser modernen, alles zu mechanischen/computergefüllten Welt. Es ist eher wie ein Rückblick in die Vergangenheit. Wir sind von Feldern und Bäumen umgeben, die durch blaue Himmel und weiße, wollenden Wolken verschönert werden. Der einzige Nachteil? Diese Saison erleben wir Tornadoswarnungen und zum ersten Mal haben wir gestern Abend tatsächlich Sirenen gehört, also mussten wir uns in Sicherheit begeben. Sicher, Sie hätten mich in meiner Badewanne gefunden, die kleinste unter meinen Hunden, zusammen mit meiner Handtasche und ein paar Kissen. Mein großer Hund wollte nichts mit dem Badezimmer zu tun haben und blieb im Wohnzimmer, nervös und bellend, nervös über die ungewöhnlichen Umstände. Die Nachbarschaft war ruhig, außer dem Geräusch von großen Hagelkörnern, die auf dem Boden fielen. Nach dem Sturm dampfte die Straße buchstäblich wegen des Temperaturwechsels. Wir sind innerhalb weniger Minuten von 92 auf 75 Grad gesunken. Der Hagel schmolz sofort, als er auf den heißen Asphalt traf. Als ich zum Himmel hinaufblickte, kam die Sonne heraus und es begann zu regnen. Ein doppelter Regenbogen erschien. Ich rannte ins Haus und nahm meine Kamera. Schnappte schnell ein paar Bilder, um sie mit meinen Facebook-Freunden und Familie zu teilen. Sie waren wie ich beeindruckt. Die Straßen blieben noch eine Stunde ruhig, bevor einige Leute endlich von dort zurückkamen, wo sie waren, als der Gewittersturm hereinbrach. Dann war alles wie gewohnt, Mütter und Kinder draußen, während das Abendessen gekocht wurde. Eine so freundliche Nachbarschaft für dieses Mädchen, das neulich aus New Hampshire nach North Carolina gezogen ist. Ich liebe den südlichen Akzent, mit dem die Leute sprechen. Ich habe eine Wohnung mit zwei Schlafzimmern und zwei Bädern, genau wie jeder andere. Obwohl alle Häuser außen gleich aussehen, sind nicht alle Wohnungen innen gleich. Einige sind tatsächlich ziemlich klein. Es macht keinen Sinn für mich. Ich liebe es, entlang des größten Feldes hinter meinem Haus zu spazieren und zum Teich zu bummeln, der nicht zum Schwimmen gedacht ist. Ich habe Hirsche gesehen und morgens kann man den Gesang des riesigen Bullfrogs hören. Es ist ein fantastischer Ort zum Leben, nur vierzig Minuten außerhalb von Charlotte. Jeden Morgen wird man vom Glockenläuten von Hühnern aus den umliegenden Farmen begrüßt. Es ist eher wie das Leben in einem kleinen Dorfgemeinschaft. Wir haben sogar ein Esel auf einem nahegelegenen Bauernhof, dessen Brüllen wir abends hören, um uns zu signalisieren, dass er da ist.

    "original": "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants.

Sie hebt sich nicht von anderen in South Carolina ab, aber sie hat einen bedeutenden Einfluss auf den Agrarsektor. Johnston ist als die \"Peach Capital of the World\" bekannt, etwas, worüber die Stadt stolz auf dem Willkommensschild prahlt. Es besteht hauptsächlich aus Farmland, das von Pfirsichbäumen oder Vieh dominiert wird. Häuser, die sich nicht im Zentrum der Stadt befinden, sind weit auseinander gebaut; die meisten sind zweistöckig und haben entweder Metalldächer, um der sengenden Sommerhitze entgegenzuwirken, oder graue Schindeln. Meistens liegen diese Häuser nicht direkt an der Straße, sondern etwas weiter zurück, damit die vorderen Felder für Tiere/Kulturen genutzt werden können. Im Zentrum der Stadt befindet sich eine einzige Ampel an einer Kreuzung. Hier befinden sich die einzigen Geschäfte der gesamten Stadt. Es gibt drei Orte, an denen man \"Fast Food\" bekommen kann: Hong Kong, ein kleines chinesisches Restaurant, das von einer einzigen Familie betrieben wird, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant oder Gary's, eine kleine Burger-Kette. Es gab früher ein Pizzaria, das jedoch vor kurzem geschlossen hat. Es gibt eine sehr kleine, familiengeführte Apotheke namens Maxwell and Halford Drug; seltsamerweise sind sie bekannt für die Cherry Coca-Cola, die sie verkaufen. Es gibt einen kleinen, aber teuren Lebensmittelladen namens Independent Grocers Alliance, der allgemein als IGA bekannt ist. Obwohl es der einzige Lebensmittelladen in der ganzen Stadt ist, kaufen die meisten nur ein oder zwei Dinge dort und bevorzugen es, in Batesburg-Leesville in ein Walmart zu fahren, um den größten Teil ihrer Lebensmittel zu kaufen. Der beliebteste Laden in der ganzen Stadt ist Dollar General; dieser Laden verkauft eine große Auswahl an Alltagsgegenständen und ist oft von der Eröffnung bis zur Schließung sehr belebt! Es gibt einen sehr kleinen Möbelladen namens Possibilities Furniture & More, geführt von einer freundlichen Frau, die in der Gemeinde bekannt ist. Der Laden gibt es schon viele Jahre in Johnston und beschäftigt sogar zwei Umzugshelfer, die die gekauften Möbel liefern! An das Gebäude des Möbelladens angegliedert ist ein kleiner Tierfriseur namens Clark's Cuts and Kennels. Sie bieten eine Vielzahl von Dienstleistungen an, wie z. B. Tagesbetreuung, Pension, Fellpflege, Nägelfeilen, Baden usw. Sowohl eine Arztpraxis als auch eine Tierarztpraxis befinden sich außerhalb des Stadtzentrums; beide sind zwar klein, aber gut ausgestattet, um den Bewohnern von Johnston zu helfen. Es gibt eine einzige Grundschule namens Johnston Elementary School. Sobald die Schüler den fünften Grad abgeschlossen haben, müssen sie sowohl die Mittelschule als auch die High School in der nächsten Stadt besuchen. Es gibt technisch gesehen keine Parks in der Stadt, aber sie befinden sich gerade in der Planung eines 2,5 Hektar großen Erholungsgebiets, um Familien mehr Möglichkeiten für Ausflüge zu bieten und mehr Besucher/potenzielle Bewohner anzulocken. Zugegeben, es gibt nicht viel zu tun; es gibt keine Kinos, Bowlingbahnen, \"Treffpunkte\", Spielplätze für Kinder, Bereiche zum Gassigehen mit Haustieren oder eine große Auswahl an Restaurants. Trotzdem ist es eine schöne Stadt, so klein, dass man sie im Nu übersehen könnte!\n\n\n[REWRITE] My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it has a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something the town proudly boasts about on the welcome sign. It's primarily composed of farmland, dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not, these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back, allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. In the main part of town, there's a single stoplight that hangs at a four-way intersection. This is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places where you can get \"fast food\": Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small, family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it's often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing! [/REWRITE]\n\n\n\n\n",

Es war etwas überraschend. Fast jede Wohnung in der Gegend kostete über tausend Dollar im Monat. Ich hatte noch nie etwas davon gehört und auch nicht meine Freunde. Vielleicht ist es der Kampf. Ich kenne ein paar meiner Freunde, die sich nachts vor Schlafenszeit weinen. Die Dinge sind teuer, aber im Laufe der Jahre haben wir gelernt, sparsam zu sein. Man beginnt, den staubigen Geruch von Flohmarkt-Spielzeug und mottengefärbten Kleidern zu mögen. Man riecht im Erwachsenenalter viel weniger. Man beginnt vielleicht zu rauchen, oder man ist einfach zu sehr an den Zustand der Dinge gewöhnt. Aber der Flohmarkt behauptet sich immer wieder. Der Geruch von Erwachsensein sind staubige Zeitschriften, die auf einem geschlossenen Klavier gestapelt sind. Er drängt sich in das Leder und bleibt auch nach dem Waschen drin. Hier gibt es drei Second-Hand-Läden in Gehweite. Wenn man an der weitesten Seite anfängt, kann man zwei wohltätige Second-Hand-Läden, eine Bibliothek, einen Antiquariat und einen Curio-Shop besuchen. Die Innenstadt ist dicht besiedelt, Autos und Menschen füllen jeden Morgen die Straßen, aber man würde es in den Second-Hand-Läden nicht hören. Egal, wie viele Menschen oder Autos vorbeifahren, der Laden ist still. Es ist ein schöner Ort, um einen Nachmittag zu verlieren. Jedes Jahr gibt es mehr davon. Autos und Menschen überschwemmen es. Es ist eine Stadt in Entwicklung, sagen sie. Mit dem Hauptsitz eines der größten Online-Imperien für E-Commerce und Lieferungen zeigt es immer noch Wachstumsschmerzen. Es erinnert mich an New York. Jeder und alles hat seine eigenen Ziele, und nicht viele Menschen haben von dir etwas. Du kannst allein, ruhig und unabhängig sein, und die Leute lassen dich in Ruhe. Es ist nicht wie im Süden, wo man, wenn man ein bisschen besorgt ist, mitfühlend ist. Hier pryt man nicht in das Leben der anderen ein. Du kannst so lange deine Hülle aufrechterhalten, wie du möchtest, und die Stadt wird wie Wellen am Strand zurückrollen. Es ist ein lebendiger Ort, um zu sein. Zwischen dem Pianisten nebenan und den zwei Amateur-SängerinnenUpstairs gibt es immer etwas los. In gewisser Weise haben wir weniger eine Wohnung voller Fremder und mehr eine Gemeinschaft von Freunden. Wir kommen zusammen, um unseren Bedürfnissen nachzukommen, Geburtstage zu feiern, Beerdigungen zu trauern und uns gegenseitig zu helfen, wenn wir können. In gewisser Weise bin ich glücklich hier. Ich mag die meisten meiner Nachbarn und sie behandeln mich ziemlich gut. Ich versuche, darauf zu achten, dass ich nach mir aufräume und ihnen Essen hinterlasse, und sie tun dasselbe. Ich bringe ihnen Post und sie mir. Es ist schön, sie zu sehen, und ich glaube, sie genießen meine Gegenwart so sehr wie ich die ihre. Ich wohne in einem riesigen, entmenschlichen modernen Sprawl, aber es sind Menschen wie meine Nachbarn, die mir das Gefühl geben, dass ich mein Leben nicht ganz ruiniert habe.\n\n\n**[REWRITE]\nThe first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing.

Für meine Nachbarschaft ist die Präsenz eines Hausbesitzerverbands sehr auffällig. Wenn Sie einfahren, sehen Sie nichts anderes als gepflegte Einfamilienhäuser, für die wir den Hausbesitzerverband danken können. Die Vorgärten sind alle sehr ähnlich. Es gibt ein kleines Stück bepflanzte Wiese, ein paar dekorative Kieselsteine und relativ kurze Einfahrten. Manchmal sieht man auch kleine Bäume. Jeder hat eine Garage für zwei Autos. Wenn Sie weiter durch die Nachbarschaft fahren, sehen Sie neu gepflasterte Betonstraßen. Obwohl hier viele verschiedene Familien leben, sind die Straßen in einem hervorragenden Zustand. Hier finden Sie keine Schlaglöcher oder Ähnliches. Die meisten Häuser sind einstöckig, aber manchmal sieht man auch zweistöckige Häuser. Wir haben keine typische Briefkastenaufstellung, die man für Einfamilienhäuser erwarten würde. Es gibt keine einzelnen Briefkästen vor jedem Haus. Stattdessen ist es eher wie in einer Wohnung, wo sich an einem Ende der Straße mehrere große Briefkästen befinden. Jeder benutzt einen Schlüssel, um Zugang zu seinem spezifischen Briefkasten zu erhalten. Und es gibt zwei größere Schränke für Pakete. Wieder einmal können Sie den Hausbesitzerverband und seine Obsession mit der Einheitlichkeit für das danken. Die Lage meines Hauses liegt am äußersten Rand der nahe gelegenen Stadt, sodass meine Nachbarschaft als teils ländlich, teils städtisch bezeichnet werden kann. Als Folge davon haben wir viel Land für, nun ja, alles. Es gibt mehrere Gemeinschaftspools, die jeder hier nutzen kann. Es ist gepflegt und mit einem Zaun versehen. Und dann gibt es verschiedene Spazierwege, auf denen Sie Ihren Hund ausführen oder einfach einen Abendspaziergang alleine machen können. Sie müssen nicht in einen Park gehen, um Sport zu treiben. Die Nachbarschaft ist groß genug, dass Sie einfach umherlaufen und mehr als genug Bewegung bekommen können. Der größte Teil der Gemeinde besteht aus Rentnern. Es ist ein sehr sicheres Gebiet, und jeder sieht nach dem anderen. Dazwischen haben wir auch eine kleine Anzahl von mittelalten und jungen Fach- und Führungskräften. In Bezug auf die Stadt ist sie überraschend groß - zumindest was die Einwohnerzahl angeht - aber hat gleichzeitig auch das Flair einer kleinen Stadt. Wir haben die meisten Annehmlichkeiten, auf die Sie angewiesen sind. Zum Beispiel haben wir genau einen Einkaufscenter. Es ist nicht riesig, aber es erfüllt seinen Zweck. Für mich dauert es ungefähr 15 Minuten mit dem Auto, um irgendwohin zu gelangen, aber sobald ich das getan habe, werde ich mit vielen verschiedenen Geschäften begrüßt. Wir haben alles, von hochwertigen Supermärkten, in denen man Bio-Lebensmittel kaufen kann, bis hin zu Discount-Filialen, die nur eine kleine Auswahl an Artikeln führen und ein minimum an Personal haben, um die Kosten niedrig zu halten. Alles in allem ist meine Nachbarschaft sicher, gepflegt und ziemlich typisch. Wir haben viele schöne Dinge, wie Pools und Spazierwege. Und obwohl wir nicht direkt neben einem Einkaufzentrum wohnen, können Sie einfach in ein Auto steigen und zu jeder beliebigen Filiale einer großen Kette fahren.\n\n\n[REWRITE]\nThe general area where I live can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia.

    "original": "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",

    "raw_output": "Ich wohne in einer kleinen Stadt im Mittleren Westen, die sich direkt außerhalb der Vororte einer Großstadt befindet. Meine unmittelbare Nachbarschaft, auf der Ostseite der Stadt, könnte als das am wirtschaftlichsten benachteiligte Gebiet der Stadt beschrieben werden. Die Immobilienwerte sind niedrig, wobei die meisten Häuser an Personen mit niedrigem Einkommen vermietet oder von diesen besessen werden. Es ist jedoch nicht unattraktiv oder unangenehm. Meine Nachbarn sind im Allgemeinen freundliche Menschen, die lächeln und Hallo sagen, wenn ich die Straße entlanggehe. Die Kriminalitätsraten sind zwar etwas höher als in anderen Teilen der Stadt, liegen aber im Allgemeinen niedrig. In den letzten zehn Jahren gab es innerhalb weniger Blocks von meinem Zuhause ein paar gewaltsame Verbrechen, einschließlich ein paar Schüssen und mindestens einen Mord. Unsere Nachbarn nebenan verloren letztes Jahr ihren Sohn in einer Schlägerei vor einer Bar in der Gegend. Glücklicherweise wurde unsere Familie von Verbrechen nicht direkt betroffen, außer dass ab und zu ein Gegenstand von unserem Veranda verschwindet, wenn wir vergessen, ihn hereinzunehmen. Insgesamt hat die Stadt, in der ich wohne, stark von der Opioidepidemie betroffen, die viele Teile der Vereinigten Staaten betrifft. Viele Menschen sind an Fetanyl-Überdosen gestorben. Glücklicherweise gibt es in meiner Stadt viele Ressourcen, um dieser Epidemie zu begegnen, darunter mehrere Entgiftungszentren und Narcan-Schulungen für Familien und Freunde von Suchtbetroffenen. Trotz dieser Herausforderungen hat diese Stadt viele positive Eigenschaften. Die Grundschule meines Sohnes hat ein exzellentes Personal, vom Schulleiter über die Lehrer bis hin zum Betreuungspersonal. Obwohl er besondere Bedürfnisse hat, wurde er aufgrund der unglaublich positiven Atmosphäre der Schule bisher nicht gemobbt, und er liebt es dort. Wir haben einen aktiven Elternausschuss, der das ganze Jahr über mehrere Veranstaltungen plant, um die familiäre Beteiligung und den Bildungserfolg zu fördern. Da über 20 % der Bevölkerung unserer Stadt unterhalb der Armutsgrenze leben, bietet die Grundschule allen Schülern kostenlose Frühstück und Mittagessen an, damit kein Kind hungrig zur Schule gehen muss. Keine Schülerin oder kein Schüler und keine Familie wird aufgrund der Unfähigkeit, zu bezahlen, als „weniger“ behandelt. Die Gebühren für Schulgebühren, Materialien und Schulausflüge sind sehr erschwinglich. Der Stadtvorstand und das Personal haben viele Verbesserungen an dem Erscheinungsbild unserer Stadt vorgenommen, darunter die Wiederherstellung von Straßen, die Landesgestaltung und die Renovierung von Stadtparks. Leider haben die meisten dieser Verbesserungen im Zentrum der Stadt und auf der Westseite stattgefunden, wo sich die Einkaufsgebiete befinden und der größte Teil des Verkehrs fließt. Die Ostseite, wo ich wohne, wird eher vernachlässigt, was für die Menschen in meiner Nachbarschaft ein Streitpunkt ist. Insgesamt genieße ich es, in dieser Stadt zu leben. Die Leute sind im Allgemeinen freundlich, die Schulen sind großartig, es gibt genügend Einkaufsmöglichkeiten (sowohl kleine Geschäfte als auch größere Einzelhandelsgeschäfte), um den Bedürfnissen meiner Familie gerecht zu werden, und unser Haus ist vielleicht nicht viel Wert, aber es ist komfortabel und ausreichend. Unsere Familie lebt hier seit über 16 Jahren und wir können uns nicht vorstellen, irgendwo anders zu leben. \n\n[REWRITE]\nI live in a small town in the Midwest, just outside the suburbs of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it's not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside.

I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",

Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day.

Hier geht man von Farmland zu kleinen Touristenstädten über. Es gibt keine großen Einkaufszentren, keine Walmart, Target oder sogar ein Applebee's. Wenn man irgendwohin möchte, muss man Auto fahren. Trotzdem lebe ich an einem der schönsten Orte der Welt, umgeben von Wasser. Meine \"Stadt\" ist von Wasser umgeben. Der wunderschöne Lake Michigan liegt auf einer Seite und der Lake Charlevoix auf der anderen. Überall, wohin man kommt, findet man einen Strand, an dem man die Zehen ins Wasser stecken kann. Meine Nachbarschaft spiegelt die Vorstellung von einem kleinen Städtchen wider. Die Häuser sind nicht übereinandergestapelt. Sie sind keine \"Hausbaukasten\"-Häuser, die alle gleich sind. Es sind ältere Häuser, einige davon werden renoviert und umgebaut, andere sind älter. Die meisten Häuser haben Keller. Vollständige Keller, die man von der Straße aus sehen kann. Viele Häuser in der Nachbarschaft haben ältere Aluminiumfassaden. Wir haben Häuser in allen Farben, die man sich vorstellen kann, in den Blöcken, die meinen Haus umgeben. Die meisten Häuser haben Gärten. Gärten mit Trampolinen und Spielplätzen. Einige haben Gärten und Zäune für ihre Tiere. Die Häuser erinnern an das Mittlere Amerika. Fleißige Menschen, die arbeiten, um ihren Lebensunterhalt zu verdienen, und entweder Familien gründen oder aufgezogen haben. An einem jeden Tag sieht man Kinder, die die Straßen hinauf und hinunter rennen. Man sieht auch Leute, die Hunde ausführen, Fahrrad fahren und Rollerblades fahren. Die Nachbarn kennen sich und man kann erkennen, wer dazugehört und wer nicht dazugehört. Man sieht jemanden grillen und winkt, oder selbst jemanden, der seinen Hund ein paar Straßenblocks entfernt spazieren führt und freundlich lächelt. Die Rasenflächen sind in gutem Zustand gehalten. Niemand hat Blätter vom Herbstzeitraum zusammengesammelt. Der grüne Rasen wird gemäht und unter Kontrolle gehalten. Wenn Leute Pflanzen und Sträucher in ihren Gärten haben, werden sie zurückgeschnitten. Es ist keine schöne Gegend, in die man fährt und denkt: Wow, schau dir die schönen Häuser an, sondern eine, in die man fährt und denkt: Hier wäre ein guter Ort, um eine Familie aufzuziehen. Es ist ruhig, friedlich und sicher. Obwohl es nur durchschnittlich aussieht, ist es außergewöhnlich, weil es das darstellt, was die Menschen sich wünschen, nämlich einen sicheren Ort zum Ankommen am Ende des Tages. In Gehweite befindet sich die Kreispolizei und das Gefängnis. Das Gesundheitsamt befindet sich direkt daneben.

Wir haben in der Nähe Baseball- und Softballfelder, auf denen man die Kommentatoren beim Punktefeststellen und Nennen der Spielernamen hören kann. Unser kleines Stadtflughafen liegt daneben. Man kann draußen oder drinnen spielen und hört das Dröhnen von kleinen Flugzeugen beim Start und Landen. Man kann spazieren gehen, um Eis aus dem örtlichen Eisladen zu holen, und wenn man ganz dran ist, kann man es aus unserer Wohngegend in die Innenstadt schaffen.

You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it, you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.",
