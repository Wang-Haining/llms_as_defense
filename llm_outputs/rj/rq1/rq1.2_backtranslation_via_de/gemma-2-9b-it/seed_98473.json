Wohngebiete sind scheinbar zufällig zwischen Gewerbegebieten verteilt, in denen eine Vielzahl von Unternehmen betrieben werden. Einige dieser Unternehmen bestehen aus Büros, während andere verschiedene Geschäfte, Restaurants und Unterhaltungsmöglichkeiten beherbergen. Es gibt keinen Mangel an neuen Restaurants zum Essen oder Geschäften zum Einkaufen. Während einige Geschäfte große, bekannte Marken sind, die von großen Unternehmen gehören, gewinnen auch kleine Boutiquen zunehmend an Popularität. Sie befinden sich nicht nur in verschiedenen Einkaufszentren, sondern säumen auch die Straßen, die oft zu Fuß erreichbar sind von Wohngebieten, die sonst ruhig und friedlich wären, wenn sie nicht von so vielen Sehenswürdigkeiten umgeben wären. Es gibt auch ein paar nahe gelegene Parks, und ich habe bemerkt, dass die Leute diese Parks mit ihren kleinen Kindern besuchen. Apropos Leute, es gibt tatsächlich eine große Vielfalt in meiner Nachbarschaft. An einem kleinen Ort haben wir eine prominente LGBTQ+ -Gemeinschaft, eine orthodox-jüdische Gemeinschaft und eine Sammlung von Flüchtlingen und Einwanderern aus der ehemaligen Sowjetunion. Etwas außerhalb meiner Nachbarschaft gibt es viele mehr Menschen verschiedener Rassen und Herkunft, obwohl sie manchmal in ihre eigenen kleinen Gemeinschaften innerhalb der Stadt aufgeteilt sind. Wir haben Orte, die als Korea-Stadt, China-Stadt, Little Armenia und viele mehr bekannt sind, die nur wenige Meilen entfernt sind. Einige Meilen können jedoch eine sehr lange Fahrt sein. Eine Strecke von nur 10 Meilen kann manchmal zwei Stunden dauern, wegen des Verkehrs, besonders zur Stoßzeit. Kaum jemand in meiner Stadt geht irgendwohin, obwohl bestimmte Sehenswürdigkeiten unweigerlich in der Nähe sind, ist die Stadt riesig und die Menschen bevorzugen es im Allgemeinen nicht, zu Fuß zu pendeln. Als Folge davon haben wir auch einen der schlimmsten Verkehrsstaus der Welt, und es ist fast überall schwierig, Parkplätze zu finden. Ironischerweise wurde in den letzten Jahren viel gebaut, da große Apartmentgebäude in die Stadt kommen. Es scheint ein beliebtes Reiseziel zu sein, aber viele Einwohner sind enttäuscht von der Aussicht auf noch mehr Menschen, die einziehen, und noch mehr Fahrzeuge auf den Straßen. Es gibt in meiner Stadt viele verschiedene Arten von Häusern. Nicht jeder lebt oder möchte in einem großen Mehrfamilienhaus leben. Wohngebiete bestehen aus Häusern verschiedener Größen und kleineren Apartmentgebäuden und Eigentumswohnungen. Einige Immobilien enthalten Einfamilienhäuser, während andere Doppelhäuser enthalten. Das gilt auch in meiner unmittelbaren Nachbarschaft, daher gibt es auch keinen Mangel an Vielfalt bei den Wohnmöglichkeiten. Ebenso besteht die Nachbarschaft aus Menschen unterschiedlichen Alters, und um ehrlich zu sein, kenne ich die meisten meiner Nachbarn nicht. Es ist heutzutage keine enge Gemeinschaft mehr, obwohl ich viele Erinnerungen aus meiner Kindheit habe, in denen ich mit meinem Nachbarn und ein paar anderen Freunden aus der Nachbarschaft gespielt habe, die alle ungefähr mein Alter hatten.\n\n\n\n[REWRITE]\nSince I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse.

The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood.

There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request.

Mein Haus hat einen kleinen Garten vor dem Haus und eine kleine Einfahrt links vom Haus. Es erinnert, wie die meisten anderen auch, an eine Zeit nicht allzu lange her, in der das Wohnen in den Vororten der amerikanische Traum war. Dieser Traum schien die Menschen dieses Landes einst zu umarmen, aber jetzt zieht er sich zurück. Aber meine Nachbarschaft und viele mehr bleiben noch immer bestehen, rufen uns und denen, die uns besuchen, noch immer zu, dass der Traum noch lebt und wir ihn so gut es geht noch immer festhalten. Die Menschen fühlen sich nicht mehr so optimistisch wie früher, die Pflege der kleinen Gärten ist nicht mehr das, was sie einmal waren, aber es steht immer noch ein Auto oder zwei in jeder Einfahrt, und die Jugend spielt immer noch so, als wäre die Welt um sie herum das Ganze ihres Daseins. Die öffentliche Schule, die hier seit fast 90 Jahren steht, steht immer noch und scheint in der Jugend von heute eine Zukunft zu wecken, während sie bei den älteren Bewohnern Nostalgie hervorruft. Die Kirchen sind weit auseinander und größtenteils leer, aber die Basketballplätze sind immer noch voll. Alle Häuser sehen anders aus, fühlen sich aber gleich an. Es gibt einen großen Supermarkt namens Super \"A\", der von einer großen jemenitischen Familie betrieben wird, die wahrscheinlich die einzige arabische Familie in der Nachbarschaft ist. Der Großteil der Bewohner ist afroamerikanisch. Die Straßen sind breit und die Kinder spielen normalerweise Fußball, hören nur auf, um den Autos Platz zu machen. Die meisten Leute in meiner Nachbarschaft sind schon seit Generationen hier und können Geschichten von einer Zeit erzählen, in der sich alle kannten. Es gab eine Karateschule, aber als Hollywood damit aufhörte, Karate-Kid-Filme zu produzieren, wollten die Kinder nicht mehr Karate-Kid sein, also ist es jetzt eine Apotheke, weil Drogen alles besser machen, oder so habe ich gehört. Es gibt auch ein kleines Kino, das alte Filme zu ermäßigten Preisen zeigt. Es wird von der Jugend ignoriert, weil es keine aktuellen Filme hat, aber von den Älteren geschätzt, die es für einen kleinen Preis für einen Ausflug halten, natürlich ohne Kinder. Es gibt eine einzige Schnellstraße, die durch meine Stadt führt. Obwohl Ein- und Ausfahrt in der Nachbarstadt sind. Es gab einst eine Petition, um eine Ausfahrt für unsere Stadt zu bekommen. Die Jugend unterstützte es, während die Älteren sich dagegen aussprachen. Es scheint, dass die Schnellstraße in unserer Stadt alles ruinieren würde, sagten die Älteren, die schließlich den Stadtrat davon überzeugten, den Antrag abzulehnen. Sie bauen eine neue Highschool und wir versuchen gerade, ein Maskottchen für unsere Stadt zu finden.

Zumindest nicht an einem Ort, den die meisten Leute bewohnen möchten. Aber wenn man hinter dem alten, verlassenen Whole Foods geht und hinter den Hotels zurückgeht, die außerhalb der Sommermonate nur für Familientreffen sporadisch bewohnt werden, findet man eine ganze lebendige Gemeinde. In diesen Gemeinschaften, auf diesen Straßen, befinden sich einige Wohnanlagen - nebeneinander angeordnet wie russische Matrjoschka-Puppen, die akribisch und sorgfältig auseinandergenommen und in einer Linie entlang der Straße aufgestellt wurden. Die ersten Wohnungen, die man findet, waren in den Nachrichten für einige nicht gerade ehrenwerte Geschäfte in den Schlagzeilen, daher konzentrieren wir uns nicht zu sehr darauf - denn das Äußere kann schließlich täuschen. Aber die Wohnungen neben diesem Komplex und die zwei Komplexen neben dem sind eine ganz andere Welt, von fast niemanden, der in diesem Gebiet wohnt, bekannt. Gegenüber von diesen Komplexen befindet sich der Satellitencampus eines Community Colleges - ein ruhiger, verschlafener Gebäudekomplex, der wie ein Wachmann an der Straße steht, wo Studenten mit Kaffee in der Hand eintreten, um um 7 Uhr morgens mit müden Augen ihren Tag zu beginnen. Die eisernen Tore knarren auf und lassen sie einzeln hereinkommen, während Pendler aus ihren Fenstern die Fäuste schütteln und sich über sie beschweren, weil sie den Verkehr an Tagen mit höherer Präsenz behindern. Die Straße mündet in eine weitere Wohnstraße, auf der sich auf einer Seite ein Park und auf der anderen Seite ein Rehabilitationszentrum für Menschen mit Knochenbrüchen unter unglücklichen Umständen befindet. Das Behandlungszentrum verfügt über fröhliche Veranda-Möbel und einen träge schwingenden Deckenventilator, der die warme, dichte Sommerluft hin und her bewegt. Kinder rennen im Park über das Gras hin und her, schlagen Handstände und machen Radkreisen über die stacheligen grünen Stängel, während Bienen faul in den Blumenbeeten an der Straße herumdrehen. Alte Rentner führen ihre Hunde auf dem Gehweg aus, motzen den Teenagern auf ihren Skateboards aus und nickt bescheiden den Teenagerinnen zu, die sich in der Nähe des Spielplatzequipment versammelt haben und über Jungen und die neuesten YouTube-Sensationen plaudern. Am Rande des Parks gibt es ein Sushi-Restaurant in einem Einkaufszentrum, das preiswertes Essen anbietet, aber nie zu voll erscheint - direkt daneben ein Schwimminnenfachgeschäft und ein Nagelsalon, der sich dazwischen versteckt. Man könnte seine Pool für die Saison füllen, während man sich eine Maniküre macht und Hibachi-Hähnchen isst, alles auf einmal - die Schönheit eines Einkaufszentrums.

She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",

Sie stammte aus einer Stadt, in der es nur 5 Minuten zu Fuß zum Supermarkt war – sie hatte in ihrem Leben noch nie so viel offene Fläche gesehen.  Ergriffen von der Allgegenwärtigkeit der Maisfelder, erzählte ich ihr, wie es war, in ländlichem Ohio aufzuwachsen, und in diesem Moment wusste sie endlich, wer ich war und woher ich kam. Auf einer zwei Fahrstreifenstraße fahren Sie zu einem Steinbruch, der mit Wasser gefüllt ist. Direkt daran vorbei liegt die kleine Siedlung, in der ich wohne. Die Häuser sind größtenteils aus Ziegel und Stuck gebaut. Jedes Haus hat mindestens ein halbes Acre Land, das jeder mit Stolz pflegt. Während der Frühling, sind jährlich gepflanzte Blumen reichlich vorhanden, zusammen mit den Bäumen des Mittleren Westens, die sich in jeder Jahreszeit verändern. Die Auffahrten sind alle mit den luxuriösen Mercedes Benz Luxusautos der höchsten Klasse gefüllt, die in der Mittagsonne nach einer guten alten, traditionell gereinigten Wäsche glänzen. Weiter auf der Straße zu meinem grauen Steinhaus fahrend, ist mein koreanischer Nachbar immer draußen mit einem freundlichen Gesicht. Er verbringt den ganzen Tag damit, seinen Rasen zu mähen und kann über das Summen seines Motors singen gehört werden. Jeder in der Nachbarschaft lacht über ihn, aber er ist immer echt und eine erstaunliche Person mit einer einzigartigen Geschichte. Er ist älter geworden und hat mit zunehmendem Alter etwas von seinem Witz verloren. In seiner Vergangenheit war er Arzt und mischt sich normalerweise mit dem Gras und seinem John Deer Zero Turn Rasenmäher. Endlich erreichen Sie mein Haus. Auf dem Seitengarten sind Enten reichlich vorhanden und werden von unserem Terrier verfolgt. Hinter dem Haus fließt ein kleiner Bach in den Steinbruch. Hier kann man Bullfrösche, den Bach und das gelegentliche „Mäh“ von den nahegelegenen Bauernhöfen hören. Über die handgemachte Holzhängebrücke liegt eine unberührte Oase, gefüllt mit natürlich wachsenden Bäumen, Kräutern und Wildblumen. Hier verbrachte ich den größten Teil meiner Kindheit. Von der Errichtung von Baumhöhlen bis zum „Jagen“ von Tieren (was hauptsächlich aus dem Jagen bestand), gab es immer etwas zu tun und in der Regel ein Kind aus der Nachbarschaft, das zum Spielen bereit war. Die Winter in meiner kleinen Stadt können schmerzhaft brutal sein, aber nichts ist schöner. Der Garten verwandelt sich von einem grünen Meer in eine leere Wildnis. Die Bäume, die einst rosa, lila und orangefarbene Blumen beherbergten, werden zu kahlen Skeletten aus Rinde. Wenn es gelegentlich schneit, erscheint über Nacht ein Winterwunderland. Der Hinterhof ist gesäumt von Schneemännern und Schneemännern, die von meiner kleinen Schwester gemacht wurden. Meine Schwester und ich haben uns in unserer Kindheit oft gestritten, und im Winter waren Schneebälle unsere Waffe der Wahl. Wir bauten massive igluartige Festungen, um unsere Waffen zu verwahren, normalerweise mit Ästen, wie ein Arsenal. In unserem eigenen kleinen Wunderland spielten wir Verstecken in einer Zeit, in der nichts anderes wichtig war. Wir waren nur junge Kinder ohne Sorgen auf der Welt.\n\n[REWRITE] Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the cornfields that stretched out to the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be shocked by the vast emptiness of the landscape.

    "raw_output": "## German Translation:\n\nDas erste, was du über Portland, Oregon, verstehen musst, ist die Definition von „weird“. Das inoffizielle Stadtmotto, auf einer Gebäudewand, die gleichzeitig als Pizzaliege, Bar, Musikklub, Stripclub dient und auf mindestens der Hälfte dieser Unternehmungen mit dem Gesetz flirtet, lautet: „Keep Portland Weird“. Für manche ist es ein kleiner Ruf, sich an das Portland der 90er und frühen 2000er Jahre zu erinnern, ein Portland, das weniger bekannt und weniger teuer war und kreative und einzigartige Subkulturen hervorbrachte. Für andere ist es ein Aufruf – kommt nach Portland, wo die Leute dich immer noch als komisch bezeichnen, aber diesmal als Kompliment. Trotz des Zustroms wohlhabender Kalifornier und des ständigen Baus von Eigentumswohnungen für diese Kalifornier ist Portland immer noch weird. Weird bedeutet nicht unbedingt Akzeptanz, aber es bedeutet die Akzeptanz von Dingen, die normalerweise nicht akzeptiert werden. Weird bedeutet nicht, dass wir keine modernen Annehmlichkeiten und moderne Kämpfe haben. Wie der Rest des Landes kaufen wir den größten Teil unserer Sachen aus China. Es gibt eine Million Möglichkeiten, weird zu sein, nicht normal zu sein, aber Portland hat auch viel Normales. Portland hat Yoga, Hipster und Geschäftsleute. Vielleicht bedeutet weird, dass wir all das einfach weniger ernst nehmen. In meiner Nachbarschaft, wie in vielen Portlander Nachbarschaften, haben wir farbenfrohe Häuser, Hausgärten mit Blumen, Kräutern und Gemüse an den Straßen und kostenlose Kartons im Sommer. Freie Kartons sind traditionell Pappkartons, die Gegenstände enthalten, die jemand loswerden will, aber sie können auch Plastiktüten oder Kartons sein. Sie enthalten etwas Magisches, ein Schatz, der gerade perfekt für den Vorbeiziehenden ist, und überraschend oft. Freie Kartons enthalten oft Kleidung und Bücher, aber sie können alles enthalten. Das magische Potenzial, durch ein Viertel im Südosten von Portland zu spazieren, ist das, worum es in Portland geht. Das ist zumindest das, worum es in Portland für mich geht, aber ich bin nur eine Varietät von weird unter Tausenden. Manche Menschen, die ich unterhalte, würden nie träumen, ihre Kleidung aus einem Karton am Bürgersteig zu nehmen. Diese Leute machen Goat Yoga (ja, Yoga mit echten Ziegen) oder Timbers-Spiele (das Fußballteam der Stadt). Portland ist voll von Menschen, die alle möglichen Dinge lieben. Portland ist voller Menschen, die unsere Träume verfolgen oder von dem Träumen, unsere Träume zu verfolgen, während wir zu viel Zeit in der Bar verbringen. Ja, Portland hat ein Drogenproblem. Drogenprobleme haben in der Regel (an ihrer Wurzel) psychische Probleme, und der konstante Regen über einen Großteil des Jahres sowie die düsteren Wolken scheinen einen Beitrag zu leisten. Portland hat auch ein Obdachlosenproblem, mit dem niemand etwas zu tun zu wissen scheint. Die Obdachlosen werden von den Sozialleistungen angezogen, die Portland bietet, die in den meisten Teilen des Landes besser sind, aber unsere Leistungen sind unzureichend, wie in allen Teilen des Landes. Die nicht-obdachlose Bevölkerung schwankt zwischen Fürsorge und Hass. Darin sind wir überhaupt nicht weird.\n\n\n\n[REWRITE]\nThe first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon, is the definition of \"weird\".

Egal wie sehr ich sie vergesse oder wie sehr ich mit Arbeit und Leben beschäftigt bin, um sie zu bemerken, sie sind da, standhaft, unbeeindruckt und unbeeinflusst von den Schwierigkeiten des Lebens. Dann an Tagen, an denen ich am meisten gestresst und aufgewühlt bin, fordern sie, gesehen zu werden, und wenn ich mich ihnen zuwende, lassen sie mich meine ängstliche Seele zur Ruhe kommen und leihen mir etwas Kraft, um weiterzumachen, einen Tag nach dem anderen. Ich bin hierhergezogen, als ich mein Studium begann, und die Berge im Norden des Campus, die mich zuerst fesselten. Sicher, die Universität hat auch ihre eigenen atemberaubenden Sehenswürdigkeiten in Gebäuden, Seen und Bäumen, die ihren eigenen Platz in meinem Herzen haben, aber es sind die Berge, die wirklich den Thron besetzen. Der Rest der Stadt ist auf seine Weise wunderschön. Es gibt unzählige Cafés, in denen ich viele Stunden mit Koffein getriebenem Lernen verbrachte. Man kann zu Fuß oder mit dem Bus nur ein wenig weiter zum Stadtzentrum gehen und sich von einer Aura der Antike umgeben lassen, die von den verblassten bunten Backsteinen geprägt ist, die Restaurants und Bürogebäude säumen. Hier zeigt sich diese scheinbar vorstädtische Stadt so viel Trubel und Lebendigkeit wie ihre benachbarte Großstadt. Dieses Bild hält aber nicht lange an, denn man kann, nachdem man an der Bibliothek vorbeigegangen ist, erneut in die ruhige Kleinstadt entfliehen. Diese Dichotomie der Atmosphären in solcher Nähe verleiht dieser Stadt wirklich eine wunderbare Atmosphäre, als würde sie darauf warten, entdeckt zu werden. So ist es leicht, viele geliebte Erinnerungen zu schaffen, jede in Verbindung mit einem bestimmten Teil der Stadt. Ob es das Vorbeigehen an den rostigen Schaukeln im Park mit Freunden nach einer ganzen Nacht oder das Rennen durch das belebte Stadtzentrum, um den Film im schicken Kino zu sehen, für das die Universität Tickets beschafft hat. Leider ist es auch die Heimat vieler harter Erinnerungen, denn wie alle Orte im Leben sind auch diese anfällig für Schwierigkeiten. Die Seen, insbesondere, können ein ziemlich passabler Ort für die Reflexion sein, sowie für Schluchzanfälle um zwei Uhr nachts mitten in einer existenziellen Krise. Letzteres habe ich mehr Erfahrung mit. Während ich zusah, wie die Schildkröten, Enten und Insekten ihr Leben auslebten, jede mit einem Beitrag oder einer Rolle, konnte ich mich nichtempêcher, an meinen eigenen Sinn des Zwecks zu denken, als ich versuchte, dieses Rätsel namens Leben zu navigieren. Also ging ich am See vorbei, am Park und den kleinen Häusern, die nach Vorstadtluft schreien, bis ich eine Hauptstraße erreichte. Da schien die Sonne ihre strahlenden Strahlen auf die Palmen und malte den Himmel entlang des Weges, und als ich zum Sonnenaufgang aufblickte, erkannte ich, dass ich nach Norden ging. Sicher genug, sie waren da, wie immer. Die robusten, gewaltigen Berge streiften den verschwommenen blau-gelben Himmel mehr als jedes Gebäude am Horizont, und als würden sie ohne Worte sprechen, weckten sie in mir mein Gefühl der Ausdauer.\n\n\n## English Translation:\n\n\n[REWRITE]The mountains are always there.

It was then that the sun shone its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy, imposing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building on the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.",

Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket.

Die öffentlichen Verkehrsmittel sind sehr gut erreichbar und eine der beliebtesten Verkehrsmittel in New York City. Bensonhurst ist ein ziemlich städtisches Viertel, daher werden Sie sich immer noch wie in New York City fühlen. Bereiten Sie sich während Ihres Besuchs auf den Anblick der zahlreichen asiatischen Geschäfte in der Umgebung vor. In den letzten zwei Jahrzehnten hat Bensonhurst einen Zustrom asiatischer Einwohner erfahren. Deshalb werden Sie bei Ihrem Spaziergang mindestens jedes Block ein asiatisches Geschäft sehen. Am beliebtesten sind Supermärkte und Waschsalons. Zufällig sind diese Geschäfte auch bei den lokalen Bewohnern sehr beliebt, da die Lebensmittelqualität in den Supermärkten hervorragend ist, die Preise viel günstiger und schließlich und vor allem sehr praktisch. Ganz in meiner Nähe gibt es vier asiatische Supermärkte, die jeweils zwei Gehminuten voneinander entfernt sind. Das trägt zusätzlich zur Praktikabilität bei, wenn es darum geht, Lebensmittel zu besorgen. Ich sage nicht, dass Bensonhurst ausschließlich von asiatischen Bewohnern bevölkert ist. Es ist ziemlich vielseitig, mit Einwanderern und ihren Kindern der ersten und zweiten Generation. Die meisten großen und beliebten Geschäfte in der Gegend werden von Asiaten betrieben. Zusätzlich zu diesen von asiatischen Unternehmen geführten Geschäften gibt es auch einen kürzlich renovierten Park in der Nähe, der etwa zehn Basketballplätze, ein großes Feld für Fußball oder Baseball, vier Handballarena, Schaukeln, einen Spielplatz für Kinder und sogar einen Wasserspielplatz für Kinder im Sommer hat. Da wir in New York City sind, sind die Parks natürlich sehr vielfältig. Hier werden Sie alle Arten von Menschen sehen, die zusammen spielen und miteinander auskommen. In diesem Viertel gibt es nicht viele große Firmengebäude. Die einzigen Gebäude, die Sie finden würden, sind Gebäude für Genossenschaftswohnungen oder Eigentumswohnungen. Die Mehrheit der Wohnräume hier sind jedoch Doppelhäuser. Die meisten Menschen sind sehr freundlich, aber sehr laut. Jeden Tag hören Sie Autos, die Musik spielen, während sie an Ihrem Haus vorbeifahren, oder ständig das Gaspedal durchtreten, was Sie morgens wachrütteln kann. Wenn Sie nachts planen, zu besuchen, sollten Sie auf der Hut sein. Dieses Viertel ist ziemlich sicher, aber die Menschen sind unberechenbar. Sie könnten auf Leute stoßen, die aus heiterem Himmel Ärger anfangen wollen, Schläger und Diebe. Ich selbst wurde in diesem Viertel in der Vergangenheit körperlich angegriffen, aber das war vor vielen Jahren. Ein weiteres kürzlich stattgefundenes Ereignis betraf den Diebstahl von Paketen. Obwohl es hier einen Paketstealer in der Nachbarschaft gibt, ist es ein häufiges Problem. Zu guter Letzt, obwohl New York City eine Strafe für Menschen hat, die nicht nach ihren Hunden aufräumen, folgen die Menschen hier nicht den Regeln. Jeden Morgen sehen Sie mindestens einen Hundekot, wenn Sie zum Bahnhof oder zum Supermarkt gehen. Meine größte Stinkschuld ist Hundekot auf dem Boden überall, wohin ich in diesem Viertel gehe.

Die Leute nennen es den \"Workout-Hügel\", weil so viele Jogger gerne darauf hochlaufen, während ihres täglichen Workouts. Da es auf meiner Straße überhaupt keine Gehwege gibt, gehen alle auf der Straße. Die Straße ist an einigen Stellen uneben und kann etwas gefährlich zum Befahren sein. Einige der Telefond- und Stromleitungen, die um den Block herum gespannt sind, sehen zerrissen aus. Es regnet und stürmt oft in unserer Gegend, daher schlagen Äste und andere herumfliegende Gegenstände oft auf die Stromleitungen und die ständigen Reparaturen machen sie fleckig und patchworkartig. Es gibt viele hohe, immergrüne Bäume überall, wohin man blickt. Aber die Leute hier hassen die Bäume. Sie bemühen sich, so viele wie möglich abzubauen, weil die Bäume den Blick auf den Ozean versperren. Deshalb sind viele der Häuser so hoch auf dem Hügel gebaut, mit riesigen, glasfronten zweiten Stockwerken, die ineinander ragen, um den Blick auf die Bucht zu erhaschen. Es ist wunderschön bei Sonnenuntergang, wenn das Wasser zu scheinen scheint, als würde es von unten beleuchtet, und der Himmel orange wird. Es ist aber meistens bewölkt, also sieht man den größten Teil des Sonnenlichts durch einen Nebel. Die meisten Tage sind bewölkt und feucht. Moos wächst auf allem, was es kann: Dächer, Autos und Geländer. Ich habe einmal mein Auto einen Monat lang auf meinem Hof ​​abgestellt und als ich es wieder benutzen wollte, war es grün und flauschig mit Moos überzogen. Es hat drei Stunden gedauert, bis ich alles abgekratzt hatte. Es gibt nicht viele Kinder in meiner Gegend, obwohl es nur wenige Blocks von hier entfernt eine Schule gibt. Die meisten Menschen in meiner Nachbarschaft sind älter, viele von ihnen im Ruhestand. Anstatt Kinder haben die Leute Hunde. Es ist üblich, sie auf den Rasen der Leute sitzen oder auf der Straße hintereinander herjagen zu sehen. Wenn Sie eine Tür oder ein Fenster offen lassen, riskieren Sie, dass sie in Ihr Haus schleichen. Ich habe einmal einen in meinem Wohnzimmer gefunden und musste ihn wieder aus der Haustür jagt. Kaninchen laufen wild in der Gegend herum. Einige sind gut gewachsen, und die Gärtner hassen sie, weil sie die Wurzeln der Pflanzen ausgraben und in die Rasenflächen der Leute gräben. Meine Katzen lieben sie aber und haben die meisten aus unserer Nachbarschaft gejagt.

It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.",

When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way.

The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator.

High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some.

If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way.

    "raw_output": "## German Translation:\n\nWenn man mich fragt, meine Nachbarschaft zu beschreiben, bin ich sicher, dass meine Antwort etwas einzigartig ist. Während andere, die auf diese Frage antworten, höchstwahrscheinlich Hausbesitzer sind mit ihren eigenen individuellen Lebenswegen, ist meine Situation etwas anders. Ich betrachte meine Nachbarschaft als den Universitätscampus, auf dem ich wohne, und die Menschen, die in meinem Wohnheim leben, als meine Gemeinschaft. Ich betrachte auch den umliegenden Campus als meine Nachbarschaft, wenn auch in geringerem Maße. Trotz dieser Besonderheit teilt meine Nachbarschaft einige Gemeinsamkeiten mit den konventionelleren Vorstellungen von einer Nachbarschaft. Genau wie jede konventionelle Nachbarschaft hat die Nachbarschaft, in der ich wohne, Häuser, Menschen, Geschäfte und Parks. Beginnen wir damit, die \"Häuser\" zu besprechen, aus denen meine Nachbarschaft besteht. Bevor ich es mir zum Ziel setze, die Häuser in meiner Nachbarschaft zu erkunden, wäre es am besten, die Arten von Häusern zu klären, die man in meiner Nachbarschaft finden kann. Es gibt drei Arten von Wohnraum in meiner unmittelbaren Umgebung: Wohnungen, eigentliche Häuser und Wohnheimhäuser. Erstens gibt es in den Wohnungen in der Regel 2 bis 4 Personen pro Zimmer, und es gibt etwa 4 bis 6 Zimmer pro Etage. Der gebräuchlichste Gebäudetyp kann etwa 2 Etagen beherbergen, sodass durchschnittlich etwa 20 Menschen in jedem Gebäude leben. Zweitens gibt es die eigentlichen Häuser, die für jeden mit einer Zugehörigkeit zur Schule zum Mieten zur Verfügung stehen. Typischerweise handelt es sich um 2- bis 4-Zimmer-Einheiten, in denen in der Regel Alumni wohnen. Es gibt jedoch nur einige dieser Arten von Häusern, die im gesamten Viertel verteilt sind, da sie weniger effizient sind. Schließlich gibt es die typischen Studentenwohnheime, die Hunderte von Studenten beherbergen. Dort teilen sich zwei Personen ein Zimmer, mit Ausnahme einiger Ausnahmen, und es ist der häufigste Wohnraum in meiner Nachbarschaft. Nachdem wir uns mit dem Wohnen befasst haben, können wir zu den Menschen übergehen. Meine Schule ist stolz auf ihre Vielfalt, und das spiegelt sich im Charakter meiner Nachbarschaft wider. Es gibt Menschen aus allen Kulturen und Altersgruppen, die in meiner Nachbarschaft leben. Die meisten Mitarbeiter des Personals wohnen in den Häusern, die sich im Viertel befinden, während die jüngeren Studenten in den Studentenwohnheimen und die älteren Studenten in den Wohnungen wohnen. Die Menschen in diesem Viertel lassen sich nicht nur durch das Sprechen darüber gerecht werden, daher ist es am besten, einfach zu den Geschäften und Parks in meiner Nachbarschaft überzugehen. Da meine Schule wirklich ein eigenständiges Viertel ist, hat sie eine Fülle von Geschäften und einen einzigen Park. Die Geschäfte sind eine Mischung aus Speisemöglichkeiten, die man in jedem anderen Viertel finden würde, und dem eigenen, einzigartigen Sortiment an Kleidung und Lebensmittelgeschäften der Schule. Folglich kann man alles, was man braucht, innerhalb der Grenzen meines Viertels finden! Außerdem ist der Park in meiner Nachbarschaft ein Spielplatz für all die verschiedenen Menschen in meiner Nachbarschaft, er wird von allen Mitgliedern meiner Nachbarschaft sauber und frei von Kriminalität gehalten!\n\n\n\n\n## English Translation\n\nWhen asked to describe my neighborhood, I am sure that my answer is rather unique.

Zuerst war ich ziemlich traurig, als ich zum ersten Mal in meine Nachbarschaft kam. Ich kam aus Riverdale nach Stockbridge, und ich werde nicht lügen, ich habe geweint, weil ich sie vermisst und geliebt habe. Aber meine Mutter und mein Vater wollten das Beste für mich und meine kleine Schwester, also sind wir in einen besseren Ort für Wohnen, eine bessere High School, alles wurde als \"nicht Ghetto\" angesehen, als wir in unsere neue Nachbarschaft gezogen sind. Im Laufe der Jahre habe ich mich daran gewöhnt und mir neue Freunde und auch neue Feinde in der Schule gemacht. Ich habe die Nachbarn im Laufe der Jahre nie wirklich richtig kennengelernt, außer Herrn Glen und seinen Kindern sowie Dennis für eine Weile, da beide direkt neben uns wohnten. Sie sind angenehme Leute, die ich fast als Familie betrachten kann, und ich schätze sie wirklich. Ich erinnere mich, als meine Mutter, mein Vater, meine Schwester und ich zu Herrn Glens Hochzeit gingen (Sie haben sich wiedergetraut). Es war wirklich lustig und angenehm, um es milde auszudrücken, und etwas, worauf ich mich freue, wenn ich mein Vermögen aufbaue und meiner zukünftigen Frau das Leben einer Königin schenke. Als Frau Glen, Frau Veda, den weißen kleinen Gurt an ihrem Bein abnahm und ihn warf, habe ich ihn gefangen! Leider habe ich die Blumen nicht gefangen! Wir haben die ganze Nacht getanzt und ich habe es wirklich genossen, eine gute Zeit mit Marsharii, einer ihrer Töchter, zu verbringen. Ich habe sie aber seitdem nicht mehr gesehen. Ich hoffe, sie ist zu größeren und besseren Dingen übergegangen. Die Nachbarschaft selbst ist wie ein Labyrinth, obwohl ich jetzt ein GPS habe, mit dem ich mehr Zeit zum Erkunden habe. Ich bin nur so weit gegangen, und das war, als ich mit meinen Freunden Kason und Curtis zusammen war. Wir haben früher oft Videospiele gespielt und einfach das Leben in vollen Zügen genossen, so viel wie möglich. Manchmal ging ich in den Park und genoss die Natur, was meine Seele beruhigt. Es gibt mir ein Gefühl von Ruhe und Frieden in diesen Tagen. Ich nehme auch ein paar Stöcke mit, die ich im Home Depot gekauft habe, und übe nur mein Gleichgewicht. Und ich bringe mein Bokken-Holzschwert mit, wenn ich kann. Ich habe Spaß daran, das zu tun, was ich liebe. Es gibt auch einen Basketball- und Tennisplatz, obwohl ich Tennis oder Basketball schon lange nicht mehr gespielt habe. Es ist trotzdem schön, ihn zu haben, falls ich ihn irgendwann wieder aufgreifen und eine neue Runde spielen möchte. Mein Vater hat mich und meinen besten Freund mit Mr. Graves Tennis großgezogen, und wir hatten immer eine tolle Zeit. Sie haben uns hart gearbeitet! Aber wir hatten immer Spaß. Ich denke, es gab viele Male, an denen ich mich in dieser Nachbarschaft amüsiert habe, und es gibt viele Geschichten, aber das sind die, die mir wirklich eingeprägt sind, und ich glaube, das Beste steht noch bevor!\n\n\n\n[REWRITE]\nWell, considering that I've been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know.

But my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered \"not ghetto\" when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when my mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen's wedding (They got remarried). It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I'm looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen's wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn't catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven't seen her since though. I hope she's moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I've only gone so far, and that is when I've hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games a lot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I'll also bring some sticks that I bought from Home Depot and just practice my balance, and bring my bokken wooden sword if I can. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There's also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven't played tennis or basketball in a long time, it's still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on tennis with Mr. Graves, and we'd always have a great time. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there are a lot of times I've had fun in this neighborhood, and there are plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best is yet to come!",

My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own.

Es war am Anfang schwer, Freunde zu finden, aber ich habe mich mit jemandem angefreundet, der zwei Häuser weiter wohnt, und einem anderen Typen, der in meiner Straße wohnt. Keiner von ihnen wohnt dort mehr, aber die Erinnerungen bleiben. Die Leute, die hier wohnten, als ich hierhergezogen bin, sind größtenteils immer noch hier. Meine Nachbarschaft ist ziemlich ähnlich wie eine durchschnittliche amerikanische Vorstadtnähe. Die Nachbarschaft hat viele zweistöckige Häuser. Jedes Wochenende oder wann immer es draußen warm ist, höre ich die Kinder draußen spielen. Die Nachbarschaft ist an den meisten Tagen der Woche ruhig. Ich hatte nie ein Problem mit irgendjemandem in der Nachbarschaft. Du wirst hier in Ruhe gelassen, es sei denn, du brauchst Hilfe. Ich habe mehrere Pakete online bestellt und habe nie ein Paket von meinem Vorgarten gestohlen bekommen. Ich habe das Gefühl, meinen Nachbarn zu vertrauen. Es gibt einen Park nur ein oder zwei Minuten von meinem Haus entfernt. Ich habe viele Erinnerungen daran. Ich habe dort mit den anderen Jungs aus der Nachbarschaft Basketball, Fußball und Baseball gespielt. Ich habe auch eine meiner schlimmsten Erinnerungen dort bekommen, als ich beim Fußballspielen in die Nase geknallt wurde, aber die guten Erinnerungen überwiegen die schlechten. Heutzutage gehe ich in diesen Park, um Zeit mit den Kindern meines Cousins zu verbringen. Sie sind viel jünger als ich und spielen immer noch gerne auf Schaukeln und Rutschen und so weiter. Nur der Gedanke daran, in den Park zu gehen, macht sie aufgeregt. Der Park macht mich aus vielen Gründen sehr nostalgisch. Die Nachbarschaft ist sehr vielfältig. In der Nähe finden Sie alle Arten von Lebensmitteln. Innerhalb eines Kilometerradius könnten Sie chinesische, indische, mexikanische und italienische Restaurants finden. Allerdings nutzen heutzutage viele Menschen einfach Apps wie GrubHub und DoorDash, um sich ihr Essen liefern zu lassen. Die beliebtesten Essensorte sind die Fast-Food-Restaurants, aber die finden Sie in fast jeder Vorstadtnähe. Es gibt auch viele Pizzaläden. Die Geschäfte hier enthalten alles, was Sie jemals brauchen könnten. Es gibt mehrere Drogerien in der Nähe. Es gibt eine Walgreens und eine CVS in der gleichen Straße sowie einen Jewel-Osco-Supermarkt, der im Mittleren Westen beliebt ist. Einige der Geschäfte sind sogar vielfältig, es gibt zum Beispiel einen indigenen Laden, falls Sie jemals Lust haben, selbst indisches Essen zu kochen oder fertig zubereitetes indisches Essen zu kaufen. Insgesamt bin ich ein Fan meiner Nachbarschaft. In sozialen Medien zu lesen und in den Nachrichten zu sehen, welche Horrorgeschichten andere Menschen mit ihren Nachbarn durchmachen müssen, macht mich dankbar für meine.\n\n\n\n[REWRITE] I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade.

However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.",

Sie hebt sich nicht von anderen in South Carolina ab, aber sie hat einen erheblichen Einfluss auf den Agrarsektor. Johnston ist als \"Peach Capital of the World\" bekannt, was die Stadt stolz auf dem Begrüßungszeichen verkündet. Es besteht hauptsächlich aus landwirtschaftlichen Flächen, die entweder von Pfirsichbäumen oder Vieh dominiert werden. Häuser, die sich nicht im Hauptteil der Stadt befinden, sind weit voneinander entfernt; die meisten sind zweistöckig und haben entweder Metalldächer, um der sengenden Sommerhitze entgegenzuwirken, oder graue Schindeldächer. Meistens befinden sich diese Häuser nicht in der Nähe der Straße, sondern weiter hinten, sodass die vorderen Felder für Tiere/Kulturen genutzt werden können. Im Zentrum der Stadt befindet sich ein einziges Ampelzeichen an einem Kreuzungspunkt. Hier befinden sich die einzigen Geschäfte der gesamten Stadt. Es gibt drei Orte, an denen man \"Fast Food\" bekommen kann: Hong Kong, ein kleines chinesisches Restaurant, das von einer einzelnen Familie geführt wird, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant oder Gary's, eine kleine Burgerkette. Früher gab es eine Pizzeria, die jedoch vor kurzem geschlossen hat. Es gibt eine sehr kleine, familiengeführte Apotheke namens Maxwell and Halford Drug; seltsamerweise sind sie am besten für das Cherry Coca-Cola bekannt, das sie verkaufen. Es gibt einen kleinen, aber teuren Lebensmittelladen namens Independent Grocers Alliance, der gemeinhin als IGA bekannt ist. Obwohl es der einzige Lebensmittelladen in der ganzen Stadt ist, kaufen viele Menschen nur ein oder zwei Artikel und bevorzugen es, in Batesburg-Leesville in ein Walmart zu fahren, um den größten Teil ihrer Lebensmittel zu kaufen. Der beliebteste Laden in der ganzen Stadt ist Dollar General; dieser Laden verkauft eine große Auswahl an Alltagsartikeln und ist oft von der Öffnung bis zur Schließzeit voll. Es gibt einen sehr kleinen Möbelladen namens Possibilities Furniture & More, geführt von einer freundlichen Frau, die in der Gemeinde bekannt ist. Der Laden befindet sich schon seit vielen Jahren in Johnston und beschäftigt sogar zwei Möbelpacker, die die gekauften Möbel liefern! Am Gebäude des Möbelladens befindet sich ein kleiner Tierfriseur namens Clark's Cuts and Kennels. Sie bieten eine Vielzahl von Dienstleistungen an, wie z. B. Betreuung, Unterbringung, Pflege, Nagelschliff, Baden usw. Sowohl eine Arztpraxis als auch eine Tierarztpraxis befinden sich außerhalb des zentralen Stadtteils; beide sind zwar klein, aber gut ausgestattet, um die Bewohner von Johnston zu versorgen. Es gibt eine einzige Grundschule namens Johnston Elementary School. Sobald die Schüler die fünfte Klasse abgeschlossen haben, müssen sie sowohl die Mittelschule als auch die High School in der nächsten Stadt besuchen. Es gibt technisch gesehen keine Parks in der Stadt, aber sie befinden sich gerade dabei, einen 2,5 Hektar großen Erholungsbereich zu schaffen, um Familien mehr Möglichkeiten zum Ausgehen zu bieten und mehr Besucher/potenzielle Bewohner anzulocken. Zugegeben, es gibt nicht viel zu tun; es gibt keine Kinos, Bowlingbahnen, \"Treffpunkte\", Spielplätze für Kinder, Bereiche zum Gassigehen mit Hunden oder eine große Auswahl an Restaurants. Trotzdem ist es eine schöne Stadt, so klein, dass man sie im Nu übersehen könnte!\n\n\n\n[REWRITE] My neighborhood is a quaint little town.

Fast jede Wohnung in der Gegend kostete über tausend Dollar pro Monat. Ich hatte noch nie von dieser Geschichte gehört und auch meine Freunde nicht. Vielleicht liegt es am Kampf. Ich kenne ein paar meiner Freunde, die sich nachts vor Schlaftränen übergeben. Die Dinge sind teuer, aber im Laufe der Jahre haben wir gelernt, sparsam zu sein. Man lernt den staubigen Geruch von Flohmarkt-Spielzeug und in Mottenhülsen gelagerter Kleidung zu mögen. Man riecht im Erwachsenenalter viel weniger. Man könnte anfangen zu rauchen, oder man ist einfach zu sehr an den Zustand der Dinge gewöhnt. Aber der Flohmarktassert sich immer wieder. Der Geruch des Erwachsenseins ist staubige Zeitschriften, die auf einem verschlossenen Klavierstapel liegen. Er bohrt sich in das Leder und bleibt sogar nach dem Waschen hängen. Hier gibt es drei Secondhandläden in Gehweite. Wenn man an der Fernseite beginnt, kann man zwei wohltätige Secondhandläden, eine Bibliothek, ein Antiquariat und einen Kuriositätenladen besuchen. Die Innenstadt ist dicht, Autos und Menschen füllen jeden Morgen die Straßen, aber in den Secondhandläden hört man das nicht. Egal wie viele Menschen oder Autos vorbeifahren, der Laden ist still. Es ist ein schöner Ort, um einen Nachmittag zu verlieren. Jedes Jahr gibt es mehr davon. Autos und Menschen überschwemmen es. Es ist eine wachsende Stadt, sagen sie. Mit dem Hauptquartier eines der größten Online-Imperien für E-Commerce und Zustellung zeigt sie immer noch Wachstumsschmerzen. Es erinnert mich an New York. Jeder und alles verfolgt seine eigenen Ziele und niemand hat von dir viel verlangt. Du kannst allein, ruhig und unabhängig sein, und die Leute lassen dich in Ruhe. Es ist nicht wie im Süden, wo ein kleines kümmern bedeutet, dass du dich um etwas interessierst. Hier drängt niemand in das Leben der anderen. Du kannst deine Schale so lange wie du willst aufrechterhalten, und die Stadt stürzt und rollt wie Wellen am Strand zurück. Es ist ein lebhafter Ort, an dem man sein kann. Zwischen dem Pianisten nebenan und den zwei Amateur-Sängerinnen upstairs gibt es immer etwas los. Auf eine Weise haben wir weniger eine Wohnung von Fremden und mehr eine Gemeinschaft von Freunden. Wir kommen zusammen, um unsere Bedürfnisse zu befriedigen, Geburtstage zu feiern, Beerdigungen zu trauern und uns gegenseitig zu helfen, wenn wir können. In gewisser Weise bin ich glücklich hier. Ich mag die meisten meiner Nachbarn und sie behandeln mich recht gut. Ich versuche, darauf zu achten, dass ich nach mir aufräume und ihnen Essen lasse, und sie tun dasselbe. Ich bringe ihnen Post und sie mir. Es ist schön, sie zu sehen, und ich glaube, sie genießen meine Anwesenheit so sehr wie ich die ihre. Ich lebe in einem riesigen, entmenschlichendem modernen Platzmuster, aber es sind Menschen wie meine Nachbarn, die mir das Gefühl geben, dass ich mein Leben nicht ganz ruiniert habe.\n\n\n[REWRITE]\nThe first time I heard about my neighborhood, I was listening to a podcast about missing people.

Für mein Viertel im Besonderen ist die Präsenz eines Hausbesitzerverbandes sehr deutlich spürbar. Wenn man einfährt, sieht man nichts als gepflegte Einfamilienhäuser, wofür wir den Hausbesitzerverband danken können. Die Vorgärten sind alle sehr ähnlich. Es gibt ein kleines Stück bepflanzte Fläche, einige dekorative Kieselsteine und relativ kurze Einfahrten. Manchmal sieht man auch kleine Bäume. Jeder hat eine Garage für zwei Autos. Wenn man weiter durch das Viertel fährt, sieht man neu gepflasterten Beton. Trotz der vielen verschiedenen Familien, die hier leben, sind die Straßen in exzellentem Zustand. Hier findet man keine Schlaglöcher oder ähnliches. Die meisten Häuser sind einstöckig, aber manchmal sieht man auch zweistöckige. Wir haben kein typisches Briefkasten-System, wie man es von Einfamilienhäusern erwarten würde. Es gibt keine individuellen Briefkästen vor jedem Haus. Stattdessen ist es eher wie in einem Apartmentgebäude, wo sich mehrere Briefkästen am Ende der Straße befinden. Jeder benutzt einen Schlüssel, um Zugang zu seinem jeweiligen Briefkasten zu erhalten. Und es gibt zwei größere Schließfächer für Pakete. Wieder einmal kann man den HOA und seine Obsession für Uniformität dafür verantwortlich machen. Die Lage meines Hauses liegt am Rande der nahegelegenen Stadt, sodass mein Viertel sowohl ländlich als auch städtisch zu bezeichnen ist. Als Ergebnis haben wir viel Land für, nun ja, alles. Es gibt mehrere Gemeinschaftspools, die jeder, der hier wohnt, nutzen kann. Er ist gepflegt und mit einem Zaun umgeben. Und dann gibt es verschiedene Wanderwege, auf denen man seinen Hund spazierenführen oder einfach einen Abendspaziergang allein unternehmen kann. Man muss nicht in einen Park gehen, um Sport zu treiben. Das Viertel ist groß genug, dass man einfach umherlaufen kann und ausreichend Bewegung bekommt. Der größte Teil der Gemeinde besteht aus Rentnern. Es ist ein sehr sicherer Bereich, und jeder sieht auf den anderen auf. Dazwischen gibt es eine kleine Anzahl von mittelalten und jungen Fachleuten. Was die Stadt betrifft, so ist sie überraschend groß - zumindest was die Einwohnerzahl angeht - aber hat gleichzeitig ein kleines Städtchen-Gefühl. Wir haben die meisten Annehmlichkeiten, auf die man angewiesen ist. Zum Beispiel haben wir genau ein Einkaufszentrum. Es ist nicht riesig, aber es erfüllt seinen Zweck. Für mich dauert es etwa 15 Minuten mit dem Auto, um an einen bedeutenden Ort zu gelangen, aber sobald ich dort bin, werde ich mit vielen verschiedenen Geschäften begrüßt. Wir haben alles, vom hochwertigen Supermarkt mit Bio-Lebensmitteln bis hin zu Discount-Läden, die nur eine kleine Auswahl an Artikeln führen und das absolute Mindestpersonal haben, um die Kosten niedrig zu halten. Alles in allem ist meine Nachbarschaft sicher, gepflegt und ziemlich typisch. Wir haben viele schöne Dinge, wie Pools und Wanderwege. Und obwohl wir nicht direkt neben einem Einkaufszentrum wohnen, kann man einfach in den Wagen steigen und zu jeder großen Kette fahren.\n\n[REWRITE]\nThe general area where I live can be described as your typical cookie-cutter suburbia.

As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single-story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single-family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle-aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small-town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high-end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.",

My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide.

Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress.

No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town.

Meine unmittelbare Nachbarschaft, an der östlichen Seite der Stadt, könnte als das am stärksten wirtschaftlich benachteiligte Gebiet der Stadt bezeichnet werden. Die Immobilienwerte sind niedrig, wobei die meisten Häuser an einkommensschwache Personen vermietet oder von ihnen besessen werden. Es ist jedoch nicht unattraktiv oder unangenehm. Meine Nachbarn sind im Allgemeinen freundliche Menschen, die mir lächeln und Hallo sagen, wenn ich die Straße entlang gehe. Die Kriminalitätsraten sind zwar etwas höher als in anderen Stadtteilen, sind aber im Allgemeinen gering. In den letzten zehn Jahren gab es innerhalb weniger Blocks von meinem Haus ein paar Gewalttaten, einschließlich ein paar Schüssen und mindestens einen Mord. Unsere Nachbarn verloren letztes Jahr ihren Sohn in einer Schießerei vor einer Bar in der Nähe. Zum Glück hat unsere Familie keine direkten Erfahrungen mit Kriminalität gemacht, abgesehen davon, dass gelegentlich ein Gegenstand von unserem Veranda verschwindet, wenn wir ihn nicht nach drinnen bringen. \n\nAllgemein hat die Stadt, in der ich wohne, stark unter der „Opioid-Epidemie“ gelitten, die viele Teile der Vereinigten Staaten betrifft. Viele Menschen sind an Fentanyl-Überdosen gestorben. Glücklicherweise gibt es in meiner Stadt viele Ressourcen, um dieser Epidemie entgegenzuwirken, einschließlich mehrerer Entzugsbehandlungszentren und Narcan-Schulungen für Familien und Freunde von Menschen, die an einer Sucht leiden. Trotz dieser Herausforderungen hat diese Stadt viele positive Eigenschaften. Die Grundschule meines Sohnes hat ein exzellentes Personal, von der Schulleitung über die Lehrer bis hin zum Betreuungspersonal. Trotz seiner besonderen Bedürfnisse hat er aufgrund der unglaublich positiven Atmosphäre der Schule bisher keine Mobbing-Erfahrungen gemacht, und er liebt es dort. Wir haben einen aktiven Elternbeirat, der das ganze Jahr über mehrere Veranstaltungen plant, um die Familienbeteiligung und den Bildungsrückgang zu fördern. Da über 20 % der Einwohner unserer Stadt unterhalb der Armutsgrenze leben, bietet die Grundschule allen Schülern kostenlose Frühstück und Mittagessen, damit kein Kind hungern muss. Keine Familie oder kein Kind wird aufgrund von finanziellen Schwierigkeiten „minderwertig“ behandelt, und die Kosten für Schulgebühren, Materialien und Schulausflüge sind sehr angemessen. Der Gemeinderat und das Personal haben viele Verbesserungen an der Erscheinung unserer Stadt vorgenommen, einschließlich der Reparatur von Straßen, der Landschaftsgestaltung und der Sanierung der Stadtparks. Leider sind die meisten dieser Verbesserungen im Stadtzentrum und auf der westlichen Seite erfolgt, wo sich die meisten Einkaufsmöglichkeiten befinden und der größte Teil des Verkehrs fließt. Die östliche Seite, wo ich wohne, wird tendenziell vernachlässigt, was für die Menschen in meinem Viertel ein Streitpunkt ist. Insgesamt genieße ich es, in dieser Stadt zu leben. Die Menschen sind im Allgemeinen freundlich, die Schulen sind großartig, es gibt genügend Einkaufsmöglichkeiten (sowohl kleine Geschäfte als auch größere Einzelhandelsgeschäfte), um den Bedürfnissen meiner Familie gerecht zu werden, und unser Haus mag nicht viel wert sein, aber es ist gemütlich und ausreichend. Unsere Familie lebt hier seit über 16 Jahren und wir können uns nicht vorstellen, irgendwo anders zu leben. \n\n\n[REWRITE]\nI live in a small town in the Midwest that is just outside the suburbs of a major city.

Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",

We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes.

Trotzdem lebe ich an einem der schönsten Orte der Welt, umgeben vom Wasser. Meine \"Stadt\" ist von Wasser umgeben. Zum einen liegt der wunderschöne Lake Michigan und zum anderen der Lake Charlevoix.

Die meisten Häuser haben Keller. Voll ausgestattete Keller, die man von der Straße aus sehen kann. Viele Häuser in der Nachbarschaft haben ältere Aluminiumverkleidungen. In den Blöcken rund um mein Haus gibt es Häuser in allen erdenklichen Farben. Die meisten Häuser haben Gärten. Gärten mit Trampolinen und Spielplätzen. Manche Leute haben Gärten und Zäune für ihre Tiere. Die Häuser erinnern an das Mittlere Amerika. Arbeitsame Menschen, die hart arbeiten, um ihren Lebensunterhalt zu verdienen und entweder Familien gründen oder aufgewachsen sind. An einem beliebigen Tag siehst du Kinder, die die Straße entlanglaufen. Du siehst auch Leute, die Hunde Gassi gehen lassen, Rad fahren und Rollerblades fahren. Nachbarn kennen Nachbarn und man kann erkennen, wer dazugehört und wer nicht dazugehört. Man sieht jemanden draußen grillen und grüßt, oder sogar jemanden, der seinen Hund aus ein paar Straßenblocks entfernt spazieren führt und freundlich lächelt. Die Rasenflächen sind in einem ordentlichen Zustand. Niemand hat Laubhaufen vom Herbst. Der grüne Rasen wird gemäht und unter Kontrolle gehalten. Wenn Menschen Pflanzen und Sträucher in ihren Gärten haben, werden sie beschnitten. Es ist keine wunderschöne Nachbarschaft, in die man fährt und denkt: \"Wow, schau dir diese schönen Häuser an\", sondern eine, in die man fährt und denkt: \"Da könnte man eine Familie großziehen\". Sie ist ruhig, friedlich und sicher. Auch wenn sie nur durchschnittlich aussieht, ist sie außergewöhnlich, weil sie das darstellt, was die Menschen sich von der Welt wünschen, nämlich einen sicheren Ort, an dem man am Ende des Tages landen kann. In Gehweite befindet sich die Sheriff-Abteilung und das Gefängnis des Landkreises. Das Gesundheitsamt befindet sich direkt daneben. Das städtische Recyclingzentrum liegt nur eine Straße weiter, und Nachbarn und Bewohner aus der ganzen Stadt nutzen die von ihnen angebotenen Dienstleistungen.

Man kann draußen oder drinnen spielen und die Geräusche kleiner Flugzeuge hören, die abheben und landen. Man kann zu Fuß Eiscreme aus dem örtlichen Eiscremegeschäft holen, und wenn man wirklich Lust hat, kann man vom Viertel zu den Geschäften in der Innenstadt gehen. Meine Kinder können mit dem Fahrrad zum Park fahren, der nur etwa 8 Blocks entfernt ist. Es ist ein wirklich toller Ort zum Leben. \n\n## English Translation:\n\n[REWRITE]I live in rural America, specifically a small town in Michigan.

It isn't a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It's quiet, peaceful, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff's department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live. [/REWRITE] \n\n\n",
    "transformed": "I live in rural America, specifically a small town in Michigan. It's a place where you transition from farmland to small tourist towns. There are no large shopping malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee's. To get anywhere, you have to drive. Still, I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world, surrounded by water. My \"city\" is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go, you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood reflects the idea of small town living. Houses aren't stacked on top of each other. They aren't cookie-cutter houses built the same. They are older homes, some updated and remodeled, some older. Most homes have basements. Full basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses in every color imaginable in the blocks surrounding my house. Most houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hardworking people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking, and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors, and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn't belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down.
