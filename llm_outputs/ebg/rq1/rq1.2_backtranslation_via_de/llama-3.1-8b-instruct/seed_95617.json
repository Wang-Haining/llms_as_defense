Werte, die ich der Sozialarbeit zugute kommen lassen kann, sind Folgende: Dienst, Respekt, ethischer Charakter, Verpflichtung zur Verbesserung der Beziehungen zwischen anderen und zur Verbesserung meiner selbst, um in meiner Branche kompetent zu bleiben. Diese Kernwerte sind nicht nur für Sozialarbeiter wichtig, sondern auch für mich persönlich.\n\nIch habe mir immer gewünscht, anderen zu helfen, aber ich war unsicher bezüglich der Karrierewege, die ich verfolgen wollte. Während meiner Jahre in der Schule und im College sah ich viele Einzelpersonen fliehen vor ihren Problemen in Distanz und einige verwendeten weniger als ideale Umgangsformen. Aufgrund der Situationen, die ich beobachtet habe, entschied ich mich, einen Bachelorabschluss in Psychologie zu machen. Noch immer unsicher bezüglich eines bestimmten Karrierewegs, beschloss ich, eine Auszeit zu nehmen, nachdem ich 2009 den Piedmont College abgeschlossen hatte. Eines Tages besuchte ich einen Freund, der mir einen 16-jährigen Jungen auf seinem Sofa vorstellte, der nervös saß. Sie erklärte mir, warum er besuchte: um vor seinen missbrauchenden Eltern zu fliehen. Am nächsten Tag erfuhr ich, dass er die Polizei zu seiner Eltern' Haus gerufen hatte. Um herauszufinden, ob ich in irgendeiner Weise helfen konnte, fuhr ich zu seinem Elternhaus. Als ich dort war, erklärte ich meine Bedenken privat den Polizeibeamten und erzählte ihnen, dass ich gerade einen Abschluss in Psychologie von Piedmont College absolviert hatte. Die Polizei bat mich, mit den Eltern zu sprechen, da nichts für den Jugendlichen, was das Gesetz für ihn tun konnte. Als ich die Eltern zu der Situation befragte, sahen sie nervös aus und nutzten Vorwände, um ihr Sohn \"manipulatives\" Verhalten zu beschreiben, das \"einfache\" Streitigkeiten mit außenstehenden Personen zu lösen. Nach dieser bestimmten Erfahrung begann ich, einen Karriereweg in Sozialarbeit in Betracht zu ziehen, um Kindern mit \"einfachen\" Konflikten unter Familienmitgliedern zu helfen.\n\nEin weiterer Wert, der für den Bereich Sozialarbeit wichtig ist, ist soziale Gerechtigkeit. Als Gesellschaft behaupten wir, dass der Einzelne wichtig ist und betrauern diejenigen, die wir verloren haben. Der von der Gesellschaft gehaltene Begriff des \"Einzelnen\" ist mehr ein Anhänger alter Traditionen als eine tatsächliche Einzigartigkeit. Wenn also die Gesellschaft diejenigen trauert, die sie verloren hat, dann warum streben wir danach, ähnlich wie \"jeder andere\" zu sein? Ich bin ein Einzelner und genieße es nicht, Einschränkungen auf mich zu legen, um ähnlich wie anderen zu sein. Während meiner Jahre in der Schule und im College protestierte ich gegen soziale Ungerechtigkeiten, wo immer ich konnte: Ich färbte meine Haare unnatürliche Farben, trug Kleidung, die meinem Charakter entsprach, pirschte meine Ohrläppchen über die traditionelle Setzung hinaus, erklärte meine Beteiligung an GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), kämpfte gegen Rassismus und Diskriminierung, wo immer ich sie sah, usw. Ich glaube an soziale Gerechtigkeit und werde weiterhin gegen soziale Ungerechtigkeiten protestieren.\n\nEnglish translation back to original text:\n\n[REWRITE] In pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families.

The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",

Die Aktivierung des GABAA-Rezeptors induziert Antworten, die den Schlaf fördern. Wenn es von der Aktivität abgehalten wird, kann dies zu reduzierter Angst und Schlafinduktion führen. Der GABAB-Agonist (Baclofen) erhöhte die Schlafzeit (Matsuki et al., 2009). Solche Ergebnisse implizieren, dass die Tiermodelle der Maus auf Studien an Menschen generalisierbar sind. Dies zeigt, dass es eine genetische und umweltbedingte Basis für den physischen GABAB-Rezeptor in Menschen gibt.

Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005).

This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers.

Zunächst wird eine kurze Definition der Störung bereitgestellt. Als Nächstes wird das Diagnoseverfahren erläutert, einschließlich allgemeiner Merkmalen oder \"Rotflaggen\". Schließlich schließt das Papier mit Hinweisen ab, wie ein Lehrer in einem inklusiven Klassenzimmerumfeld einen Schüler mit ZAV unterstützen kann.\n\nZentrale auditorische Verarbeitungsstörung (ZAV), oder auditorische Verarbeitungsstörung (AVD) „bezieht sich auf die Effizienz und Wirksamkeit, mit der das zentrale Nervensystem (CNS) auditorische Informationen verwendet. In engen Grenzen definiert (C)AV sich auf die wahrnehmungsbezogene Verarbeitung auditorischer Informationen im CNS und die neurobiologische Aktivität, die diese Verarbeitung unterlegt und zur electrophysiologischen auditorischen Potentiale führt“ (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), was bedeutet, dass es sich um eine Störung handelt, bei der das zentrale Nervensystem (d. h. das Gehirn) nicht richtig Dinge wahrnimmt, die gehört werden. Menschen mit ZAV können normal hören und werden daher nicht als \"hörbehindert\" angesehen; vielmehr funktioniert das Gebiet des Gehirns, das was wir hören, wahrnimmt, Wörter trennt oder Konversation von Hintergrundgeräuschen unterscheidet, nicht wie üblich.\n\nDie früheste Erwähnung der Störung, die sich zu ZAV entwickelte, stammt aus der Mitte der 1950er Jahre, genannt \"auditorische Imperzeption\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), als Forscher Kinder mit kommunikativen Störungen auswerteten. Die italienische Forschergruppe von Bocca, Calearo und Cassinari begannen 1954, Tests für diese Kinder zu entwickeln; 1961 führte Kimura \"die dichotische Testung ein und formulierte ein Modell, um die Physiologie der CANS, die dichotische Wahrnehmung zugrunde liegt, zu erklären\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Eine nationale Konferenz wurde 1977 abgehalten, die die Forschung auf Kinder mit ZAV anregte.\n\nZAV manifestiert sich in mehreren Formen: Die betroffene Person kann möglicherweise nicht lokalisiert oder Gehör schaffen; kann Schwierigkeiten haben, zwischen zwei oder mehr \"akustischen Ereignissen\" (Höreignisse) zu unterscheiden; kann nicht erkennen, ob es sich um ein Muster handelt; kann nicht unterscheiden, ob sich die Rede ändert (wie beispielsweise bei der Erkennung von Sarcasmus aufgrund des Stimmlaufs); kann möglicherweise ein Geräusch blockiert durch ein nachfolgendes Geräusch; kann möglicherweise nicht die Fähigkeit haben, Schallklänge zu synthetisieren (das heißt, sie in einer bedeutsamen Weise interpretieren, die sie dann in die Tat umsetzen können); und kann möglicherweise nicht bestimmen, in welcher Reihenfolge auditorische Informationen vorliegen (Ferre).\n\nUm ZAV festzustellen, muss der Patient mit \"systematischer Beobachtung des Hörenverhaltens und/oder Leistung auf Tests der auditorischen Funktion\" untersucht werden, die möglicherweise von \"Audiologen, SLPs, Psychologen und anderen mit einer Vielzahl von Maßnahmen durchgeführt werden, die auditorische Fähigkeiten beurteilen\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Dies kann Fragebögen und Umfragen, Beobachtungen des auditorischen Verhaltens, einschließlich wie der Patient auf bestimmte Reize reagiert, einschließen. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt gibt es kein einziges Werkzeug oder Test, das zur Diagnose mit hohem Erfolgsgrad verwendet wird, und es gibt keine bekannte Ursache für die Störung. Viele der eingesetzten Tests stellen dem Patienten mehrere, gleichzeitige auditorische Reize vor und fragen sie dann, bestimmte Artikel zu unterscheiden, wie ein Serien von Wörtern oder Zahlen.

    "raw_output": "The original text in German:\n\nDer Schauspiel \"Zwölfte Nacht\" scheint zu sagen, dass die Täuschung zwar in der Tat nützlich sein kann, um lange Phasen der Täuschung zu veranstalten, aber am Ende muss man sich von der neu entstandenen Maske befreien, ansonsten riskiert man, sich für immer in dem Prozess zu verlieren. Ein großes Problem mit dem Ende einer Täuschung ist jedoch, dass man sich dabei in der Folge entfremdet. Daher muss man sich am Ende zwischen der eigenen Selbsterhaltung oder der Erhaltung der Beziehungen zu denen um sich herum entscheiden. Denn obwohl einige neutral auf die Entdeckung reagieren, dass sie getäuscht wurden, so werden andere die Täuschung nicht so leicht nehmen und werden wahrscheinlich verärgert sein.\n\nBesonders problematisch ist das Thema der Täuschung in der Rolle der Geschlechter, da sie viele Nebenfragen aufwirft. Vielleicht die wichtigste ist, warum? Warum fühlt sich der Betroffene dazu gezwungen, seine eigene Identität aufzugeben und sich in der Form des gegenteiligen Geschlechts zu verkleiden? In Violas Fall ist es offensichtlich eine Form der Selbstschutz: „Ich werde dich zu einem Kapitän in dieser Stadt bringen,/ Wo meine Mädchenhaare liegen, durch deren sanfte Hilfe/ Ich wurde bewahrt, um diesem edlen Grafen zu dienen…” (5.1.247-249)\n\nAls Neuankömmling in einem fremden Land fühlt sich Viola dazu gezwungen, sich als Mann zu verkleiden, um sich vor Angreifern zu schützen. Violas Plan funktioniert, aber es führt auch dazu, dass sie sich von den Frauen um sie herum entfremdet, sie von einem wichtigen Unterstützungssystem abgeschnitten werden lässt. Dazu kommt noch, dass sie offensichtlich so überzeugend ist, als Mann zu erscheinen, dass Olivia sie mit Sebastian verwechselt und in Wirklichkeit in sie verliebt ist: „Wohin, mein Herr? Cesario, Ehemann, bleib.” (5.1.138) Zu allem Überfluss muss sie auch mit unterdrückten romantischen Gefühlen zwischen ihr und Orsino kämpfen: „Junge, du hast mir tausendmal gesagt,/ Du solltest keine Frau lieben, wie mich.” (5.1. 260-261)\n\nObwohl dies eine zu einem gewissen Grad fortschrittliche Einstellung ist, kann man in der modernen Lesart \"Zwölfte Nacht\" als eine Illustration betrachten, wie Täuschung die Entdeckung unterdrückter Emotionen fördern kann, insbesondere im Falle von Olivia und Orsino. Bestimmte Passagen scheinen darauf hinzudeuten, dass die genannten Charaktere möglicherweise unausgedrückte, unbewusste Wünsche haben, die durch die Erscheinung von Viola/Cesario gezwungen werden, sich mit ihnen auseinanderzusetzen. Zum Beispiel ist Olivia möglicherweise von Cesario angetan, weil Cesario als Mann erscheint, oder hat Olivia vielleicht heimliche Gefühle für Frauen? Man würde argumentieren, dass dies wahrscheinlich nicht der Fall ist, da Shakespeare’s Charakter Olivia eher jemanden parodiert, der in seiner Zeit nur auf das Aussehen anderer schielt.\n\nDies wird durch die Leichtigkeit bewiesen, mit der Olivia ihre romantischen Schwärmereien von Cesario auf Sebastian überträgt und Cesario/Viola als Familienmitglied und nicht als Liebhaber betrachtet: „Eine Schwester, du bist sie.” (5.1.315)\n\n[REWRITE] The play Twelfth Night seems to say that although deception is in fact useful for perpetrating long periods of deception, in the end one must give up the newly formed disguise, or else risk losing oneself forever in the process.

Natürlich kann keine Kolonialmacht so breit angelegt sein, dass sie sich mit einer so einfachen Beschreibung erklären lässt. Die deutsche Kolonialmacht war in ihren Politiken und Herrschaftsstilen genauso vielfältig wie in ihrer Geographie. Bildungseinrichtungen in den Kolonien waren gleichfalls vielfältig. Als die Briten 1919 Deutsch-Ostafrika (Tanganjika) übernahmen, fanden sie eine große Bevölkerung ausgebildeter und literater Afrikaner. Die deutschen Bildungsanstrengungen in Kamerun und anderen Kolonien wurden auch von zeitgenössischen Autoren gelobt.\n\nDie Situation in Südwestafrika (heute Namibia) bot einen deutlichen Kontrast. Anders als in Ostafrika, wo die Regierung staatliche Schulen gründete und eine bedeutende Rolle bei der Bildung der Einheimischen einnahm, überließ die Regierung in Südwestafrika das Bildungsaufgaben der Heimatmissionare, die nur sehr beschränkten Regierungsunterstützung erhielten. Die Regierung investierte jedoch erhebliche Ressourcen in die Bildung der Europäer in der Kolonie, indem sie ein System staatlicher Schulen einrichtete, sowie missionarische Schulen unterstützte und regulierte. Diese Bildungspolitiken hatten langfristige Auswirkungen auf Südwestafrika, selbst nach der deutschen Herrschaft. Während andere deutsche Kolonien eine erhebliche Zahl ausgebildeter und gebildeter Afrikaner hatten, blieb \"die überwältigende Mehrheit der Bevölkerung in Südwestafrika unberührt, unbeleutet und analphabetisch.\" Verschiedene soziale, politische und wirtschaftliche Faktoren führten zu dem divergierenden Erfahrungen von Südwestafrika. Diese Arbeit soll den Diskurs erweitern, indem sie diese Faktoren identifiziert und besonders die neuere Forschung über die Haltung von Siedlern und Kolonialbehörden zu den einheimischen Afrikanern berücksichtigt.\n\nEs gibt eine Fülle von Literatur zu Bildung in der deutschen Kolonialmacht speziell. Die meisten dieser Quellen sind in deutscher Sprache und wurden im frühen 20. Jahrhundert, während oder kurz nach der Periode der deutschen Kolonialherrschaft, geschrieben. Das Ziel der frühen Werke war vor allem darin zu beschreiben, die Merkmale der Bildungssysteme in diesen Kolonien. Spätere Schriften in englischer Sprache erweiterten den Diskurs durch vergleichende Studien der Bildung in den verschiedenen deutschen Kolonien und umfassendere Analysen von spezifischen Aspekten der Bildung. Diese Studien zeigten signifikante Unterschiede in den Bildungssystemen verschiedener Kolonien. Die bedeutendste Arbeit, die sich explizit auf das Thema dieser Arbeit bezieht, ist Cohens Studie über Bildung in Südwestafrika und Ostafrika. Cohen vergleicht die Bildungssysteme der beiden Kolonien und diskutiert die Faktoren, die für die Unterschiede zwischen ihnen verantwortlich sind. Laut Cohen erklärt die große Siedlerbevölkerung von Südwestafrika viele der unterscheidenden Aspekte des Bildungssystems der Kolonie.\n\nIm Vergleich zu Deutschlands anderen Kolonialbesitzungen hatte Südwestafrika einen gemäßigten Klima, obwohl ein großer Teil des Territoriums von ariden Wüsten bedeckt ist. Die europäische Bevölkerung von Südwestafrika spiegelte die relativ gastfreundlichen Bedingungen wider. Bis 1913 lebten in Südwestafrika fast 15.000 Weiße, während in der Kolonie mit der nächsten größten Siedlerbevölkerung, Ostafrika, nur 5.336 lebten.\n\nBack translation to English:\n\n[REWRITE] German colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably in regards to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa.

    "original": "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality.

    "raw_output": "Deutsche Version:\n\nDie Klassifizierung von Popmusik hat sich im Laufe der letzten 100 Jahre stark verändert und umfasst mittlerweile so viele Genres, dass es schwierig ist, sie alle aufzulisten. Die Sache wird zusätzlich dadurch kompliziert, dass viele, wenn nicht alle Genres – zum Beispiel Rap, Rock, Country, Jazz, Folk – mehrere Unter- und Unter-Untergenres hervorgebracht haben. Die Subgenre des Heavy Metal Rocks gilt als eines der vielfältigsten und ausdrucksstärksten Genres der Popmusik der letzten 40 Jahre. Es ist ausdrucksstark, da es eine breite Palette von Emotionen zeigt, obwohl sie tendenziell zur dunkleren Seite des Spektrums tendieren. Es ist vielfältig, da sich die Menschen sehr bald nach den Anfängen des Genres bewusst wurden, dass es eine echte Flexibilität hat, und begannen, sie auszunutzen, um ihr eigenes Subgenre zu erstellen, das dann von Sub-Sub-Genres gefolgt wurde, und die Kette reicht bis heute fort.\n\nHeute haben wir einen Punkt im Metal-Bewegung erreicht, an dem die vielen Nischen der Gruppen es schwierig machen, genau zu bestimmen, was Heavy Metal eigentlich ist. Es hat sich so viele Themen von anderen Genres aufgenommen, aber wie alles andere, hat es irgendwoher entstanden. Um das heutige Metal-Musik zu verstehen, muss man sich zuerst mit der Metal-Bewegung auseinandersetzen und überlegen, warum es eine Bewegung ist, und nicht einfach nur ein Genre.\n\nMetal ist in vielfältiger Hinsicht eine Bewegung, die durch Dunkelheit definiert ist. Metal kann als „ Musik mit mehr “ betrachtet werden – mehr Bass, mehr Lautstärke, mehr Gewalt, mehr Theatralik. Weniger Primitivität, mehr Finesse; die Leute in Metal-Bands wissen wirklich, wie man ein Instrument spielen muss, und es kommt durch in der Musik. Metal ist auch – obwohl es vielleicht nicht überraschen sollte – eine Bewegung, die stark von Drogen beeinflusst ist. Es gab einen psychedelischen Drogenboom in den späten 70er Jahren, der zu Menschen führte, die verrückter wurden, was sie dazu antrieb, verrückte, außerirdische Platten zu machen, die Drogen als Vorwand für ihre Schaffenskraft nutzend. Es besitzt viele dunkle, viszerale Qualitäten, die für die Musikszene neu waren, da ein großer Teil der populären Musik Qualitäten hatte, die sich nicht an der dunkleren Seite des emotionalen Spektrums orientierten. Späteren Generationen von Metal schenkten einige ihrer Einflüsse aus der dunklen, viszeralen Qualität, die so präsent waren in der Romantik. Texte wie folgende drücken die Dunkelheit aus, die ein solcher Eckpfeiler der Bewegung ist: (Byrne)\n\nDie von Helter Skelter abgelehnten Texte von Lennon-McCartney zeigen die dunklere Seite der Beatles. Sie zeigen ein Auf- und Ab, das angeblich von Drogen herrührt. Dieser Song gilt bei einigen als einer der ersten Heavy Metal-Songs. Er war eine Antwort auf einen Rolling-Stones-Song, der auch auf der dunkleren, härteren Seite stand. Die Beatles wollten beweisen, dass sie so schwer sein konnten wie die Stones, also legten sie diese Nummer auf The White Album.\n\n[REWRITE]\nThe classification of popular music has undergone significant changes over the last 100 years and now encompasses so many genres that it is difficult to list them all. The situation is complicated by the fact that many, if not all, genres – such as rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk – have spawned multiple sub and sub-genres. Heavy metal rock is considered one of the most diverse and expressive genres of popular music in the last 40 years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions, although they tend to lean towards the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that people quickly realized that it had real flexibility and started to use it to create their own sub-genres, which was then followed by sub-sub-genres, and this chain continues to this day.\n\nToday, we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where the many niches of groups make it difficult to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has incorporated so many themes from other genres, but like everything else, it originated from somewhere. In order to understand the metal music that exists today, one must first understand the metal movement and why it is a movement rather than just a genre.\n\nMetal is, in many ways, a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered \"music with more\" – more bass, more volume, more violence, more theatricality. Less primitivism, more finesse; people in metal bands really know how to play their instruments, and it comes through in the music. Metal is also – although it may not be surprising – a movement heavily influenced by drugs. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the late 1970s that led to people becoming crazier, which led them to make crazy, otherworldly records, using drugs as an excuse for their creativity.

The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",

    "raw_output": "German translation of the original text:\n\nEinige Jahrzehnte bevor sich die Surrealisten um ihre traumhaften Werke bemühten, schuf der Künstler Henri Rousseau seine eigenen Träume, wörtlich und metaphorisch. Die Träne, ein 1910 von dem berühmten Post-Impressionisten gemaltes Gemälde, stellt nicht nur eine Frau dar, die in Bewunderung vor den Wundern der Welt steht, in die sie in einem Traum eintaucht, sondern auch Rousseaus eigene Träume und Ziele als Künstler. Seit Beginn seiner Arbeit träumte er von Anerkennung, Akzeptanz und Lob durch andere Künstler und Kunsthistoriker und fand sich vor einer schwierigen inneren Dilemmata, dies zu erreichen. Die Träne ist das Werk, mit dem Henri Rousseau seine langjährige innerliche Auseinandersetzung am besten widerspiegelt: entweder sich an bestimmten Stile der Malerei anzupassen, um von der kritischen Kunstwelt, die er so bewunderte, angenommen zu werden, oder sich kreativ unabhängig und einzigartig zu fühlen, seinen eigenen Weg zu gehen.\n\nBevor man Die Träne unter dieser Perspektive analysieren kann, muss man sich zunächst mit der biografischen Geschichte Rousseaus vertraut machen. Henri Rousseau wurde am 21. Mai 1844 in der Stadt Laval im Nordwesten Frankreichs geboren. Sein Vater war Schmied und Händler, der \"bourgeois Prosperität\" genoss (Shattuck 47). Im Wachsen auf erhielt er keine formelle Ausbildung in den Künsten; stattdessen war er bis zum Alter von 40 Jahren für Frankreich als Gabelou, oder Mitarbeiter der kommunalen Zollabfertigung, tätig, obwohl er den Fehlurteil sobriquet douanier, Zollinspektor, erhielt (Shattuck 46). Der Tod seiner ersten Frau Clémence, der der Tod von acht Säuglingskindern folgte, hinterließ Rousseau nur noch seine Tochter Julia und eine immense Trauer (Shattuck 49). Er hoffte daher, in einem neuen Leben Zuflucht zu finden und suchte Trost in der Malerei, um ein neues Beginn zu finden. Anders als die zeitgenössischen Kollegen Rousseaus, die den Bauern in der Malerei sentimentalisierten und romantisierten, ist er in Wirklichkeit ein Volksmaler und hat die Hoffnungen und Träume des durchschnittlichen Mitglieds seiner Klasse.\n\nRousseaus Obsession mit der Akzeptanz in der Kunstwelt ist im Kontext einigermaßen verständlich, wenn man sich die Gesichtspunkte ansieht: wie besprochen, war er nicht nur in der formellen Malerei ungebildet und begann seine Karriere mit einem viel älteren Alter, aber er produzierte Werke in der gleichen Zeit wie viele andere talentierte und besser bekannte moderne Künstler. Auch wenn er bereits für viele Jahre tätig war, erhielt Rousseau erst um die gleiche Zeit, als Matisse eine Reputation als Künstler aufbaute, nötige Anerkennung für sein Kunstwerk. In dem Buch Modern French Painters, behauptet Autor Jan Gordon, dass die beiden, obwohl sie in der Kunstwelt als Konkurrenten galten, nicht nur in Stil und Gegenstand unterschiedlich waren, sondern auch ihre Gründe, um im ersten Mal zu malen: \"Matisse war ein Maler, der eine Angst vor der trivialen Malerei hatte, während Rousseaus Wunsch war, ein Bild zu malen, das so konventionell war, dass er in die Association des artiste français aufgenommen wurde\" (92).\n\nEnglish translation back to the original text:\n\n[REWRITE] A few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively.

    "raw_output": "German translation of the original text:\n\nViele großartige Denker haben eine enge Verbindung zwischen Ethik und Ästhetik, zwischen Wahrheit und Schönheit, postuliert. Ich glaube, dass es an einer grundlegenden Ebene einen Grund dafür gibt. Wie John Keats in \"Ode an ein griechisches Urn\" sagt, \"Schönheit ist Wahrheit, Wahrheit Schönheit. Das ist alles, was ihr auf Erden wisst, und alles, was ihr wissen müsst.\" Viele Dinge, die wir im Leben wissen, lernen wir durch Bildung oder Erfahrung. Wir scheinen jedoch die Ästhetik und die Ethik, wie Keats andeutet, ohne diese erwarteten Wege zu lernen, zu schätzen. Beide Ethik und Ästhetik sind ein Versuch, sie zu beschreiben, anstatt zu verbieten. Unsere Studien über Moralität und Schönheit sind größtenteils Versuche, zu erklären, warum ein Kunstwerk oder eine Literaturstück schön ist, oder warum eine Handlung moralisch ist, anstatt eine Reihe von Regeln für die Bewertung oder die Schaffung von gutem Kunst oder moralischem Verhalten.\n\nMehr zur Sache, Kritik an Kunst oder Moral kann niemals die Essenz dessen, was gut ist oder was schön ist, vollständig erfassen. Eine Diskussion über den Wert von Da Vincis Mona Lisa mag sich um Konzepte wie Vordergrund, Hintergrund, Kontrast oder kultureller Kontext drehen, aber am Ende beschreiben diese nicht, warum es gute Kunst ist. Wenn man jedoch nach einem Lieblingswerk der Kunst oder Literatur gefragt wird, ist es üblich, eine Phrase wie \"Es gibt einfach etwas daran\" zu hören, gefolgt von einer komplexeren oder kritischeren Erklärung. Ich glaube, dass beide Kunst und Moral niemals vollständig auf ihre Eigenschaften reduziert werden können. Wie Flannery O'Connor sagt, \"Ein Roman ist eine Möglichkeit, etwas zu sagen, das man auf keine andere Weise sagen kann. . . . Man erzählt eine Geschichte, weil eine Aussage unzureichend wäre.\" Unabhängig davon, wie vollständig wir die Eigenschaften eines literarischen Werks beschreiben, bleibt etwas Transzendentes zurück. Ich glaube, dass die Ethik dieselbe Eigenschaft hat. Wie Wittgenstein sagt, \"Es ist klar, dass die Ethik nicht ausgedrückt werden kann. / Die Ethik ist transzendental. / Ich schlage vor, dass es dieses \"Etwas\", dieser je ne sais quoi, ist, was Kunst und Moral ihr mächtigstes Attribut ist, und dass diese transzendentalen Natur von Ethik und Ästhetik einen Verbindungsdruckpunkt zwischen ihnen bietet.\n\nIch glaube, dass Moralität und Kunst so eng zusammenhängen, weil wir beide von ihnen am stärksten auf einer noumenalen Ebene erleben, wie man es mit einem kantianischen Begriff ausdrücken kann. Sie wirken auf uns auf einer Ebene, die erfahren werden kann, aber nicht vollständig erklärt werden kann. Dieser Zusammenhang ist sogar stärker, wenn es um die Kunst der Literatur geht. Wie McKean sagt, \"Was am meisten die Literatur von den anderen Künsten unterscheidet, was es in Wahrheit einzigartig an der Kunst ist, ist ihre moralische Qualität. Vielleicht sind moralische Standards für andere Künste unangemessen, wie Musik beispielsweise, aber sie scheinen für die Literatur genauso relevant zu sein wie für das Leben selbst. Leben bedeutet notwendigerweise Werte. . . . Die Literatur ist uns genau deshalb wichtig, weil wir dort die Werte finden, die wir brauchen.\"\n\nEnglish translation of the German text:\n\n[REWRITE] Many a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty.

    "original": "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",

Die gleiche Kultur kann man von Köln am Rhein, durch das Zentrum Deutschlands bis zur sächsischen Stadt Dresden am Elbe spüren. Mit einer so einzigartigen Kultur sollte es nicht überraschen, dass Deutschland wie wir es heute kennen, aus mehreren verschiedenen Quellen und Stämmen stammt.\n\nGermania ist das ursprüngliche Land der Deutschen. Die Herkunft des Namens ist unter Scholaren und Historikern stark umstritten. Tacitus behauptete, dass der Name von einem germanischen Stamm kam, der damals als Tungrier bekannt war, und dass sie vorher als Deutsche bekannt waren, bevor sie den Rhein überschritten und sich mit den gallischen Kräften auseinandergesetzt haben (Tacitus, 98). Julius Cäsar verwendete zum ersten Mal das Wort \"Germanus\" in seinerCommentar über die gallischen Kriege, in dem er die Gallier besiegt und mit germanischen Stämmen umkämpft hat, die öfter unter falschen Voraussetzungen den Rhein überschritten. Er nahm dieses Wort von den Galliern selbst und verwendete es, um zwischen denen zu unterscheiden, die er besiegt hatte (die Gallier) und die, die er noch nicht besiegt hatte. Während die Herkunft unsicher ist, glauben einige, dass es sich um einen Nachbarn in der gallischen Sprache handelte. Im ersten Kapitel seines ersten Buches über diese Kriege schreibt Julius Cäsar: \"Die Germanen, die jenseits des Rheins wohnen, mit denen sie (die Gallier) ständig Krieg führen..... Sie streiten mit den Germanen in fast täglichen Schlachten.\" (Julius Cäsar, 50-40 v. Chr.) Andere behaupten, dass der Name von dem Speer kommt, der in Kriegen verwendet wurde, bekannt als Ger (O.E.D, 2010), oder vielleicht von dem altirischen Wort garim, das \"schreien\" oder \"screamen\" bedeutet, was darauf hinweist, dass die Deutschen laut oder störend waren.\n\nDer frühe römische Historiker Tacitus hat in seinem im Jahr 98 geschriebenen \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" festgehalten, in dem er von den Ursprüngen der Germanen erzählte, dass \"Ich sie als ursprünglich und nicht mit anderen Rassen durch Einwanderung oder Kontakt vermischte betrachten würde. Denn in früheren Zeiten kamen diejenigen, die emigrieren wollten, nicht per Landweg, sondern auf Schiffen an..... Wer würde aus Asien oder Afrika nach Italien nach Deutschland mit seinen wilden Landschaften, seinen rauhen Himmeln, seinen störrischen Sitten und Äußerungen, es sei denn, es wäre sein Zuhause?(SIC)\" (Tacitus, 98)\n\nUnd wer würde aus Rom nach Germania gehen? Bestimmt nicht die Römer, jedenfalls noch nicht. Sie würden ihre Eroberungen in die Länder von Germania senden, um Güter zu erwerben und gelegentlich eine Feldzüge führen, aber am Ende kehrten sie meistens zurück nach Hause in ihr gewaltiges Reich. So wie die germanischen Stämme in der Mitte des ersten Jahrhunderts auftauchten, lebten sie am Rand des römischen Reiches und handelten mit ihren Gütern, die sie von der Landschaft gewonnen hatten, und ihren Fähigkeiten, indem sie in den Reihen der römischen Armee dienten, (Ozment, 2005 S. 17.)\n\nEnglish Translation:\n\n[REWRITE] Germany today is considered a strong force, a united nation with its own cultural influences within the shadows of the Alps in Munich, all the way to the Baltic sea city of Kiel.

With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that the Germany we know today comes from several different sources and tribes.\n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians.  Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98).

Ohne Emotionen, still, mit einer geübten Wahrnehmung, die zwar das Objekt der Untersuchung studierte, aber sich weigerte, es mit einem abstrakten Verständnis in Verbindung zu bringen, das mein Geist analysierte das Bild vor meinen Augen. Gedanken glitten in mein Gehirn ein und wieder heraus, fast schneller als sie erschienen. Meine Bewusstsein arbeitete so reibungslos und sauber, dass es schien, als hätte ich keine richtigen Gedanken von selbst, sondern nur eine aktive und flüssige Erfahrung von dem, was ich sah.\n\nAls ich von einem Künstler, mit dem ich gearbeitet habe, beraten wurde, kaufte ich ein Kunstlehrbuch namens \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\". Ich wollte schon seit ich sechs Jahre alt war, lernen, wie man malt, und dieses Buch unterrichtet alles von der Verständigung von einem Bleistift bis hin zu den Prozessen, die das Gehirn verwendet, um Linien zu interpretieren. Eine Technik, die das Buch lehrt, ist es, ein Quadratrahmen um jedes Bild zu platzieren, das der Künstler untersuchen möchte. So verwandelt sich ein überwältigend detailliertes Bild, zum Beispiel eine Schüssel mit Früchten auf einem Tisch, der sich in einer Küche befindet und an einen Esszimmer angrenzt, in ein leicht erfassbares Bild, diese Schüssel mit Früchten auf einer einfachen Ebene.\n\nIn diesem Moment, als ich mich auf die Schüssel vor mir konzentrierte, konnte ich die Künstlerrahmen nicht mental projizieren. Ich war so überwältigt, so fasziniert, dass ich nur stehen und staunen konnte. Picasso ging durch seine blaue Phase, Monet liebte das Grüne, italienische Renaissance-Meister zeigten ein Regenbogen an Farben. Wenn ich irgendeine Vorstellung hatte, meine Perspektive als würdig der Titel Künstler zu bezeichnen, dann lagen vor mir die Anfänge meiner Bilder, der Beginn meiner Geschichte, \"Work in Brown\".\n\nFingertippen berührten mein gewähltes Werkzeug der Künstler, Muskeln spannten und lockerten sich, während meine Hand durch den Raum ging, die Willenskraft meines Geistes fand Gestalt und Form in dem, was der kreativste Moment meines Lebens hätte sein können. Wasser schwirrte, ruhig und glatt, kristallklar und sauber. Flocken von Materie brachen sich vom Ganzen los und wurden von nichts geführt. Muskeln spannten sich, zuckten und zuckten ein bisschen schneller und unruhiger die zweite Zeit, meine Hand schlug den Griff des Toilettensitzlöffelns nochmals. Das störende braune Paket weigerte sich, sich zu bewegen, blockierte sich wie ein Schneckengang auf dem Boden der Toilette.\n\nMop in der Hand, Füße ein Fuß voneinander entfernt, grüner Schlips um den Hals geflochten, kniff ich mich leicht zusammen, während ich auf die rüde Bündel verarbeiteter Tier- und Pflanzenmaterialien starrte, das jemand als Botschaft für die Säuberer der Badezimmer von Rite Aid hinterlassen hatte. Ein paar weitere Züge des Toilettenspülens, ein paar weitere ruhige, introspektive Momente für mich selbst, dann bewegte sich meine Hand, um das Ende des Toilettenpapiers an der Wand rechts zu packen und begann daran zu knüllen, bis es sich einem Ofenhandtuch ähnlich sah. Aufrecht stehend, dann nach vorne gebeugt, tauchte meine Hand langsam in die Schüssel, wie eine Mutter, die sich in den Ofen begibt, um den Truthahn zum Thanksgiving zu rösten….\n\nEnglish translation back to the original text (with slight variations):\n\n[REWRITE]Downwards I stared, my mind blank and comprehending the scene in front of me.

Mehrere Faktoren kommen zusammen, um dieses tödliche Statistik-Vektor für die jüngsten amerikanischen Fahrer zu schaffen.  Die National Institutes of Health erklären, dass ein Aspekt des Problems darin besteht, dass das Teenagerhirn tatsächlich nicht bereit ist für die Gefahren des Fahrens. Einfache Erfahrunglosigkeit liegt auch am Herzen des Problems. Diese Erfahrunglosigkeit verursacht nicht nur mehr tödliche Unfälle, sondern auch eine höhere Rate von Fahrzeugumstürzen, Geschwindigkeitsüberschreitungen und Abkommen der Straße.  \nDie Teenager fahren auch viel schlechter, wenn sie mit ihren Peers reisen – was jeder, der ein bisschen Gespenstisches weiß, weiß, dass sie auf regelmäßiger Basis tun.  Das Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center hat eine Studie durchgeführt, die folgende Korrelation zeigte: zwischen dem Alter des Passagiers und der Anzahl der verkehrsunfälle, die vorkamen.\n\tKalifornien und andere Staaten haben versucht, die Sicherheit der jungen Fahrer zu erhöhen, indem sie temporäre provisorische Lizenzen erfordern, die die Fahrzeiten der Teenager begrenzen und andere Minderjährige als Passagiere verbieten.\n\tAber provisorische Fahrerlizenzen sind meiner Meinung nach palliative Maßnahmen.  Das wahre Thema ist, dass – als Gruppe – die jüngsten Fahrer, nach allen statistischen Markern, einfach nicht in der Lage sind, die Risiken und Verantwortlichkeiten adäquat zu bewältigen.  Der Psychologe Marvin Zuckerman glaubt, dass selbst 18 zu jung für eine feste Fahrerlizenz ist.  USA Today berichtet, dass Zuckerman Forschungen durchgeführt hat, die nahelegen, dass ein gemeinsamer Wunsch unter denen unter 19-20 Jahren besteht, Risiken zu nehmen für die reinen Thrillsensation.  Es geht dann einleuchtend, das Fahren zu verzögern, bis die Neigung zu Thrillsuchern abgeebbt ist.  Wenn wir weiterhin Fahrerlizenzen an jungen Teenagern ausstellen, werden wir nicht nur weiterhin tödliche Unfälle sehen, sondern der Todeszähler wird wahrscheinlich in den nächsten Jahren zu schockierenden Verhältnissen anwachsen.  Bis 2010 werden die Babies der Baby-Boomer fahren und Millionen von neuen Teenagern werden bereit sein, die Straße zu betreten.  \nGesetze dieses Themas hätten verständlicherweise eine direkte und offene Lösung.  Schulen könnten weiterhin Fahrerprüfungen anbieten, um den Lernprozess für zukünftige Fahrer zu beginnen, aber niemand unter 18 Jahren könnte ein Kraftfahrzeug bedienen.  Ein provisorisches Führerschein könnte noch vor der Verleihung einer festen Fahrerlizenz ausgestellt werden und eine bestimmte Anzahl an praktischen Fahrtrainingseinheiten wäre noch erforderlich.  Die spezifische Anzahl der erforderlichen Stunden könnte auf die von der Mehrheit der Staaten bereits erforderlichen Stunden basieren (in Kalifornien zum Beispiel ist derzeit diese Zahl 6 Stunden Fahrpraxis und 50 Stunden Übung mit einem Erwachsenen.)  Da die tödlichen Statistiken für Jugendliche aus einer Streichprobe aller Staaten kommen, wäre ein einheitliches, nationales Gesetzgebungsvorschlag auf dieses Thema ein vernünftiger – und ich glaube, effektiver – Weg, um Jugendliche auf nationaler Ebene zu schützen. \nDas Gesetzesvorschlag, den ich machen möchte, ist in keiner Weise ein neues Konzept.\n\nTranslation from German back to English:\n[REWRITE] Teenagers are dying behind the wheel.

The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\nCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\nBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures. The real issue is that – as a group – the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license. USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation. It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out. If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years. By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward. Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle. A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well. The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.) Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable – and I believe effective – means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.",

Diese Filme nutzen im Allgemeinen kreative Schnitttechniken, um Illusionen zu erzeugen. Meine Filmstudie beschäftigte sich hauptsächlich mit der Beschreibung der Poetik der meisten Trickfilme und der Untersuchung der evolutionären Merkmale, die in einigen der späteren Filme vorhanden sind. Im Wesentlichen ist der Trickfilm am Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts eingebunden, in einem Frontalprospekt verfasst, verwendet keine Kamerabewegung, verwendet lange und mittlere Shots und hält sich an die strikte Methode eines Shots = eines Filmes. Allerdings gibt es einige Filme am Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts, die diese Richtlinien durchbrechen, indem sie Aspekte wie mehrere Shots einführen.\n\nEines der auffälligsten Aspekte, die die Trickfilme gemeinsam haben, ist ihre Aufzeichnung in einer inneren Bühne innerhalb des Rahmens eines Frontalprospekts. Die Kamera bewegt sich nicht aus ihrer Prospektposition aus, um Figuren oder Objekte zu verfolgen. Diese Komposition war sehr gängig in den frühen Filmen und zog ihre Wurzeln vom Theater und, für Trickfilme, von Vaudeville und Zaubershow. Eine der Einschränkungen, die mit der Verwendung der Bühne verbunden sind, ist, dass Figuren in Trickfilmen im Allgemeinen nur seitlich bewegen und nicht in Richtung oder von der Kamera weg gehen. Nehmen Sie zum Beispiel die Aktion im Film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). Die Schauspieler treten von der rechten Seite ein und bewegen sich entlang der horizontalen Achse hin und her. Selbst wenn sie aus dem Bild rausgehen, folgt die Kamera ihnen nicht.\n\nDie Frontalprospekt-Komposition bedeutet, dass Shots tendenziell lange Shots und, seltener, mittlere Shots sind. Rundumschüsse kommen in keinem der Trickfilme aus dem Edison-Katalog vor. Dies leitet sich aus der Theater- und Vaudeville-Tradition ab, in der das Publikum die gesamte Aufführung zu jeder gegebenen Zeit sieht, wie von den Grenzen der Bühne umrahmt. Wie in den meisten frühen Filmen bewegen sich die Schauspieler nicht vom Mittelgrund zur Kamera, daher treten Rundumschüsse nie auf.\n\nIm Allgemeinen folgen die meisten frühen Trickfilme dem Muster, dass ein konzeptioneller Shot einem Film entspricht. Dies beschränkt die Länge der meisten Trickfilme auf etwa eine Minute oder weniger, je nach verwendeten Frames pro Sekunde. Es beschränkt auch die dramatische oder narrative Verwendung der Trickfilme; die meisten von ihnen konzentrieren sich auf kurze Vaudeville-Stile- Tricks, wie Magie, Verschwinden und Tauschhandlungen mit wenig Geschichte. Beachten Sie jedoch, dass in einem Trickfilm ein konzeptioneller Shot in den Augen des Zuschauers nicht tatsächlich einem körperlichen Shot entspricht. Ein einzelner \"Shot\" kann tatsächlich mehrere zusammengefügte aufeinanderfolgende Shots sein, um die Illusion von Erscheinung oder Verschwinden zu erzeugen. Schauen Sie sich zum Beispiel den Film The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), einen der früheren Trickfilme, genauer an. Eine gründliche Überprüfung enthüllt den Moment, an dem der körperliche Shot mit Mariens \"abgetrenntem\" \"Kopf\" beginnt, obwohl der gesamte Film im Auge des Zuschauers konzeptionell einer Shot entspricht.\n\nEnglish translation:\n\n[REWRITE] Reviewing the Library of Congress's library of early Edison films, I decided to watch all the trick films, of which there were 15 from 1895 to 1901.

Obwohl er hauptsächlich als Agronom tätig war,  schuf seine Laufbahn in der Politik und seine Berufung als Landwirt einen Mann, der für seine Hingabe und Offenheit in Angelegenheiten der persönlichen Freiheit und der Regierung bekannt war.  Seine Hingabe an ein agrarisches System war der Grund für fast alle seine Meinungen über die Regierung.  Sein Bestreben, das Erhaltung und Förderung dessen zu ermöglichen, was er für die beste aller Berufe hielt, färbte seine Argumente in Bezug auf Souveränität, Staatsrecht und sogar das Gerichtswesen ein.\n \n John Taylor glaubte, dass die Vereinigten Staaten eine großartige Gelegenheit hatten, ein ideales System zu schaffen, da keine natürliche Tradition die Schöpfer der Regierung behinderte, was es ermöglichte, ein System der Selbstverwaltung zu gründen.  Er glaubte stark an die natürlichen Rechte des Menschen und an die Tatsache, dass sie miteinander vernetzt sind - was bedeutet, dass, wenn eines verwehrt wird, sie alle versagen und der Wert der verbleibenden geringer wird.  Diese Rechte sollten also außer Reichweite der Regierung liegen.  Er behauptete, dass das, was man den „Zustand der Natur“ nannte, bedeutete, dass jene mit körperlicher Stärke und bösartiger Intelligenz profitierten, aber dass in einer Zivilisation so nicht sein sollte.\n \n Zum Schaffen dieser idealen Gesellschaft glaubte Taylor, dass eine Regierung geschaffen werden musste, die die inhärenten Guten und Bösen in der Menschheit berücksichtigt.  Taylor war sehr rigide in seinen Meinungen über eine dualistische Moral.  Er behauptete, dass „Wie die Regierung von Menschen ausgeübt wird, sind alle ihre Tugenden und Laster menschlich“ (Ibid., S. 167).  Er definierte gute Prinzipien als solche, die das private Eigentum schützen, die Landwirtschaft verbessern und Kapitalismus diskriminieren, und glaubte, dass eine Regierung, die auf guten Prinzipien gegründet ist, unabhängig von ihrer Verwaltung gleichmäßig funktionieren würde, was unweigerlich von Avarice und Eigeninteresse geleitet wird.  Eigeninteresse glaubte er, sei die Motivation in allen Dingen, aber dass die Eigenschaft nur als böse betrachtet wird, wenn sie über die Schaffung einer Gesellschaft auf der Grundlage des öffentlichen Wohls hinausgeht, um Subgesellschaften, die auf Kosten anderer leben, zu schaffen.  Eine gute Regierung war notwendig, um die natürliche Böseheit des Menschen aufrechtzuerhalten, und auch dann muss sie unter sorgfältiger Beobachtung stehen, um die Aufnahme von schlechten Prinzipien zu vermeiden.\n \n Taylor, wie viele andere strenge Republikaner seiner Zeit, forderte eine strengere Auslegung der Verfassung.  Er wollte eine extrem begrenzte Bundesregierung mit keinem mehr Recht oder Macht, als vom Verfassungstext ausdrücklich angegeben war.  Er wusste, dass eine umfassende Bundesregierung teuer war und daher wahrscheinlich despotisch war.  Er glaubte jedoch, dass eine einfache, wörtliche Auslegung gefährlich war und ohne Berücksichtigung der Absicht der Verfasser so leicht korrupt werden könnte.  Er sah die Erklärung der Unabhängigkeit sogar als wahre Charta der Vereinigten Staaten an, weil sie die Länder ausdrücklich als souveräne Staaten und nicht als eine Nation beschrieb.\n\n[REWRITE] John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.

That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project.

Das war ein bisschen entmutigend, und es ist schwer zu sagen, warum das passiert sein könnte. Mit dem Einsetzen des Winters auf einem Campus in New England gibt es eindeutig einen Rückgang bei der Mobilität zu Fuß oder auf dem Fahrrad, was möglicherweise einen Teil des Rückgangs erklären könnte. Dezember markiert auch das Ende des Herbstsemesters, als jeder sehr beschäftigt ist, sein Schulleben zu beenden, die Noten zu verarbeiten und so weiter. Die Abgabe des Pendler-Logs ist für viele einfach möglicherweise aus dem Visier geraten. Darüber hinaus bringt Dezember auch den Beginn der besinnlichen Zeit und den sich daraus ergebenden einmonatigen Pausen für Studierende und Fakultäten, während derer viele gar nicht mehr auf den Campus kommen müssen. Die Kurse beginnen dann im späten Januar für das Frühjahrssemester, vielleicht auch eine Klaue zum niedrigen Anzahl Einreichungen für diesen Monat. Aber das erklärt den niedrigen Anzahl Einreichungen für Februar nicht wirklich. Es ist auch möglich, dass jede solche Art von Projekt anfangs einen Anfangsschub an Energie und Begeisterung haben wird, der dann natürlich nachlässt. Um diese Tendenz zu bekämpfen, haben wir den Carpool Challenge Week, eine spezielle Blitzkampagne im März, geschaffen, um die Initiative zu revitalisieren, wodurch sich die Anzahl der Einreichungen für den Monat erhöhte. So war also eines der Herausforderungen, die wir erlebt haben, wie den Projektpuls in beiden Fällen zu erhalten: einerseits natürlich die natürliche Abnahme der Beteiligung, andererseits speziell die Probleme der Ferien und Semesterpausen in der Hochschulbildung.\n\nEine Herausforderung für dieses Projekt (oder jede alternative Fahrtprojekt) ist schlicht die Tatsache, dass Menschen die Freiheit, Unabhängigkeit und Flexibilität beim Fahren ihrer Autos genießen. Das ist tief in unserer Kultur verankert. Es ist daher wichtig, Anreize für die Teilnahme an alternativen Verkehrsmöglichkeiten zu bieten. Wir haben viel Geldgeschenkkarten an lokale Restaurants, Kaffeebar, Massage-Therapeuten, die lokale unabhängige Buchhandlung und sogar einige größere nationalen Kettenhändler verteilt. Es wäre jedoch interessant gewesen zu sehen, wie manche sogar größere Preise die Teilnahme beeinflusst hätten – wie zum Beispiel das Gewinnen eines schönen Fahrrads, eines Hybridfahrzeugs oder eines Elektrofahrzeugs. Das hätte auch geholfen, die Abnahme der Beteiligung zu bekämpfen, gegen die das Projekt anging. Die Art der Preise änderte sich während des Projekts nicht wirklich. Wenn die Preise jedoch im Laufe des Projekts an Wert zunimmt, könnte das geholfen haben. Die Geldgeschenkkarten schienen zum Beginn des Projekts ausreichend zu sein, aber wenn wir Anfang Dezember die Zusatz eines Paar Fahrräder angekündigt hätten, und dann im Januar die Zusatz eines Hybrid- oder Elektrofahrzeugs, kann man nur denken, dass die Teilnahme und Beteiligung stattdessen gestiegen wären, anstatt abzunehmen.\n\nEnglish translation:\n[REWRITE] Referring back to Figure 17, there was a significant drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project.

That was a bit disheartening, and it's hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there's obviously a drop in mobility on foot or by bike, which might explain some part of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy wrapping up school life, processing grades, and so on. Filling out the commuter log might simply have slipped off the radar screen for many people. Furthermore, December brings the onset of the holiday season and the resulting one-month break for students and faculty, during which time many don't even need to come to the campus at all. Classes then resume in late January for the spring semester, perhaps also a clue to the low number of submissions for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. It's also possible that any project of this kind will have an initial surge of energy and enthusiasm at the outset, which then naturally tapers off. To combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to revitalize the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. So one of the challenges we faced was how to maintain project momentum in both cases: on the one hand, the natural decrease in engagement, and on the other hand, specifically the problems of holiday and semester breaks in higher education.\n\nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply ingrained in our culture. It's therefore essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of transportation. We distributed a lot of gift cards to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as winning a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to counter the drop in engagement that the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn't really change during the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.",

Ein ETF bietet Ihnen die Diversifikation eines Indexfonds und die Vorteile des Einzelaktienbesitzes wie die Möglichkeit, kurz zu verkaufen, auf Leverage zu kaufen und bei jeder Transaktion so wenige wie ein Anteil zu kaufen.  Obwohl diese Vorteile sehr attraktiv sind, sind die Ausgabenquoten der ETFs weit niedriger als die der durchschnittlichen Fondssparpläne.  Leider gibt es auch einige Nachteile, wie etwa die Notwendigkeit, eine Vermittlungsgebühr für jeden Handel mit ETFs zu zahlen, genauso wie Sie auf einem Aktienkauf.  Ein weiterer Vorteil der ETFs ist die breite Palette an Fonds, die verfügbar sind.  Obwohl diese Vorteile klar dargelegt sind, ist es immer eine gute Übung für den sachkundigen Finanzinvestor, zu prüfen, ob die genannten Vorteile, wie Diversifikation, tatsächlich existieren und in welchem Umfang sie existieren.  Für die Zwecke dieses Unterfangens werden wir das ETF IHF untersuchen und es mit den Top 10-Haltungen vergleichen, die das ETF umfassen, um zu bestimmen, ob die Vorteile des Besitzes eines einzelnen ETF den Vorteilen eines diversifizierten Portfolios aus zehn Aktien nahe kommen und ob es bessere Konfigurationen der gleichen Aktien gibt, die einen besseren optimalen Sharp-Ratio oder Rendite bieten.\nUm die ETF zu bewerten, würde es sich als sehr aufwendig erweisen, jede Position einzubeziehen, deshalb haben wir beschlossen, nur die Top 10-Haltungen zu berücksichtigen, die 63,58 % der gesamten Vermögenswerte des ETF ausmachen.  Hier sind die Top 10-Haltungen und der Prozentsatz der Gesamtvorderungen.\n\nUm einen Eindruck davon zu gewinnen, wie gut diese zehn Aktien das ETF IHF als Ganzes darstellen, können wir den aktuellen % der Vermögenswerte, normalisiert auf 100 %, verwenden, um die Beiträge jedes Aktien zu einem Portfolios Beta und Rendite zu berechnen, wenn das Portfolio vollständig aus den 10 Aktien besteht, in dem Verhältnis, in dem der ETF ihre Haltungen eingesetzt hat.  Die Berechnungen von Beta und Rendite sind im folgenden Diagramm enthalten.\n\nAus dem obigen Diagramm ist es offensichtlich, dass die Rendite eines Portfolios, das nur die Top 10-Haltungen enthält, 6,11 % höher ist als das ETF, ein Anstieg der Rendite um 16 %.  Es ist auch offensichtlich, dass das Beta der Top 10-Haltungen 0,12 niedriger ist als das ETF als Ganzes.  Aus den bislang erzielten Ergebnissen scheint ein Portfolio aus nur den Top 10-Haltungen eine höhere Rendite mit einem niedrigerem Beta bieten zu können.  Es besteht jedoch die Möglichkeit, dass die Mittelwerte dieser beiden Portfolios nicht statistisch voneinander verschieden sind.\nUm zu bewerten, ob diese Portfolios statistisch voneinander verschieden sind, wird die Standardabweichung jeder der Top 10-Aktien bestimmt und normalisiert auf 100 %, um ihre kumulierte Standardabweichung mit der des ETF IHF zu vergleichen.\n\nBack Translation:\n\n[REWRITE]An exchange-traded fund, or ETF, is a security designed to track an index, a commodity, or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.

In „Traumland“ verwendet Poe den Begriff „Thulé“ in den Zeilen 6 und 56, den Mabbott auf Virgil zurückführt. Virgil verwendete den Begriff in Bezug auf eine Insel nördlich von Großbritannien, die die Griechen für den Rand der bekannten Welt hielten. Es ist sicher, dass Virgil den Begriff verwendete, jedoch gibt es eine noch aktuellere Quelle, der man eine Mitschuld zu geben hat. Poe war sehr an deutschen Autoren interessiert.\n\nDiese Zitat ist wichtig, da es Poes Vertrautheit mit Gothes Schreiben zeigt. Karl J. Arndt, in seinem Buch Poe’s Politian und Goethe’s Mignon, kommentiert die Ähnlichkeit ihrer beiden Gedichte und zieht den Schluss, dass Poe Gothe nachahmte.\n\nOxford Companion to English Literature sagt über Gothe, dass er ein gefeierter Schreiber des poetischen Dramas Faust war, das in zwei Teilen veröffentlicht wurde, der erste im Jahr 1808 und der zweite im Jahr von Gothes Tod 1832. In den poetischen Versen des zweiten Teils von Faust liegt ein kurzes Gedicht mit dem Titel „Der König von Thulé“. Das Gedicht handelt von einem König, dessen Frau nachdem sie ihm ein Becher schenkt, stirbt. Nachdem seine Frau gestorben ist, beginnt er schwer zu trinken und zu weinen aus dem Gedächtnis seiner toten Königin. Er entscheidet dann, dass es Zeit ist für ihn zu sterben und gibt seinen Besitz an seine Kinder ab, mit Ausnahme des Bechers. Dann geht er zu einem Kliff, wirft den Becher in den Ozean, schließt die Augen und stirbt. Das Auftreten des Königs von Thule und die Beschreibung des Königs in Traumland sind sehr ähnlich, vielleicht ein dunkler Doppelgänger von Poes Verlust und Trinkkorb. Faust war auch in ein romantisches Drama von HP Grattan 1842 komponiert worden, was weniger als ein Jahr vor Poes Verwendung des Begriffs Thule in „The Pit and the Pendulum“.\nPoe verweist auf Thule zweimal in seinen gesammelten Schriften an. Einmal verweist Poe auf „ultma Thule“ in „The Pit and the Pendulum“, aber er verwendet diesen Ausdruck in „Traum-Land“ zweimal, als Buchenden für das Gedicht. „Der König von Thule“ und „Traumland“ können als Begleitstücke gelesen werden. In „Traumland“ sagt der Sprecher: „Er beschreibt dann die Landschaft von Thule und wie sie dunkel, einsam ist, er wird von toten Freunden heimgesucht und sieht eine schattige Welt ohne Farbe. Alles diese Szenen wären in „Der König von Thule“ von Gothe gelesen worden, da er seine Frau gerade verloren hat, ist einsam und hat seinen Willen, zu herrschen oder selbst zu leben, verloren. Das gesamte Gedicht ist eine Beschreibung, als ob der Sprecher in Goethes Gedicht eingetreten wäre.\nGothe war ein bedeutender Autor, den Poe kennen gelernt haben würde, wenn nicht aus Respekt für Tennyson. Poe hatte folgendes zu sagen, als er gefragt wurde, ob er Tennyson bewunderte.

To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

Vor Palmers Unfall waren fünf verschiedene Sturz-und-Fall-Vorfälle bei D&D in diesem Jahr 2009 gemeldet worden. Palmer klagt nun gegen D&D wegen Ersatz und Schmerzensgeld im Zusammenhang mit ihrer Verletzung und wir untersuchen, ob man einen Antrag auf partielle Zusammenfassung gegen den Schmerzensgeldanspruch stellen sollte.\n\nIn Kalifornien kann ein Kläger Schadensersatz und Schmerzensgeld für einen Vertragsbruch verlangen, der nicht aus einem Vertrag herrührt, wenn der Beklagte mit „Übergriff, Betrug oder Vorsatz“ gehandelt hat. Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294 (a) (Lexis 2010). Die Gesetzesdefinition von Vorsatz umfasst verabsäumte Handlungen, die darauf abzielten, Schaden zu verursachen, oder, im Falle der Absenz von Absicht, Handlungen, die „unwürdig“ und mit „einer bewussten Missachtung der Rechte oder Sicherheit anderer“ verbunden sind. id. bei § (c) (1). Gerichte haben die Handlungen als vorsätzliche bezeichnet, wenn sie mit einer bewussten Missachtung der Rechte des Klägers verbunden waren, wenn der Beklagte „wusste, dass die wahrscheinlichen gefährlichen Folgen seines Handelns, und dass er bewusst und willentlich darauf hingearbeitet hat, diese Folgen zu vermeiden.“ Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).\n\nEnglish translation back to the original text:\n\n[REWRITE] In California, a customer who was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store may be awarded compensatory and punitive damages if the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half hour because he was eating dinner.\n\nA judge is unlikely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer's punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified, a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant's actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer's accident; and despite this knowledge, he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer's argument that Martin's actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store.\n\nOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne, an employee of D&D Markets, informed his manager, Paul Martin, that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn't have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way. At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer's accident, five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D's in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damage claim.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that was intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff's rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

Einer der Hauptthemen, das in der Klasse heiß diskutiert wurde, war, ob der Islam eine feindselige Religion ist.  Ich glaube, dass die Frage sogar heute noch viel relevanter ist als je zuvor.  Wenn man sich zurück an die Ereignisse seit dem 11. September 2001 erinnert, habe ich als persönliche Beobachtung, dass die Massenmedien von einem feindseligen Verständnis des Islam und Extremismus zu einem Ausmaß der Toleranz gegenüber dem Islam in Amerika gegangen sind.  Ich denke, dass wir 2001 nie einen Präsidentschaftskandidaten mit dem Namen Barack Obama haben könnten, der eine offensichtliche muslimische Hintergrund in seiner Familie hat.\n\nDie Biografie des Propheten fasziniert mich, weil nach meiner Kenntnis der Geschichte von Muhammad widerspricht die Biografie dem Profil von Muhammad.  Aus dem, was ich weiß und in der Vergangenheit gelernt habe, habe ich gedacht, dass Muhammad Zwangsbekehrungen in den Islam erzwang.  Er würde Stämme erobern und übernehmen und dann forderte sie auf, den Islam anzunehmen.  Aber nach der Biografie war Muhammad als eine Art Märtyrer beschrieben, der missverstanden und sich selbst erniedrigte.  Nachdem dann kamen Menschen einzeln zu dem Schluss, dass in seinen Lehren die Wahrheit liegt und suchten ihn auf.\n \nAuch gibt es einige unheimliche Ähnlichkeiten zwischen den Missionen von Jesus und den \"Wundern\" von Muhammad.  Das offensichtlichste ist, als er Lamm und Milch nahm und es multiplizierte, so dass es für mehr als vierzig Männer genug gab.  Es ist dieser Stil der Schreibart, der mich davon überzeugt, dass die Autoren Muhammad als den bescheidenen Propheten darstellen wollten, der nicht beweisen musste, sondern einfach in der Wahrheit und Wundern lebte.  Dieser Art von Fehlschluss ist das Schlimmste, weil er die Wunder und das Leben von Jesus Christus herunterspielt.  Mir fällt auf, dass sie versuchen, zu stehlen und versuchen, die Person und das Leben von Jesus durch Muhammad zu übernehmen. \n \nEs gibt auch viele Geschichten in der Biografie, die es so erscheinen lassen, als gäbe es einen Teil ihres Programms, Beweise für \"Zeugen\" oder wie Menschen \"von selbst\" zum Islam konvertierten.  Aber das Problem ist, dass viele Geschichten zumindest aus einer dritten Parteiperspektive stammen.  Das heißt, in der Geschichte wird illustriert, dass er von so-und-so, der von so-und-so erzählt hat usw.  Ich mochte das nicht so sehr, weil ihr Ziel war, dass es Beweise für die Wahrheit der Geschichten bot, aber ich dachte, dass es die Geschichten verringerte und sie noch mehr verdächtig erscheinen ließ.\n \nIch denke, das, was mich am meisten über diese Arbeit beunruhigt, ist, dass sie versuchen, Muhammad als einen gottgeweihten Mann aufzuwerten und zu erheben, der bescheiden, liebenswürdig, weise und sanft war.  Aber die Geschichte widerspricht der Idee, dass Muhammad ein sanfter und bescheidener Mann war, und ich kann nicht umhin, mich zu wundern, ob Muslime heute das wahre Hintergrundgeschichte von Muhammads Aufstieg zur Macht kennen.\n\nHier ist die Übersetzung zurück ins Englisch:\n\n[REWRITE] Almost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.

If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.

Wenn man diese Geschichte in groben Zügen betrachtet, sieht man einen Trend, wie das Christentum von seinem Ursprung immer weiter weggeht. Es scheint, dass die heutige Welt eine wachsende Bewusstsein und einen unerreichten progressiven Trend zeigt.  Während traditionelle Leute noch übrig bleiben und sich jeder Art von Denken widerstehen, der über das gelehrt wurde, was ihnen beigebracht wurde, mögen diese Teile der Bevölkerung möglicherweise nicht prominent genug sein, um das Ganze zu beeinflussen.  Unter Christen wird in den kommenden Jahren eine historische Bewusstheit immens anwachsen.  Ein Verlangen wird sich verbreiten, die Lehren, die in das Christentum im Laufe der Zeit hineingefügt wurden, von der tatsächlichen Absicht der Religionsnamen zu unterscheiden.  Es möglicherweise dauert Jahrzehnte oder sogar Jahrhunderte, aber der Ausgang wird unvermeidlich sein:  Es wird eine große Wende in der Trend der christlichen Geschichte geben.  Es wird eine Fortschritt zurück zu seiner ursprünglichen Form geben.  Eine Bewegung wird wachsen, die Schichten von Lehren entfernen wird, eine nach der anderen, wie wenn die Uhr sich rückwärts bewegt, bis nichts mehr übrig ist, außer einer Vorstellung von dem, was Jesus der Menschheit überbracht, im Namen Gottes vor, als andere Denker solche Ansprüche machten.  Wenn dieser Trend durch die Vereinigten Staaten und Europa durchläuft und Massen in seinem Gefolge dazu bringt, wie wir zu der Zeit lebten, als Jesus lebte, nur seine Ideen zu folgen, bleibt die Kirche als Institution stark, um den Weg zu leiten.  Allerdings, weil der theologische Zeitmesser sich rückwärts bewegt hat, wird die extreme Ausbreitung der Vielfalt in Christendom in mehr und mehr Uniformität des Glaubens und der Praxis zurückkehren.  Zwischen Regionen, zwischen Bekenntnissen, zwischen Spaltungen aller Art sehen wir stattdessen anstelle von Unterschieden zunehmende Ähnlichkeiten.  Die menschliche Geschichte ist voller großer Wenden.  Ein Beispiel ist wie Christen zu einer Zeit verfolgt, ausgestoßen und getötet wurden vom römischen Reich.  Doch später wurde dieses Reich eine christliche Institution.  Unsere Nation ist von der afroamerikanischen Sklaverei zu afroamerikanischer Führung gekommen.  Die große Wende, die in unserer Zukunft zu erwarten ist, wird sich in dem Bereich der christlichen Religion abspielen, Geschichte aufzulösen, in der Suche nach der Quelle, und Vielfalt dabei aufzulösen.  Es ist entscheidend zu beachten, dass ein Teil davon machen wird, was diesen Prozess möglich macht, eine Methode, Jesu Worte als metaphorisch zu lesen, anstatt als wörtliche Aussagen.  Also, was ist es, was sich ereignet hat, seit Jesu Leben?\n\nWenn wir weit genug zurück in die Geschichte blicken, finden wir nur Judentum, das theologische Anfang für die christliche Religion.  Monotheismus, die Wahrnehmung einer göttlich offenbarten Religion, und die Autorität der hebräischen Schriften, waren allesamt im Kern der Religion, als die Römer Jerusalem im Jahr 63 v. Chr. übernahmen.  Die jüdische Bevölkerung teilte keinen Geist.  Sie spalteten sich in Sadduzäer, Phariser, Essener, Zeloten und die Mehrheit der gewöhnlichen Menschen auf.\n\nBack to English translation:\n\n[REWRITE] The teachings of Jesus and the convictions he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.

They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",

Sie kümmern sich nicht um die großen Rauchwolken, die aus den Fabriken aufsteigen, oder die Kot- und Harnabflüsse aus den Tausenden von Käfigen um Packingtown.\n\nDie Besitzer und Manager kümmerten sich auch nicht um ihre Angestellten, die für sie arbeiteten, um sie reich zu machen. Sie würden alles tun, um einen oder einen Dollar zu sparen, \"Vom oberen bis zum unteren ist der Ort einfach ein brodelnder Kessel von Neid und Hass; es gibt keine Loyalität oder Anständigkeit überall, es gibt keinen Ort, an dem ein Mann gegen einen Dollar gerechnet wird\". Sie zwangen ihre Angestellten, schreckliche Arbeitszeiten zu arbeiten und ohne vorherige Ankündigung legten sie viele Menschen gleichzeitig ohne Entschädigung oder Unterstützung bei einem Job los. Während der Epoche, in der \"Die Wildnis\" spielt, gab es wenige, wenn überhaupt, Gesetze oder Vorschriften, die die Arbeits- oder Lebenssicherheit der Arbeiter schützten. Dies erlaubte den Managern und Besitzern, wild drauf loszumachen, ihre Angestellten zum schnelleren Fortschritt zu zwingen und in katastrophalen Bedingungen zu arbeiten. Obwohl das Buch es nicht direkt sagt, wurden die Menschen, die in Packingtown lebten und sich selbst an die Arbeit und Umgebung totarbeiteten, einfach erwartet, mit den furchtbaren Bedingungen innerhalb und außerhalb der Fabriken fertig zu werden. Es gab keine Behörden oder Organisationen, die Informationen oder Hilfe für die Arbeiter anboten. Es gab Gewerkschaften, die jedoch oftmals eher schadeten als halfen, da sie Geld von den armen Arbeitern verdienten. Die Arbeiter wurden so schlecht behandelt und hatten keine Möglichkeit, dem System von Packingtown zu entkommen, daher wurden sie als Sklaven beschrieben, \"Hier ist eine Bevölkerung, die niedrigste Art und vorwiegend aus Ausländern besteht, die ständig am Rande des Hungertodes schwebt und ihre Chancen im Leben von der Laune von Männern abhängt, die genauso grausam und skrupellos sind wie die alten Zeiten der Sklavenhalter; unter solchen Umständen ist Unmoral genau so unvermeidlich und verbreitet, wie unter dem System der Sklavenhaltung.\"\n\nEnglish translation:\n\n[REWRITE] I believe that The Jungle shows how humans are naturally greedy and self-centered deep down inside. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower than themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The most obvious area is that of the owners and managers of the large factories. All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They don't care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass the great chimneys rose, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\", Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is causing. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They don't care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal waste and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \n\nThe owners and managers also didn't care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra dollar, \"From the top to the bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They forced their employees to work terrible hours and then without even a day's notice they might lay off multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in, there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers' safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"[/REWRITE]",

Einige dieser Techniken sind wirksamer als andere. F. Scott Fitzgerald verwendet viele dieser Techniken in seinem Roman The Great Gatsby. Manchmal kombiniert er ein Adjektiv mit einem Substantiv, das normalerweise nicht zusammenpasst, um den Lesern eine bestimmte Aura um ein Thema zu geben. Zu anderen Zeiten gibt er einem Symbol eine Bedeutung und verwendet es dann für denselben Zweck. \n\nFitzgerald verwendet diese letzte Technik mit vielen Farben, einschließlich Gold, Grün, Weiß/ Grau und Rot/Pink. In seinem Roman The Great Gatsby baut F. Scott Fitzgerald Bedeutung für Farben auf, insbesondere Weiß/Grau und Rot/Pink, und verwendet sie dann später, um den Lesern eine bestimmte Erinnerung an eine Gefühlslage um einen wichtigen Gegenstand herum zu vermitteln. \n\nDie Bedeutung, die Fitzgerald aufbaut und verwendet, für Weiß/Grau ist Uniformität, wobei Weiß ein bisschen nett und höher gestellt ist und Grau älter und fadenscheinig ist. Fitzgerald legt diese Bedeutung am Anfang des Romans fest, indem er beide ständig verwendet. Daisy und Jordan sind ständig \"in Weiß\" (8) - tatsächlich tragen alle immer Weiß: Nick trägt \"weiße Flanell\" (41) zu Gatsby's Party, Tom trägt ein \"weißes Hemd\" (36) bei seinem Treffen mit Myrtle und Catherine ist \"powdered milchig weiß\" (30). Tatsächlich sind die einzigen Zeit, an denen Menschen nicht in Weiß sind, wenn Nick seine Eindrücke von Gatsby's Party sammelt: \"die Hallen... sind farbenfroh mit Primärfarben\" (40). Fitzgerald definiert diese beiden Farben weiter, indem er sie viele alltägliches, unwichtiges Objekte in Farbe malen: wie Nick zum Arbeitsplatz geht, geht er \"die weißen Schluchten von New York\" (56) hinunter, die Namen der Leute bei Gatsby's Party heißen \"graue Namen\" (61) auf Nick's Zeitplan, Catherines Apartment ist \"eine Scheibe in einem langen Weißkuchen von Wohnhäusern\" - Uniformität (28). Er beschreibt auch einfache oder alltägliche Menschen oder Orte als Weiß oder Grau: Jordan und Daisy haben eine \"weiße Kindheit\" (19) gemeinsam, es gibt \"graue Autos\" und \"graue Landschaft\" (23) in der Ascheschlucht, der \"italienische Junge\" im Eisenbahnzug ist \"graue\" (26), und der Hundeverkäufer ist \"ein alter grauer Mann\" (27). Nachdem Fitzgerald genug Bedeutung an Weiß/Grau hinzugefügt hat, verwendet er sie, um bestimmten Gegenständen Unwichtigkeit oder Uniformität zu signalisieren. Dieses Malen von Farben, um den Lesern etwas zu zeigen, beginnt mit Daisy. Nach einer langen Zeit ohne bedeutungsvolle Verwendung dieser Farben kommt Fitzgerald heraus, um Daisy als \"in Weiß\" beschrieben, in einem \"kleinen weißen Roadster\" zu bezeichnen; die Leser beginnen, Daisy als weniger Charakter zu sehen, mehr als nur ein uniformes Addition, etwas, das Gatsby will und sich sehnt (74). Fitzgerald verwendet mehr davon, um diese Eindrücke von Daisy als eine mehr uniforme Addition zu vermitteln, zum Beispiel, da es einen \"graue Haze von Daisys Fellkragen\" (18) gibt, und sie wieder in einem weißen (115) Kleid vor Tom und Gatsby's Begegnung erscheint.\n\nGerman to English translation:\n\n[REWRITE] Many authors use different methods to give their readers a certain atmosphere or attitude towards important themes.

Gemeinsame Anbauprodukte umfassen Tomaten, Zitrusfrüchte, blättrige Grünzeug, Kürbis, Brokkoli, Kräuter, Baumfrüchte wie Pfirsiche und Zitronen, Beeren, Honig und Paprika. Es gibt einen erheblichen Markt für organische Gemeinschaftsgärtnerei-Lebensmittel im San Diego-Bereich, mit vielen lokalen Organisationen, die lange Wartelisten haben. Organische Eier und Milch sind auch beliebt. Viele organische Betriebe bieten auch Touren ihrer landwirtschaftlichen Betriebe an sowie Zugang für Wanderungen, Vogelbeobachtungen und andere Freizeitaktivitäten an. Dies ist der Typ von Betrieb, der es dem Landbesitzer ermöglichen würde, die Vorteile von Regierungsprogrammen zu nutzen, während er das Habitat verbessert, was eine Nutzung für Freizeitzwecke und die Schaffung einer Gelegenheit für Betriebsbesichtigungen und andere Programme für den Gelderwerb oder zur Bildungszwecke ermöglicht.\n\nDarüber hinaus erfüllt es einen potenziell lukrativen Nischenmarkt, und die Vorteile der organischen Landwirtschaft umfassen oft eine größere Artenvielfalt an Pflanzen und Wildtieren in der Region dank des Mangels an Chemikalien im Boden und im Wasser. Allerdings erfordert organische Landwirtschaft in einigen Aspekten höhere Kosten als konventionelle Landwirtschaft. Sie erfordert intensivere Arbeitskraft und -management, um Schädlinge und Unkraut zu entfernen und das Boden zu düngen, ohne Chemikalien, und Verluste sind oft größer als bei konventionellen Methoden, wobei ein kleiner organischer Betrieb auch die Effizienz des Skaleneffekts von großen Betrieben vermisst. Praktiken, die nicht mit der organischen Landwirtschaft in Zusammenhang stehen, aber für die Wildtierwelt äußerst nützlich sind, können auch höhere Arbeitskosten verursachen, einschließlich der Pflanzung von Deckfrüchten, strategischer Weidemanagement, Entfernung invasiver Arten und aktives Management des Pflanzenwachstums, um bestimmte Bedingungen wie Randhabitate oder Flecken offener Böden bereitzustellen. Es gibt also viele Gründe, warum der Landbesitzer in diesem Beispiel nach finanzieller Unterstützung oder Expertise suchen könnte, um sowohl Gewinne zu maximieren als auch die Qualität des Habitats zu verbessern.\n\nDas für diese Szenario ausgewählte Land ist ein Grundstück, das sich neben dem Dorf Potrero befindet, in nicht eingemeindeten Teilen des San Diego County, Kalifornien. Es handelt sich um 160 acres Chaparral, nicht einheimische Mittelmeer-Grasland und Eichenwald neben dem Cleveland National Forest. Es liegt in der ostlichen Südfußhöhenökoregion des San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. Der Plan wird noch geprüft, aber betrachtet derzeit über 100 Arten von Pflanzen und Tieren. Viele sind bedroht, wie der Stephens'-Kängururatte, der Berggelbbein-Frosch, mehrere Arten von Schmetterlingen und der kalifornische Gnidder; andere sind rückläufig und könnten bald auf die Liste gesetzt werden, wie der Grabkauz.\n\nDiese Gegend war von Ureinwohnern für unzählige Jahrhunderte bewohnt und wurde dann von Rindfleischzüchtern und Holzverkäufern in der späten 1800er besiedelt. Dieses Stück Land war Teil eines ursprünglichen Homestead-Patents und wurde wahrscheinlich für Weidewirtschaft und/oder Holzproduktion in den meisten der dazwischenliegenden Jahrzehnte genutzt.\n\nIch wählte einen Stück Land aus einem Immobilien-Website aus und erforschte verfügbare Regierungsprogramme, um herauszufinden, welche Optionen ein kleiner Bauer realistischerweise haben könnte, um Kosten zu mildern und die Wildtierfreundlichkeit zu erhalten.

    "original": "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture.

Kultur ist nicht homogen, noch ist sie etwas Spezifisches. Sie ist auch nicht einheitlich oder einzigartig. Aussagen wie \"Alle Russen sind stur\" oder \"Alle Japaner sind zuvorkommend\" sind von Natur aus breit gefächert und zu einfach. Während die Verständigung von Kulturerfahrungen ist angemessen, ist es viel produktiver für einen Verhandler, die Bedeutung einer Kultur im Hinblick auf die betreffende Angelegenheit zu verstehen und wie die Kulturhaltung auf die Verhandlungen wirken wird. Wenn man sich einer ausländischen Kultur nähert, erfährt man sie auf eine Weise, die für seine eigene Kultur verständlich ist, und Vergleiche ergeben sich zwangsläufig.\n\nDas Versuchen ausländische Kultur oder Einstellung zu verstehen, kann alles umfassen, von der Erforschung ihrer Geschichte bis hin zu ihrer Vorurteile. Anstatt eine Kultur zu beurteilen oder versuchen, sie zu ändern, muss man sie einfach akzeptieren, wie sie ist, und innerhalb ihrer Grenzen arbeiten, besonders im Rahmen der Verhandlung, und besonders, wenn man mit einer schwachen Verhandlungsposition an den Tisch kommt. Ebenso kann es für einen Verhandler hilfreich sein, wenn er sich auf \"fremdem\" Gebiet befindet, Respekt vor Traditionen und Glaubenssätzen zu zeigen, um die kulturellen Barrieren zu überwinden und die Verhandlung voranzutreiben.\n\nEs ist wichtig zu beachten, dass Kultur sich nicht unbedingt auf ein nationales/internationales Dilemma beschränkt. Die meisten Unternehmen innerhalb eines Landes haben ihre eigene Unternehmenskultur. Zum Beispiel kann eine Unternehmenskultur Langzeitarbeit im Büro oder eine entspanntere Arbeitszeit betonen. Beweise für eine Unternehmenskultur können in den Arbeitnehmercodes, im Kommunikationsstil (direkte v. indirekte Kommunikation, Delegation von Aufgaben) und in den Einstellungspraktiken zu sehen sein. Einige Unternehmen fördern Philanthropie auf jeder Ebene von Arbeitnehmern, andere beschränken es auf \"unternehmensgenehmigte\" Wohltätigkeitsorganisationen oder Spendenaktionen. Man muss nur auf die Unterschiede zwischen der amerikanischen Unternehmenskultur von Unternehmen (und tatsächlich gibt es auch intraunternehmerische Vielfalt sogar von Region zu Region, von urbane zu suburbanen Umgebungen eingeschlossen) schauen, um die Vielfalt der Gedanken zu schätzen, die in einer bestimmten sozialen Kultur anwesend sein kann. Bestimmte Kulturen sind nicht annähernd so stratifiziert wie die amerikanische Kultur und erscheinen einem Außenstehenden als mehr uniform zu sein, aber ein ähnliches Äußeres ist einfach ein Hinweis, tiefer zu graben.\n\nWerte sind noch wichtiger zu verstehen, da sie den Grund für eine Kultur liefern. Wenn das Retten der Gesicht oder die Harmonie in der Gemeinschaft innerhalb einer Kultur gewürdigt wird, ist es sicher, dass ein Verhandler nicht öffentlich seinen Arbeitgeber oder seinen Vorgesetzten in der Verhandlung schamvoll machen wird, um erfolgreich zu sein. Ebenso wird ein Verhandler aus einer Kultur, die mehr Wert auf einen harten Vertrag legt, nicht unbedingt dazu gezwungen sein, sich am frühesten Gelegenheit zum Abschluss zu entscheiden. Diese allgemeinen Annahmen in Betracht zu ziehen ist wichtig, bevor man zum Verhandlungstisch kommt. Allerdings wird ein Verhandler gut beraten sein, etwas über seinen Gegner auf persönlicher Ebene zu lernen, um die Verhandlung effektiv zu gestalten.\n\n[REWRITE]\n\nCulture plays a significant role in every negotiation. Culture can be defined by what it is not and what it signifies. Culture is not homogeneous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating,\" are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While understanding cultural experiences is appropriate, it is much more productive for a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture's attitude will affect the talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to their own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise.\n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or trying to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds themselves on \"foreign\" territory, showing respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in overcoming cultural barriers and moving the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is essential to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long working hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of tasks), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, while others restrict it to \"company-approved\" charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper.\n\nValues are even more important to understand, as they provide the why of a culture.

Diese Überzeugung scheint auch von dem anderen Autor, den wir besprechen werden, Thomas von Aquin, geteilt zu werden. Da jede ihrer Argumente in der Verteidigung des gleichen Konzepts steht und unsere Herausforderung darin besteht zu bestimmen, wessen Argument besser ist, müssen wir aus Gründen der Kürze voraussetzen, dass sie beide in ihrem Glauben an die Existenz Gottes richtig sind, speziell an den Gott der Bibel. Wenn wir einen Gott-Typ, der sich nicht vom einen ähnelt, in dem unsere beiden Autoren glauben, zulassen würden, wäre es uns nicht möglich, ihre beiden Argumente angemessen zu vergleichen, da sie letztlich in der Verteidigung eines bestimmten Konzepts von Gott sind. Das gesagt, bin ich der Meinung, dass, während jeder von ihnen gültige Punkte aufwirft, keiner von ihnen eine umfassende Grundlage für den Glauben an Gott liefert.\n\nUm dies zu illustrieren, werden wir zunächst die grundlegende Argumentation von St. Anselm untersuchen. Anselms Passage spiegelt einen Weg des Verständnisses durch den Glauben wider, bei dem man in sich selbst nach Beweisen für Gott sucht. Er erklärt, dass Gott in unserem Verständnis existiert und wir seine Nichtexistenz nicht effektiv konzipieren können. Diese Idee, wenn sie in seinen Terminologie ausgedrückt wird, ist ein bisschen mühsam und manchmal unklar, aber der grundlegende Tenor ist, dass der Beweis für Gott in unserem eigenen Geist liegt. St. Anselm legt uns nahe, dass wir nicht darüber hinausgehen müssen, um die Wahrheit über Gott zu finden, sondern dass die Existenz dieses Wesens durch die Untersuchung dessen, was wir innervestandenerweise wissen, wahr ist. Aussenwissenschaftliche Evidenz ist vermutlich nicht notwendig. Diese Idee, dass man an etwas glaubt, für das kein unumstößlicher Körper von empirischer Evidenz existiert, wird in christlichen Texten oft als Glaube bezeichnet.\n\nDiese Idee ist sehr verschieden von der, die St. Thomas von Aquin hält. Aquinas schlägt vor, dass die Existenz Gottes durch Vernunft und empirische Evidenz vollständig bewiesen werden kann, ohne dass Glaube erforderlich ist. Eine solche Idee wäre bei der Evangelisierung, einem wichtigen Element des Christentums, von Vorteil, weil sie die Rekrutierung von neuen Konvertiten ermöglichen würde, ohne dass sie auf ihre Bereitschaft angewiesen wären, etwas zu akzeptieren, was nicht bewiesen werden kann. Sie könnten stattdessen allein durch Logik überzeugt werden. St. Thomas erläutert fünf verschiedene logische Argumente, die die Existenz Gottes unterstützen: Veränderung, Ursache, Notwendigkeit, Grade der Vollkommenheit und Harmonie. In jedem davon zeigt er, dass der Beweis für Gott in der logischen Notwendigkeit für Gott liegt. Wenn Ihnen gesagt wird, dass Sie ein Puzzleteil vermissen, und Sie den Rest des Puzzles zusammenbauen, bestimmt die Logik, dass Sie das Wissen über die Merkmale und die Existenz des fehlenden Teils haben, ohne ihn zu sehen.\n\nGerman to English:\n\n[REWRITE] The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'

    "raw_output": "Text in German:\n\nIn der fünften oder sechsten Jahrhundert v. Chr. wurde ein Prinz geboren, der eines Tages als Buddha bekannt werden würde. Während seines Lebens verleugnete er die Welt und wurde erleuchtet, und seine Lehren führten zur Bildung des Buddhismus – der orthodoxeste Sekte dessen ist der Theravada-Buddhismus. Die Religion ist etwa zweitausendfünfhundert Jahre alt; sie sieht anders aus als damals, als Buddha lebte. Dies kann überall gesehen werden, zum Beispiel im theravadischen Staat Sri Lanka, wo die jährliche Wasserscheidezeremonie begangen wird. Mönche und Laien nehmen an dieser Zeremonie teil, und sie hat eine religiöse Bedeutung, trotzdem hat Buddha nie über eine solche Feier teacht. Diese Unterschiede reichen von den oberflächlichen Traditionen bis hin zum soteriologischen Kern der Religion. Die theravadische Buddhistengemeinschaft, sowohl aus monastischer als auch aus laikaler Perspektive, hat seine dogmatischen Grundsätze im Laufe der Zeit ändern müssen. Dies kann auf Kräfte sowohl aus dem Inneren als auch aus dem Äußeren zurückgeführt werden, sowohl feindliche als auch gnädige.\n\nEs gibt ein paar Kriterien, die in diesem Gespräch häufig verwendet werden werden. Das Konzept von Innerem versus Äußerem. Hier ist eine innere Kraft definiert als eine Kraft, die von Mitgliedern der Buddhasasana ausgeht, unabhängig vom Mönchsstatus. Eine äußere Kraft ist jede Kraft von Nicht-Buddhisten. Eine feindselige Kraft ist jede Kraft, die die buddhistische Gemeinschaft schädigt oder beabsichtigt zu schädigen – eine Kraft, die aus einer negativen Wahrnehmung des Buddhismus ausgeht. Eine gnädige Kraft ist eine Kraft, die nicht beabsichtigt, der buddhistischen Gemeinschaft zu schaden oder zu helfen – obwohl sie es letztendlich tun könnte, als Nebenprodukt. Diese Termini werden wiederholt in dieser Diskussion auftauchen.\n\nZunächst ist es wichtig, die Grundlagen der Religion zu erforschen – die Lehren, die sich im Kern des Theravada-Buddhismus befinden. Buddhisten suchen Zuflucht im Drei-Edelstein des Buddha, der Dhamma und der Sangha. Die Dhamma besteht im Wesentlichen aus den Tripitaka – den drei Körben – der buddhistischen Texte. Das Sutta-Pitaka enthält alle Suttas, das Vinaya-Pitaka enthält die disziplinären Regeln, und das Abhidhamma-Pitaka enthält die metaphysischen Bestandteile des Buddhismus. Die metaphysischen Begriffe bestehen aus Dingen wie Anatta – keine Seele, Dukkha – innewohnende Leid in dem Leben, und Anicca – die Unbeständigkeit von allem. Nur durch die Anerkennung dieser Konzepte kann man den Sansara, den Kreislauf des Todes und der Wiedergeburt, beenden, der fortwährend stattfindet. Mit dem Sansara wird auch Lobha – Begierde, Dosa – Hass, und Moha – Täuschung – enden, wenn man erleuchtet wird. Im Vinaya-Pitaka werden Regeln für das Leben festgelegt. Für Laien gibt es fünf Gebote (Ich werde nicht töten, ich werde nicht lügen, ich werde nicht stehlen, ich werde mich nicht sexuell unanständig benehmen, und ich werde keine betäubenden Substanzen zu mir nehmen). Für Mönche gibt es viele weitere disziplinäre Regeln, die zu befolgen sind. Das fundamentalste dogmatische Konzept im Buddhismus ist das Konzept der vier edlen Wahrheiten. Erstens Dukkha; die Wahrheit, dass das Leben Leid ist. Zweitens, dass die Bindung Leid verursacht. Drittens, dass das Leid überwunden werden kann.\n\n[REWRITE] In the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born.

    "original": "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).

(Diehl und Goerts 2000 S. 145).  Der Höhepunkt dieser Rivalität war der mexikanisch-amerikanische Krieg von 1846-1848, in dem die Vereinigten Staaten Mexiko angegriffen und besiegten und die USA Texas und das amerikanische Südwesten als neues Territorium sicherten.  Viele weitere Zusammenstöße zwischen den beiden Nationen fanden statt, erloschen schließlich jedoch gerade noch vor dem Ersten Weltkrieg.  Die Rivalität begann, als Amerikaner und Mexikaner auf Schlüsselthemen wie Religion, Kultur und Tradition aneinander gerieten und einen großen Konflikt um materielle Interessen (Schmitt 1974 S. 30-31) hatten.   \n\tDies ist nicht unähnlich vielen anderen Nationen, die eine anhaltende Rivalität mit einem Nachbarn haben.  Nationen, die eine gemeinsame Grenze teilen, neigen dazu, Interessengegensätze zu haben, die zu der Schaffung rivalisierender Positionen zwischen den Nationen führen.  Die Vereinigten Staaten und Mexiko sind nicht unähnlich vielen anderen anhaltenden Rivalitäten zwischen Nationen, die eine gemeinsame Grenze teilen.  David M. Pletcher (1977) erklärt, dass \"Nur in Mexiko und Kuba kann man lang anhaltende amerikanische diplomatische Probleme finden\" (S. 41).  Tatsächlich sind beide Nationen geografisch nahe an den Vereinigten Staaten gelegen und waren Rivalen der Vereinigten Staaten, während andere Nationen in Lateinamerika gute Beziehungen zum Vereinigten Staaten genießen und genossen haben.   \n\tReligiöse Probleme schufen eine Spaltung zwischen den beiden Nationen, ein Problem, das viele Nationen durch die Geschichte heimgesucht hat.  Sally Frahm (2001) erklärt, dass \"wenn im 20. Jahrhundert Amerikaner gegen Faschismus und Kommunismus waren, waren sie im 18. und 19. Jahrhundert gegen Katholizismus und Monarchie\" (S. 86).  Nicht anders als die Rivalität des Kalten Krieges zwischen den Vereinigten Staaten und der Sowjetunion war eine ideologische Auseinandersetzung und eine Konkurrenz um Interessen, die jede Nation für lebenswichtig hielt.  In diesem Fall jedoch basierten die ideologischen Auseinandersetzungen nicht auf der politischen Struktur, sondern auf den religiösen Vorlieben der Vereinigten Staaten und Mexikos.  Diese Misstrauen wuchs aus dem Misstrauen zwischen den Engländern und den Spaniern.  Diese Gefühle von Misstrauen ererbten sie von ihren ehemaligen Kolonialherren, was ein erheblicher Hinderungsgrund für die Etablissement einer freundlichen Beziehung zwischen den Vereinigten Staaten und Mexiko war.\n\tDiehl und Goerts (2000) führen 17 Streitigkeiten zwischen Mexiko und den Vereinigten Staaten in der 57-jährigen Rivalitätsperiode auf.  Die Mehrheit der Streitigkeiten zwischen den Rivalitäten, die von Diehl und Goerts beschrieben werden, betreffen territoriale Streitigkeiten in Bezug auf Grenzüberfälle von mexikanischen Gebieten in Mexiko und andere Grenzprobleme.  Grenzraubzüge von Banditen und Gesetzesbrechern von den amerikanischen Grenzstädten waren ein erhebliches Problem, das bis zu dem Zeitpunkt fortbestand, bis beide die Vereinigten Staaten und Mexiko militärische Kräfte auf ihre Grenzen anwendeten (Schmitt 1974 S. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) erklärt, dass die Rivalität zwischen den beiden Nationen begann, als \"Mexiko offensichtlich von den Vereinigten Staaten in erheblichem Maße abhängig wurde\" (S. 109) und schließlich endete, als die amerikanischen Ambitionen \"sich von der territorialen Expansion zur wirtschaftlichen Eingriff in Mexico änderten\" (S. 110) im späteren 19. Jahrhundert.\n\nTranslation back to English:\n\n[REWRITE] The United States of America and Mexico are an example of two countries that at one time were marked by an enduring rivalry that lasted 57 years, from 1836 to 1893.

Also -- obwohl mein Traum es war, Wissenschaftler oder Journalist zu sein – vorzugsweise ein bisschen von beidem – habe ich mich für Krankenschwester entschieden. \n\nDennoch war ich dort: 46 Jahre alt und allein, ohne Geld im Bankkonto und unfähig, zu arbeiten. Bis heute bin ich behindert und nach 15 Jahren des Lebens auf Sozialhilfe für Behinderte habe ich wirklich nichts mehr, was ich als \"mein\" bezeichnen könnte. Ich komme zurecht, aber jeden Tag ist ein Kampf und ein Angriff auf meine Sicherheit, mein Wohlbefinden und mein Selbstwertgefühl.

    "original": "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",

In jüngerer Zeit wurde mathematische Modellierung auf allgemeine Aspekte der Molluskenskeletogenese sowohl durch Ontogenese als auch Phylogenese angewendet (z. B. Raup und Stanley, 1981). Unser Studie untersucht, wie die mathematische Modellierung des ontogenetischen und phylogenetischen Wandels bei Prunum in Kombination mit experimentellen Studien verwendet werden kann, um die beteiligten Mechanismen im Hinblick auf die Richtung und Größe des evolutionären-entwicklungsbedingten Wandels zu klären. Wir haben X-radiographische Bilder von Prunum-Arten verwendet, um quantitative Parameter zu definieren, die dann verwendet werden können, um hypothetische und reale Skelett morphologien zu modellieren. Diese Parameter wurden in das Softwareprogramm CerioShell (Stone, 1995) eingegeben. Wir haben hypothetische Schalenmorphologien modelliert, die verwendet werden können, um die Grenzen möglicher morphologischer Veränderungen bei Prunum zu interpretieren. Diese Ergebnisse werden mit experimentellen und deskriptiven Studien kombiniert, um die makroevolutionären Ereignisse in diesem Kladen besser zu verstehen.\n\nEine Schale kann als Struktur angesehen werden, die sich im Verlauf der Zeit über 360 Grad des Raumes bewegt. Diese Revolutionen oder Drehungen einer gewundenen Schale werden als Windungen bezeichnet, die sich um eine imaginäre zentrale Achse drehen. Diese Achse verläuft durch die Mitte der Schale und wird als Columella bezeichnet. Die Geschwindigkeit, mit der sich die Windungen erweitern, kann variieren, und eine kontinuierliche Linie trennt jeden Windung und wird als Sutura bezeichnet. In den meisten Schalen ist die größte Windung der Schale die letzte Windung (Körperwindung). Die Spitze wird als alle Windungen außer der letzten bezeichnet. Der Apex ist die Spitze der Spitze und der gegenüberliegende Ende wird als Basis bezeichnet. Das Tier streckt sich durch einen Öffnung namens Aperture aus.\n\nSchalen können in apikalen, basal, apertural und abaperturalen Ansichten betrachtet werden. (Die \"gewöhnliche\" Orientierung einer Schale ist eine aperturale Sicht, mit der Aperture nach dem Betrachter und mit der Spitze nach oben.) \n\nEine Methode zur Zählung der Windungen ist unten zu sehen. Zuerst sollte die Schale von der apikalen Sicht betrachtet werden und dann bestimmt werden, wo die erste Sutura anfängt. Eine Linie kann dann gezogen werden, die die Schale in zwei Teile teilt.

Während das Land auf dem Weg ist, viele der Milleniumszielen zu erreichen, wie die Ziele für Wasser und Abwasser, sind die Verbesserungen in der Kinder- und Muttergesundheit weit hinter den notwendigen Verbesserungen zurück, um die Ziele bis 2015 zu erreichen.  Die mehrfachen Gründe für diese Mängel werden unten diskutiert und weisen darauf hin, dass die Gesundheitssysteme gestärkt werden sollten, anstatt sich auf programmierte Eingriffe zu konzentrieren.\n\nIndonesien hat in der Anzahl der Geburten mit einem qualifizierten Gesundheitspersonal gestiegen, wobei 72 % der Geburten dieses Ziel erreichen.  Dieses Kriterium umfasst jedoch auch traditionelle Arbeiter, wie Hebammen, die medizinische Eingriffe bei komplizierten Schwangerschaften nicht leisten können (deshalb ist die hohe Anzahl der Müttersterblichkeiten durch Blutungen).  Mit anderen Worten sind die Verbesserungen in diesem bestimmten Indikator etwas irreführend und es gibt noch viel Arbeit zu tun.  Darüber hinaus gibt es einen Rückgang in der Anzahl der durch Gesundheitspersonal behandelten Durchfallerkrankungen bei Kindern unter fünf Jahren.  Während die Daten zur postnatalen Pflege unvollständig sind, ist klar, dass dieses Gebiet auch eine Sorge ist, mit niedrigen Raten landesweit.\n\nDie Kaiserschnitt-Quote ist immer noch niedriger als zu erwarten, um die 4 %.  Die Kaiserschnitt-Quote weist jedoch auf ein anderes besorgniserregendes Problem hin.  Während die Rate der Kaiserschnitte in städtischen Bereichen 7 % beträgt, ist sie nur 2 % in ländlichen Gebieten.  Dies weist auf das Problem der Gleichheit bei der Deckung landesweit hin.  Offensichtlich ist der Zugang zu Gesundheitsdiensten auf städtische Bereiche konzentriert.  Ein weiteres Problem ist die vertikale Gleichheit.  Es besteht ein 27-prozentiger Unterschied zwischen der Nutzung von Diensten zwischen den ärmsten und reichsten Quintilen.  Offensichtlich haben die Ärmsten es viel schwieriger, Gesundheitsdienste in Anspruch zu nehmen, wahrscheinlich aufgrund der Barriere bei den außerordentlichen Kosten.\n\nBeim Diskutieren der nächsten Schritte zur Verbesserung der Indikatoren für Neugeborene und Müttergesundheit ist die grundlegendste Frage, wie man den Mangel an Diensten am besten anspricht.  Insbesondere ist die Frage, ob Indonesien programmspezifische Ansätze entwickeln oder das Gesundheitssystem im Allgemeinen stärken soll, ohne sich auf die Vor- und Nachsorge für die Mutter und das Kind zu konzentrieren.  Es besteht kein Zweifel daran, dass programmierte Ansätze, um die oben genannten Probleme zu lösen, attraktiv sind.  Nicht nur zielen \"vertikale Ansätze\", die sich auf einen Sektor der Verbesserungen konzentrieren, auf viel zielführende, managierbare Ziele ab, sie generieren auch allgemein schnellere Ergebnisse.  Es gibt jedoch einige Nachteile, die beachtet werden müssen.  Ein großer Nachteil ist, dass eine starke Investition in Programmierungen für einen bestimmten Bereich der Gesundheitssektor bedeutet, dass die Finanzierung für andere Bereiche leidet und die Ressourcen von Menschen sich in diesem Bereich orientieren, der mehr Ressourcen hat (der Effekt der internationalen Finanzierung für HIV/AIDS und dessen Effekt auf die Familienplanung ist ein Beispiel).  Darüber hinaus führt die Durchführung von mehreren parallelen Programmen für einen Bereich zu einer Duplizierung von Diensten, die auch zwischen Programmen unkoordiniert sind.  Dies führt zu einem Anstieg von Formularen und Papierkram für Lieferungen und Finanzierung.\n\nBack translation to English: \n[REWRITE] The rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained relatively stable over the past ten years.

Zwei Romane, die als victorianisch gelten, aber sich von dieser Tradition entfernen, sind Oliver Twist und Wuthering Heights.  Beide Romane verwenden ein Element des Rätsels und eine Prise für das Bizarre, was für die Romane der Epoche untypisch ist, was die Charaktere in jedem Werk stärkt; sie geben Einblick, der ihre Motive und Emotionen erläutert.\n\n\"Und jetzt kamen Tausende verwirrender und verwirrender Ideen auf ihn ein und drängten sich in seinem Kopf. Es schien, als ginge er immer noch zwischen Sikes und Crackit, die sich wütend stritten: denn die Worte, die sie sagten, klangen in seinen Ohren; und wenn er seine Aufmerksamkeit auf sie richtete, ... fand er heraus, dass er mit ihnen sprach …. Plötzlich fuhr er zurück, als der Bericht von Feuerwaffen ertönte; und es stieg ein lautes Geschrei und Gebrüll in die Luft auf, und Lichter leuchteten vor seinen Augen, und alles war Lärm und Aufruhr, während eine unsichtbare Hand ihn eilig davontrug. Durch all diese schnellen Visionen lief ein undefinierter, unbehaglicher Bewusstseinszustand, der ihn ununterbrochen quälte und marterte.\"\n\n\"Die beiden Romane nutzen dieses Rätsel oft durch Traumsequenzen oder traumähnliche Zustände, obwohl die Inhalte und Funktionen varieren in jedem spezifischen Fall. In Oliver Twist offenbaren sich diese seltsamen Vorgänge oft einen Einblick in die inneren Schichten von Oliver, was ihn verletzt, und seine Kenntnis über die wahre Natur der sich um ihn herum ereignenden Dinge. Als der Schuss auf Oliver in Kapitel 28 schließlich wieder besucht wird, erlebt Oliver ihn lebhaft wieder, als ob in einem Traum, während er sich bemüht, Hilfe zu finden (siehe links). Diese Passage betont die Mangel an Kontrolle, die Oliver über die sich entwickelnde Ereignisse hatte, sowie die bedrückende Situation, in die sich seine Gesundheit gebracht hatte, die stark präsent war via Olivers Halluzinationen von Sikes und Crackit. Der Schuss selbst überwältigt ihn; alle seine Sinne sind betäubt, da er die 'unsichtbare Hand' nicht bemerkt, die ihn fortträgt; er erlebt seine Verzweiflung wiederholt, entfernt von dem Schock der Schmerzen, als die Schmerzen jetzt konstant und mit Angst verbunden sind, anstatt mit Überraschung. Während Oliver überwältigt ist, erhebt sich die Frage, wer seine Mißgeschicke verursacht hat, da es gewiss nicht seine eigene Handlung war. Dieser Schuss bestärkt den Gedanken, dass Oliver kaum Kontrolle über etwas hat, da er nicht einmal versucht, Kontrolle über ein Ereignisses Ausgang zu gewinnen, selbst wenn sein Leben in Gefahr ist. Eine wachsende Stimmung der Niederlage in Oliver wird auch angedeutet, als ob der alte Fagin ihn gebrochen hätte, ihn in diese Verzweiflung zu zwingen, seine Fähigkeit, zu reagieren, zu beeinflussen. Andernfalls könnte angenommen werden, dass Oliver einige Anstrengung unternommen hätte, zumindest für den eigenen Lebenssatz' willen.\"\n\n\"Der Tag verging – Tag!

    "original": "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",

Wenn man weiß, war er von lateinamerikanischer Abstammung, das war mir sicher, aber der Junge sprach perfekt Englisch. Wir kämpften von da an, bis an den Tag, als ich seine Mutter traf. Ich war dabei, um ein paar Jungen (für Mangel an einer besseren Bezeichnung) zu babysitten, während der Rest der Gruppe auf einer Ausflug war, als seine Mutter hereinkam. Seine Mutter sprach kein Wort Englisch, nur Spanisch. Mit meinem sehr schlechten Wissen von Spanisch (ich war nur gerade erst dabei, es zu lernen) konnten wir uns unterhalten. Aber es war dann, dass mir plötzlich ein Licht aufging: Adrian konnte lesen, er wusste nur nicht gut, wie die englische Alphabet aussieht. Ich weiß nicht, ob diese Erkenntnis ihm jemals geholfen hat, aber ich hoffe, dass er jetzt besser ist.\n\nIch erzähle diese Geschichte, um mich auf das Problem der Sprachbarriere in der Schule zu konzentrieren, insbesondere hier in Kalifornien. Ich erzähle sie auch, um zu beweisen, dass es nicht immer so offensichtlich ist, wie wir denken. Selbst für einen Jungen, der perfekt Englisch spricht, kann das Lesen noch ein riesiger Hindernis sein. Ich denke, wir können alle zustimmen, dass dieses Problem existiert, also: Was tun wir? In Adrians Fall war die Lösung ziemlich einfach: Unterricht in englischem Lesen, insbesondere Alphabet und Aussprache. Aber für die vielen Kinder, die kaum Englisch sprechen, ist die Lösung viel komplexer. Es gibt keine einzigartige Antwort. Das Doppelte Sprachsystem, Mainstream-Immersion, private Tutoren, ESL-Kurse, nicht eines dieser Dinge, alleine, wird dieses Problem nicht lösen. Die Antwort liegt darin, alle der oben genannten Dinge zu kombinieren!\n\nZunächst einmal ist das Doppelte Sprachsystem eine großartige Idee. Nicht nur für Kinder, deren erste Sprache Spanisch ist, sondern für alle Kinder. „Kinder in Zweigsprachenunterricht haben gezeigt, dass sie sich besser in den Schule schlagen als ihre Peers.“ Ein großer Teil der Ängste, die sich um diese Idee ranken, ist, dass es ein Verschwendung von Ressourcen ist und dass die Mehrheit der Schüler in Schulen keinen Nutzen davon haben wird. Aber das ist falsch. Wenn wir diese Arten von Programmen in der Klasse als Regel anwenden, anstatt als Ausnahme, würden alle Kinder davon profitieren. Wie gehen wir aber damit um? Verlangen wir von allen Lehrern, dass sie zweisprachig sind? Nein. Das wäre unvernünftig und unrealistisch. Ich denke jedoch, dass es keinen Grund gibt, warum wir nicht auch besondere Hilfskräfte, Tutoren, nennen Sie es, was Sie wollen, haben könnten, die zweisprachig sind.\n\nEnglish translation:\n\n[REWRITE] Several years ago, I worked in an after-school program tutoring elementary school students. I did my best to help them in any subject they were struggling with, but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the teachers to help a little boy named Adrian (I believe he was in third or fourth grade) who was having a huge trouble with reading. It dawned on me that something was wrong; he had the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly, others not even close, it was the strangest thing. You know, he was of Latin American descent, that I was sure, but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from then on, until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysit (for lack of a better term) a few stragglers while the rest of the after-school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English, only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish (I was only just learning), we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a ton of bricks: Adrian could read fine, he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much, but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n\nI tell that story to address the problem of the language barrier in schools, especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English, reading can still be a huge obstacle. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists, so what do we do? In Adrian's case, the solution was fairly simple: tutoring in English reading, particularly the alphabet and pronunciation. But for the many children who barely speak English, the solution is much more complex. There is no one-size-fits-all answer. The dual-language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes, none of these things by themselves will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above!\n\nFirst of all, the dual-language system is a great idea. Not just for children whose first language is Spanish, but for all children. \"Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.\" A lot of fear surrounds this idea, that it's a waste of resources, and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these kinds of programs in the classroom as the rule, rather than the exception, all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this, though? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However, I do think that there's no reason we can't have special aids, tutors, whatever you want to call them, who are bilingual. [/REWRITE]",

Einige von uns werden in die Sonntagschule geschickt, um darüber zu lernen, während andere zum Tempel gehen oder innerhalb von sich selbst nach Antworten suchen.  Viele von uns akzeptieren leichtgläubig die von unseren Eltern überlieferten Religionen.  Einige von uns jedoch lehnen sie entschieden ab, da es in unserem persönlichen egozentrischen Universum nichts mehr als Wissen geben kann.

Wir suchen nach einem Licht im Dunkeln, das uns aus der Schattenwelt führt und hinein in die Sonne.\n\n „Ein Kardinal,” sagte mein Vater, als ich ihn fragte, was seine Lieblingsvogelart ist.  Wir saßen auf der Vorderveranda unseres Hauses, lauschten dem Regen, der auf das Blechdach über uns trommelte, während wir uns Zigaretten rauchten. Die Giebel brachten den Regen herab, ertränkten die Pflanzen an der Kante der Veranda.  Er sah in den Regen hinaus, ein Blick, der halb suchend, halb erinnernd aussah.  Er war um ein paar Monate herumgekommen und seine Kleidung hing schlaff von seinem Körper. Sein Haar war dünner, spärlicher als ich mich daran erinnerte.  Er starrte weiterhin in den Regen hinaus, vermied den Augenkontakt.  Ich fühlte mich allein, ängstlich und unfähig, mit meinem Vater über die Menge zu sprechen, die ich ihm versähe, weil darüber zu sprechen es nur noch realer für uns beide machen würde.  Ich umarmte ihn, setzte mich wieder hin, schob meinen Stuhl ein bisschen näher an seinen heran und schloss mich ihm bei der Gaze in die fallenden Regentropfen des Juni-Dämmerungslichts an.\n\n Mein Vater starb im Dezember jenes Jahres, fünf Tage nach meinem 22. Geburtstag.  Die Chemotherapie und die Strahlentherapie hatten seinem Leiden nicht Abhilfe gebracht, aber ihn einige mehr Monate länger am Leben erhalten, als die Ärzte vorhergesagt hatten; was der Wert war, wenn er nur länger leiden musste, konnte ich nicht definieren.  Was für ein Gott würde das tun, dachte ich mir selbst.  Allein in der Nacht sagte ich keine Gebete.  Wenn Gott existierte, dachte ich, er hatte auf mich lange nicht mehr zugehört.\n\n  Ich wollte nicht zusehen, wie er aus diesem Leben in ein anderes hineinging.  Also tat ich es nicht.  Ich konnte nicht zusehen, wie das Leben, das mich erschaffen hatte, endete.  Ich wollte mich an meinen Vater erinnern, so wie er gelebt hatte und nicht so wie er gestorben war.  Außerdem wusste ich, dass ich meinen Vater besser kannte als sie, besser als seine Familie und wusste, dass Dad nicht wünschen würde, dass sein einziger Kind bei seinem Tod dabei war.

Die gotische Mode wurde entwertet, gelobt, angeklagt, als hätte sie keine reale Tiefe, und gelobt für das 'schreckliche Sublime' - Phänomen, das es zu evokieren schien (Burke). Die ursprüngliche \"gotische Erzählung\", Horace Walpoles The Castle of Otranto, verwendete die Ideen sowohl der \"alten als auch der modernen\" Romane, um den proto-gotischen Genre zu schaffen und ein neues Verfahren der literarischen Ausdrucksweise zu schaffen. Walpole verwendet \"alte\" theaterische Elemente und \"neue\" Nachahmung der Natur in \"modernen\" Romane, um, wie er es bezeichnet, \"Eine gotische Geschichte\" vorzustellen (Walpole 4). Die gotische Genre nutzt viele Rückschläge auf mittelalterlichen gothischen Theater, Architektur und Traditionen. Selbst zu der Zeit der Veröffentlichung von The Castle of Otranto wurde das Wort \"gotisch\" verwendet, um viele verschiedene Völker, Stile und Zeitperioden zu beschreiben. Es wurde als archaisch oder unsophistisiert wahrgenommen, im Angesicht von \"modernen\" gesellschaftlichen und literarischen \"Vermächtnissen\". Die Kombination der mehr theatralen \"Gothic\" und der neuen Form des Romans (durch die der Leser einen persönlichen Einblick in die Psychologie der Charaktere erhält) ist es, was es ermöglicht, dass Gothic für so lange Zeit bleibt und wird zum einen veraltet und zum anderen neu für einen Leser, der sich sehr im Laufe der Zeit von der ursprünglichen Schrift entfernt hat.\nEine der prominentesten gotischen Ideen in gotischen Romanen ist der Begriff von Chivalry. Die mittelalterliche Idee von Chivalry, der Prozess der Schulung eines richtigen Ritters, wird sowohl beibehalten als auch in der ursprünglichen gotischen Erzählung, The Castle of Otranto, verwandelt. Chivalry ist insbesondere für gotische Schriftsteller wichtig, weil es darstellt - den klassischen Ritter, mutig, ehrenhaft, kundig - und das angenommene oder wahrgenommene Fehlen jenes Ideals, das diese Schriftsteller (insbesondere Walpole) in der Gesellschaft sah. Durch die Verwendung der chivalrischen Konzepte und der Manieren wird das \"gotische Vergangene\" idealisiert und romantisiert (hindeutend auf die zukünftige Evolution von Gothic zu Romantik) und wird verwendet, um den gegenwärtigen Zustand zu verbessern. Walpole war, als er The Castle of Otranto schrieb, inmitten politischer Unruhen und war ängstlich über die mögliche Zukunft. Er, in der Politik und (debattierbar) ungerechtfertigte Vorwürfe, möglicherweise sogar, wenn nicht explizit, begann, dass die angenommen Moral und die angeborene \"Güte\" in der Menschheit, die in der gotischen Epoche vorhanden war, in den Individuen, die den 'Gegenwart' Gesellschaft ausmachten, irgendwie verloren gegangen war. In seiner Schrift ist dies klar in mehreren Charakteren zu sehen, einem davon ist der Charakter Frederic. Den Leser kann man sehen, bevor man Frederic trifft, dass er viele chivalrische Züge aufweist, er wird beschrieben als:\n\nDie Beschreibung von ihm umfasst eine große Anzahl traditionell chivalrischer Bilder; Frederic ist, zuallererst, ein Prinz, er hat gelitten, wurde angemessen von Tragödien, die er verließ, betroffen und ist derzeit zu haben, dass er durch Ungläubige getötet wurde. Die Figur des \"galanten und höflichen Ritters\" ist, natürlich, übertrieben, bringt die bald zu werden gotische Tropfen des Exzesses in Gang (66).\n\nEnglish Translation (after translation back from German):\n\n[REWRITE] The traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for \"Old-New'\", as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel.

In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66).[/REWRITE]",
    "transformed": "The traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for \"Old-New'\", as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' phenomenon that it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' imitation of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many references to medieval gothic theater, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\nOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" becomes idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future.

The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",

Der Begriff Supply-Chain-Management wurde 1982 von Keith Oliver erfunden. Keith Oliver beschrieb den Gesamtwert der Planung, Implementierung und Kontrolle, die am Supply-Chain-Prozess abläuft, um die Bedürfnisse der Kunden in einer schnellen und effizienten Weise zu befriedigen.  Es gibt sechs Schlüsselfaktoren im Supply-Chain-Management: Produktion, Lieferung, Lagerhaltung, Standort, Transport und Informationen. Geschäftsführer von Unternehmen verwenden diese sechs Schlüsselfaktoren, um dem Kunden den besten Service zu bieten.\n\nDie Produktion ist der erste Schritt im Supply-Chain-Prozess. Die Produktion ist die Grundlage für den gesamten Supply-Chain-Prozess. Die Produktionsebene wird die Zeit, den Grund, den Ort und die Art und Weise beschreiben, wie alles produziert wird. Manager müssen wissen, was die Kunden wollen. Um dies zu wissen, können Manager den Markt betrachten. Der Markt ist der größte Indikator, um zu bestimmen, was die Kunden verlangen. Sobald Manager den Markt analysiert haben und die Kundenbedürfnisse verstehen, sind sie bereit, zu entscheiden, welche Produkte produziert werden sollten und wie viele davon produziert werden sollten. Nachdem die Führungskraft entschieden hat, was produziert und wie viel produziert wird, sind sie bereit, zu entscheiden, wo die Produkte produziert werden sollten und an welchem Standort es sich für die Mengen und Qualität des Produkts am besten eignet, wobei sich die Kundenbedürfnisse und die Zufriedenheit der Kunden berücksichtigen müssen. Nachdem der Standort für die Produktion der Produkte entschieden ist, geht man auf die nächste Etappe, nämlich die Planung der Arbeitslast und die Wartung der Ausrüstung. Die Produktion ist ein sehr wichtiger Schritt im Supply-Chain-Prozess.  Jedes Detail ist in der ganzen Prozess entscheidend. Wenn alle Details nicht entsprechend geplant werden, könnte dies der Firma im Laufe der Zeit viel Zeit und Geld kosten. Zum Beispiel habe ich in Wal-Mart und Target-Handelsfilialen gearbeitet. Beide Unternehmen haben eine geplante Layout und ein Buch über den Ablauf für jeden Teil der Firma. Es gibt einen geplanten Aufbau, wie die Uniformen der Mitarbeiter aussehen sollten. Die Beziehungen zu Lieferanten und die Beziehungen zu anderen Unternehmen werden durch diesen Ablauf vereinfacht.\n\nDie zweite Schlüsselfaktor im Supply-Chain-Management ist die Lieferung. Die Lieferung wird als strategische Entscheidungen definiert, die getroffen werden sollten, um die Kernfähigkeiten einer Einrichtung zu bestimmen und die Partnerschaften mit externen Unternehmen zu entwickeln. Ein Unternehmen kann viele verschiedene Produktionseinheiten für ein Produkt haben.  Alle Divisionen bestehen aus unterschiedlichen Ausrüstungen, Mitarbeitern und Spezialisten. Der Manager muss entscheiden, welche Division für das Produkt am besten geeignet ist.  Die Führungskraft kann auch beschließen, die Arbeit an andere Unternehmen auszulagern. Die Hauptgründe, warum Manager die Arbeit an Unternehmen auslagern, ist, um Geschwindigkeit zu erzielen. Geschwindigkeit ist die Fähigkeit, Qualität und Flexibilität gleichzeitig zu liefern, während die Kosten reduziert oder auf niedrigem Niveau gehalten werden.\n\nEnglish Translation:\n\n[REWRITE] Supply chain management is the stream of processes that involves moving goods from the customer's order through the raw material stage, the supply chain, production, and distribution of products to the customer.

After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest.

Birma, auch als Myanmar bekannt, ist ein südostasiatisches Land, das von einer diktatorischen Militärjunta regiert wird, die 1962 durch einen Putsch an die Macht kam. Im Jahr 2007 fanden zahlreiche Straßenproteste statt, die erste öffentliche Proteste in einer Dekade. Anführer dieser Proteste waren viele Burmese Mönche, die diese Proteste nach dem Farbton ihrer Gewänder den Namen \"Die Saffron-Revolution\" gaben. Nach den ersten Aufständen begann die Öffentlichkeit in großem Maße Interesse an den Protesten zu zeigen, und während die burmesische Regierung anfangs die Mönche widerwillig dabei erlaubte, friedlich zusammenzukommen, eskalierte die Gewalt schnell zu einem Krieg zwischen den Mönchen und der Militärjunta, mit der Militär, das aktiv in Tempel in der ganzen Land umherzog und ransackte. Ausländische Journalisten wurden auf der Stelle verhaftet, ein japanischer Fotojournalist namens Kenji Nagai wurde am 27. September 2007 einfach nur deswegen getötet, weil er bei einer Straßenprotest teilnahm. Während die offizielle Todeszahl bei 13 liegt, ist Colonel Hla Win, der vor der offiziellen Meldung einige Tage aus der Armee desertiert war, mit den Worten zitiert worden: \"Viele mehr Menschen sind in den letzten Tagen getötet worden als du gehört hast. Die Leichen können in Zehntausenden gezählt werden.\"\n\nDas ist nichts Neues. Während dies nur einige der jüngsten Beispiele von Verbrechen in unserer Welt sind, hat sich seit Längen der Wunsch der Regierung, Widerstand zu unterdrücken und die völlige Herrschaft über ihre Bürger zu behalten, in der Zivilisation selbst bestätigt. Frühere römische Kaiser erklärten sich selbst als von den Göttern auserwählt, um völligen Exekutiv-Recht über jedes Aspekt ihrer Gesellschaft zu haben. Japanische Kaiser werden als Götter angenommen, die in unser Welt geschickt wurden, um ihren Leuten zum Wohl zu führen durch die Erfindung von Motorola-Mobiltelefonen und Hara-Kiri, und unser gegenwärtiger Präsident, George W. Bush, hält wöchentliche Konferenzsitzungen mit Ted Haggard, dem Führer von Stupid People Worldwide, einer Tochtergesellschaft der Republikanischen Partei.\n\nEinige der bekanntesten Beispiele solcher Vorfälle sind die Proteste am 4. Juni 1989 auf dem Tiananmen-Platz, wo Intellektuelle, Arbeitsaktivisten und Studenten sich gegen die autoritäre Herrschaft der Regierung versammelten. Die Todeszahlen in diesem Fall schwanken wild, mit offiziellen Meldungen der chinesischen Regierung, die 200-300 Tote angaben, während die chinesische Rote Kreuz einen Schätzwert von 2.000-3.000 Todesfällen gab. Ein weiteres Beispiel ist der Ruandische Völkermord der 1990er Jahre, wobei Hutu-Milizengruppen, unterstützt vom ruandischen Staat, eine systematische Ermordung aller Tutsis sowie politischer gemäßigter Personen, unabhängig von ihrem ethnischen Hintergrund, begannen. Hitlers \"Drittes Reich\", ein Zeitraum von mehreren Jahren und mehreren Ländern, in dem jede Person jüdischer Herkunft eingefangen und getötet wurde, ist ein weiteres extremes Beispiel.\n\nDie deutsche Übersetzung zurück ins Englische:\n\n[REWRITE] Hitler lives in Burma, the sign reads.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with marker onto her sign.

    "original": "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

Ellington’s Anwesenheit am Klavier ist subtil in vielen der für diese Aufgabe ausgewählten Kompositionen, aber als Komponist hat Ellington sich hervorragend in der Schaffung reicher und komplexer Stücke bewährt, die die individuellen Fähigkeiten der Band Mitglieder hervorheben. Ellington hat das Framework geschaffen, in dem ein Solist frei improvisieren konnte, zusätzlich zu geschriebenen eng orchestrierten Stücken und Phrasen, die auf die spezielle Art der Bandmitglieder abzielten, um musikalische Ideen zu hervorheben. Indem er dies tat, betonte er auch den Ton der Orchester allgemein, indem er kohärente und originelle Klänge für jeden Stück schuf. Ellington’s Meisterschaft über die individuellen Spieler Sound, sowie wie sie sich zusammensetzten in einem wachsenden Ensemble, ermöglichte es ihm, einige der innovativsten und brillantesten Stücke der Jazzgeschichte zu schreiben.\n\nDer Grove Music Dictionary, bei der Diskussion von Ellington’s Sound und Innovation, erwähnt Creole Love Call in Bezug auf die Verwendung von \"Stimme als Instrument\" während seiner Karriere. Dies ist ein frühes Beispiel von Ellington’s Verwendung von Stimme, um Textur und Farbe hinzuzufügen, ohne die Beeinträchtigung durch Lyrics. Creole Love Call demonstriert auch Ellington’s Fähigkeit, den Stil seiner Solisten zu ergänzen, was sich durch seine Karriere hindurch erweist. Dieses langsame, bedachte Zwölf-Takt-Bluesstück enthält sechs Chöre, wie folgt:\nChorus 1: Call und Antwort zwischen Stimme und Reeds, wobei die Stimme beginnt, glatt und melodisch, dann übergeht zu einem raueren Sound gegen Ende.\nChorus 2: Mute Trompetensolo, das die grundlegende Melodie erweitert und mehrere verlängerte Blue-Noten betont.\nChorus 3: Schwungvolles Klarinetten-Solo in einem hohen Register, unterstützt durch einen subtilen syncopierten Klavierphrasen.\nChorus 4: Vollbesetztes Orchester wiederholt den ersten Chorus mit einem Call und Antwort durch die Blech- und Reeds-Abteilungen.\nChorus 5: Das kletterische Chor von dem Stück, da die Reeds beginnen nun das Call und Antwort in einem hohen Register, unterstützt durch syncopierte Stop-Time von der Blech- und Rhythmusabteilungen.\nChorus 6: Ein Rückkehr zur Struktur des ersten Chor, mit Call und Antwort zwischen Stimme und Reeds. In diesem Chor übernimmt die Stimme den Sound der \"Growl\"-Technik, Soloing als ein Instrument.\nTag: Kurze Bezeichnung, die eine vokale Run und eine dissonante Novitätsende durch einen Posaunen zeigt.\nEllington’s Verwendung von Stimme, um eine Dimension von Tonfarbe zu diesem Stück hinzuzufügen, ist ein Beispiel für einen stilistischen Merkmal, das seine Arbeit durchzieht.\nIn Hot and Bothered, aufgenommen ein Jahr später, kombiniert Ellington seine Fähigkeit, enge Orchestrierung mit seinem Gehör für eine Tonfarbe. Ein Call und Antwort zwischen \"Bubber\" Miley auf der gedämpften Trompete und Baby Cox’s Skat-Singing verwendet die vokalen Elemente von Miley’s Spiel und instrumentalen Aspekte von Cox’s Stimme, um eine reiche und komplementäre Klangfarbe zu schaffen. Es Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) erweitert diese Ideen, als Ellington die Verwendung von Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, ein Hauptstütze in Ellington’s Orchester, zum großen Erfolg verwendet, um die Melodie auf gedämpfter Trompete einzuführen.\n\nAngesichts der Tatsache, dass das Originaltext sehr umfangreich war, habe ich die Übersetzung in zwei Teile geteilt. Hier ist die Übersetzung in der gewünschten Reihenfolge (Deutsch, dann Englisch):\n\nDer Originaltext in Deutsch:\nDuke Ellington’s Erbe in der Jazzmusik leitet sich im großen Teil von seiner Lebensdauer und, durch Extension, seine kreativen Fähigkeiten, um seine Orchester zu formen.

Indem er dies tat, betonte er auch den Ton der Orchester allgemein, indem er kohärente und originelle Klänge für jeden Stück schuf. Ellington’s Meisterschaft über die individuellen Spieler Sound, sowie wie sie sich zusammensetzten in einem wachsenden Ensemble, ermöglichte es ihm, einige der innovativsten und brillantesten Stücke der Jazzgeschichte zu schreiben.\nDer Grove Music Dictionary, bei der Diskussion von Ellington’s Sound und Innovation, erwähnt Creole Love Call in Bezug auf die Verwendung von \"Stimme als Instrument\" während seiner Karriere. Dies ist ein frühes Beispiel von Ellington’s Verwendung von Stimme, um Textur und Farbe hinzuzufügen, ohne die Beeinträchtigung durch Lyrics. Creole Love Call demonstriert auch Ellington’s Fähigkeit, den Stil seiner Solisten zu ergänzen, was sich durch seine Karriere hindurch erweist. Dieses langsame, bedachte Zwölf-Takt-Bluesstück enthält sechs Chöre, wobei das Beispiel des Chor wie folgt ist:\nChorus 1: Call und Antwort zwischen Stimme und Reeds, wobei die Stimme beginnt, glatt und melodisch, dann übergeht zu einem raueren Sound gegen Ende.\nChorus 2: Mute Trompetensolo, das die grundlegende Melodie erweitert und mehrere verlängerte Blue-Noten betont.\nChorus 3: Schwungvolles Klarinetten-Solo in einem hohen Register, unterstützt durch einen subtilen syncopierten Klavierphrasen.\nChorus 4: Vollbesetztes Orchester wiederholt den ersten Chor mit einem Call und Antwort durch die Blech- und Reeds-Abteilungen.\nChorus 5: Das kletterische Chor von dem Stück, da die Reeds beginnen nun das Call und Antwort in einem hohen Register, unterstützt durch syncopierte Stop-Time von der Blech- und Rhythmusabteilungen.\nChorus 6: Ein Rückkehr zur Struktur des ersten Chor, mit Call und Antwort zwischen Stimme und Reeds. In diesem Chor übernimmt die Stimme den Sound der \"Growl\"-Technik, Soloing als ein Instrument.\nTag: Kurze Bezeichnung, die eine vokale Run und eine dissonante Novitätsende durch einen Posaunen zeigt.\nEllington’s Verwendung von Stimme, um eine Dimension von Tonfarbe zu diesem Stück hinzuzufügen, ist ein Beispiel für einen stilistischen Merkmal, das seine Arbeit durchzieht.\nIn Hot and Bothered, aufgenommen ein Jahr später, kombiniert Ellington seine Fähigkeit, enge Orchestrierung mit seinem Gehör für eine Tonfarbe. Ein Call und Antwort zwischen \"Bubber\" Miley auf der gedämpften Trompete und Baby Cox’s Skat-Singing verwendet die vokalen Elemente von Miley’s Spiel und instrumentalen Aspekte von Cox’s Stimme, um eine reiche und komplementäre Klangfarbe zu schaffen. Es Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) erweitert diese Ideen, als Ellington die Verwendung von Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, ein Hauptstütze in Ellington’s Orchester, zum großen Erfolg verwendet, um die Melodie auf gedämpfter Trompete einzuführen.\n\nUnd hier ist die Übersetzung zurück ins Englische:\n\n[REWRITE]\nDuke Ellington's legacy in jazz is largely due to his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington's presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this project, but as a composer, Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that highlighted the individual abilities of band members. Ellington created the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. By doing so, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating cohesive and original sounds for each piece. Ellington's mastery of the individual players' sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music Dictionary, in discussing Ellington's sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice \"as a jazz instrument\" throughout his career. This is an early example of Ellington's use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington's ability to complement the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus, the voice takes on the sound of the \"growl\" technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington's use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley's playing and instrumental aspects of Cox's voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington's orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.\n[/REWRITE]",

Einige hatten sich in sie verliebt und waren durch die peinlichen Versuche, sie zu beeindrucken, gegangen, aber niemand hatte ihre Aufmerksamkeit erregt. Sie fragte sich oft mit diesem merkwürdigen Gedanken, versuchte, darüber nachzudenken, was es war, was so ein seltsames Ding in einem Teenagermädchen verursachen konnte.

Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",

Die Arbeitslosigkeit stieg, der Immobilienmarkt brach zusammen und viele der größten und wichtigsten Unternehmen Amerikas blieben in Ruin zurück. Diese Rezession dauert bis heute an, daher muss man sich die Frage stellen: Wie kam diese Krise zustande und wie können wir sie stoppen? Kurz gesagt, wurde die Finanzkrise durch selbstsüchtige und naiv politische Entscheidungen geschaffen, die Banken und Firmen unter Druck setzten, Subprinzipen-Kredite in ein bereits unzureichendes finanzielles Infrastruktursystem zu geben. Währenddessen wurden Fannie Mae (FNMA) und Freddie Mac (FHLMC) unter Druck gesetzt, diese Hypotheken zu unterzeichnen und zu zerkleinern in CDOs und CDSs umzuwandeln. Als die Gläubiger diese Kredite nicht einzahlen konnten, waren die Banken an Kapitalreserven knapp und übertrugen diesen Chaos auf die neu verpackten Hypotheken, die sie verkauft hatten, und auf das restliche Wirtschaftssystem.\n\nDie Wurzeln der Finanzkrise lagen im Jahr 1999 der Ära Clinton, als der Präsident sich auf eine zweite Amtszeit vorbereitete. Er strebte danach, seine Popularität zu steigern. Um dies zu erreichen, lockerte die Clinton-Regierung die Kreditbeschränkungen, was ein düsteres Szenario für die Subprinzipen-Krise sieben Jahre später schuf. Steven Holmes von der New York Times berichtete im Jahr 1999: „Fannie Mae, der größte Unterzeichner von Wohnhypotheken im Land, war unter zunehmendem Druck von der Clinton-Regierung, Kredite unter geringen und mittleren Einkommensgruppen zu erweitern und fühlte sich von Aktionären zu seiner außergewöhnlichen Gewinneinzug im ständigen Wachstum unter Druck gesetzt.\" Holmes ging weiterhin daran, die Folgen dieser Maßnahmen vorauszusagen: „Aber die von der Regierung geförderte Gesellschaft könnte in einer Rezession in Schwierigkeiten geraten und könnte eine Rettungsaktion der Regierung ähnlich der der Sparkassenbranche in den 1980er Jahren auslösen.\" Wie im Einführungsdurchblick erwähnt und von Holmes vorausgesehen, führte unberatene Kreditgeschäfte zweifellos zum Zusammenbruch der Wirtschaft.\n\nViele Faktoren trugen dazu bei, dass die Wirtschaft in einen Abstieg versank, darunter die neue und komplexen Struktur von Hypotheken. Variable-Zins-Hypotheken, Hypotheken-Sicherheiten und Sichergelderhebungsverpflichtungen (CDOs) wurden in den Jahren vor der Krise weit verbreitet eingesetzt und sollten nur noch mehr Sektoren der Wirtschaft in den Immobilienmarkt einbeziehen. Dies führte dazu, dass U.S.-Haushalte und Finanzmärkte insgesamt sich selbst übermäßig in den Immobilienmarkt hineinleckten, was sie extrem anfällig für sogar kleine Preisänderungen machte.\n\nTatsächlich zerplatzte der Immobilienblasen, und die Finanzinstitute, die diese Hypotheken-Sicherheiten gekauft hatten, wurden übervorteilt. Die fünf größten US-Investmentbanken berichteten zusammen 2007 über 4,1 Billionen Dollar Hypotheken-Schulden, was etwa 30% des USA-Bruttoinlandsprodukts entspricht. Am Ende wurden Bear Sterns und Merrill Lynch außerordentlich günstig verkauft, Lehman Brothers wurde aufgelöst und Goldman Sachs und Morgan Stanley wurden gezwungen, Banken zu werden, die intensiv reguliert wurden. Fannie und Freddie hatten 5 Billionen Dollar Hypotheken-Schulden, und wurden im September 2008 unter Regierungskontrolle gestellt.\n\nEnglish translation back to English:\n\n[REWRITE]In 2007, the United States of America slid into a massive financial crisis.

Im Film passiert die Exposition, wenn ein Charakter einem anderen eine Core-Dump-Information anvertraut, ähnlich \"Der Rime of the Ancient Mariner\".  In der Fiktion macht der Autor die Geschichte.\n\nEin Beispiel ist angebracht.  Wenn du eine Geschichte liest, wirst du gesagt, dass die Heldin ihren Geliebten in einem bestimmten Ort und zu einem bestimmten Zeitpunkt traf, dass sie in einer Gala heirateten und dass ihr Gatte vor ihren Augen ermordet wurde.

Du würdest erwarten, dass der Autor Zeit auf die Einführung der Person des Ehemanns verwendet, indem er durch dessen Sprache und Benehmen zeigt, wie tief er seine Frau liebt, und du würdest genauso erwarten, dass die Heldin durch große und kleine Weise zeigt, wie sehr die Anwesenheit ihres Gatten in ihrem Leben veränderte und bereicherte (besonders wenn die Geschichte dir später auf den Boden nimmt, dass dies der Fall ist).  Eine angemessene Einführung in die Figur des Ehemanns würde es ermöglichen, dass du dich emotional mit seinem Schicksal verbunden fühlst und die Heldin selbst besser verstehst: Was sah sie in ihm? Wie tief war ihre Bindung zueinander? Klarheit über ihre Gedanken, Überzeugungen, Träume und so weiter, die durch seine Augen reflektiert werden.  Du würdest mit ihr um sein Leben trauern und dich dadurch noch mehr mit der Heldin selbst verbinden.\n\nZusammengefasst, du würdest erwarten, dass es Fleisch auf dem Knochen der Handlung gibt: \"Sie trafen sich, sie heirateten, er starb.\"\n\nAls Autor musst du das Fleisch liefern.  (*sieht auf Metapher, seufzt, geht weiter*)  Manchmal ist es verlockend, gewisse Dinge zu übergehen.  Vielleicht bringst du einen neuen Charakter ein und weißt, dass er früher in der Luftwaffe war und jetzt Nacht-Manager an einem Tankstellens ist, er war zweimal verheiratet, keine Kinder, mag am Wochenende Angeln gehen, heimlich träumt davon, den Tankstellens eines Tages zu besitzen und hat Eier benediktin fürs Frühstück.\n\n[REWRITE] Ah, exposition.

The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",

Die Hauptgeschichte handelte von einem Mann in Ashley, Ohio, der seine Ehefrau erstochen hatte. Sein Name war Shad Hostettler, aber die Frau wurde nicht genannt. Sie zeigten sein Polizeifoto, und er sah wie ein echter Bösewicht aus. Sie widmeten nur etwa zwei Minuten dieser Geschichte, da sie sich gerade entwickelte. Es wurden nur wenige Details genannt, nämlich, dass er sie mehrmals erstochen und verhaftet worden war. Ich denke, sie haben sich auf diese Geschichte genügend Zeit eingebracht.\n\nDie zweite Geschichte handelte von einem Angriff während der frühen Morgenstunden auf Travis Buyers, 18 Jahre alt. Er wurde in der Sharon-Woods-Gegend angeschossen und lag schwer verletzt im Krankenhaus; es waren noch keine Festnahmen gemacht worden oder Verdächtige. Die SWAT-Einheit untersuchte das Verbrechen. Diese Geschichte schien kurz zu sein, und ich denke, das möglicherweise lag daran, dass dies ein \"schwarzer\" Mann oder eine schwarze Nachbarschaft war. Ich habe (und habe dies jahrelang bemerkt) festgestellt, dass Minderheiten bei Verbrechen als Opfer weggelassen werden. Wenn beispielsweise ein \"weißer\" Kind oder Erwachsener entführt oder missbraucht wird oder ein Opfer eines Verbrechens ist, wird die Medien aufhören zu schreien; aber wenn ein Minderheitensperson ist, ist es Glück, wenn sie einmal erwähnt wird.\n\nDie nächste Geschichte handelte von einer Schusslöchern, die in einem Med-Flugzeug gefunden worden waren. Details wurden genannt, wo sie dachten, dass der Vorfall passiert war. Es war festgestellt worden, dass es sich um eine 0,22 Kaliber-Kugel aus einem Gewehr handelte, die das Flugzeug getroffen hatte. Crime-Stoppers bieten einen fünftausend Dollar Belohnung für Hinweise, die zur Festnahme des Schützen führen.\n\nDie nächste Geschichte handelte von einem Diebstahl in einer UDF an der Clime Road in Columbus. Sie sagten, dass ein dunkelhäutiger Schwarzer Mann den Laden ausgeraubt hatte, er trug eine Kapuzen-Pullover. Sie sagten, er sei etwa 1,80 Meter groß und wiegen etwa 68 Kilo. Ich fand es eigenartig, dass sie so viel Zeit darauf verwendeten, darauf hinzuweisen, dass er schwarz war und wie dunkel er war.\n\nEine andere Geschichte handelte von Rene Rodriguez, einem in Texas wegen Drogenhandels verurteilten Kingpin. Er war wegen des Versuchs, große Mengen Marihuana aus Texas nach Ohio zu verteilen, verurteilt worden. Ein interessantes Detail, das ich beobachtet habe, war, dass stattdessen von \"300\" Monaten die Rede war, anstatt dass er zu 25 Jahren im Gefängnis verurteilt worden war. Ich bin nicht sicher, ob sie dachten, das klang hinhaltender oder was. Sie erwähnten auch, dass es sich um einen hispanischen Mann handelte, aber ich glaube, das war nicht für die Geschichte relevant.\n\nEnglish translation:\n\n[REWRITE] I watched two newscasts from Columbus, Ohio.

One curious thing I noted was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said \"300\" months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man; I do not believe that was really relevant to the story.",

    "raw_output": "The original English text in German translation is:\n\nEs besteht ein Band zwischen Brüdern; ein unzerbrechliches, unwiderrufliches Band. Innerhalb dieses Bandes liegen viele Emotionen: Liebe, Stolz, Neid, und Grausamkeit, nur um ein paar zu nennen. Brüder verstehen einander, viel besser als jeder andere mit diesem Art von Bindung, und sie können nur sich selbst sehen, wenn sie ihren Bruder anschauen. Es ist, wenn eine Situation am schlimmsten ist, wenn die wahre Natur dieses Bandes durchscheint, sei es gut oder schlecht. Wenn diese Emotionen klar werden, tragen sie mit sich eine große Kosten. Teil des Verständnisses der Emotionen, die aus diesem Bruderband entstehen, ist das Umgang mit den Konsequenzen, die sie mit sich bringen. Wenn man einem Bruder ins Auge sehen und in jener Person ihren eigenen Reflex sehen kann, sieht man sich selbst nicht wie die anderen, sondern wie man wirklich ist. In ihren Handlungen und den Konsequenzen ihrer Handlungen liegt ihr wahres Charakter. In „Der Rubinibis“ erkunden zwei Brüder dieses Thema und all der tobenden Emotionen, die daran hängen. Durch eine üppige, lebhaft beschriebenen Landschaft, setzen diese zwei Jungen auf eine sinnlose Reise aus. Bittere Enttäuschung kollidiert mit intensivem Stolz in der dramatischen Szene, und nur einer von den Brüdern entkommt mit seinem Leben. Das Thema wird durch direkte Charakterisierung des Protagonisten, Doodle, und ihrer Interaktionen miteinander, sowie durch den Erzähler's Perspektive, die die komplexen Gefühle, die der Protagonist und seine Sicht der Welt um ihn herum, beide derer stark beeinflusst sind, kommuniziert.\n\nDie Handlungen des Protagonisten können alle zusammengefasst werden durch eine Schlüsselfigur: Stolz. Von dem Moment an, als er und sein kleiner Bruder, Doodle, gemeinsam herausgehen, bis zu ihrem letzten, fatalem Ausflug, fühlt sich der Protagonist gegenüber Doodle verärgert. Er hatte sich gewünscht einen Bruder, den er alle seine weltlichen Fähigkeiten beibringen konnte, wie „...bei Atem anzuhalten, zu laufen, zu springen oder die Reben in Old Woman Swamp zu erklimmen...“ Er wollte einen Bruder, der '...' zu Horsehead Landing rennen und mit ihm in der Spitze des großen Kiefernastes hinter der Scheune sitzen könne...' offensichtlich sind diese Dinge unmöglich, gegeben Doodles Zustand. Doodle wurde mit einem extrem schwachen Herz geboren, was es unwahrscheinlich, dass er überleben würde. Selbst dann war es fast unmöglich, dass er jemals an körperlich anstrengenden Aktivitäten teilnehmen würde. Was für ein Schlag für den jungen Protagonisten, dessen Kopf voller wilder Fantasien war, um all die Träume, die in einer Sekunde zerschmettert wurden. Tatsächlich ist er sogar gezeigt, als er Wut gegen den kleinen Jungen zeigt, als er sich daran erinnert, überlegte, ihn zu erwürgen, indem er ihm ein Kissen auf den Mund legte. Was für ein Kind hätte die Gegenwart von Vernunft, um Mord an einem Kind zu planen? Doch als der kleine Jüngling ihn anlächelte, wurde sein Herz weich. Ein einfaches Handeln gab dem Protagonisten so viel Hoffnung! Dies zeigt, dass seine Überzeugung wahrscheinlich nicht sehr stark war. Im Hintergrund seines Gehirns hatte er eine instinktive Liebe für seinen Bruder.\n\nThe back-translated English text is:\n\n[REWRITE]There is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond.

As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time.

Mit dem Fortschritt der Technologie veränderte sich auch die verwendeten Metaphern, um das Gehirn zu beschreiben. Zunächst wurde es mit einer Wachstafel verglichen, dann mit einem Papyrusblatt, dann mit einem Buch und schließlich mit einem Computer. Wenn Sie über das Gehirn lernen, behalten Sie im Hinterkopf, dass die Nützlichkeit dieser Metaphern begrenzt ist und zu falschen Schlussfolgerungen führen kann.\n\nDie Informationsverarbeitung beginnt mit Eingaben von den Sinnesorganen, die physische Reize wie Berührung, Hitze, Schallwellen oder Lichtquanten in elektrochemische Signale umwandeln. Die sensorische Information wird mehrmals durch die Algorithmen des Gehirns in beiden bottom-up- und top-down-Verarbeitungsprozessen transformiert. Zum Beispiel, wenn Sie ein Bild von einem schwarzen Box auf einem weißen Hintergrund ansehen, analysiert bottom-up-Verarbeitung sehr einfache Informationen wie Farbe, Orientierung und wo die Grenzen des Objekts sind – wobei die Farbe über einen kurzen Abstand signifikant ändert –, um zu entscheiden, dass Sie einen Box sehen. Top-down-Verarbeitung nutzt die Entscheidungen, die bei einigen Schritten des bottom-up-Prozesses getroffen werden, um Ihre Erkennung der Box zu beschleunigen. Top-down-Verarbeitung in diesem Beispiel kann Ihnen dabei helfen, das Objekt als schwarze Box zu identifizieren, anstatt als Box-förmiges Loch im weißen Hintergrund.\n\nWenn Informationen zu einem gewissen Grad verarbeitet sind, entscheidet ein Aufmerksamkeitsfilter, wie wichtig das Signal ist und welche kognitiven Prozesse es zugänglich gemacht werden sollten. Zum Beispiel verarbeiten Sie alle Gräser, wenn Sie nach unten auf Ihre Schuhe schauen, aber ein gesunder Aufmerksamkeitsfilter verhindert, dass Sie sie einzeln wahrnehmen. Im Gegensatz dazu können Sie Ihr eigenes Namens finden, auch wenn es in einem lauten Raum ausgesprochen wird. Es gibt viele Stufen der Verarbeitung, und die Ergebnisse der Verarbeitung werden durch Aufmerksamkeit wiederholt moduliert.\n\nDamit das Gehirn Informationen verarbeiten kann, muss es zuerst gespeichert werden. Es gibt mehrere Arten von Gedächtnissen, einschließlich sensorischem, arbeitendem und langfristigem. Zuerst wird die Information kodiert. Es gibt spezifische Kodierungen für jeden Typ von sensorischen Reizen. Zum Beispiel kann verbaler Input struktural kodiert werden, was sich auf das Aussehen der gedruckten Wörter bezieht, phonemisch, was sich auf den Klang des Wortes bezieht, oder semantisch, was sich auf den Sinn des Wortes bezieht. Sobald Informationen gespeichert sind, müssen sie aufrechterhalten werden. Einige tierexperimentelle Studien schlagen vor, dass die arbeitende Erinnerung, die Informationen für etwa 20 Sekunden speichert, durch ein elektrisches Signal unterhalten wird, das sich in einer bestimmten Folge von Neuronen für einen kurzen Zeitraum wiederholt. Informationen in langfristigem Gedächtnis werden angenommen, in der Struktur bestimmter Arten von Proteinen aufzubewahren.\n\nEs gibt zahlreiche Modelle, wie das Wissen in der Hirn organisiert ist, einige basieren auf der Art und Weise, wie Menschen Erinnerungen abrufen, andere basieren auf Computertechnologie und andere auf Neurophysiologie. Das semantische Netzwerkmodell besagt, dass es Knoten gibt, die Konzepte darstellen, und dass die Knoten nach ihrer Verwandtschaft vernetzt sind. Zum Beispiel könnte in einem semantischen Netzwerk \"Stuhl\" an \"Tisch\" gelinkt sein, was an \"Holz\" gelinkt werden kann, usw.\n\nHere is the translation back to English:\n\n[REWRITE] The human brain is a complex, creative information-processing system.

Die Menschen werten die Gemeinschaft über den Einzelnen an und werden von Anfang an konditioniert, um unmittelbares Glück über alles andere zu verfolgen. Die Bürger werden als Spielsteine in einem größeren Spiel entlarvt, die in einem von der Weltbeherrscherin diktierten Ideologie gefangen sind. Durch die Untersuchung des Werks unter dem Prisma des Marxismus wird man die verborgenen Bedenken des Autors in Bezug auf die Entwicklung der genannten Systeme bemerken. Häufige Termini im Marxismus, wie Homogenität und Reifikation, unter anderem, stärken die Idee, dass Huxleys Roman eine Kritik an den Fehlern in der sich entwickelnden Wirtschaft seiner Zeit ist.\n\nDer Kapitalismus wird durch die Verwendung des marxistischen Thesen, des falschen Bewusstseins, satirisch dargestellt. Im Wesentlichen wird den gewöhnlichen Bürgerinnen und Bürgern die wahren Beziehungen zu anderen Klassen in wirtschaftlichen Begriffen vorenthalten, da sie hauptsächlich an ihrem eigenen Gewinn interessiert sind. Es wird behauptet, dass dies das Ergebnis der ideologischen Kontrolle der Proletarier und der gemeinsamen Arbeiter ist, was offensichtlich durch die Konditionierung der Menschen in \"Brave New World\" ist. Die unteren Klassen, Delta, Gamma usw., haben keine wahre eigene Willensäußerung; durch Hypnopaedie wird der Wunsch zu konsumieren, zu verschwenden, zu genießen gestärkt über alles andere. Dies wird, wie bereits erwähnt, durch die Weltbeherrscherin manipuliert. Hegemonie, im Wesentlichen die Idee, dass Gruppen der sozialen Klassen von einer separaten Gruppe von Individuen in ihrer Gesamtheit beherrscht werden, wird in diesem Fall offensichtlich verwendet. Die unteren Klassen sind völlig von der Manipulation unbewusst, fast wörtlich „[kaufen] sich in eine Ideologie ein, die die Struktur unterstützt“ (d. h. Kapitalismus & Konsumismus). Die oberen Klassen werden mit der Fähigkeit geboren, es zu erkennen, aber tun nichts; nur wenige Alphas oder Betas außer Charakteren wie Bernard tun mehr als das. In der Tat sind die Interaktionen der sozialen Klassen, wie im größeren Umfang besprochen wird, bedeutende Anzeichen der wahrgenommenen Unterdrückung des Kapitalismus.\nMögliche Beziehungen zwischen disparaten Individuen existieren in \"Brave New World\" nicht. Der Roman scheint die Charaktere zu verweigern, sie fehlen sogar unter den Hauptfiguren an Tiefe. Vielleicht will Huxley andeuten, dass die Entwicklung der Technologie und des Kapitalismus zusammen mangelnde Freiwilligkeit und Ausdruckskraft des Menschen nehmen. Liebe existiert nicht, noch die Extreme eines bestimmten Gefühls; vielmehr werden die Interaktionen auf der Oberfläche gehalten, dargestellt durch die Bemerkungen der Männer über Frauen hauptsächlich über ihre körperliche Erscheinung (d. h. pneumatische Qualität), und die unverhohlenen Kommentare der Frauen über ihre Begegnungen, sozusagen. Zudem zeigt die absolute Anhänglichkeit jeder sozialen Klasse an ihren Rang im Hierarchy die sozioökonomische Auswirkung des Kapitalismus. Ihre absolute Treue zu ihrer Rolle in der Gemeinschaft ist ein Indiz des marxistischen Gedankengutes über die Proletarier, die sich falsch versichert fühlen, über alles andere zu stehen, solange sie weiter konsumieren, gehorchen, sich mit dem Rest ihrer Peers einigen.\n\n[REWRITE] \nAldous Huxley critiques the impending threat of both technology and the capitalist structure, as it's reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel \"Brave New World\".

In fact, the interactions of the social classes, as discussed in greater length, are significant indicators of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\n\nRelationships between disparate individuals do not exist in \"Brave New World\". The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through the males' remarks about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females' unashamed comments about their encounters, so to speak. Furthermore, each societal class' complacency with their status in the hierarchy is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely assured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.",

    "original": "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week.

    "raw_output": "The original German translation and back-translation might look a bit different due to the complexities of English-to-German and German-to-English translations, and the nuances of word choice. However, I will attempt to provide the requested translations.\n\nFirst, I will translate the original text to German:\n\nIch bin seit etwa zwei und ein halb Jahren Student an der University Park. Viele, einschließlich mir selbst, haben Schwierigkeiten, sich auf dem Campus zurechtzufinden. Im ersten Jahr war ich in einem Zimmer in den East Halls untergebracht; praktisch der östlichste Punkt des Campus, wenn man den Stadion und den Bryce Jordan Center nicht mitzählt. Die Fahrt von meinem Zuhause in Stuart Hall zu Kursen in Orten wie dem Willard-Gebäude, das nahe dem Campuszentrum liegt, kann bis zu 25 Minuten Fußweg dauern, besonders, wenn das Wetter schlecht ist, wie es in State College oft der Fall ist. Als ich mit einem alten Alum sprach, erfuhr ich, dass die East-Halls-Schulhäuser nicht lange Zeit in einem abgelegenen Teil des Campus standen und von den übrigen Teilen des Campus durch große unbebaute Flächen getrennt waren. Heute hat man diese leeren Flächen mit Sportplätzen, neuen Gebäuden wie dem neuen Creamery und dem neuen Gesundheitsdienst-Zentrum sowie mit Wohnanlagen umgeben. Bei der ständigen Erweiterung unseres Campus wird es immer schwieriger, von einem Ort zum anderen zu gelangen. Welche Lösung ist die beste zur Mobilitätsproblematik? Auf einem College-Campus ist das Fahrrad die Lösung. Aber das Fahrrad alleine löst keinerlei Probleme. Die Studenten müssen darauf reiten und der Campus muss den Bedürfnissen der Fahrradfahrer angepasst werden.\n\nIch sprach mit einem Freund von mir, der kürzlich nach einer mehrjährigen Pause wieder Fahrradfahren begann. Er fragte sich, warum er jemals aufgehört hatte. \"Fahrräder sind großartig\", sagte er. \"Für einige Jahre war es nicht cool, ein Fahrrad zu fahren, aber es ist die beste Möglichkeit, sich zu bewegen.\" Neben der positiven Auswirkung auf den Körper ist Fahrradfahren die effizienteste Art, sich zu bewegen. Ein Teller Haferflocken und ein bisschen körperliche Anstrengung können dich 30 Meilen oder mehr zurücklegen. Wie viele Studierende bin ich auch unter denjenigen, die außerhalb des Campus leben; genauso weit vom Campuszentrum entfernt wie einige Schulhäuser. Die intelligenteste Entscheidung, die ich in diesem Jahr getroffen habe, war es, ein Fahrrad zu kaufen. Jeden Tag habe ich einen Kurs in Thomas Gebäude, der leicht 25 Minuten Fußweg von meinem Zuhause entfernt ist. Wenn ich schnell genug fahre, kann das Fahrrad die Zeit von 25 Minuten auf 5 Minuten reduzieren. Das einzige Problem ist, dass Pollock Road die direkteste Route zum Thomas-Gebäude von meinem Haus ist und sie ist nicht immer eine einfache Route, sei es mit dem Fahrrad oder ohne. Es gibt Dinge, die für das Walken zu sagen sind, aber persönlich habe ich nicht genug Zeit, um zu Fuß zu gehen. Wenn ich kein Fahrrad hätte, wäre das Walken meine einzige zuverlässige Option, um auf den Unterricht zu gelangen. Jeden Tag zum Thomas-Gebäude zu gehen würde mir zusätzliche 30 bis 40 Minuten abnehmen, das ist fast 2,5 Stunden pro Woche. Dazu kommen die Zeit, die ich für andere Kurse, Terminplanungen und anderer Dinge aufwenden müsste. Das ist mehr Zeit, als ich mir leisten kann.\n\nNow, the German text translated back to English:\n\n[REWRITE]\nI've been a student at University Park for about two and a half years now.
