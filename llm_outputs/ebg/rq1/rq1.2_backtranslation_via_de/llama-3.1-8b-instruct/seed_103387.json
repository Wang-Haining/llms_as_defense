Werte, die ich der Sozialarbeit zu bieten habe, sind unter anderem: Dienst, Respekt, ethische Natur, der Einsatz, um Beziehungen zwischen anderen zu verbessern und mich selbst professionell zu verbessern, um in meinem Bereich kompetent zu bleiben. Diese Grundwerte sind nicht nur für Sozialarbeiter wichtig; sie sind mir persönlich wichtig.\n\nIch habe immer schon helfen wollen, aber ich war mir unsicher, welcher Berufspfad ich verfolgen wollte. Während meiner Jahre in der Schule und im College habe ich viele Menschen gesehen, die ihre Probleme ignorierten und ein paar Personen, die weniger als ideale Ersatzmechanismen nutzten. Aufgrund der Situationen, die ich gesehen habe, entschied ich mich für ein Bachelor-Studium in Psychologie. Noch immer unsicher, welcher Berufspfad ich verfolgen sollte, beschloss ich, nach meinem Abschluss an der Piedmont College im Jahr 2009 eine Pause einzulegen. Eines Tages besuchte ich einen Freund, der mich einem 16-jährigen Jungen vorstellte, der nervös auf seinem Sofa saß. Er erklärte mir, warum er ihn besuchte: um vor seinen misshandelnden Eltern zu fliehen. Am nächsten Tag erfuhr ich, dass er die Polizei bei seinen Eltern angerufen hatte. Um zu sehen, ob ich irgendwie helfen konnte, fuhr ich zu seinem Elternhaus. Als ich dort war, erklärte ich meinen Bedenken privat den Polizisten und sagte ihnen, dass ich gerade mit einem Abschluss in Psychologie von der Piedmont College abgeschlossen hatte. Die Polizei bat mich, mit den Eltern zu sprechen, da es für den Teenager nichts gab, was der Gesetzgebung tun konnte. Als ich die Eltern zu dem Vorfall befragte, sahen sie nervös aus und verwendeten Ausreden, um ihr Sohnes „manipulative“es Verhalten zu beschreiben, das sich an äußeren Stellen beschwerte, um „ganz einfache“ Streitigkeiten zu lösen. Nach dieser bestimmten Erfahrung begann ich, mich ernsthaft für eine Karriere in der Sozialarbeit zu entscheiden, um Kindern mit „ganz einfachen“ Streitigkeiten zwischen Familienmitgliedern zu helfen.\n\nEin weiterer Wert, der für den Bereich der Sozialarbeit wichtig ist, ist soziale Gerechtigkeit. Als Gesellschaft behaupten wir, dass der Einzelne wichtig ist und wir jene trauern, die wir verloren haben. Das Konzept des Einzelnen, das die Gesellschaft hält, ist mehr ein Anhänger alter Traditionen als tatsächliche Einzigartigkeit. Wenn also die Gesellschaft die verlorenen Individuen trauert, warum streben wir danach, ähnlich wie „jeder andere“ zu sein? Ich bin ein Einzelner und genieße es nicht, Einschränkungen auf mich zu legen, um ähnlich wie andere zu sein. Während meiner Jahre an der Schule und im College protestierte ich gegen soziale Unrecht, wann immer ich konnte: Ich färbte meine Haare unnatürliche Farben, trug Kleidung, die meinem Charakter entsprach, steckte meine Ohren über die traditionelle Art hinaus durchstechen, erklärte meine Beteiligung an der GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), kämpfte gegen Rassismus und Diskriminierung, wenn ich sie beobachtete, usw. Ich glaube an soziale Gerechtigkeit und werde weiterhin gegen soziales Unrecht protestieren.\n\nEnglish translation of the German text:\n\n[REWRITE] In pursuing a degree in social work, I have decided to follow a career path with the Department of Family and Child Services to help children who have been abused or neglected, and provide support for troubled families.

The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models.

The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences.

Das biologische Modell konzentriert sich auf genetische Informationen, die erbt werden können, sowie medizinische Aspekte der Gesundheit. Die sozio-kulturellen Modelle betrachten Umweltbeziehungen und ihre Anwendungen auf Rasse, Ethnie, Demografie und sozioökonomischen Status. Diese Übersicht über Schlafstörungen untersucht diese Modelle und erklärt jedes Stück Forschung, das ausgewählt wurde, um sich auf und um die Modelle besser zu erklären. Die Erklärungen der Forschung und ihrer Ergebnisse werden dann kritisiert, um ihre spezifischen Stärken und Schwächen zu erwähnen.\n\nEine Schlafstörung kann als eine primäre Schlafstörung, eine Schlafstörung, die mit einer anderen psychischen Störung zusammenhängt, oder eine Schlafstörung, die mit anderen Problemen zusammenhängt, gekennzeichnet werden. Die primären Schlafstörungen sind Dyssomnien oder Parasomnien, während Schlafstörungen, die mit einer anderen psychischen Störung zusammenhängen, mit einem Axis I- oder Axis II-Störung zusammenhängen. Andere Kategorien von Schlafstörungen können auf medizinische Komplikationen oder die Einnahme einer Substanz zurückzuführen sein. Die Dyssomnien sind: Primäre Insomnie, Primäre Hypersomnie, Narcolepsie, Schlafbezogene Atmungsstörung, Schlaf-Rhythmus-Störung und Dyssomnie Nicht Anderweitig Spezifiziert (NOS). Während die primäre Insomnie eine Komplikation in der ausreichenden oder gewährleisteten Schlaf darstellt, ist die primäre Hypersomnie eine Schwierigkeit bei der Aufrechterhaltung des Wachseins, beides für mindestens einen Monat. Die Narcolepsie beinhaltet Kataplexie und/ oder automatische REM. Während die Dyssomnien sich auf das Beginnen und Aufrechterhalten des Schlafs konzentrieren, sind die Parasomnien Schlafstörungen, die mit Verhaltensanomalien und/ oder physiologischen Vorkommnissen verbunden sind. Die Parasomnien sind Albtraumstörung, Schlaf-Terror-Störung, Schlafgänger-Störung und Parasomnien Nicht Anderweitig Spezifiziert. Die Schlafstörungen, die mit einer anderen psychischen Störung zusammenhängen, umfassen Schlafschwierigkeiten aufgrund von Axis I (Klinische Störungen) oder Axis II (Persönlichkeitsstörungen oder geistige Behinderung). Diese Übersicht konzentriert sich auf Insomnie und zum Teil auf primäre Schlafstörungen im Allgemeinen in Bezug auf die biologischen und sozio-kulturellen Modelle.\n\nDas biologische Modell der Schlafstörungen konzentriert sich auf Gene, erbbare Faktoren und physiologisch erworbenen Aspekte der Schlafstörungen. Neuronen im Hypothalamus, die Orexin enthalten, sind für die Regulation des Schlafs und der Wachheit verantwortlich. Diese Studie experimentierte mit Mäusen und fand heraus, dass es sich um phänotypische GABAB-Rezeptoren auf den Orexin-Neuronen handelt, die speziell für Schlaf- und Wachzustände verantwortlich sind. Die Aktivierung des GABAA-Rezeptors induziert Antworten, die Schlaf fördern. Wenn es unterdrückt wird, kann dies zu reduzierter Angst und Schlaf induzieren. Der GABAB-Agonist (Baclofen) erhöhte die Schlafzeit (Matsuki et al., 2009). Solche Ergebnisse implizieren, dass die Tiermodelle von Mäusen auf Studien in Menschengeneralisiert werden können. Dies zeigt, dass es eine genetische und umweltbedingte Grundlage für die physische GABAB-Rezeptor in Menschen gibt. Ein Problem oder die Abwesenheit dieses Rezeptors könnte die Fähigkeit eines Einzelnen beeinträchtigen, ausreichend zu schlafen, ohne Medikamente. Die sozio-kulturellen Implikationen dieser Studie sind, dass, wenn das Phänotyp ererbt wurde, dies den Schlaf regeln könnte, und eine Änderung des Rezeptors würde den Schlaf für einen Einzelnen natürlich stören.

Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers.

Als nächstes wird die Diagnose erklärt, mit gemeinsamen Merkmalen oder \"Rotflaggen\". Schließlich schließt das Papier mit Hinweisen ab, wie ein Lehrer in einer inklusiven Klassenzimmumergänzung einen Schüler mit CAPD unterstützen kann.\n\n Die zentrale auditorische Verarbeitungsstörung (CAPD) oder Hörverarbeitungsstörung (APD) \"bezieht sich auf die Effizienz und Effektivität, wie das zentrale Nervensystem (CNS) auditorische Informationen nutzt. Im engen Sinne bezieht sich CAPD auf die wahrnehmungsbezogene Verarbeitung von auditorischen Informationen im CNS und die neurobiologische Aktivität, die diese Verarbeitung und die Entstehung elektrophysiologischer auditorischer Potentiale unterliegt\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), was bedeutet, dass es sich um eine Störung handelt, bei der das zentrale Nervensystem (d.h. das Gehirn) die Dinge, die man hört, nicht richtig verarbeiten kann. Menschen mit CAPD können normal hören, und werden daher nicht als \"hörbehindert\" angesehen; vielmehr funktioniert der Teil des Gehirns, der das, was wir hören, übersetzt, Wörter voneinander trennt oder Gespräche von Hintergrundgeräuschen unterscheidet, nicht so, wie es normalerweise sollte.\n\n Die frühesten Erwähnungen der Störung, die sich zu CAPD entwickelte, stammen aus den mittleren 1950er Jahren, genannt \"auditiver Imperfektion\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), als Forscher Kinder mit kommunikativen Störungen evaluierten. Die italienische Forschungsgruppe von Bocca, Calearo und Cassinari begann 1954, Tests für diese Kinder zu entwickeln; 1961 hat Kimura \"dichotische Tests eingeführt und ein Modell zur Erklärung der Physiologie des CANS, die dichotische Wahrnehmung unterliegt\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Ein nationaler Kongress wurde im Jahr 1977 durchgeführt, der die Forschung an Kindern mit CAPD anregte.\n\n CAPD manifestiert sich auf vielfältige Weise: Der betroffene Mensch kann möglicherweise nicht lokalisieren oder das Gehör in der Raum; kann Schwierigkeiten haben, zwischen zwei oder mehr \"akustischen Ereignissen\" (Tonauslösungen) zu unterscheiden; kann möglicherweise nicht erkennen, ob ein Geräuschmuster; kann möglicherweise nicht erkennen, ob sich die Sprache ändert (wie Sarcasmus aufgrund von Veränderungen der Stimme); kann möglicherweise nicht erkennen, ob ein Geräusch von einem anschließenden Geräusch blockiert wird; kann möglicherweise nicht in der Lage sein, Geräuschclues zu synthetisieren (d.h. sie in einem bedeutsamen Sinne interpretieren, um dann darauf zu handeln); und kann möglicherweise nicht in der Lage sein, die Reihenfolge der auditorischen Informationen zu bestimmen, die präsentiert werden (Ferre).\n\n Um CAPD zu diagnostizieren, muss der Patient systematische Beobachtung des Hörverhaltens und/oder Leistung bei Tests der auditorischen Funktion durchlaufen, die möglicherweise von Audiologen, Sprach- und Sprechtherapeuten, Psychologen und anderen mit Hilfe verschiedener Maßnahmen durchgeführt werden, die auditorische Fähigkeiten bewerten (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Dies kann Fragebögen und Umfragen, Beobachtungen des auditorischen Verhaltens, einschließlich der Reaktion des Patienten auf bestimmte Stimuli, umfassen. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt gibt es kein einziges Werkzeug oder Test, das in einem hohen Maße an diagnostischer Erfolg verwendet wird, und es gibt keinen bekannt bekannten Grund für die Störung. Viele der verwendeten Tests stellen den Patienten mit mehreren gleichzeitig auditorischen Stimulationen und bitten sie dann, bestimmte Gegenstände zu differenzieren, wie eine Folge von Wörtern oder Zahlen.

Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) \"refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder in which the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. Individuals with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered \"hearing impaired\"; rather, the area of the brain that translates what is heard, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should.\n\nThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD dates back to the mid-1950s, referred to as \"auditory imperception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari started developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura \"introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CNS underlying dichotic perception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person affected may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more \"acoustic events\" (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not be able to synthesize sound clues (i.e. interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, the patient must undergo \"systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function\", which may be conducted by \"audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. At this time, there is no single tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals.",

Ein großes Problem bei der Beendigung einer Täuschung besteht jedoch darin, dass man sich dabei entfremdet. Daher muss man in der Endschool die Wahl treffen, ob man die eigene Selbsterhaltung oder die Erhaltung der Beziehungen mit den Menschen um sich herum priorisiert. Obwohl einige Menschen neutral auf entdeckt, dass sie getäuscht wurden, werden andere die Täuschung nicht so leicht hinnehmen und werden wahrscheinlich von der ganzen Szene verletzt werden.\n\nDas Thema der Täuschung in der Rollenumkehr der Geschlechter ist besonders problematisch, da es viele Nebenfragen aufwirft, vielleicht die wichtigste davon: Warum fühlt sich der Betroffene gezwungen, seine eigene Identität zu verleugnen und eine Maske aufzunehmen, indem er sich in Form des gegenteiligen Geschlechts verkleidet? In Violas Fällen ist es offensichtlich eine Form der Selbstschutz. \"Ich werde dich zu einem Hauptmann in dieser Stadt bringen, wo meine Mädchenkleider liegen, bei deren freundlicher Hilfe wurde ich gerettet, um diesem edlen Grafen zu dienen...\" (5.1.247-249)\n\nAls sie in einem fremden Land ankam, fühlte sie es notwendig, sich als Mann zu verkleiden, um sich vor Angreifern zu schützen. Violas Plan funktioniert, aber er isoliert sie auch von den Frauen um sie herum, trennt sie von einem wichtigen Unterstützungssystem. Das Problem wird noch dadurch verschärft, dass sie so überzeugend ist, der Mann zu sein, dass Olivia sie mit Sebastian verwechselt und sich in sie verliebt. \"Woher, mein Herr? Cesario, Ehemann, bleib.\" (5.1.138) Dazu kommt noch, dass sie auch mit unterdrückten romantischen Gefühlen zwischen ihr und Orsino zu kämpfen hat: \"Bube, du hast mir tausendmal gesagt, dass du nie eine Frau wie mich lieben solltest.\" (5.1.260-261)\n\nObwohl dies vielleicht eine etwas fortschrittliche Einstellung ist, kann es für den modernen Leser als Illustration dienen, wie Täuschung die Entdeckung unterdrückter Emotionen erleichtern kann, insbesondere in den Fällen von Olivia und Orsino. Einige Passagen scheinen anzudeuten, dass die genannten Charaktere möglicherweise unerwidergabere Subkonsciouse Wünsche haben, die der Erscheinung von Viola/Cesario zwingen, sich mit ihnen auseinanderzusetzen. Zum Beispiel ist Olivia vielleicht von Cesario angezogen, weil Cesario als Mann erscheint, oder Olivia hat vielleicht heimliche Gefühle für Frauen. Man würde argumentieren, dass es wahrscheinlich nicht der Fall ist, weil Shakespeares Figur Olivia eher die Menschen ihres Zeitalters, die andere nur nach ihren Äußerlichkeiten beurteilen, parodiert.\n\nDies wird durch die Bequemlichkeit nachgewiesen, mit der Olivia ihre romantischen Vorlieben von Cesario zu Sebastian umschwenkt und Cesario/Viola als Verwandte und nicht mehr als Liebhaber betrachtet: \"Eine Schwester, du bist sie.\" (5.1.315)\n\nEnglish translation:\n\n[REWRITE] The play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process.

Natürlich kann so breit gefasste Kolonialmacht nicht durch solch einfache Beschreibung abgedeckt werden. Die deutsche Kolonialmacht war so vielfältig sowohl in ihren Politiken als auch in der Herrsungsweise als im Geographie. Bildungseinrichtungen innerhalb der Kolonien waren ähnlich vielfältig. Als die Briten Deutsch-Ostafrika (Tanganyika) 1919 übernahmen, fanden sie eine große Bevölkerung von gebildeten und literaten Afrikanern. Deutsche Bildungsbemühungen in Kamerun und anderen Kolonien wurden auch von zeitgenössischen Autoren gelobt. \n\nDie Situation in Südwestafrika (heute Namibia) präsentierte einen deutlichen Kontrast. Anders als in Ostafrika, wo die Regierung staatliche Schulen etablierte und eine bedeutende Rolle bei der Bildung der Einheimischen spielte, wurde die Aufgabe der Bildung der Einheimischen in Südwestafrika fast vollständig den missionarischen Gesellschaften überlassen, die eingeschränkten staatlichen Unterstützung erhielten. Die Regierung investierte jedoch erhebliche Ressourcen in die Bildung von Europäern in der Kolonie, indem sie ein System staatlicher Schulen einrichtete sowie missionarische Schulen stärker unterstützte und regulierte. Diese Bildungspolitiken hatten langfristige Auswirkungen auf Südwestafrika, selbst nach dem Ende der deutschen Herrschaft. Während andere deutsche Kolonien erhebliche Anzahl gebildeter und literater Afrikaner aufwiesen, blieb in Südwestafrika \"die überwältigende Mehrheit der Bevölkerung unberührt, unbeleuchtet und ungebildet\". Verschiedene soziale, politische und wirtschaftliche Faktoren führten zu den divergierenden Erfahrungen in Südwestafrika. Diese Arbeit strebt danach, die Diskussion zu erweitern, indem sie diese Faktoren identifiziert und besondere Aufmerksamkeit auf neue Forschungen über die Einstellungen der Siedler und kolonialen Behörden zu afrikanischen Einheimischen richtet. \n\nEs gibt eine reiche Literatur zum Thema Bildung in der deutschen Kolonialmacht speziell. Die meisten dieser Quellen sind auf Deutsch verfasst und entstanden im frühen zwanzigsten Jahrhundert, während oder kurz nach der Zeit der deutschen Kolonialherrschaft. Der Zweck früherer Werke bestand hauptsächlich darin, die Merkmale der Bildungssysteme in diesen Kolonien zu beschreiben. Spätere Aufsätze auf Englisch erweiterten den Diskurs durch vergleichende Studien der Bildung in den verschiedenen deutschen Kolonien und detailreiche Analysen bestimmter Aspekte der Bildung. Diese Studien illustrierten erhebliche Unterschiede in den Bildungssystemen der verschiedenen Kolonien. Das bedeutendste Werk, das diesen Gegenstand explizit anspricht, ist Cohens Studie über Bildung in Südwestafrika und Ostafrika. Cohen vergleicht die Bildungssysteme der beiden Kolonien und diskutiert die Faktoren, die für die Unterschiede zwischen ihnen verantwortlich sind. Laut Cohen erklärt die große Siedlerbevölkerung in Südwestafrika viele der unterscheidenden Aspekte des Kolonialbildungssystems.\n\nIm Vergleich zu Deutschlands anderen Kolonialbesitzungen hatte Südwestafrika ein mäßig temperiertes Klima, obwohl ein beträchtlicher Teil des Territoriums von arider Wüste bedeckt ist. Die europäische Bevölkerung in Südwestafrika spiegelte die relativ bewohnbaren Bedingungen wider.

    "raw_output": "Hier ist die Übersetzung des Textes ins Deutsche:\n\nIn den letzten 100 Jahren hat sich die Klassifizierung von Popmusik so stark erweitert, dass es schwierig ist, alle Genres aufzulisten. Es macht die Sache noch schwieriger, dass die meisten, wenn nicht alle Genres – wie zum Beispiel Rap, Rock, Country, Jazz, Folk – mehrere Sub- und Sub-Sub-Genres innerhalb ihres Bereichs hervorgebracht haben. Man kann sagen, dass das Sub-Genre des Heavy Metal Rock in den letzten 40 Jahren zu einem der vielfältigsten und ausdrucksvollsten Genres unter der Popmusik geworden ist. Es ist ausdrucksvoll, da es eine breite Palette an Emotionen zeigt, obwohl sie sich eher zu der dunkleren Seite des Spektrums neigen. Es ist vielfältig, da die Menschen bald nach den Anfängen des Genres erkannten, dass es eine wahre Flexibilität hatte und davon Gebrauch machten, um ihre eigenen Sub-Genres zu erschaffen, was dann von Sub-Sub-Genres gefolgt wurde, und der Prozess geht bis heute weiter.\n\nHeute haben wir in der Heavy-Metal-Bewegung erreicht, dass es so viele Nischen von Gruppen gibt, dass es schwer ist, genau zu bestimmen, was Heavy Metal ist. Es hat sich so viele Themen von anderen Genres angeeignet, aber wie alles andere auch, ist es aus einer bestimmten Quelle hervorgegangen. Um die heutige Metalmusik wirklich zu verstehen, muss man zuerst verstehen, was die Metalbewegung ist und warum sie eine Bewegung und nicht nur ein Genre ist.\n\nHeavy Metal ist in vielen Aspekten eine Bewegung, die durch Dunkelheit definiert wird. Heavy Metal kann als \"Musik mit mehr\" betrachtet werden – mehr Bass, mehr Lautstärke, mehr Gewalt, mehr Theatralik. Weniger Primitivität, mehr Chop-Techniken; die Menschen in Metal-Bands wissen sehr gut, wie sie ihr Instrument spielen, und das kommt auch in der Musik zum Ausdruck. Heavy Metal ist auch – obwohl es vielleicht nicht überraschend ist – eine Bewegung, die stark von Drogen beeinflusst ist. Es gab eine Psychedelische Drogen-Blüte in den späten 70ern, die dazu führte, dass die Menschen verrückter wurden, was zu ihrer Kreation führte, die verrückten, außergewöhnlichen Aufnahmen, bei denen sie die Drogen als Vorwand für ihre Kreationen nutzten. Es besitzt viele dunkle, instinktive Qualitäten, die neu für die Musikszene waren, da eine große Menge an populärer Musik Qualitäten hatte, die nicht wahrheitsgetreu zum dunkleren Teil des emotionalen Spektrums waren. Späteren Generationen von Metal haben einige ihrer Einflüsse aus den dunklen, instinktiven Qualitäten genommen, die so präsent in der Romantik-Epoche waren. Die folgenden Liedertexte aus Helter Skelter zeigen die Dunkelheit, die ein wichtiger Bestandteil der Bewegung ist:\n\nDiese Liedtexte aus Helter Skelter zeigen die dunkle Seite der Beatles. Sie zeigen eine auf und ab, die an Drogen angedeutet wird. Dieses Lied gilt bei einigen als eines der ersten Heavy-Metal-Lieder. Es war eine Antwort auf ein Lied der Rolling Stones, das auch an der dunkleren Seite litt. Die Beatles wollten beweisen, dass sie so schwer sein konnten wie die Rolling Stones, also legten sie dieses Lied auf The White Album.\n\nUnd hier ist die Übersetzung des deutschen Textes zurück ins Englische:\n\n[REWRITE] \nOver the past 100 years, the classification of popular music has expanded so significantly that it is challenging to list all the genres.

    "transformed": "Over the past 100 years, the classification of popular music has expanded so significantly that it is challenging to list all the genres. It complicates matters that most, if not all, of the genres – such as rap, rock, country, jazz, folk – have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domains. Arguably, the sub-genre of heavy metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music over the past 40 years. It is expressive because it displays a broad range of emotions, although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that people soon realized after the emergence of the genre that it had a true flexibility and took advantage of it to create their own sub-genres, which was followed by sub-sub-genres, and the chain continues to this day.\n\nToday, we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it's difficult to determine what exactly heavy metal is.

Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration.

Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46).

Als er seine Arbeit begann, träumte er von Anerkennung, Akzeptanz und Praise von anderen Künstlern und Kunstkennern, und fand heraus, dass er vor einer schwierigen inneren Dilemmata stand, um dieses Anliegen zu erreichen. \"Der Traum\" ist das Werk von Henri Rousseaus, das am besten seine langjährige innere Auseinandersetzung widerspiegelt: entweder sich den Bedürfnissen der Kritik der Kunstwelt anzupassen, die er so sehr respektierte, oder sich kreativ unabhängig und einzigartig zu fühlen und seinen eigenen Weg zu gehen.\n\nBevor man \"Der Traum\" aus dieser Perspektive analysieren kann, muss man erst einmal etwas vertraut sein mit der biographischen Geschichte von Rousseau. Henri Rousseau wurde am 21. Mai 1844 in der Stadt Laval in Nordwestfrankreich geboren. Sein Vater war Tischler und Handelsmann, der \"bürgerlichen Prosperität genoss\" (Shattuck 47). In seiner Kindheit erhielt er keine formale Ausbildung in den Künsten; stattdessen arbeitete er bis zum Alter von 40 Jahren für Frankreich als Gabelou, oder Mitarbeiter der städtischen Zollbehörde, obwohl er den Irrtumstitel douanier, Zollinspektor, trug (Shattuck 46). Der Tod seiner ersten Ehefrau Clémence, der Tod von acht Säuglingskindern folgte, ließ Rousseau nur noch einen Sohn, eine Tochter namens Julia, und immense Trauer (Shattuck 49) zurück. Er hoffte daher auf ein neues Leben und suchte Trost in der Malerei und neuen Anfangen. Im Gegensatz zu zeitgenössischen Kollegen von Rousseau, die die Bauern in Malerei sentimentalisierten und romantisierten, ist er eigentlich ein Volksmaler und hat die Hoffnungen und Träume des durchschnittlichen Mitglieds seiner Klasse.\nRousseaus Obsession, von der Kunstwelt akzeptiert zu werden, ist in gewisser Weise verständlich, wenn man den Kontext bedenkt: wie bereits erwähnt, war er nicht nur ungebildet in den formalen Malerweisen und begann seine Karriere in einem viel älteren Alter, sondern er schuf Werke zu der Zeit wie viele andere talentierte und besser bekannte moderne Künstler. Obwohl er in vielen Jahren bereits gearbeitet hatte, erhielt er erst um die gleiche Zeit, als Matisse begann, eine Reputation als Künstler zu bauen, die nötige Anerkennung für seine Kunst. In dem Buch \"Modern French Painters\" behauptet der Autor Jan Gordon, dass die beiden, obwohl sie in der Kunstwelt Konkurrenten waren, nicht nur in Stil und Gegenstand, sondern auch in ihren Gründen für Malen voneinander unterschieden waren: \"Matisse war ein Maler, der eine Furcht davor hatte, in einer alltäglichen Weise zu malen, während Rousseaus Wunsch war, ein Bild zu malen, das so konventionell war, dass er in die Artiste Français aufgenommen wurde\" (92).\n\nEnglish translation:\n\n[REWRITE]A few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and metaphorically.

Ich glaube, dass es an einem grundlegenden Niveau einen Grund für dieses gibt. Wie John Keats in \"Ode an eine griechische Urne\" sagt, \"Schönheit ist Wahrheit, Wahrheit ist Schönheit - Das ist alles, was ihr auf der Erde wisst, und alles, was ihr wissen müsst.\" Viele Dinge, die wir in unserem Leben wissen, lernen wir durch Bildung oder Erfahrung. Allerdings scheinen wir Ästhetik und Ethik, wie Keats impliziert, ohne Unterricht in diesen erwarteten Weisen zu schätzen. Beide Ethik und Ästhetik sind ein Versuch, sie zu beschreiben, anstatt Vorlagen zu liefern. Unsere Studien zur Moral und zur Schönheit sind, zum größten Teil, Versuche, zu erklären, warum ein Kunstwerk oder eine literarische Arbeit schön ist, oder warum eine Handlung moralisch ist, anstatt eine Reihe von Regeln für die Bewertung oder die Schaffung guter Kunst oder moralisches Verhalten zu liefern.\n\nMehr zu dem Punkt, Kritik an Kunst oder Moral ist nie in der Lage, das Wesentliche von dem zu erfassen, was gut oder was schön ist. Ein Gespräch über den Wert von Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa, zum Beispiel, kann sich um Konzepte wie Vordergrund, Hintergrund, Kontrast oder kultureller Kontext drehen, aber letztlich beschreiben diese nicht, warum es gute Kunst ist. Stattdessen hört man häufig eine Phrase wie \"Es gibt einfach etwas an ihm\" vor einer komplexeren oder kritischeren Erklärung, wenn man jemanden nach einer Lieblingsarbeit von Kunst oder Literatur fragt. Ich glaube, dass sowohl Kunst als auch Moral nie vollständig auf ihre Eigenschaften reduziert werden können. Wie Flannery O'Connor sagt, \"Eine Geschichte ist eine Art, etwas zu sagen, das nicht auf eine andere Weise gesagt werden kann... Du erzählst eine Geschichte, weil eine Aussage unzureichend wäre.\" Unabhängig davon, wie vollständig wir die Eigenschaften eines literarischen Werks beschreiben, bleibt etwas Transzendentales, das noch übrig bleibt. Ich glaube, dass die Ethik dieselbe Eigenschaft hat. Wie Wittgenstein sagt, \"Es ist klar, dass Ethik nicht ausgedrückt werden kann. / Ethik ist transzendent. / Ich schlage vor, dass es dieses 'etwas', dieses je ne sais quoi, ist, was die kraftvollste Eigenschaft von Kunst und Moral ist, und dass diese transzendentalen Natur beider Ethik und Ästhetik einen Verbindungszeitpunkt zwischen ihnen bietet.\"\n\nIch glaube, dass Moral und Kunst so eng miteinander verbunden sind, weil wir beide von ihnen am machtvollsten auf eine noumenale Ebene erfahren, um einen Kantischen Begriff zu verwenden. Sie beeinflussen uns auf einer Ebene, die erfahren werden kann, aber nicht vollständig erklärt werden kann. Diese Verbindung ist sogar stärker, wenn es um die Kunst der Literatur geht. Wie McKean sagt, \"Was die Kunst der Literatur besonders ausmacht, was in Wahrheit einzigartig ist, ist ihre moralische Qualität. Es mag sein, dass moralische Standards für andere Kunstformen unangemessen sind, Musik, zum Beispiel, aber sie scheinen so relevant zu Literatur wie zu Leben selbst zu sein.

The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",

    "transformed": "Today's Germany is considered a strong force, a united country with its own unique culture that stretches from the shadows of the Alps in Munich to the Baltic Sea in Kiel. This culture can be felt from Cologne on the Rhine, through the center of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. It shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we know it today comes from various sources and tribes given its unique culture. Germania was the ancestral homeland of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among historians and scholars. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic tribe known as the Tungrians, and that they were previously known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar first used the word \"Germanus\" in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, where he defeated the Gauls and fought with Germanic tribes that often crossed the Rhine under misleading pretenses. He took this word from the Gauls themselves and used it to distinguish between those he had conquered (the Gauls) and those he had not.

Mehrere Faktoren kommen zusammen, um diesen toten Statistikvektor für die jüngsten amerikanischen Fahrer zu schaffen.  Die National Institutes of Health erklären, dass ein Aspekt des Problems darin liegt, dass das Teenagerhirn tatsächlich nicht bereit für die Gefahren des Fahrens ist.  Die simple Erfahrung mangelt es auch am Herzen des Problems. Diese Erfahrung verursacht nicht nur mehr tödliche Unfälle, sondern auch eine höhere Rate von Fahrzeugrollen, Geschwindigkeitsübertretungen und Fahren vom Straßenrand.  \nTeenager fahren auch viel schlechter, wenn sie mit ihren Peers reisen – was jeder, der ein bisschen Verstand hat, weiß, dass sie auf regelmäßiger Basis tun.  Das Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center führte eine Studie durch, die folgende Korrelation zeigte: zwischen dem Alter des Beifahrers und der Anzahl der verkehrsunfälle, die auftraten.\nKalifornien und andere Staaten haben versucht, die Sicherheit der Teenagerfahrer zu erhöhen, indem sie temporäre Beauftragungslizenzen eingeführt haben, die die Stunden begrenzen, die Teenager fahren dürfen und andere Minderjährige als Beifahrer verbieten.\nAber Beauftragungslizenzen sind, in meiner Meinung, Ersatzmaßnahmen.  Das wahre Problem ist, dass als Gruppe die jüngsten Fahrer, gemessen an statistischen Markern, einfach nicht in der Lage sind, die Risiken und Verantwortlichkeiten ausreichend zu handhaben.  Der Psychologe Marvin Zuckerman glaubt, dass auch 18 zu jung ist für eine reguläre Führerscheinlizenz.  USA Today meldet, dass Zuckerman Forschungen durchgeführt hat, die eine gemeinsame Sehnsucht unter Personen unter 19-20 nach Risiken für die bloße Freude an der Aufregung zeigen.  Es ist logisch, das Fahren auf jeden Fall bis zum Zeitpunkt zu verzögern, an dem die Neigung zum Risiko suchende Verhalten abnimmt.  Wenn wir weiterhin Führerscheinlizenzen an jungen Teenagern ausstellen, werden nicht nur weiterhin tödliche Unfälle passieren, sondern die Todeszahlen werden wahrscheinlich in den nächsten Jahren in astronomische Verhältnisse ansteigen.  Bis 2010 werden die Babynamen der Baby-Boomer fahrtauglich sein und Millionen neuer Teenagerfahrer werden bereit sein, die Straße zu überqueren. \nLegislative Maßnahmen zur Lösung dieses Problems wären ausgesprochen einfach.  Schulen könnten weiterhin Fahrschulen anbieten, um den Lernprozess für zukünftige Fahrer zu beginnen, aber niemand unter 18 Jahren dürfte ein Motorfahrzeug betreiben.  Eine vorläufige Erlaubnis könnte noch vor dem Erteilen einer vollständigen Führerscheinlizenz erteilt werden, und eine gewisse Anzahl von praktischen Fahrausbildungsstunden würde ebenfalls erforderlich sein.  Die spezifische Anzahl der Stunden, die erforderlich sind, könnten auf die Anzahl der Stunden basieren, die die meisten Staaten bereits verlangen (in Kalifornien zum Beispiel ist diese Zahl derzeit 6 Stunden Fahrausbildung und 50 Stunden Übung mit einem Erwachsenen).  Da die tödlichen Statistiken für Teenagerfahrer aus einer Querschnitt aller Staaten kommen, wäre eine einheitliche nationale Gesetzgebung auf dieses Thema ein vernünftiger – und ich glaube wirksamer – Weg, um Jugendliche in ganz Amerika zu schützen.\nDie von mir vorgeschlagene Gesetzgebung ist in keiner Weise ein neues Konzept.\n\nUnd hier ist die Übersetzung zurück ins Englisch:\n\n[REWRITE]Teenagers are dying behind the wheel.

    "original": "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",

    "raw_output": "Translation to German:\n\nBeim Durchsehen der Bibliothek des Kongresses für frühe Edison-Filme beschloss ich, alle Trickfilme anzusehen, von denen es 1895 bis 1901 fünfzehn gab. Diese Filme nutzen in der Regel kreative Schnitttechniken, um Illusionen zu erzeugen. Meine Filmstudien konzentrierten sich in der Regel darauf, die Poetik der meisten Trickfilme zu beschreiben und die evolutionären Merkmale in wenigen der späteren Filme zu untersuchen. Grob gesagt, sind Trickfilme der Zeitumbruch an einem festen Ort, bestehen aus einem frontal ausgerichteten Proscenium, enthalten keine Kamerabewegung, verwenden lange und mittellange Schüsse und folgen streng der Methode einer einen Schnitt = ein Film. Allerdings gibt es einige Filme am Anfang des zwanzigsten Jahrhunderts, die diese Richtlinien brechen, indem sie Aspekte wie mehrere Schüsse einführen.\n\nEinige der bemerkenswertesten Aspekte, die die Trickfilme gemeinsam haben, sind ihre Filmaufnahmen an einem interieur Set innerhalb des Rahmens eines frontal ausgerichteten Prosceniums. Die Kamera bewegt sich nicht aus ihrer Proscenium-Position, um Figuren oder Objekte zu verfolgen. Diese Komposition war in frühen Filmen sehr beliebt und entlehnte ihre Wurzeln aus dem Theater und, für Trickfilme, Vaudewille und Zauberschau. Eines der Einschränkungen, die mit der Verwendung des Bühnenraums einhergehen, ist, dass Figuren in Trickfilmen normalerweise nur seitwärts laufen und nicht zum oder von der Kamera gehen. Nehmen wir zum Beispiel den Handlungsablauf im Film \"Onkel Josh in einem Spukschloss\" (1900). Die Schauspieler betreten von rechts und bewegen sich entlang der horizontalen Achse hin und her. Selbst als sie aus dem Bild rausgehen, verfolgt die Kamera sie nicht.\n\nDie Proscenium-Style-Komposition bedeutet, dass Schüsse im Allgemeinen lange Schüsse und, seltener, mittellange Schüsse sind. Nahschüsse werden in keinem der Trickfilme aus dem Edison-Katalog verwendet. Dies leitet sich aus der Theater- und Vaudewille-Tradition ab, bei der die Zuschauer die gesamte Aufführung zum gegebenen Zeitpunkt sehen konnten, begrenzt durch die Ränder der Bühne. Wie in den meisten frühen Filmen bewegen die Schauspieler sich nicht vom Mittelpunkt weg zur Kamera, daher werden Nahschüsse nie verwendet.\nIm Allgemeinen folgen die meisten frühen Trickfilme dem Muster, dass ein konzeptioneller Schnitt ein Film entspricht. Dies beschränkt die Länge der meisten Trickfilme auf etwa eine Minute oder weniger, je nach verwendeten Bildern pro Sekunde. Es beschränkt auch die dramatische oder narrative Verwendung der Trickfilme; die meisten von ihnen konzentrieren sich auf kurze Vaudewille-Stileinträge, wie Zauberei, Verschwinden und Tauschhandlungen mit wenig Geschichte. Beachten Sie jedoch, dass in einem Trickfilm ein konzeptioneller Schnitt in den Augen des Zuschauers nicht unbedingt einem physischen Schnitt entspricht. Ein einzelner \"Schnitt\" kann tatsächlich mehrere verbundene zusammengefügt sein, um die Illusion von Erscheinung oder Verschwinden zu erzeugen. Schauen Sie sich sorgfältig \"Die Hinrichtung von Maria, Königin von Schottland\" (1895), einen der früheren Trickfilme, an.

It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer's eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single \"shot\" may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing.

Obwohl er hauptsächlich Landwirt war,  hat seine kurze politische Karriere und seine berufliche Tätigkeit zusammen mit seiner Überzeugung von der Bedeutung persönlicher Freiheit und der Regierung ihn zu einem Mann gemacht, der für seine Entschlossenheit und seine Offenheit in Angelegenheiten der persönlichen Freiheit und der Regierung bekannt war.  Seine Überzeugung von einem agrarischen System war die Grundlage für fast alle seiner Meinungen über die Regierung.  Sein Versuch, das zu bewahren und zu fördern, was er für das beste aller Berufe hielt, prägte seine Argumente über Souveränität, Verfassungsmäßigkeit und sogar das Gerichtssystem.\n\nJohn Taylor glaubte, dass die Vereinigten Staaten eine großartige Gelegenheit hatten, ein ideales System zu schaffen, da es keine einheimische Tradition gab, die den Schöpfern der Regierung im Weg stand, was die Einrichtung eines Systems der Selbstregierung ermöglichte.  Er glaubte stark an die natürlichen Rechte des Menschen und an die Tatsache, dass sie alle voneinander abhängig sind – das heißt, wenn ein Recht verwehrt wird, verlieren sie alle ihre Wirksamkeit und ihre Wert verringert sich.  Diese Rechte sollten also außerhalb der Reichweite der Regierung liegen.  Er behauptete, dass das, was einige den \"zustand der Natur\" nannten, bedeutete, dass jene mit körperlicher Stärke und böser Intelligenz davon profitierten, aber dass es in einer Zivilisation nicht so sein durfte.\n\nUm dieses ideale Gesellschaft zu schaffen, glaubte Taylor, dass eine Regierung eingerichtet werden muss, die Rechenschaft ablegen muss über die ursprüngliche Gutmütigkeit und Bosheit des Menschen.  Taylor war sehr streng in seiner Überzeugung von einer dualistischen Moral.  Er behauptete, dass \"da Regierung durch den Menschen ausgeübt wird, müssen alle ihre Tugenden und Lastern menschlich sein\" (Ibid., S. 167).  Er definierte gute Prinzipien als solche, die das private Eigentum schützen, die Landwirtschaft verbessern und den Kapitalismus diskriminieren, und glaubte, dass eine Regierung, die auf guten Prinzipien gegründet war, gerecht funktioniere, gleichgültig, wer sie leitet, da sie letztlich von Avarice und Eigeninteresse geleitet wird.  Eigeninteresse, glaubte er, sei die Motivation des Menschen in allen Dingen, aber die charakteristische Eigenschaft sei nur dann als böse zu betrachten, wenn sie die Schaffung einer Gesellschaft auf der Grundlage des öffentlichen Wohls zu Subsellschaften führt, die auf Kosten anderer leben.  Eine gute Regierung ist notwendig, um die natürliche Bosheit des Menschen aufrechtzuerhalten, und selbst dann muss sie sorgfältig beobachtet werden, um die Hinzufügung von schlechten Prinzipien zu vermeiden.\n\nTaylor, wie viele andere strenge Republikaner seiner Zeit, rief nach einer strengen Auslegung der Verfassung.  Er wollte eine extrem begrenzte Bundesregierung mit keinerlei Rechten oder Befugnissen, als diese in der Verfassung ausdrücklich genannt waren.  Er wusste, dass eine umfassende Bundesregierung teuer war und daher wahrscheinlich despotisch war.  Doch glaubte er, dass eine einfache, wörtliche Auslegung gefährlich war und dass ohne Berücksichtigung des Absichten der Schriftsteller sie leicht korrupt werden könnte.  Mehr noch, er sah die Erklärung der Unabhängigkeit als wahre Charta der Vereinigten Staaten, da sie die Länder ausdrücklich als souveräne Staaten und nicht als eine Nation beschreibt.\n\n[REWRITE] John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.

December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks.

Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped.

Das war ein bisschen entmutigend, und es ist schwer zu sagen, warum das passieren könnte. Mit dem Beginn des Winters auf einem New-England-Campus gibt es einen offensichtlichen Rückgang der Personen, die entweder mit dem Fahrrad oder zu Fuß zum Campus fahren, was möglicherweise einen Teil der Deklination erklären könnte. Dezember markiert auch das Ende des Herbstsemesters, als alle sehr beschäftigt sind, ihre Hausarbeiten fertigzustellen, die Note zu bearbeiten und so weiter. Das Einreichen des Fahrgastlogs mag einfach von der Radar-Schirm für viele Leute gerutscht sein. Außerdem bringt Dezember den Beginn der Weihnachtsferienzeit mit sich und den daraus folgenden monatlichen Pausen für Studenten und Personal, in denen viele nicht einmal zum Campus kommen müssen. Die Kurse werden dann im späten Januar für das Frühlingssemester fortgesetzt, was vielleicht auch ein Hinweis auf die geringe Anzahl an Einreichungen für diesen Monat ist. Keine dieser Dinge erklärt jedoch wirklich die geringe Anzahl an Einreichungen im Februar. Man könnte auch vermuten, dass jeder solchen Projekte anfangs eine Impulsbewegung und Aufregung haben wird, die dann natürlich abnehmen wird. \n\nUm diese Tendenz zu bekämpfen, haben wir das Carpool-Challenge-Week eingerichtet, eine besondere Blitzkampagne im März, um das Initiativ zu revitalisieren, die zu einem Anstieg der Einreichungen im selben Monat führte. Eine der Herausforderungen, die wir erfahren haben, war die Frage, wie man den Projekt-Momentum in Anbetracht sowohl eines natürlichen Rückgangs der Beteiligung, aber auch speziell der Probleme der Weihnachts- und Semesterferien in der höheren Bildung aufrechterhalten kann. \n\nEin weiterer Herausforderung für dieses Projekt (oder jedes alternative Verkehrsmittelsprojekt) ist die einfache Tatsache, dass Menschen die Freiheit, Unabhängigkeit und Flexibilität genießen, ihr Auto zu fahren. Dies ist tief in unserer Kultur verwurzelt. Es ist daher wichtig, Anreize für die Teilnahme an alternativen Verkehrsmitteln zu bieten. Wir haben viele Preise in Form von Geschenkkarten an lokale Restaurants, Kaffee-Shops, Massage-Therapeuten, den lokalen unabhängigen Buchladen und sogar einige größere nationalen Kettenläden verteilt. Es wäre jedoch interessant gewesen, zu sehen, wie einige größere Preise die Teilnahme beeinflusst hätten – wie zum Beispiel das Gewinnen eines schönen Fahrrads, eines Hybridfahrzeugs oder eines Elektrofahrzeugs. Das könnte auch geholfen haben, die Abstufung der Beteiligung zu bekämpfen, die das Projekt erlebt hat. Die Art der Preise änderte sich während des Verlaufs des Projekts nicht wirklich.

An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

Ein ETF bietet die Diversifikation eines Indexfonds und die Vorteile der Einzelaktienbesitz wie die Fähigkeit, kurz zu verkaufen, mit Kredite zu kaufen und mit so wenig wie einem Aktienpapier in jeder Transaktion zu kaufen.  Obwohl diese Vorteile sehr attraktiv sind, sind die Gebührenverhältnisse von ETFs beträchtlich niedriger als die der durchschnittlichen Fondssparpläne.  Leider gibt es einige Nachteile, wie die Notwendigkeit, eine Kommission für jede Transaktion mit ETFs zu zahlen, genau wie für eine Aktienorder.  Ein weiterer Vorteil der ETFs ist die breite Palette von Fonds, die verfügbar sind.  Obwohl diese Vorteile klar sind, ist es immer ein gutes Übung für den kundigen Finanzinvestor, auszuwerten, ob die angegebenen Vorteile, wie Diversifikation, tatsächlich existieren und in welchem Umfang sie existieren.  Für die Zwecke dieser Bemühungen werden wir den ETF IHF untersuchen und ihn gegen die Top 10 Holdings, die den ETF bestehen, vergleichen, um zu bestimmen, ob die Vorteile der Besitz einer einzelnen ETF denen der Besitz eines diversifizierten Portfolios aus den zehn Aktien kommen, und ob es bessere Konfigurationen der gleichen Aktien gibt, die einen besseren Sharpe-Verhältnis oder Rendite bieten.\n\nUm den ETF zu bewerten, würde es sich zu umständlich anstellen, jede Position einzubeziehen, daher haben wir entschieden, nur die Top 10 Holdings mit einem Anteil von 63,58 % an allen Vermögenswerten im ETF zu berücksichtigen.  Im Folgenden sind die Top 10 Holdings und der Anteil der Gesamtvaleur angegeben.\n\nUm einen Schätzwert zu erhalten, wie gut diese zehn Aktien den ETF IHF als Ganzes darstellen, können wir die aktuelle % der Vermögenswerte, normalisiert auf 100 %, verwenden, um die Beiträge jeder Aktie zur Beta und zur Rendite eines Portfolios zu berechnen, das aus diesen 10 Aktien besteht, in dem Verhältnis, das der ETF durch die Ausgaben ihrer Vermögenswerte festgelegt hat. Die Berechnungen von Beta und Rendite sind im unten stehenden Diagramm enthalten.\n\nAus dem oben stehenden Diagramm ist offensichtlich, dass die Rendite eines Portfolios, das nur die Top 10 Holdings enthält, 6,11 % höher ist als der ETF, ein Anstieg der Rendite um 16 %.

In „Dream-Land“ verwendet Poe den Begriff „Thulé“ in den Zeilen 6 und 56, der von Mabbott auf Virgil zurückführt. Virgil verwendete den Begriff in Bezug auf eine Insel nördlich von Britannien, die die Griechen als Rand des bekannten Weltbildes betrachteten. Es ist gewiss, dass Virgil den Begriff verwendet hat, jedoch gibt es eine aktuellere Quelle, der man zu dem Zuschreibung geben muss. Poe war sehr an deutschen Autoren interessiert.\n\nDiese Zitate sind wichtig, da sie Poes Vertrautheit mit Gothes Schreiben zeigen. Karl J. Arndt, in seinem Buch Poe’s Politian und Goethes Mignon, kommentiert die Ähnlichkeit ihrer beiden Gedichte und schlussfolgert, dass Poe Gothe imitierte.\n\nDer Oxford Companion to English Literature besagt, dass Gothe ein berühmter Schriftsteller des poetischen Dramas Faust war, das in zwei Teilen erschien, der erste im Jahr 1808 und der zweite im Jahr 1832, dem Jahr seines Todes. Innerhalb der poetischen Verse des zweiten Teils von Faust steckt ein kurzer Gedicht mit dem Titel „Der König von Thulé“. Das Gedicht handelt von einem König, dessen Frau nachdem sie ihm ein Becher schenkt, stirbt. Nachdem seine Frau gestorben ist, beginnt er, viel zu trinken und weint aus Trauer um seine tote Königin. Er beschließt dann, dass es Zeit für ihn zu sterben ist und gibt seinen Besitz an seine Kinder, mit Ausnahme des Bechers, ab. Dann geht er zu einem Felsen, wirft den Becher ins Meer, schließt die Augen und stirbt. Die Haltung des Königs von Thule und die Beschreibung des Königs in Dream-Land sind sehr ähnlich, vielleicht ein dunkler Doppelgänger von Poes Verlust und Trinken. Faust wurde auch in einem romantischen Drama von H P Grattan 1842 komponiert, was weniger als ein Jahr vor Poes Verwendung des Begriffs Thule in „The Pit and the Pendulum“ lag.\n\nPoe erwähnt Thule zweimal in seinen gesammelten Werken. Einmal erwähnt Poe „ultma Thule“ in The Pit and the Pendulum, jedoch verwendet er diesen Ausdruck in „Dream-Land“ zweimal, als Buchränder für das Gedicht. „Der König von Thule“ und „Dream-Land“ können als Begleitstücke gelesen werden. In „Dream-Land“ sagt der Sprecher so etwas wie: Er beschreibt dann die Landschaft von Thule und wie sie dunkel, einsam ist, er wird von toten Freunden heimgesucht, und er sieht eine von Schatten umgebene Welt ohne Farbe. Alle diese Szenen würden in „Der König von Thule“ von Gothe gelesen werden, da er gerade seine Frau verloren hat, einsam ist und seine Macht, noch sein Leben zu führen, verloren hat. Das gesamte Gedicht ist eine Beschreibung, als ob der Sprecher in Gothes Gedicht eingetreten ist.\n\nGothe war ein wichtiger Autor, den Poe kennen gelernt hätte, wenn nicht aus anderen Gründen als aus seinem Respekt für Tennyson. Poe hatte folgendes zu sagen, als er gefragt wurde, ob er Tennyson bewunderte. Neben der Verbindung zu Tennyson hätte Poe Gothes Werk durch viele Reproduktionen kennengelernt, die nach der ursprünglichen Veröffentlichung stattfanden.\n\nEnglish translation of the German text:\n\n[REWRITE] Dream-Land is one of Edgar Allan Poe's self-proclaimed better poems.

I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",

Nachdem sich also einzelne Menschen die 'Wahrheit' in seinen Lehren fanden, suchten sie ihn auf.\n \nAußerdem gibt es einige unheimliche Ähnlichkeiten zwischen den Missionen Jesu und den 'Wundern' Mohammeds.  Die offensichtlichste ist, als er Mutter und Milch nahm und es multiplizierte, so dass es für mehr als 40 Männer genug gab.  Dieser Stil der Schreibweise führt mich dazu, zu glauben, dass die Schreiber Mohammed als bescheidenen Propheten darstellen wollten, der nichts beweisen musste, sondern einfach in Wahrheit und Wundern lebte.  Diese Art von Falschheit ist der schlimmste, da sie das Wunder und Leben Jesu Christi herunterspielt.  Es ist mir, als ob sie versuchen, das Leben und die Person Jesu durch Muhammad zu stehlen und ihm zu geben.\n \nEs gibt auch viele Geschichten in der Biografie, die es so erscheinen lassen, als ob ihr Ziel darin besteht, Beweise für 'Zeugen' oder von Menschen zu liefern, die 'auf eigenen' zu Islam konvertieren.  Das Problem aber ist, dass viele Geschichten aus einer Drittpersonsperspektive stammen.  Das heißt, im Geschichtenteil stellt der Autor dar, dass er von so und so zu hören bekam, der von so und so zu hören bekam usw.  Ich mochte das nicht sehr, obwohl ihre Idee darin bestand, dass es Beweise für die Wahrheit der Geschichten lieferte, dachte ich, es diminiert die Geschichten und macht sie noch verdächtiger.\n \nIch denke, das, was mich am meisten stört, ist, dass sie versuchen, Muhammad als frommen Mann zu erhöhen, der bescheiden, liebenswürdig, weise und sanft war.  Aber die Geschichte widerspricht der Idee, dass Muhammad ein sanfter und bescheidener Mann war, und ich kann nicht umhin zu denken, ob Muslime heute die wahre Geschichte hinter Mohammeds Aufstieg zur Macht kennen.\n\nEnglish translation:\n\n[REWRITE] About four years ago I attended an Islam course at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I think the question is even more relevant today than it ever was.  Looking back on the events since 9/11, I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme form of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don't think in 2001 we could have had a presidential candidate with the name Barack Obama, who had an obvious Muslim background in his family.\nThe Prophet's biography fascinates me because, according to what I know of Muhammad's history, the biography contradicts the character of the Prophet.  From what I knew and learned in the past, I thought Muhammad forced people to convert to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to adopt the Islamic religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was portrayed as a sort of martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the 'truth' in his teachings and sought him out. \nThere are also some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the 'miracles' of Muhammad.  The most obvious one is when he took goat's milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be seen as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This kind of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad. \nThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of 'witness' or of how people 'on their own' converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third-party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn't like this much because, although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made them seem even more suspicious.\nI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and elevate and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can't help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad's rise to power. [/REWRITE]",

Wenn wir uns diese Geschichte in breiten Zügen ansehen, sehen wir eine Tendenz der Christenheit, sich weiter und weiter von ihren Ursprüngen zu entfernen.  Es scheint, dass die Welt von heute eine wachsende Bewusstsein und einen unerhörten progressiven Trend zeigt.  Während traditionelle Menschen übrig bleiben und sich gegen jegliche Art von Denken wehren, das über das gelehrt wurde, was ihnen beigebracht wurde, mag diese Gruppe der Bevölkerung nicht prominent genug sein, um das Ganze zu beeinflussen.  Unter den Christen wird ein historisches Bewusstsein erheblich in den kommenden Jahren wachsen.  Eine Sehnsucht wird sich verbreiten, um die durch die Zeit in das Christentum eingefügte Lehren vom eigentlichen Zweck der Religion, ihrem Namensgeber, zu unterscheiden.  Es mag Jahrzehnte oder sogar Jahrhunderte dauern, aber das Ergebnis ist unvermeidlich:  Es wird eine große Umkehrung in der Tendenz der christlichen Geschichte geben.  Es wird eine Rückkehr zu ihrer ursprünglichen Form geben.  Eine Bewegung wird wachsen, die Schichten von Lehren, eine nach der anderen, entfernen wird, genau wie der Uhr zeigte, wenn sie rückwärts ging, bis nichts mehr übrig ist außer der Vorstellung, was Jesus der Menschheit auf behalf der Gottheit vorstellte, bevor irgendein Denker solche Ansprüche erhob.  Wenn diese Tendenz durch die Vereinigten Staaten und Europa geht und Massen unter ihrer Woge davon überzeugt, so zu kultivieren, als wären wir zu Jesu Zeiten lebend, nur seine Ideen folgend, bleibt die Kirche als Institution stark, um den Weg zu weisen.  Doch weil die theologische Uhr rückwärts gegangen ist, wird die extreme Vielfalt in Christendom in zunehmenden Gleichförmigkeit von Glauben und Praxis zurückkehren.  Zwischen Regionen, zwischen Bekenntnissen, zwischen Divisionen jeder Art sehen wir stattdessen zunehmende Ähnlichkeiten.  Die menschliche Geschichte ist voller großer Umkehrungen.  Eines der Beispiele ist, wie Christen zu einem Zeitpunkt verfolgt, verstoßen und getötet wurden von dem römischen Reich.  Doch später wurde jenes Reich zu einer christlichen Institution.  Unsere Heimat ging von der afroamerikanischen Sklaverei zur afroamerikanischen Führung.  Die große Umkehrung, die in unserer Zukunft bevorsteht, wird sich in dem Bereich der christlichen Religion auswirken, indem sie die Geschichte aufzulösen versucht, um die Quelle zu finden, und die Vielfalt dabei aufhob.  Es ist wichtig zu beachten, dass ein Teil dessen, was diese Prozess ermöglichen wird, in der Art und Weise, wie Jesu Worte als metaphorisch und nicht als wörtliche Aussagen gelesen werden.  Also was ist geschehen, seit Jesu Zeit?\n       Wenn wir weit genug zurück in die Geschichte blicken, finden wir nur Judentum, die theologische Anfang für die christliche Religion.  Monotheismus, die Wahrnehmung einer von Gott offenbarten Religion, und die Autorität der hebräischen Schriften, lagen alle am Kern der Religion, als die Römer Jerusalem im 63 v. Chr. in ihrer Kontrolle hatten.  Die jüdische Bevölkerung teilte nicht einen Geist.  Sie teilten sich in Sadduzäer, Pharisäer, Essener, Zeloten und eine Mehrheit von Gemeinleuten auf.\n\n[REWRITE]The teachings of Jesus and his beliefs during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that continued after his death.

Sie wollen nur für sich selbst sorgen und ihr Leben so gut wie möglich machen, aber niemanden unterschätzen, der niedriger steht als sie selbst. \"Die Wildnis\" zeigt dies auf viele Weise. Die offensichtlichste Gegend ist die Eigentümer und Manager der großen Fabriken. Sie wollen nur ihre Firmen und Fabriken so groß und großartig wie möglich machen. Sie kümmern sich nicht um jemanden oder etwas, das sich ihnen in den Weg stellte oder etwas, das durch ihre Fortschritte verletzt wurde. Nach Upton Sinclairs Werk \"Die Wildnis\" \"Die Linie der Gebäude stand klar und schwarz gegen den Himmel; hier und da aus der Masse stieg die großen Schornsteine auf, mit dem Strom der Rauch strömend weg bis ans Ende der Welt\". Sinclair versucht, ein Bild von dem großen Schaden zu malen, den diese Verschmutzung schafft. Er zeigt, dass die Eigentümer keine Rücksicht auf Person oder Tier nehmen, die verletzt werden könnte. Sie kümmern sich nicht um die großen Rauchwolken, die aus den Fabriken aufsteigen oder die Tierkot- und Harnabläufe von den Tausenden Zäunen in Packingtown. Die Eigentümer und Manager kümmerten sich auch nicht um ihre Angestellten, die für sie arbeiteten, um sie reich zu machen. Sie würden alles tun, um ein oder zwei Dollar zu sparen. \"Von oben bis unten ist der Ort einfach ein brodelnder Topf von Eifersüchteleien und Hass; es gibt keine Loyalität oder Anstand überall, es gibt kein Ort, an dem ein Mann gegenüber einem Dollar etwas zählte\". Sie zwangen ihre Angestellten zu unerträglichen Arbeitsstunden und ohne eine Vorwarnung könnten sie Tausende von Menschen gleichzeitig ohne Entschädigung oder Unterstützung bei der Suche nach einer neuen Stelle entlassen. Während der Zeit, in der sich \"The Jungle\" abspielt, gab es keine Gesetze oder Vorschriften, die den Arbeiterschutz oder das Wohlergehen der Arbeiter schützten. Dies ermöglichte es den Managern und Eigentümern, wild zu sein, ihre Angestellten zum Arbeiten zu zwingen und in katastrophalen Bedingungen zu arbeiten. Obwohl das Buch dies nicht direkt sagt, wurden die Leute, die in Packingtown lebten und ums Leben kamen, einfach dazu ermutigt, mit den wretcheden Bedingungen, sowohl bei der Arbeit in den Fabriken als auch um sie herum, zurechtzukommen. Es gab keine Agenturen oder Organisationen, die der Arbeiter Informationen oder Hilfe boten. Es gab Gewerkschaften, die gebildet wurden, aber diese taten oft mehr Schaden als Hilfe, da sie sich aus den armen Arbeitern Geld verdienten. Die Arbeiter wurden so schlecht behandelt und hatten keine Möglichkeit, dem System von Packingtown zu entkommen, dass sie als Sklaven beschrieben wurden, \"Hier ist eine Bevölkerung, die niedrig ist und für die meisten ausländischen, der stets auf der Kippe des Verhungerns stand und abhängig für die Gelegenheiten des Lebens von der Laune von Männern, die genauso brutal und unscrupulös sind wie die alten Zeiten Sklavenhalter; unter solchen Umständen ist Unmoral genauso unvermeidlich und so verbreitet, wie sie es unter dem System der Sklaverei ist.\"\n\n[REWRITE] I believe that \"The Jungle\" shows that people deep down are naturally greedy and self-centered.

    "original": "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

Manchmal kombiniert er ein Adjektiv mit einem Nomen, das normalerweise nicht so zusammenpasst, um den Lesern eine bestimmte Aura rund um ein Objekt zu vermitteln. Zu anderen Zeiten gibt er einem Symbol eine Bedeutung und verwendet es dann denselben Zweck. Fitzgerald verwendet diese letzte Technik mit vielen Farben, einschließlich Gold, Grün, Weiß/Schwarz und Rot/Rosa.

Fitzgerald legt diese Bedeutung am Anfang des Romans fest, indem er beide ständig verwendet. Daisy und Jordan sind ständig \"in Weiß\" (8) - tatsächlich trägt jeder immer Weiß: Nick trägt \"weiße Flanellhosen\" (41) zur Party von Gatsby, Tom trägt ein \"weißes Hemd\" (36), wenn er Myrtle trifft und Catherine ist \"milkig weiß\" (30). Tatsächlich sind die einzigen Menschen, die nicht in Weiß sind, wenn Nick seine Eindrücke von Gatsby's Party bekommt: \"die Hallen ... sind farbenfroh mit primären Farben\" (40). Fitzgerald verfeinert diese beiden Farben, indem er viele alltägliche und unbedeutende Objekte mit ihnen einfärbt: als Nick zu Arbeiten geht, geht er \"nieder in die weißen Schluchten des unteren New Yorks\" (56), die Namen der Menschen auf Gatsby's Partys sind jetzt \"graue Namen\" (61) auf Nick's Zeitplan, Catherines Wohnung ist \"ein Stück in einem langen weißen Kuchen von Wohnhäusern\" - Uniformität (28). Er beschreibt auch einfache oder alltägliche Menschen oder Orte als weiß oder grau: Jordan und Daisy hatten ein \"weißes Mädchenalter\" (19) zusammen, es gibt \"graue Autos\" und \"graue Landschaften\" (23) in der Ascheschlucht, der \"italienische Junge\" im Zug ist \"grau\" (26), und der Hundeverkäufer ist \"ein grauer alter Mann\" (27). Nachdem Fitzgerald genug Bedeutung zu Weiß/Schwarz hinzugefügt hat, verwendet er sie, um Unwichtigkeit oder Uniformität an bestimmten Objekten zu zeigen. Dieses Verwenden von Farben, um Lesern etwas zu zeigen, beginnt mit Daisy. Nach einer langen Zeit ohne irgendwelche bedeutungsvolle Verwendung dieser Farben beschreibt Fitzgerald Daisy als \"in weiß\" in \"einem kleinen weißen Kugelwagen\"; die Leser beginnen, Daisy als weniger ein Charakter zu sehen, mehr wie nur ein Uniformaddition, etwas, was Gatsby haben und lange nach ihm streben will (74). Fitzgerald verwendet mehr dieser Technik um Daisy herum, um diese Vorstellung von Daisy als eine mehr Uniformaddition zu geben, zum Beispiel, es gibt einen \"grauen Dunst von Daisys Fellkragen\" (18), und sie ist wieder in einem \"weißen\" (115) Kleid, bevor Tom und Gatsby sich treffen.\n\nEnglish translation of the original German translation back:\n\n[REWRITE] Many authors use various methods to convey a certain attitude or feelings about important topics to their readers. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses many of these various techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald combines an adjective and a noun that do not usually fit together to convey a certain aura around an object to the readers. At other times, he gives a meaning to a symbol and then uses it for the same purpose. Fitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In his novel The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald builds up meanings for colors, especially white/gray, and red/pink, and then uses them to convey a certain reminder of a feeling around an important object.\n\nThe meaning that Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit nicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning at the beginning of the novel by consistently using both. Daisy and Jordan are consistently \"in white\" (8) - in fact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears \"white flannels\" (41) to Gatsby's party, Tom wears a \"white shirt\" (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is \"powdered milky white\" (30). In fact, the only time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby's party: \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further refines these two colors by coloring many common, unimportant objects with them: as Nick goes to work, he goes \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), the names of people at Gatsby's parties are now \"gray names\" (61) on Nick's timetable, Catherine's apartment is \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\" - uniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and Daisy had a \"white girlhood\" (19) together, there are \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) in the valley of ashes, the \"Italian child\" in the train is \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is \"a gray old man\" (27). After Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or uniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy. After a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster\"; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character, more like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses more of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition, for example, there is a \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" (18), and she is again in a \"white\" (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.\n\n[/REWRITE]",

Viele nachhaltige Farmen bieten auch Touren durch ihre landwirtschaftlichen Operationen sowie Zugang zu Wanderungen, Vogelbeobachtungen und anderen Freizeitaktivitäten an. Dies ist der Typ von Betrieb, der es der Landbesitzer erlaubt, die Vorteile von Regierungsprogrammen zu nutzen, während die Lebensräume verbessert werden, was es ermöglicht, Freizeitnutzung und die Schaffung von Möglichkeiten für landwirtschaftliche Touren und andere Programme zu schaffen, um Geld zu verdienen oder für Bildungszwecke.\n\nZusätzlich zum Ausfüllen eines potenziell lukrativen Nischenmarktes umfassen die Vorteile der nachhaltigen Landwirtschaft oft eine größere Artenvielfalt an Pflanzen und Wildtieren in der Region, dank eines Mangel an Chemikalien im Boden und Wasser.

Sie erfordert eine intensivere Arbeitskraft und Leitung zur Entfernung von Schädlingen und Unkraut und zur Bodendüngung ohne Chemikalien, und Verluste sind oft höher als mit konventionellen Methoden, während eine kleine nachhaltige Farm auch das Wirtschaftlichkeitsniveau von großen Betrieben fehlt. Praktiken, die nichts mit der nachhaltigen Landwirtschaft zu tun haben, aber der Fauna zugutekommen, können auch höhere Arbeitskosten verursachen, einschließlich des Anbaus von Deckfrüchten, einer strategischen Weideverdichtung, der Entfernung von invasiven Arten und der aktiven Verwaltung der Pflanzenwachstum, um bestimmte Bedingungen wie Habitate der Ränder oder Flecken offener Erdoberfläche zu schaffen. Daher sind es viele Gründe, warum der Landbesitzer in diesem Beispiel finanzielle Hilfe oder Expertise in der Maximierung sowohl von Gewinnen als auch von Lebensraumqualität sucht.\n\nFür dieses Szenario wurde eine Parzelle, neben der Stadt Potrero, in unabhängigem San Diego County, Kalifornien, gewählt.

Vielmehr als eine Kultur zu beurteilen oder sie zu ändern, muss man sie einfach akzeptieren, wie sie ist, und innerhalb ihrer Grenzen arbeiten, besonders innerhalb des Verhandlungsrahmens und besonders, wenn man mit einer schwachen Verhandlungsposition auftritt. Ebenso kann ein Verhandler, der sich in einem \"Fremd\" Gebiet befindet, durch Respekt für Traditionen und Glaubensinhalte nur helfen, kulturelle Barrieren zu überwinden und den Verhandlungsvorgang voranzutreiben.\n\nEs ist wichtig zu beachten, dass Kultur sich nicht unbedingt auf eine national/internationale Dichotomie beschränkt. Die meisten Unternehmen innerhalb eines Landes haben ihre eigene Unternehmenskultur. Zum Beispiel kann eine Unternehmenskultur lange Arbeitszeiten im Büro oder eine entspanntere Arbeitszeit betonen. Beweise einer Unternehmenskultur können in Kleidervorschriften, in der Kommunikationsweise (direkte v. indirekte Kommunikation, Delegierung von Aufgaben), und im Personalwesen zu sehen sein. Einige Unternehmen ermutigen Philanthropie auf jeden Weg von Mitarbeitern, andere beschränken es auf \"Unternehmensgenehmigte\" Wohltätigkeit oder Veranstaltungen. Man muss nur in die Unterschiede in der amerikanischen Unternehmenskultur zwischen Unternehmen sehen (und tatsächlich, intrafirmen Vielfalt besteht sogar von Region zu Region, von urbanen zu suburbanen Umgebungen) um die Vielfalt an Gedanken zu würdigen, die innerhalb einer bestimmten gesellschaftlichen Kultur vorkommen können. Einige Kulturen sind nicht annähernd so strukturiert wie die amerikanische Kultur, und mögen einem Außenstehenden als uniformer erscheinen, aber ein ähnlicher äußerer Eindruck ist nur ein Zeichen, tiefer zu bohren.\n\nWerte sind noch wichtiger zu verstehen, weil sie die \"Warum\" einer Kultur liefern. Wenn das \"Gesicht wahren\" oder \"gemeinschaftliche Harmonie\" in einer Kultur geschätzt werden, ist es sicher, dass ein Verhandler nicht öffentlich Schande über sein Unternehmen oder seinen Vorgesetzten bringen wird, um am Verhandlungstisch erfolgreich zu sein.

    "original": "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",

    "raw_output": "German translation:\n\n\"Der Narr hat gesagt im Herzen: 'Es gibt keinen Gott.'\" Diese Zitat erscheint zum ersten Mal in Psalm 14 der christlichen Bibel und steht am Anfang von St. Anselms Argumentation über die Existenz Gottes. Diese Überzeugung scheint auch bei dem anderen Autor, den wir diskutieren werden, Thomas von Aquin, gehalten zu werden. Da jede ihrer Argumente in der Verteidigung des gleichen Konzepts stehen und unsere Herausforderung darin besteht zu bestimmen, dessen Argument das bessere ist, müssen wir uns, zum Zweck der Kürze, mit der Annahme abfinden, dass beide in ihrem Glauben an die Existenz Gottes richtig sind, insbesondere den Gott der Bibel. Wenn wir einen Gottartigen zulassen, der nicht dem gleicht, in dem unsere beiden Autoren glauben, würden wir es nicht in der Lage sein, ihre beiden Argumente angemessen zu vergleichen, da sie in der Verteidigung eines bestimmten Gotteskonzepts stehen. Mit anderen Worten gesagt, ich denke, dass, obwohl jeder von ihnen valide Punkte bringt, keiner von ihnen eine umfassende Grundlage für den Glauben an Gott bietet.\n\nUm diesen Punkt zu illustrieren, werden wir zunächst das grundlegende Argument von St. Anselm untersuchen. Anselms Passage spiegelt einen Weg zum Verständnis durch Glauben wider, indem man sich selbstsucht, um Beweise für Gott zu finden. Er erklärt, dass Gott in unserem Verständnis existiert, und wir können daher nicht effektiv seinen Nichtexistenzkonzept erfassen. Während dieser Konzept, wenn es in seinen Terminologie ausgedrückt wird, ein bisschen mühsam und manchmal unklar ist, umfasst der grundlegende Inhalt, dass der Beweis für Gott in der eigenen Seele liegt. St. Anselm schlägt uns vor, dass wir keine Wahrheit über Gott außerhalb der Grenzen unserer eigenen Seele suchen müssen, sondern dass die Existenz dieses Wesens durch die Untersuchung von dem wahrzunehmen ist, was wir innewohnend wahrnehmen. Fremde Beweise werden vorausgesetzt, als unnötig. Diese Idee, dass man akzeptiert, was empirische Beweise nicht unumstößlich belegen, wird in christlichen Texten oft als Glaube bezeichnet.\n\nDiese Idee ist sehr unterschiedlich von derjenigen von St. Thomas von Aquin. Aquin schlägt vor, dass die Existenz Gottes vollständig durch Vernunft und empirische Beweise bewiesen werden kann, ohne dass Glaube notwendig ist. Ein solches Vorhaben wäre in der Evangelisation, einem wichtigen Element des Christentums, von Vorteil, da es ermöglichen würde, neue Konvertiten ohne Abhängigkeit von ihrer Bereitschaft an etwas zu glauben, das nicht bewiesen werden kann, zu gewinnen. Sie könnten stattdessen allein durch Logik überzeugt werden. St. Thomas erweitert fünf verschiedene logische Argumente zur Unterstützung der Existenz Gottes: Wechsel, Kausalität, Kontingenz, Grad der Vollkommenheit und Harmonie. Bei jedem davon zeigt er im Wesentlichen, dass der Beweis Gottes in der logischen Notwendigkeit für Gott liegt. Wenn Sie erzählt wird, dass Sie ein Puzzlestück fehlen und die restlichen Teile des Puzzles zusammengesetzt haben, diktiert die Logik, dass Sie von den Merkmalen und der Existenz des fehlenden Teils wissen können, ohne es zu sehen.\n\nEnglish translation:\n\n[REWRITE] “The fool has said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” This quote is first seen in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and is at the beginning of St. Anselm's argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to be also held by the other author we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Since each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine which is the better of the two, we must, for the sake of brevity, begin with the assumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a comprehensive basis for belief in God.\n\nTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm's passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within oneself to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his non-existence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one's own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\nThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.

Während seines Lebens gab er die Welt auf und wurde geistig erweckt, und seine Lehren führten zur Bildung des Buddhismus – der orthodoxeste Zweig desselben ist der Theravada-Buddhismus. Die Religion ist etwa zweitausendfünfhundert Jahre alt; sie sieht heute anders aus als damals, als Buddha lebte. Dies kann man überall sehen, zum Beispiel in der theravadischen Nation Sri Lankas, wo das jährliche Wasserschnittfest begangen wird. Mönche und Laien nehmen gemeinsam an diesem Fest teil, und es hat religiöse Bedeutung, obwohl Buddha nie über eine solche Feier lehrte. Diese Unterschiede reichen von den oberflächlichen Traditionen bis zum soziologischen Kern der Religion. Die theravadische buddhistische Gemeinschaft, sowohl aus monastischer als auch aus der laizistischen Perspektive, musste ihre dogmatischen Prinzipien im Laufe der Zeit ändern. Dies kann auf Kräfte sowohl aus dem Äußeren als auch dem Inneren, sowohl Feindseligkeit als auch Milde, zurückgeführt werden.\n\nEs gibt eine Reihe von Qualifikationstermen, die diese Diskussion häufig verwenden wird. Es gibt den Begriff des Innern versus dem Äußeren. Hierbei wird ein innere Kraft als eine Kraft angesehen, die von Mitgliedern der Buddhasasana ausgeht, unabhängig von ihrem monastischen Status. Eine äußere Kraft ist jede Kraft aus Nicht-Buddhisten. Eine feindselige Kraft ist jede Kraft, die das buddhistische Gebiet schädigt oder beabsichtigt, es zu schädigen – eine Kraft, die von einer negativen Vorstellung des Buddhismus ausgeht. Eine milde Kraft ist eine Kraft, die nicht beabsichtigt, das buddhistische Gebiet zu schädigen oder zu helfen – obwohl es dabei passieren kann, dass man es letztendlich tut. Diese Termini werden in dieser Diskussion mehrfach aufgeführt.\n\nZurück zu den Grundlagen der Religion – zu den Lehren, die im Kern des Theravada-Buddhismus liegen. Buddhisten suchen im Doppelgitter des Buddhas, der Dhamma und der Sangha Zuflucht. Die Dhamma besteht im Wesentlichen aus den Tripitaka – den drei Körben – buddhistischer Texte. Das Sutta-Pitaka enthält alle Suttas, das Vinaya-Pitaka die Disziplinarregeln und das Abhidhamma-Pitaka die metaphysischen Komponenten des Buddhismus. Die metaphysischen Vorstellungen umfassen Dinge wie Anatta – keine Seele, Dukkha – innere Leiden in dem Leben, und Anicca – die Unbeständigkeit alles. Nur durch das Erkennen dieser Konzepte kann man Sansara, den Kreislauf der Tod und Wiedergeburt, beenden, der sich ständig abspielt. Mit Sansara werden auch Lobha – Begierde, Dosa – Hass und Moha – Täuschung vergangen, wenn man geistig erweckt wird. Im Vinaya-Pitaka werden Regeln für das Leben festgelegt. Für Laien gibt es fünf Präzedenzregeln (Ich werde nicht töten, ich werde nicht lügen, ich werde nicht stehlen, ich werde mich nicht sexuell missbrauchen und ich werde keine Beruhigungsmittel nehmen). Für Mönche gibt es viele mehr Disziplinarregeln, die zu befolgen sind. Das grundlegendste dogmatische Prinzip im Buddhismus ist die Erkenntnis der vier edlen Wahrheiten. Erstens, Dukkha; die Wahrheit, dass das Leben Leiden ist. Zweitens, dass die Bindung Leiden verursacht. Drittens, dass Leiden überwunden werden kann.\n\nEnglish translation:\n\n[REWRITE]In the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who one day would be known as Buddha was born.

The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.

Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).

(Diehl und Goerts 2000, S. 145). Der Höhepunkt dieser Rivalität war der Mexikanisch-Amerikanische Krieg von 1846-1848, in dem die Vereinigten Staaten Mexiko angegriffen und besiegt und für sich Texas und den amerikanischen Südwesten als neues Territorium gesichert haben.  Viele andere Auseinandersetzungen fanden zwischen den beiden Nationen statt, bis sie sich nur kurz vor dem Ersten Weltkrieg beruhigten.  Die Rivalität begann, als Amerikaner und Mexikaner auf wichtige Themen wie Religion, Kultur und Tradition aneinandergerieten und einen schwerwiegenden Konflikt der materialen Interessen hatten (Schmitt 1974, S. 30-31).   \n\nDies ähnelt vielen anderen Nationen, die eine dauerhafte Rivalität mit einem Nachbarn haben.  Nationen, die eine gemeinsame Grenze haben, neigen dazu, Konflikte von Interessen zu haben, die die Schaffung rivalisierender Positionen zwischen den Nationen begünstigen.  Die Vereinigten Staaten und Mexiko sind nicht unähnlich vielen anderen dauerhaften Rivalitäten zwischen Nationen, die eine gemeinsame Grenze teilen.  David M. Pletcher (1977) sagt, dass „nur in Mexiko und Kuba kann man lange andauernde übergeordnete amerikanische diplomatische Probleme finden“ (S. 41). Tatsächlich belegen beide Nationen eine geografische Nähe zu den Vereinigten Staaten und waren Rivalen der Vereinigten Staaten, während andere Nationen in Lateinamerika gute Beziehungen zu den Vereinigten Staaten genossen haben.  \n\nReligiöse Probleme schufen eine Spaltung zwischen den beiden Nationen, ein Problem, das viele Nationen durch die Geschichte geplagt hat.  Sally Frahm (2001) sagt, dass „wenn Amerikaner im 20. Jahrhundert dem Faschismus und dem Kommunismus entgegenstanden, im 18. und 19. Jahrhundert dem Katholizismus und dem Monarchismus“ (S. 86). Nicht anders als die Rivalität des Kalten Krieges zwischen den Vereinigten Staaten und der Sowjetunion war diese Rivalität teilweise ideologischer Kampf und teilweise eine Konkurrenz um Interessen, die jede Nation für lebensnotwendig erachtete.  In diesem Fall jedoch waren die ideologischen Auseinandersetzungen nicht auf die politische Struktur, sondern auf die religiösen Vorlieben der Vereinigten Staaten und Mexiko basiert.  Dieser Misstrauenskultur wuchs aus dem Misstrauen zwischen den Engländern und den Spaniern heran.  Von ihren ehemaligen Kolonialherren erbten die Gefühle von Misstrauen, was ein größerer Hinderungsgrund im Aufbau guter Beziehungen zwischen den Vereinigten Staaten und Mexiko war.\n\nDiehl und Goerts (2000) listeten 17 Konflikte zwischen Mexiko und den Vereinigten Staaten während der 57-jährigen Rivalität auf.  Die meisten Konflikte zwischen der Rivalität, die von Diehl und Goerts beschrieben, sind territoriale Probleme, die sich aus Grenzraub von mexikanischem Territorium auf US-amerikanisches Territorium und andere Grenzprobleme ergeben.  Grenzüberfälle durch Banditen und Outlaws aus amerikanischen Grenzstädten waren ein erheblicher Problem, das bis beide die Vereinigten Staaten und Mexiko auf ihren Grenzen Milizialkraft einsetzten (Schmitt 1974, S. 97).  \n\nSchmitt (1974) erklärte, dass die Rivalität zwischen den beiden Nationen abnahm, als „Mexiko in einem wesentlichen Maße von den Vereinigten Staaten abhängig wurde“ (S. 109) und schließlich endete, als die amerikanischen Ambitionen „sich von territorialer Expansion zur wirtschaftlichen Intervention in Mexiko wandelten“ (S. 110) im späten 19.

Ich hatte mich für meine Berufswahl aus einer tief verwurzelten Bedürfnis nach Sicherheit und Stabilität entschieden, die ich als Kind nicht hatte. ‚Du wirst immer eine Arbeit finden; die Menschen werden immer krank werden‘, war das Mantra, das ich während meiner Adoleszenz und danach hörte. Also – obwohl mein Traum es war, Wissenschaftlerin oder Journalistin zu werden, bevorzugt ein bisschen von beidem, wählte ich den Beruf der Krankenschwester.\n\nJedenfalls war ich da: 46 Jahre alt und allein, kein Geld im Bankkonto und unfähig zu arbeiten. Bis zum heutigen Tag bin ich behindert und nach 15 Jahren Leben auf Sozialhilfe habe ich buchstäblich nichts mehr, das ich als 'mein' bezeichnen kann. Ich komme über die Runden, aber jeden Tag ist ein Kampf und ein Angriff auf meine Sicherheit, mein Wohlbefinden und mein Selbstwertgefühl. Nichts in meinem Leben ist mehr sicher, und trotzdem gibt es eines, was ich für wahr halte. Ohne die Hilfe meiner Familie und ein paar guten Freunden hätte ich es nicht geschafft, diese Jahre zu überstehen, egal wie stark ich war. Und glaubt mir, wenn wirklich ein echtes Unglück hereinbricht, fühlt man sich dann gar nicht sehr stark.\n\nMein Punkt ist, dass es in dem Leben immer wieder Notstände gibt – groß und klein. Es gibt keine Garantien und unabhängig davon, wie gut man sich vorbereitet, gibt es Dinge, die zu groß sind, um sie allein zu bewältigen.\n\nIch stimme voll und ganz der Meinung, dass wir in den USA aufhören sollten, alle unsere Eier in den 'Basket des großen Staates' zu legen; der ist ohnehin schmierig und bricht auseinander. Doch ich würde lieber sehen, dass die Amerikaner wieder lernen, sich gegenseitig zu vertrauen – sich gegenseitig zu helfen und nach Hilfe zu fragen, anstatt dass jeder von uns einzeln in den Garten geht, um Notfall-Schutzschuppen zu bauen.\n\nDie Konservativen in den USA sprechen von der 'rugged individualism', die dieses Land aufgebaut hat; aber in Wirklichkeit war es nicht die rugged individualism, die unsere Vorfahren in Zeiten der Not vorantrieb, sondern Mitgefühl, gegenseitiges Respekt und der Austausch von Ressourcen. Die Pioniere, die über die Rocky Mountains in Pferdewagenzügen zogen, erreichten die Küste nicht allein, indem sie es alleine taten.\n\nAlso, bereitet euch vor. Ich bin vorbereitet. Ich habe einen Notfallkoffer; Blutversorgungsmittel, Wasserreinigungstabletten und Plastikfolie und Klebeband für die Fenster im Falle eines biologischen Angriffs. Ich habe mehrere Taschenlampen und allsorts von Batterien, viel, viel Kerzen und wasserdichte Streichhölzer und Dosenware, auch. Wenn ihr ein Stück Land und Ressourcen für ein kleines Bauernhaus und die Fähigkeit habt, eure eigene Lebensmittel zu konservieren oder zu konservieren – dann tut es. Es ist eine großartige Idee, sofern ihr nicht in einem Apartment wohnt. \n\nAber während ihr drauf seid, lernt euch euren Nachbarn kennen.\n\n[REWRITE] Fifteen years ago, I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed.\n\nI was a nurse at the time.

Gibt es Einschränkungen oder Beschränkungen, die den Weg der evolutionären Veränderung beeinflussen? Obwohl D'Arcy Thompson 1917 bereits festgestellt hatte, dass \"der Zoologe sogar jetzt noch nicht begonnen hat, die einfacheste organische Form in mathematischer Sprache zu definieren\", gilt das auch heute noch. In jüngster Zeit wurde mathematisches Modellieren auf allgemeine Aspekte der Skelettgenese von Mollusken durch Ontogenie und Phylogenie angewendet (z. B. Raup und Stanley, 1981). Unsere Studie untersucht, wie mathematisches Modellieren von ontogenetischen und phylogenetischen Veränderungen in Prunum in Kombination mit experimentellen Studien verwendet werden kann, um die Mechanismen zu klären, die die Richtung und Größe der evolutionären-entwicklungsbedingten Veränderungen beeinflussen. Wir haben Röntgenbilder von Arten von Prunum verwendet, um quantitative Parameter zu definieren, die dann verwendet werden können, um hypothetische und reale Skelettmorphologien zu modellieren. Diese Parameter wurden in das Softwareprogramm CerioShell (Stone, 1995) eingegeben. Wir haben hypothetische Schalenmorphologien modelliert, die verwendet werden konnten, um die Grenzen möglicher morphologischer Veränderungen in Prunum zu interpretieren. Diese Ergebnisse werden mit experimentellen und beschreibenden Studien kombiniert, um die makroevolutionären Ereignisse in dieser Klade besser zu verstehen.\n\nEine Schale kann als Struktur betrachtet werden, die eine Röhre durch Zeit und Raum von 360 Grad zurücklegt. Diese Revolutionen oder Wendungen einer gewundenen Schale werden als Whorls bezeichnet, die um einen imaginären Mittelpunkt gedreht werden. Dieser Mittelpunkt verläuft durch das zentrale Säulenpaar der Schale und wird als Columella bezeichnet. Die Geschwindigkeit, mit der sich die Whorlen vergrößern können variieren, und eine kontinuierliche Linie trennt jede Whorl und wird Sutura genannt. In den meisten Schalen ist die letzte Whorl (Körperwhorl) die größte. Die Spitze der Schale wird als Spire bezeichnet, die restlichen Whorls werden als Spire bezeichnet. Die Spitze ist der Scheitelpunkt der Spire und das gegenüberliegende Ende wird als Basis bezeichnet. Das Tier kommt aus seiner Schale durch eine Öffnung, die als Apertura bezeichnet wird.\n\nSchalen können in apikaler, basaler, aperturaler und abaperturaler Sicht betrachtet werden. (Die \"gewöhnliche\" Orientierung einer Schale ist eine aperturale Sicht, mit der Apertura zum Betrachter und mit der Spitze nach oben.)\n\nEin Verfahren zur Zählung von Whorls wird unten beschrieben. Zuerst sollte die Schale von der apikalen Sicht betrachtet werden, und dann sollte bestimmt werden, wo die erste Sutura beginnt. Eine Linie kann dann gezogen werden, die die Schale in zwei Teile teilt. Whorls werden von dieser Linie gezählt und auf ein Viertel einer Whorl geschätzt.\n\nEine Schale kann als eine Reihe von Öffnungen betrachtet werden, die durch Zeit und Raum reisen, während das Tier seine Schale aufbaut (i.e. akkumuliert). Es ist möglich, die Bahn der Apertura zu verfolgen, indem Koordinaten des Zentrums jeder Whorlsapertura sowie der horizontalen und vertikalen Radius der Apertura verwendet werden.\n\nDiese Trajektorie kann grafisch und mathematisch dargestellt werden. Sobald eine mathematische Formulierung erstellt wurde, ist es dann möglich, Parameter zu variieren und die Skelettgenese des Mollusken zu modifizieren.\n\n[REWRITE]\nWhy do organisms evolve as they do?

The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.

In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.

Obwohl das Land auf dem Weg ist, viele der Millenniumsziele zu erreichen, wie die Ziele für Wasser und Sanitärversorgung, sind die Verbesserungen in der kindlichen und mütterlichen Gesundheit weit hinter den erforderlichen Verbesserungen zurück.  Die mehrfachen Ursachen für diese Mängel werden unten diskutiert und deuten darauf hin, dass die Gesundheitssysteme stärker werden sollten als auf programmbasierte Interventionen.\n\nIndonesien hat Verbesserungen in der Anzahl von Geburten mit einem qualifizierten Gesundheitsarbeiter, mit 72% der Geburten, die dieses Ziel erreichen.  Es ist jedoch zu beachten, dass diese Kategorie traditionelle Arbeiter einschließt, wie Hebammen, die keine medizinische Interventionen durchführen können, falls die Schwangerschaft kompliziert ist (hiermit die große Anzahl an Müttertode durch Blutung).  In anderen Worten sind die Verbesserungen in diesem bestimmten Indikator irreführend und es gibt noch viel zu tun.  Zusätzlich gab es einen Rückgang im Prozentsatz der durch einen Gesundheitsfachmann behandelten Diarrhoeen bei Kindern unter fünf Jahren.  Während die Daten zur postnatalen Pflege unvollständig sind, ist klar, dass auch dieser Bereich eine Sorge ist, mit niedrigen Raten in ganz Indonesien.\n\nKaiserschnittraten sind immer noch niedriger als zu erwarten, um die 4%.  Die Kaiserschnittquote zeigt zusätzlich ein anderes besorgniserregendes Problem an.  Während die Rate von Kaiserschnitten in städtischen Gebieten 7% beträgt, beträgt sie nur 2% in ländlichen Gebieten.  Dies deutet darauf hin, dass das Problem der Gleichheit der Abdeckung in ganz Indonesien besteht.  Es ist klar, dass der Zugang zu Gesundheitsdiensten in urbanen Gebieten konzentriert ist.  Ein weiteres Problem im Zugang betrifft die vertikale Gleichheit.  Es besteht ein 27-Prozent-Gap in der Nutzung der Dienste zwischen der ärmsten und reichsten Quintile.  Es ist offensichtlich, dass die Armen es viel schwieriger finden, Zugang zu Gesundheitsdiensten zu erhalten, wahrscheinlich aufgrund von außerhalb der Tasche Kosten.\n\nBei der Diskussion der nächsten Schritte zur Verbesserung der Neonatal- und Müttergesundheitsindikatoren ist die grundlegendste Frage, wie man am effektivsten die mangelnde Dienstleistung anpacken sollte.  Speziell, sollte Indonesien spezifische Ansätze entwickeln oder das Gesundheitssystem stärken, ohne sich auf pränatale und postnatale Pflege für die Mutter und das Kind zu konzentrieren.  Es gibt kein Zweifel daran, dass programmbasierte Ansätze, um die Probleme oben zu lösen, attraktiv sind.  Nicht nur haben \"vertikale Ansätze\", die sich auf ein Sektor der Verbesserungen konzentrieren, viel mehr zielgerichtete, managierbare Ziele, sie ergeben auch in der Regel schnellere Ergebnisse.  Es gibt jedoch einige Einschränkungen zu beachten.  Eine Haupteinschränkung ist, dass das Investieren in Programmierung für ein bestimmtes Gebiet oft bedeutet, dass das Budget für andere Gebiete leidet und personelle Ressourcen sich auf das Gebiet konzentrieren, das mehr Ressourcen hat (der Effekt der internationalen Finanzierung zu HIV/AIDS und sein Effekt auf die Familienplanung ist ein Beispiel).  Zusätzlich führt die Durchführung mehrerer paralleler Programme in einem Bereich zu einer Vielzahl von Duplikation von Diensten, die auch zwischen den Programmen unkoordiniert sind.  Dies führt zu einer Zunahme von Formularen und -papieren für die Lieferung und Finanzierung.\n\nEnglish translation:\n\n[REWRITE] The neonatal and infant mortality rate in Indonesia remained relatively stable over the last ten years.

Indonesia has made improvements in the number of births attended by a skilled health worker, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  However, this category still includes traditional workers such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions in case of a complicated pregnancy (hence the large number of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words, the improvements made in this specific indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  Additionally, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.  Cesarean-section rates are still lower than expected, around 4%.  The cesarean-section rates also point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of cesarean sections is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural areas.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly, access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly, the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out-of-pocket costs.  In discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre- and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do \"vertical approaches\" that target one sector of improvements have more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  However, there are some drawbacks to keep in mind.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  Additionally, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding.",

Zwei Romane, die als victoriansch gelten, aber sich von dieser Tradition entfernen, sind Oliver Twist und Wuthering Heights.  Beide Romane greifen ein Element der Geheimnis und eine lebhafte Vorliebe für das Bizarre auf, was für die Romane der Zeit untypisch ist, was die Charaktere innerhalb jeder Arbeit stärkt; es liefert Einblicke, die sich auf ihre Motive und Emotionen aufschließen.\n\n„Und jetzt kamen Herden verwirrender und verwirrender Ideen auf ihn zu, die sich an seine Ohren drängten. Er schien noch dazwischen zu wandeln zwischen Sikes und Crackit, die streitend waren: denn die Worte, die sie sagten, klangen in seinen Ohren, und wenn er ihre Aufmerksamkeit einbezog, … fand er, dass er mit ihnen sprach...  Plötzlich fuhr er zurück bei dem Knall von Feuerwaffen; und es stieg ein lautes Geschrei und Geschrei in die Luft, und vor seinen Augen leuchteten Lichter auf, und alles war Lärm und Tumult, während eine unsichtbare Hand ihn eilig davontrug. Durch all diese raschen Visionen lief eine unbestimmte, unbehagliche Bewusstsein von Schmerzen, das ihn ständig quälte und marterte.“\n\nDie zwei Romane nutzen dieses Geheimnis oft durch Traumsequenzen oder traumähnliche Zustände, obwohl der Inhalt und die Funktion in jedem spezifischen Fall variiert. In Oliver Twist offenbaren sich die seltsamen Begebenheiten oft Einblicke in Olivers innere Schichten, was ihn schmerzt und was er über die wahre Natur der um ihn herum Geschehenden bewusst ist. Als die Schießerei von Oliver schließlich in Kapitel 28 wiederholt wird, erlebt Oliver die Schießerei lebhaft, als ob in einem Traum, während er sich bemüht, Hilfe zu finden (siehe links). Die Passage betont den Mangel an Kontrolle, den Oliver über die sich abspielenden Ereignisse hatte, sowie die schwierigen Verhältnisse, in die sich sein Gesundheitszustand gebracht hatte, die stark durch Olivers Halluzinationen von Sikes und Crackit vorhanden war. Die Schießerei überwältigt ihn, all seine Sinne sind benommen, während er sich nicht auf den \"unsichtbaren Hand\" aufmerksam macht, der ihn davontrug; er erlebt seine Verzweiflung erneut, entfernt von dem Schock des Schmerzes, als der Schmerz jetzt konstant und mit Angst verbunden ist, anstatt mit Überraschung. Durch Olivers Überwältigung wird die Frage aufgeworfen, wessen Wille seine Missgeschicke verschuldet hat, da es sicherlich nicht sein eigener war. Diese Schießerei verstärkt die Vorstellung, dass Oliver über nichts Kontrolle hat, da er nicht einmal versucht, die Kontrolle über einen Ereignisses Ausgang zu erlangen, selbst wenn sein Leben in Gefahr ist. Ein wachsendes Gefühl der Niederlage in Oliver wird auch impliziert, als wenn alter Fagin ihn bereits gebrochen hatte, ihn in diese Verzweiflung zu zwingen, seine Fähigkeit, zu reagieren, zu beeinflussen. Andernfalls kann angenommen werden, dass Oliver zumindest aus reinem Selbstschutz versucht hätte, etwas zu unternehmen.\n\n„Der Tag verging – Tag! Es gab keinen Tag; er war schnell gekommen und war schon wieder verschwunden – und die Nacht kam wieder; eine Nacht so lang und gleichzeitig so kurz; lang in ihrem furchtbaren Schweigen und kurz in ihren Entfernten.\n\nEnglish translation back to English:\n\n[REWRITE] Victorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the time period.

Ich tat mein Bestes, wobei immer das eine oder andere Fach zu helfen, in dem sie Schwierigkeiten hatten, aber meine Stärken lagen im Englischen und im Lesen. Ich wurde von einem der Lehrer gebeten, einen Jungen namens Adrian zu unterstützen, der große Schwierigkeiten hatte, zu lesen. Ich glaube, er war entweder in der dritten oder vierten Klasse. Es fiel mir auf, dass es etwas nicht stimmte; er hatte extrem seltsame Probleme. Einige Buchstaben verstand er perfekt, andere nicht einmal annähernd, es war das seltsamste, was ich je gesehen habe. Ich war mir sicher, dass er von lateinamerikanischer Abstammung war, aber der Junge sprach perfekt Englisch. Wir hatten Schwierigkeiten, bis ich seine Mutter traf. Ich half aus, indem ich ein paar Kinder betreute, während die restlichen Schüler auf einer Schulausflug waren. Seine Mutter sprach kein Wort Englisch, nur Spanisch. Mit meinem sehr schlechten Wissen von Spanisch (ich lernte es gerade erst) konnten wir uns aber kommunizieren. Aber es war dann, als traf es mich wie ein Schlag: Adrian konnte lesen, er wusste nur nicht gut das englische Alphabet. Ich weiß nicht, ob diese Entdeckung ihm jemals half, aber ich hoffe, dass er jetzt besser ist.\n\nIch erzähle diese Geschichte, um mich auf das Problem der Sprachbarriere in den Schulen einzulassen, insbesondere hier in Kalifornien. Ich erzähle sie auch, um zu beweisen, dass es nicht immer so offensichtlich ist, wie wir denken. Selbst für einen Kind, das perfekt Englisch spricht, kann das Lesen noch ein riesiger Hinderungsgrund sein. Ich denke, wir können alle zustimmen, dass dieses Problem existiert, aber was machen wir? In Adrians Fall war die Lösung einfach: Englisch-Unterricht, besonders des Alphabets und der Aussprache. Aber für die vielen Kinder, die kaum Englisch sprechen, ist die Lösung viel komplexer. Es gibt keine einfache Antwort. Der Zweisprachensystem, die Mainstream-Integration, private Tutoren, ESL-Kurse, keine dieser Dinge allein wird dieses Problem lösen. Die Lösung liegt darin, alle oben genannten Dinge zu kombinieren!\n\nZunächst einmal ist das Zweisprachensystem eine großartige Idee. Nicht nur für Kinder, die Spanisch als erste Sprache sprechen, sondern für alle Kinder. „Kinder in zweisprachigen Bildungssystemen haben sich wissenschaftlich nachgewiesen, ihre Mitschüler akademisch überlegen zu sein.“ Viele Ängste umgeben dieses Konzept, dass es ein Verschwendung von Ressourcen ist und dass die Mehrheit der Kinder in den Schulen keinen Nutzen daraus ziehen wird. Das ist falsch. Wenn wir diese Art von Programmen im Klassenzimmer als Regel anwenden, anstatt als Ausnahme, würde sich alle Kinder davon profitieren lassen. Aber wie gehen wir vor? Sollen wir alle Lehrer bilingual sein lassen? Nein, das wäre unvernünftig und etwas unrealistisch. Ich denke jedoch, dass es keinen Grund gibt, warum wir keine speziellen Helfer nicht haben können, die bilingual sind, also beispielsweise Tutoren oder Aids.\n\nTranslation back to English:\n\n[REWRITE] Several years ago, I worked in an after-school program tutoring elementary school students.

Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to temple, or search within themselves for answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there is anything beyond our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value system only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.

He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body.  His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.

Der gotische Modus wurde geschmäht, gelobt, beschuldigt, keine wahre Tiefe zu haben, und gelobt für das \"entsetzliche Sublime\", was er zu evokieren schien (Burke). Die ursprüngliche \"Gothic Novel\", Horace Walpoles The Castle of Otranto, verwendete die Ideen von \"alten\" und \"modernen\" Romanen, um das proto-gotische Genre zu schaffen und einen neuen literarischen Ausdruck zu schaffen. Walpole verwendet \"alte\" Theater-Elemente und \"neue\" Nachahmung der Natur in \"modernen\" Romanen, um die von ihm bezeichnete \"Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4) zu präsentieren. Die gotische Gattung nutzt viele Rückverweise auf mittelalterliche gotische Theatre, Architektur und Traditionen. Bereits während der Veröffentlichung von The Castle of Otranto wurde die Wort \"gotisch\" verwendet, um viele verschiedene Völker, Stile und Epochen zu beschreiben. Es wurde als archaisch oder unsophistiziert wahrgenommen, gegenüber \"modernen\" gesellschaftlichen und literarischen \"Fortschritten\". Die Kombination der mehr theatralischen \"gotischen\" und der neuen Romanform (die dem Leser eine persönlichere Sicht auf die Psychologie der Figuren ermöglicht) ist es, was es der gotischen Literatur ermöglicht, für so lange Zeit zu bestehen und sich gleichzeitig für einen Leser, der weit entfernt im Zeitraum von der Originalveröffentlichung ist, als veraltet und neu darzustellen.\n\nEines der vorherrschenden gotischen Ideen in den gotischen Romanen ist der Begriff von Ritterlichkeit. Die mittelalterliche Idee von der Ritterlichkeit, der Prozess der Ausbildung eines rechten Ritters, wird in der ursprünglichen gotischen Erzählung, The Castle of Otranto, sowohl aufbewahrt als auch transformiert. Ritterlichkeit ist besonders für Gothic-Schriftsteller wichtig, weil sie, was sie repräsentierte – der klassische Ritter, tapfer, ehrenhaft, fähig – und der vermutete oder wahrgenommenen Mangel an diesem Ideal, den diese Schriftsteller (insbesondere Walpole) in der Gesellschaft sahen. Durch die Verwendung der ritterlichen Konzepte und Manieren wird der \"gotische Vergangenheit\" idealisiert und romantisiert (hindeutend auf die zukünftige Entwicklung von Gothic zu Romantik) und wird verwendet, um den gegenwärtigen Zustand zu verbessern. Walpole war, als er The Castle of Otranto schrieb, inmitten eines politisch angespannten Zeitalters und war entsetzt über die mögliche Zukunft. Er, in die Politik und (debattierbar) ungerechte Anklagen vertieft, mögen begonnen haben, bereits dann, wenn nicht explizit, zu denken, dass die vermutete Moral und angeborene \"Gütigkeit\" in den Menschen, die in der gotischen Epoche existierten, in jenen, die die \"gelenkte Gesellschaft\" ausmachten, in irgendeiner Weise verloren gegangen sind. In seiner Schrift wird dieser Gedanke klar in mehreren Charakteren sichtbar, einer davon ist der Charakter Frederic. Der Leser kann sehen, bevor er Frederic trifft, dass er viele ritterliche Züge aufweist, er ist beschrieben als:\n\nDie Beschreibung von ihm enthält viele traditionelle ritterliche Bilder; Frederic ist, vor allem, ein Fürst, er hat gelitten, wurde angemessen von der Tragödie berührt, die er verließ, und ist derzeit von Infideln getötet zu sein. Die Figur des \"gallanten und höflichen Ritters\" ist natürlich übertrieben, bringt die bald zu werden gotische Trope der Überschätzung in Spiel (66).\n\nEnglish translation:\n\n[REWRITE] The traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name, an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel.

Der Begriff Supply-Chain-Management wurde 1982 von Keith Oliver, einem Berater, erfunden. Keith Oliver beschrieb den Gesamtprozess der Planung, Implementierung und Kontrolle von Prozessen in der Supply Chain, um die Bedürfnisse der Kunden in einer schnellen und effizienten Weise zu befriedigen. Es gibt sechs Schlüsslelemente in der Supply Chain: Produktion, Lieferung, Lagerung, Standort, Transport und Information. Geschäftsmanager nutzen diese sechs Schlüsslelemente, um den Kunden den besten Service zu bieten. \n\tProduktion ist der erste Schritt im Supply-Chain-Prozess. Die Produktion ist die Grundlage für den gesamten Supply-Chain-Prozess. Der Produktionsstufe wird die Auflistung von Zeit, Gründen, Ort und Vorgang festgelegt, wie alles produziert werden soll. Manager müssen wissen, was die Kunden wollen. Damit Manager wissen, was die Kunden wollen, können sie den Markt analysieren. Der Markt ist der größte Indikator, um zu entscheiden, was die Kunden verlangen.  Sobald Manager den Markt analysiert haben und die Anforderungen der Kunden verstanden haben, sind sie bereit, zu entscheiden, welche Produkte hergestellt werden sollen und wie viele davon hergestellt werden sollen. Nachdem sich die Management entschieden hat, was hergestellt wird und wie viele, sind sie bereit, zu entscheiden, wo die Produkte hergestellt werden sollen und welcher Standort am besten für die Menge und Qualität der Ware ist, wobei der Kundennachfrage und Zufriedenheit berücksichtigt werden müssen.  Nachdem die Standort für die Produktion der Produkte entschieden ist, ist der nächste Schritt die Fokussierung der Manager auf die Terminplanung und die Wartung von Ausrüstungen. Die Produktion ist ein sehr wichtiger Schritt im Supply-Chain-Prozess.  Jeder Details ist im gesamten Prozess entscheidend. Wenn alle Details nicht entsprechend geplant werden, kann dies dem Unternehmen viel Zeit und Geld im Laufe der Zeit kosten. Zum Beispiel habe ich früher bei Wal-Mart und Target-Einzelhandelsgeschäften gearbeitet. Beide Unternehmen haben ein Design, ein Buch und einen Prozess für jeden Teil des Unternehmens. Es besteht ein geplantes Layout, wie ein Arbeitnehmer angezogene Schutzkleidung aussehen sollte, um den Eingang von Sendungen von LKWs zu ermöglichen. Die Veröffentlichung von Prozessen ermöglicht es einem Unternehmen, reibungslos zu arbeiten, ohne Verwirrung über Richtung und Erwartungen.\n\nDie zweite Schlüsselkomponente im Supply-Chain-Management ist die Lieferung. Die Lieferung ist definiert als strategische Entscheidungen, die getroffen werden sollten, um die Kernfähigkeiten einer Einrichtung und Outsourcing-Partnerschaften zu bestimmen, die aus diesen Entscheidungen wachsen. Ein Unternehmen kann viele verschiedene Produktionsabteilungen für ein einzelnes Produkt haben.  Jede Abteilung besteht aus verschiedenen Ausrüstungen, Arbeitnehmern und Spezialisten. Der Manager muss entscheiden, welche Abteilung am besten für die unterschiedlichen Prozesse des Produkts geeignet ist.    Die Management kann auch entscheiden, die Arbeit an andere Unternehmen auszulagern. Der Hauptgrund, warum ein Manager die Arbeit an Unternehmen auslagern würde, ist die Geschwindigkeit zu schaffen. Geschwindigkeit ist die Fähigkeit, Qualität und Flexibilität zu liefern und gleichzeitig Kosten zu reduzieren oder niedrige Kostenebenen beizubehalten.\n\nBack translation:\n[REWRITE] Supply chain management is the flow of processes that moves goods from customer orders through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and product distribution to the customer.

Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",

Nach den ersten einigen Aufständen begann die breite Öffentlichkeit Interesse an den Protesten zu nehmen, und während die birmanische Regierung zunächst der Mönchen zur Teilnahme an friedlichen Versammlungen zögerte, eskalierte die Gewalt bald in einem sogenannten Krieg zwischen den Mönchen und der Militärjunta, während die Militärjunta aktiv in Klöster einfiel und diese plünderte. Ausländische Journalisten wurden rund um die Uhr festgenommen und inhaftiert, ein japanischer Fotojournalist namens Kenji Nagai wurde am 27. September 2007 einfach deswegen getötet, weil er an einer Straßenprotest teilnahm. Während die offizielle Todeszahlen bei 13 Toten liegen, wird Colonel Hla Win, der sich vor der offiziellen Berichterstattung einige Tage zuvor von der Armee abgesetzt hat, zitiert, als er sagte, „Viele mehr Menschen wurden in den letzten Tagen getötet als Sie gehört haben. Die Toten können in mehreren Tausend gezählt werden.“\n\nDas ist nichts Neues. Während diese einige der jüngsten Beispiele von Atrocitäten in unserer Welt sind, hat sich der Wille einer Regierung, Widerstand zu unterdrücken und ihre Bürger in einem absoluten Griff zu halten, seit der Menschheit selbst bestand. Die frühen römischen Kaiser erklärten sich selbst als von den Göttern gewählt, um über jede Aspekt ihrer Gesellschaft zu herrschen. Japanische Kaiser werden tatsächlich für Götter gehalten, die unserer Welt gesandt wurden, um ihre Menschen zu einer prosperierenden Gesellschaft zu führen. Unsere gegenwärtige Präsidentin, George W. Bush, hält wöchentliche Konferenzschaltungen mit Ted Haggard, dem Anführer von Stupid People Worldwide, einer Tochtergesellschaft der Republikanischen Partei.\n\nEinige der bekanntesten Beispiele dieser Aktionen sind solche Vorfälle wie der Protest auf dem Tiananmen-Platz am 4. Juni 1989, an dem Intellektuelle, Gewerkschafter und Studenten zusammenkamen, um die autoritäre Regierung zu protestieren. Die Todeszahlen in diesem Fall reichen weit auseinander, während offizielle Berichte der chinesischen Regierung 200-300 Tote angeben, spricht die chinesische Rote Kreuz, zwischen 2.000-3.000 Tote. Ein weiteres Beispiel ist die rwandische Völkermord der 1990er Jahre, bei dem Hutu-Milizengruppen, unterstützt von der regierenden Partei in Ruanda, begannen, systematisch alle Tutsis sowie politische gemäßigte Personen, unabhängig von ihren ethischen Hintergründen, zu töten. Hitlers „Drittes Reich“, ein Zeitraum von mehreren Jahren und mehreren Ländern, an dem alle Juden aufgrund ihrer Hintergründe zusammengetrieben und getötet wurden, ist ein weiteres extrem Beispiel.\n\n[REWRITE] Hitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, the star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian country ruled by a tyrannical military junta who came to power in 1962 through the act of a coup d'état. In 2007 a series of street protests took place, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests were dubbed \"The Saffron Revolution\", named after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the initial uprisings, the public at large began to take an interest in the protests, and while the Burmese government initially allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, the violence escalated into an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries across the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll stands at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army a few days prior to the official report, is quoted as saying, \"Many more people have been killed in recent days than you've heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.\"\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government's desire to stifle dissent and maintain complete control over its citizenry has been around for as long as humanity has existed. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive authority over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republican Party.\n\nSome of the most well-known examples of these actions are such incidents as the June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square in 1989, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance varies widely, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports released by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead. Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, supported by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, regardless of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler's \"Third Reich\", a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example.\n\n[/REWRITE]",

Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color.

    "raw_output": "Original German translation:\n\nDuke Ellingtons' Erbe in der Jazzszene ergibt sich in erheblichem Maße aus seiner Lebensdauer und, im weiteren Sinne, seinen kreativen Fähigkeiten, sein Orchester zu formen. Ellingtons Präsenz am Klavier ist in vielen der für diese Aufgabe ausgewählten Kompositionen subtil, aber als Komponist hat Ellington das Talent, reiche und komplexe Stücke zu schaffen, die die individuellen Fähigkeiten der Bandmitglieder hervorheben. Ellington hat den Rahmen geschaffen, in dem ein Solist frei improvisieren kann, hinzu kommen geschriebene Stücke und Phrasen, die den spezifischen Stil der Bandmitglieder auf die Musikideen aufmerksam machen. Indem er dies tat, betonte er auch den Ton des Orchesters im Allgemeinen, indem er kohärente und originale Klangmotive für jedes Stück schuf. Ellingtons Meisterschaft in der Beherrschung des individuellen Klangs der Spieler und wie sie sich zusammenfügen, ermöglichte es ihm, einige der innovativsten und brillantesten Stücke in der Jazzgeschichte zu komponieren.\n\nDas Grove-Musiklexikon erwähnt in Bezug auf Ellingtons Klang und Innovation Creole Love Call, in welchem er die Stimme \"als Jazzinstrument\" während seiner Karriere verwendet. Dies ist ein frühes Beispiel für Ellingtons Verwendung der Stimme, um Textur und Farbe zu hinzufügen, ohne durch Texte behindert zu werden. Creole Love Call zeigt auch Ellingtons Fähigkeit, den Stil seiner Solisten zu ergänzen, ein Merkmal, das über sein ganzes Karriere hinweg erkennbar ist. Dieses langsame, überlegene Zwölftakterblues-Stück enthält sechs Chöre, wie folgt:\nChorus 1: Rufen und Antwort zwischen Stimme und Rohrblattinstrumenten, bei der die Stimme glatt und melodisch beginnt und dann zu einem raueren Klang gegen Ende übergeht.\nChorus 2: Gemüterter Trompeten-Solo, das die grundlegende Melodie erweitert und mehrere erweiterte blauen Töne betont.\nChorus 3: Umfassendes Klarinetten-Solo in einem hohen Register, von einem subtilen syncopierten Klavierphrasen begleitet.\nChorus 4: Die gesamte Band wiederholt den ersten Chor mit einem Rufen und Antwort zwischen Blech- und Rohrblatt-Sektionen.\nChorus 5: Der dramatische Chor des Stücks, bei dem die Rohrblätter nun das Rufen und Antwort beginnen und in einem hohen Register, mit syncopierten Stop-Time-Phrasen von Blech- und Rhythmussektionen begleitet.\nChorus 6: Ein Rückgang zum ersten Chor, mit Rufen und Antworten zwischen Stimme und Rohrblattinstrumenten. In diesem Chor übernimmt die Stimme die Klangfarbe des \"Growl\"-Technik, Solo wie ein Instrument.\nTag: Kurzer Tag, der eine Vocalrun und einen dissonanten Novitätsabschluss durch einen Posaunen-Tenor eingeleitet.\n\nEllingtons Verwendung der Stimme, um einer Dimension von Klangfarbe in diesem Stück hinzuzufügen, ist ein Beispiel für ein stilistisches Merkmal, das seinen Werk hindurch zieht.\nIn Hot und Bothered, aufgenommen ein Jahr später, kombiniert Ellington seine Fähigkeit zur engen Orchestrierung mit seinem Ohr für Klangfarbe. Ein Rufen-und-antwort-Phrasen zwischen \"Bubber\" Miley auf gedämpfter Trompete und Baby Cox's Skatgesang nutzt die vokalen Elemente von Miley's Spiel und die instrumentalen Aspekte von Cox's Stimme, um ein reiches und harmonisches Klangbild zu schaffen. In It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) verlängern diese Ideen sich, indem Ellington Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, eine feste Größe in Ellingtons Orchester, gut macht, um die Melodie auf gedämpfter Posaune einzuführen.\n\nGerman translation back to English (with slight variation):\nDuke Ellington's legacy in jazz primarily stems from his longevity and his creative skills to shape his orchestra.

She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear, but she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a step stool while trying to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.",

Sechsmal, zwischen 1984 und 2004, berechneten die Autoren einen aMed Diät-Score aus Selbstberichten über \"Ernährungsfragen\" (\"FFQs\"), die darauf ausgelegt waren, den Nährstoffverzehr in den vorherigen 12 Monaten zu bewerten.  Mehr als 95% der Krankenschwestern nahmen an der Teilnahme fortlaufend über die 20-Jahres-Periode teil. FFQs wurden an Studien zur Validierung unterzogen.  Die Berichte über CHD, tödliche CHD und Schlaganfälle wurden durch Revision von medizinischen oder Krankenhausakten, Autopsie oder Todesurkunden bestätigt.

Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation.

Die Arbeitslosenquote stieg an, der Immobilienmarkt brach ein und viele der größten und wichtigsten Unternehmen Amerikas befanden sich in ruinösen Zuständen. Diese Rezession besteht heute noch, und wir müssen die Frage stellen: Wie kam diese Krise zustande und wie können wir sie stoppen? Kurz gesagt, wurde die Finanzkrise durch selbstsüchtige und naiv politische Entscheidungen verursacht, die Banken und Firmen dazu zwangen, sub-prime-Kredite in eine bereits unzureichende und unsichere Finanzinfrastruktur abzugeben. Gleichzeitig wurden Fannie Mae (FNMA) und Freddie Mac (FHLMC) gezwungen, diese Hypotheken zu unterwerten und sie in CDOs und CDSs umzupacken. Als die Kreditnehmer diese Kredite nicht bedienten, fehlte den Banken das Kapitalreservoir, und sie übertrugen diese Unordnung auf die umgepackten Hypotheken, die sie verkauft hatten, und weiter auf die gesamte Wirtschaft.\n\nDie Wurzeln der Finanzkrise reichen bis ins Jahr 1999 zurück, in die Ära Clinton, als der Präsident einen zweiten Amtszweck anstrebte. Er strebte danach, seine Popularität zu erhöhen, um seine Präsidentschaft zu verlängern. Zu diesem Zweck lockerte die Clinton-Regierung die Kreditbeschränkungen, was das schlimme Szenario der sub-prime-Krise sieben Jahre später einschuf. Steven Holmes von der New York Times berichtete 1999, dass Fannie Mae, der größte Unterstützer von Heimkrediten in den USA, zunehmend von der Clinton-Regierung unter Druck gesetzt wurde, Krediten an Menschen mit niedrigem und mittlerem Einkommen zu vergeben und von Aktionären erpresst wurde, ihre phänomenalen Gewinne aufrechtzuerhalten. Holmes prognostizierte richtig, dass diese Maßnahmen zu einer Krise führen könnten: „Aber die von der Regierung subventionierte Firma könnte sich in einer Wirtschaftskrise in Schwierigkeiten befinden und zur Rettung durch die Regierung führen, ähnlich wie bei der Rettung der Sparkassenindustrie in den 1980er Jahren.“ Wie im Vorwort beschrieben und wie Holmes vorausgesehen hatte, würden unberatene Kreditvergaben zweifellos zu der Wirtschaftskatastrophe führen.\n\nViele Faktoren trugen dazu bei, dass die Wirtschaft in einen Abgrund stürzte, und einer davon war die neue und komplexe Struktur von Hypotheken. Kreditkredite mit variabler Zinsen, Hypotheken-Absonderungsscheine und Kollateralisierung von Schuldverschreibungen (CDOs) wurden in den Jahren vor der Krise stärker eingesetzt und verbanden mehrere Sektoren der Wirtschaft mit dem Immobilienmarkt. Dies führte dazu, dass US-Haushalte und die Finanzmärkte im Allgemeinen sich selbst über Gebühr in den Immobilienmarkt verleiherten, sie extrem anfällig für kleinste Preisschwankungen machten.\n\nTatsächlich brach die Immobilienblase, und die Finanzinstitute, die diese Hypotheken-Absonderungsscheine erworben hatten, wurden übervorteilt. Die fünf größten US-Investmentbanken meldeten 2007 insgesamt 4,1 Billionen Dollar an Hypotheken-Schulden an, was etwa 30 % des USA-Bruttoinlandsprodukts ausmachte. Im Ergebnis wurden Bear Sterns und Merrill Lynch außerordentlich günstig verkauft, Lehman Brothers wurde zerschlagen und Goldman Sachs und Morgan Stanley wurden gezwungen, zu kommerziellen Banken zu werden, die unter intensiver Regulierung standen. Fannie und Freddie hatten 5 Billionen Dollar an Hypotheken-Schulden und wurden im September 2008 unter Regierungskontrolle gestellt.\n\nEnglish translation:\n\n[REWRITE] In 2007, the United States of America plunged into a severe economic crisis.

Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

Dr. Merlin ist bekannt dafür, dass sie sich in der Mitte von \"Zu viel Information\" auf ihre Maus schreit, und nicht einmal in einer lustigen Weise.\n\nDie Exposition ist nicht dein Freund.\n\nDeine sanften Leser wissen bereits die grundlegenden Tipps zum Schreiben, \"Zeige, erzähle nicht\", aber Dr. Merlin stolpert immer noch in langen Abschnitten von Text, wo nichts passiert, oder schlimmer noch, zu viel.  Die Exposition ist der kleine Teufel, der auf deinem Schulter sitzt, der sagt, dass du die Geschichte loswerden solltest, um zu den wichtigen Dingen zu gelangen (nicht zu verwechseln mit dem Teufel, der auf der anderen Schulter sitzt und der Autor ermutigt, ihrem Publikum jede einzelne Detail aus der Kindheit ihrer Charaktere zu erzählen).\n\nDie Exposition bedeutet, dem Publikum zu erzählen, was passiert ist, typischerweise in einfachem Prosa.  Im Film geschieht die Exposition, wenn ein Charakter einen anderen in einem Core-Dump von Informationen erzählt, ala \"Die Rime von dem alten Segler\".  Im Fiktionalen ist es der Autor, der das Erzählen tut.\n\nEin Beispiel ist an der Zeit.  Während du ein Buch liest, erfährst du, dass die Heldin ihren geliebten an einem Ort und zu einer Zeit getroffen hat, dass sie in einer Gala-Einladung geheiratet haben und dass ihr Ehemann in ihrer Gegenwart ermordet wurde.  Man würde nicht erwarten, dass diese gesamte Sequenz zwei Seiten dauert, während die er und sie nur zwei Zeilen Gespräch haben.  Man würde erwarten, dass der Autor manchmal Zeit auf die Charakterisierung des Ehemanns verbringt, zeigt durch seinen Sprachstil und seinem Benehmen, wie sehr er seine Frau liebt, und man würde genauso erwarten, dass die Heldin durch ihre großen und kleinen Handlungen zeigt, wie viel sein Erscheinen in ihrem Leben ihre und ihr Leben bereichert hat (vor allem wenn die Geschichte dir später direkt sagt, dass dies der Fall war).  Eine angemessene Einführung in den Charakter des Ehemanns würde es dir ermöglichen, sich mit seinem Schicksal zu verbinden und würde dir Einblicke in die Heldin selbst geben: was sie in ihm sah, wie tief ihr Band war, Hinweise auf ihre Gedanken und Überzeugungen und Träume, wie durch den Prisma seiner Augen, und so weiter.  Du würdest seinen Tod mit ihr trauern und wirst dadurch noch mehr an die Heldin selbst verbunden.\n\nKurz gesagt, du würdest erwarten, dass da \"Fleisch\" auf dem Knochen des Storylines ist: \"Sie trafen sich, sie heirateten, er starb.\"\n\nAls Schriftsteller musst du dieses Fleisch liefern.  (*sieht auf die Metapher, seufzt, geht weiter*)  Manchmal ist es verlockend, gewisse Dinge zu übergehen.  Vielleicht stellst du eine neue Figur vor und weißt, dass er in der Luftwaffe war, und jetzt ist er der Nachtmanager eines Tankstellenbetriebs, und er war zweimal verheiratet, keine Kinder, geht Wochenende mit Angeln, träumt geheim von dem Tag, in dem er den Tankstellenbetrieb besitzt und hat Eier-Benedikt für Frühstück gegessen.\n\n[REWRITE]\nAh, exposition.

Die erste, die live übertragen wurde, war NBC 4 am Morgen (13. August 2011). Die Schlagzeile handelte von einem Mann in Ashley, Ohio, der seine Ehefrau erstochen hatte. Seine Frau wurde nicht genannt, sein Name war jedoch Shad Hostettler. Sie zeigten sein Porträt und er sah aus wie pure Bosheit. Sie widmeten nur etwa zwei Minuten dieser Geschichte, da sie sich noch entwickelte. Die einzigen Details, die sie gaben, waren, dass er sie mehrmals erstochen hatte und festgenommen wurde. Ich denke, sie haben genug Zeit für diese Geschichte verwendet.\n\nDie zweite Geschichte handelte von einem Morgen-Schießereignis von Travis Buyers, 18. Er war in der Nähe von Sharon Woods angeschossen worden und war schwer verletzt; es gab noch keine Festnahmen oder Verdächtige. Die SWAT-Einheit untersuchte den Vorfall. Diese Geschichte schien kurz zu sein, und ich glaube, das mag daran gelegen haben, dass es sich um einen \"schwarzen\" Mann oder einen schwarzen Stadtteil handelte. Ich habe festgestellt (und schon seit Jahren) dass Minderheiten bei der Berichterstattung über Verbrechen oft leichtfertig behandelt werden. Wenn ein weißes Kind oder Erwachsener entführt, vermisst oder ein Opfer eines Verbrechens wird, wird der Medienkrieg losgebrochen; aber wenn ein Minderheitensperson es glückt, dass es sogar erwähnt wird. \n\nDie nächste Geschichte handelte von einem Schussloch im Med-Flight-Hubschrauber. Details wurden gegeben, wo sie dachten, dass der Vorfall passiert war. Es war bestimmt, dass es sich um eine 0,22 Kaliber-Kugel aus einem Gewehr handelte, die den Hubschrauber getroffen hatte. Crime-Stoppers bieten eine Belohnung von fünf Tausend Dollar für Hinweise, die zu der Festnahme des Schützen führen. \n\nDie nächste Geschichte handelte von den Regen und Gewittern, die für Samstag Nachmittag vorhergesagt wurden. Sie sagten, dass die Temperaturen für das Wochenende im mittleren bis niedrigen Achtzigern bleiben würden. Die Länge der Geschichte war ein bisschen zu kurz, aber sie wollten sie als 'Aufforderung' verwenden, damit man weiterhin zugeschaltet blieb. \n\nSie liefen auch mit einer Geschichte über einen Raub an einem UDF in Clime Road in Columbus. Sie sagten, es sei ein dunkelhäutiger schwarzer Mann, der den Laden ausgeraubt hatte, er trug eine Hoodiesweatshirt. Sie sagten, er war etwa 1,83 Meter groß und wog etwa 68 Kilo. Ich dachte, sie haben ungewöhnlich viel Zeit damit verbracht, dass er schwarz war und wie dunkel.\n\nEine andere Geschichte handelte von Rene Rodriguez, einem verurteilten texanischen Drogenkönig. Er war wegen Erpressung verbreiteter Marihuana in großen Mengen aus Texas nach Ohio verurteilt worden. Eine merkwürdige Sache, die ich bemerkt habe, war, dass sie anstatt von \"25 Jahren Gefängnis\" sagte: \"300 Monate\". Ich bin mir nicht sicher, was der Hintergrund war, ob sie dachten, dass es klang harscher oder was. Sie erwähnten auch, dass er ein Hispano-Mann war, ich glaube nicht, dass das wirklich für die Geschichte relevant war.\n\nTranslated back to English:\n\nI watched two newscasts from Columbus, Ohio.

In dieser Bindung liegen viele Gefühle: Liebe, Stolz, Eifersucht und Grausamkeit, um nur einige zu nennen. Brüder verstehen einander besser als jeder andere mit einer solchen Bindung, und sie können nur sich selbst sehen, wenn sie auf ihren Bruder schauen. Es ist, wenn eine Situation am ärgsten ist, wenn die wahre Natur dieser Bindung durchscheint, sei es gut oder böse. Wenn diese Gefühle klar werden, gehen sie mit großem Aufwand einher. Ein Teil des Verstehens der Gefühle, die aus dieser Brüderbindung entstehen, ist der Umgang mit den Konsequenzen, die sie mit sich bringen. Wenn man einem Bruder in die Augen schauen kann und in dieser Person ihre eigene Reflexion sehen, sieht man sich selbst nicht, wie andere sie sehen, sondern wie man wirklich ist. In ihren Handlungen und den Konsequenzen ihrer Handlungen liegt ihr wahres Charakter. In \"Der rote Ibiss\" erforschen zwei Brüder dieses Thema und all die tobenden Gefühle, die mit ihm einhergehen. Durch eine dichte, lebendig beschriebene Landschaft gehen diese beiden Jungen auf eine sinnlose Reise. Bittere Enttäuschung kommt im dramatischen Moment mit intensivem Stolz in Konflikt, und nur einer der Brüder entkommt mit seinem Leben. Das Thema wird durch direkte Charakterisierung des Protagonisten, Doodle, und ihre Interaktionen miteinander, sowie durch die Perspektive des Erzählers, die die komplexen Gefühle, die der Protagonist und seine Sicht der Welt um ihn herum erleben, mitteilt, die beide starken Einfluss auf seine Handlungen haben.\n\nDie Handlungen des Protagonisten können alle zusammengefasst werden, mit einem Schlüsselgefühl: Stolz. Von dem Moment an, als er und sein kleiner Bruder, Doodle, gemeinsam rausgehen, bis zu ihrer letzten, fatalen Expedition, fühlt er Respektlosigkeit gegenüber Doodle. Er hatte sich gewünscht einen Bruder, den er alles Weltliche beibringen konnte, wie \"...Atem anzuhalten, zu laufen, zu springen oder die Ranken in der Old Woman Swamp zu erklimmen...\" Er hatte sich gewünscht einen Bruder, der \"...zum Rennen nach Horsehead Landing gehen und mit ihm im oberen Ast des großen Pines hinter dem Stall sitzen könnte...\" Offensichtlich sind diese Dinge unmöglich, gegeben Doodles Zustand. Doodle war mit einem extrem schwachen Herz geboren, was es unwahrscheinlich macht, dass er überleben würde. Selbst dann war es nahezu unmöglich, dass er jemals an körperlichen Aktivitäten teilnehmen würde. Was für einen Schlag für den jungen Protagonisten, sein Kopf voll von wilden Fantasien, war es, dass all seine Träume in einem Augenblick zerstört wurden. In Wirklichkeit ist er sogar gezeigt, wütend gegen den kleinen Jungen, da er sich erinnert beginnen zu überlegen, ihn zu ersticken. Was für ein Kind hätte die Präsenz von Geist, um Mord an seinem eigenen Sohn zu überlegen? Aber seine Seele schmilzt, wenn der kleine Junge ihn anlächelt. Ein so einfaches Verhalten gab dem Protagonisten so viel Hoffnung! Das zeigt, dass seine Überzeugung wahrscheinlich nicht sehr stark war. Im Hinterkopf hatte er eine instinktive Liebe für seinen Bruder.\n\nEnglish translation back to English:\n[REWRITE] There is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond.

    "raw_output": "The original text in German is:\n\nDas menschliche Gehirn ist ein komplexes, kreatives Informationsverarbeitungssystem. Mit der fortschreitenden Technik von primitiv zu modern, wurden auch die metaphern verwendet, um das Gehirn zu beschreiben. Zunächst wurde es mit einem Wachstift verglichen, dann mit einem Blatt Papyrus, dann mit einem Buch und zuletzt mit einem Computer. Wenn Sie mehr über das Gehirn lernen, sollten Sie sich daran erinnern, dass die Nutzbarkeit dieser Metaphern begrenzt ist und zu falschen Schlussfolgerungen führen kann.\n\nDie Informationsverarbeitung beginnt mit Eingaben von den Sinnesorganen, die physische Reize wie Berührung, Hitze, Schallwellen oder Photonen von Licht in elektrische chemische Signale umwandeln. Die Sinnesinformation wird mehrfach durch die Algorithmen des Gehirns in bottom-up- und top-down-Verarbeitung umgewandelt. Zum Beispiel, wenn man ein Bild eines schwarzen Kastens auf weißem Hintergrund ansieht, verbindet bottom-up-Verarbeitung sehr einfache Informationen wie Farbe, Orientierung und wo die Grenzen des Objekts sind - wo die Farbe signifikant über einen kurzen Abstand ändert - um zu entscheiden, dass man einen Kasten sieht. Top-down-Verarbeitung verwendet die Entscheidungen, die an bestimmten Schritten des bottom-up-Prozesses getroffen werden, um Ihre Anerkennung des Kastens zu beschleunigen. Top-down-Verarbeitung in diesem Beispiel kann Ihnen helfen, das Objekt als schwarzen Kasten anstatt als schrägen Loch im weißen Hintergrund zu erkennen.\n\nSobald Informationen zu einem bestimmten Grad verarbeitet sind, entscheidet ein Aufmerksamkeitsfilter darüber, wie wichtig das Signal ist und welchen kognitiven Prozessen es zur Verfügung gestellt werden sollte. Zum Beispiel verarbeiten Ihr Gehirn jeden Grashalm, wenn Sie auf Ihre Schuhe hinabblicken, aber ein gesunder Aufmerksamkeitsfilter verhindert, dass Sie sie einzeln wahrnehmen. Im Gegensatz dazu können Sie Ihren Namen erkennen, selbst wenn er in einem lauten Raum gesprochen wird. Es gibt viele Verarbeitungsstufen, und die Ergebnisse der Verarbeitung werden durch Aufmerksamkeit wiederholt moduliert.\n\nDamit das Gehirn Informationen verarbeiten kann, muss es sie zunächst speichern. Es gibt mehrere Arten von Gedächtnis, darunter Sinnes-, Arbeits- und Langzeitgedächtnis. Zuerst wird die Information codiert. Es gibt Encodingspezifisch für jede Art von Sinnesreizen. Zum Beispiel kann ein verbaler Input strukturiert, phonemisch oder semantisch codiert werden, was darauf abzielt, was das geschriebene Wort aussieht, was das Wort klingt oder was die Bedeutung des Wortes ist. Sobald Informationen gespeichert sind, müssen sie aufrechterhalten werden. Einige Tierstudien deuten darauf hin, dass das Arbeitsgedächtnis, das Informationen für etwa 20 Sekunden speichert, durch einen elektrischen Signalstrom gehalten wird, der für einen kurzen Zeitraum durch eine bestimmte Reihe von Nervenzellen läuft. Informationen im Langzeitgedächtnis werden vermutet, werden durch die Struktur bestimmter Arten von Proteinen aufrechterhalten.\n\nEs gibt zahlreiche Modelle, wie das Wissen im Gehirn organisiert ist, einige basieren auf der Art, wie Menschen Erinnerungen abrufen, andere auf Computerwissenschaft und andere auf Neurophysiologie. Das semantische Netzwerkmodell besagt, dass es Knoten gibt, die Konzepte darstellen, und dass die Knoten aufgrund ihrer Verwandtschaft vernetzt sind. Zum Beispiel könnte in einem semantischen Netzwerk \"Stuhl\" mit \"Tisch\" vernetzt sein, was wiederum mit \"Holz\" vernetzt sein könnte, und so weiter.\n\n[REWRITE]\nThe human brain is a complex, creative information-processing system.

Seine Menschen schätzen die Gemeinschaft über den Einzelnen, und werden von der Geburt an darauf konditioniert, unmittelbaren Glückseligkeit über alles andere zu verfolgen. Die Bürger werden als Marionetten in einem größeren Spiel enthüllt, die in einem bestimmten Weltanschauungskonzept gefangen sind, das durch den Weltkontroller diktiert wird. Wenn man das Werk unter dem Mikroskop der marxistischen Theologie untersucht, bemerkt man die untergründigen Verdächtigungen des Autors bezüglich der Entwicklung der genannten Systeme. Häufiges Terminologie in Marxismus wie Homogenität und Reifikation unterstreichen die Idee, dass Huxleys Roman eine Kritik an den Mängeln der sich entwickelnden Wirtschaft seiner Zeit ist.\n\nDer Kapitalismus wird durch die Verwendung der marxistischen These der falschen Bewusstseinsform gesatirisiert. Im Wesentlichen wird die gewöhnliche Bürgerschaft daran gehindert, wahren Beziehungen zu anderen Klassen in wirtschaftlichen Begriffen zu erkennen, da sie hauptsächlich an ihrem eigenen Gewinn interessiert sind. Es wird gesagt, dass es das Ergebnis ideologischer Kontrolle der Proletarier und der gewöhnlichen Arbeiter ist, was offensichtlich durch die Konditionierung der Menschen in Brave New World ist. Die gewöhnlichen Klassen, Delta, Gamma usw., haben keine wahre Willensfreiheit; durch Hypnopaedie wird die Motivation, zu konsumieren, zu ausgeben, zu sich selbst zu geben, über alles andere gestärkt. Dies wird manipuliert, wie bereits erwähnt, durch den Weltkontroller. Hegemonie, im Wesentlichen die Idee, dass Gruppen sozialer Klassen von einem separaten Gruppen von Individuen in der Gesamtheit beherrscht werden, wird offensichtlich in diesem Fall verwendet. Die unteren Klassen sind völlig unwissend über die Manipulation, fast wörtlich „sich in eine Ideologie einzulassen, die diese Struktur unterstützt“ (d.h. Kapitalismus und Konsumismus).  Die Oberen Klassen sind mit der Fähigkeit geboren, es zu erkennen, aber tun nichts; wenige Alphas oder Betas jenseits von Charakteren wie Bernard tun mehr als auch nur ihre Position anzunehmen. Tatsächlich sind die Interaktionen der sozialen Klassen, wie in größerem Umfang besprochen werden, bedeutende Hinweise auf die wahrgenommene Ausbeutung des Kapitalismus.\nDie Beziehungen zwischen disparaten Individuen existieren in Brave New World nicht. Der Roman scheint die Charaktere zu verweigern, sie fehlen sogar in bedeutenden Charakteren an Tiefe. Vielleicht will Huxley andeuten, dass die Entwicklung der Technologie und des Kapitalismus zusammen Menschen von ihrer Freiheit und ihrem Ausdruck berauben. Liebe existiert nicht, noch gibt es die Extreme eines jeden Emotionen; stattdessen werden Interaktionen auf der Oberfläche gehalten, gezeigt durch die Bemerkungen der Männer über die Frauen hauptsächlich über ihre körperliche Erscheinung (d.h. Pneumatische Qualität), und die unverblümmte Kommentare der Frauen über ihre Begegnungen, sozusagen.  Zudem weisen die absolute Hingabe jeder sozialen Klasse an ihren Status in der Hierarchie auf den sozioökonomischen Effekt des Kapitalismus hin.  Ihre absolute Unterworfenheit an ihren Teil in der Gemeinschaft ist ein Hinweis auf marxistische Gedanken über die Proletarier, die sich falsch versichert fühlen, über alles andere zu sein, solange sie weiterhin konsumieren, gehorchen, in Einklang mit ihren Peers bleiben.\n\nEnglish translation:\n\n[REWRITE] Aldous Huxley criticizes in the novel \"Brave New World\" the looming threat of both technology and the capitalist structure that it reinforces through its creation.

Für viele, einschließlich mich selbst, kann es ein Problem sein, sich auf dem Campus zurechtzufinden. In meinem Freshman-Jahr wurde ich in einem Zimmer im East Halls-Dormitory untergebracht; so gut wie am entferntesten Osthörner des Campus, wenn man das Stadion und den Bryce Jordan Center nicht mitzählt. Vom Stuart Hall, meiner Heimat, zu den Klassen in solch entfernten Orten wie dem Willard-Gebäude, in der Nähe des Campus-Zentrums, kann die Zeit bis zu 25 Minuten dauern, besonders wenn das Wetter schlecht ist, wie oft das in State College der Fall ist. Bei einem Gespräch mit einem alten Alum, dem ich nicht viel älter bin als ich selbst, erfuhr ich, dass nicht allzu lange her die East Halls-Dorms von dem Rest des Campuses durch riesige Stücke unbebaute Land getrennt waren. Heute hat dieser leergebliebene Raum mit Sportfeldern, riesigen neuen Gebäuden, einschließlich des neuen Creamery und des neuen Gesundheitsdienstes-Gebäudes, und umgeben mit Wohnungen gefüllt worden. Da unser Campus weiterhin wächst, wird es immer schwieriger, von einem Ort zum anderen zu gelangen. Was ist die beste Lösung für das Problem der Mobilität? Auf einem College-Campus ist das Fahrrad die beste Lösung. Aber das Fahrrad allein kann keine Probleme lösen. Die Studenten müssen sie fahren, und der Campus muss den Bedürfnissen der Fahrradfahrer angepasst werden.\n\nIch sprach vor Kurzem mit einem Freund, der kürzlich nach einer mehrjährigen Pause aufs Fahrrad zurückkehrte. Er sagte, er habe sich gefragt, warum er je aufgehört sei. „Räder sind großartig“, meinte er, „für einige Jahre war es nicht cool, ein Fahrrad zu fahren, aber es ist die einzige Möglichkeit, sich fortzubewegen.“ Neben der positiven Wirkung auf den Körper ist Fahrradfahren die effizienteste Art, sich fortzubewegen. Ein Teller Hafergrütze und ein bisschen körperliche Anstrengung können einem 30 Meilen oder mehr reichen. Wie viele Studenten habe ich auch, bin ich jetzt außerhalb der Universität wohnhaft; genauso weit vom Campus-Zentrum entfernt wie einige Dorms. Die smarteste Entscheidung, die ich in diesem Jahr getroffen habe, war es, ein Fahrrad zu kaufen. Jeden Tag habe ich Unterricht im Thomas-Gebäude, leicht 25 Minuten von meinem Zuhause entfernt. Wenn ich schnell genug pedaliere, kann sich Fahrradfahren die Zeit auf 5 Minuten verkürzen. Der einzige Haken ist, dass die Pollock Road die direkteste Route zur Thomas-Halle von meinem Haus ist, und es ist nicht immer einfach, diese Straße zu befahren, mit oder ohne Fahrrad. Es gibt Dinge zu sagen für das Gehen, aber persönlich bin ich zu beschäftigt, um zu laufen. Wenn ich kein Fahrrad hätte, wäre das Gehen meine einzige zuverlässige Option, um zur Klasse zu gelangen. Ein tägliches Gehen zur Thomas-Halle würde meine Zeit um 30-40 Minuten pro Tag hinzufügen. Das sind über zwei und eine halbe Stunden pro Woche. Dazu kommen noch die zusätzliche Zeit, die ich für das Gehen zu anderen Kursen, Terminen und dergleichen aufwenden müsste. Das ist mehr Zeit, als ich mir erlauben kann.\n\nEnglish translation back to English:\n\n[REWRITE]I have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters.

There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare.",
