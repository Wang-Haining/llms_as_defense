Werte, die ich in das Sozialwesen einbringen kann, sind: Dienst, Respekt, ethische Natur, Bekenntnis, anderen helfen zu können und mich selbst professionell zu verbessern, um in meinem Fachgebiet kompetent zu bleiben. Diese Grundsätze sind nicht nur für Sozialarbeiter wichtig; sie sind mir persönlich wichtig.\n\nIch habe immer andere helfen wollen, aber ich war unsicher, welcher Karriepfad ich beschreiten sollte. Während meiner Jahre in der Highschool und dem College sah ich viele Menschen vor ihren Problemen fliehen, in der Verneinung, und einige verwendeten weniger als ideale Anpassungsmechanismen. Aufgrund von Situationen, die ich beobachtet habe, entschied ich mich, einen Bachelor-Abschluss in Psychologie zu erlangen. Noch immer unsicher über einen Karriepfad, beschloss ich, nach meinem Abschluss von Piedmont College 2009 einen Ausflug zu machen. Eines Tages, während des Sommers, besuchte ich einen Freund, der mich einem sechzehnjährigen Jungen vorstellte, der nervös auf seinem Sofa saß. Sie erklärte mir, warum er kam: um vor seinen misshandelnden Eltern zu fliehen. Der nächste Tag erfuhr ich, dass er die Polizei an sein Elternhaus gerufen hatte. Um herauszufinden, ob ich in irgendeiner Weise helfen konnte, fuhr ich zu seinem Elternhaus. Als ich dort war, erklärte ich meinen Bedenken privatsphärisch an die Polizei und erzählte ihnen, dass ich gerade einen Abschluss in Psychologie an der Piedmont College erhalten hatte. Die Polizei bat mich, mit den Eltern zu sprechen, da es für den Jugendlichen nichts gab, was die Gesetzgebung für ihn hätte tun können. Als ich mit den Eltern über die Situation sprach, schienen sie nervös und verwendeten Ausreden, um ihre Söhne \"manipulative\" Verhalten zu erklären, das \"einfache\" Konflikte zwischen Familienmitgliedern mittels \"äußerer\" Quellen lösen zu lassen. Nach dieser bestimmten Erfahrung begann ich, ernsthaft darüber nachzudenken, eine Karriere in der Sozialarbeit zu machen, um Kindern mit \"einfachen\" Konflikten zwischen Familienmitgliedern zu helfen.\n\nEin weiterer Wert, der für das Sozialwesen wichtig ist, ist soziale Gerechtigkeit. Als Gesellschaft behaupten wir, dass der Einzelne wichtig ist und wir jene trauern, die wir verloren haben. Der Konzept der \"Einzigartigkeit\" in der Gesellschaft, das wir verteidigen, ist mehr ein Verfechter von überholten Traditionen als die tatsächliche Einzigartigkeit. Wenn also die Gesellschaft die verlorenen Einzelnen trauert, warum streben wir danach, ähnlich wie \"alle anderen\" zu sein? Ich bin ein Einzelner und geniesse es nicht, Einschränkungen auf mich zu legen, um ähnlich wie andere zu sein. Während meiner Jahre in der Highschool und dem College protestierte ich gegen soziale Ungerechtigkeiten, wann immer ich es konnte: Ich färbte meine Haare in unnatürliche Farben, trug Kleidung, die meinem Charakter entsprach, pflanzte meine Ohrläppchen über die traditionelle Stelle, erklärte meine Beteiligung an GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), kämpfte gegen Rassismus und Diskriminierung, wenn ich sie beobachtete, usw. Ich glaube an soziale Gerechtigkeit und werde gegen soziale Ungerechtigkeiten weiter protestieren.\n\nEnglish translation back to the original text:\n\n[REWRITE] When pursuing a career in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families.

The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified.

The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication.

Das biologische Modell konzentriert sich auf genetische Informationen, die vererbt werden, sowie medizinische Aspekte der Gesundheit. Die sozio-kulturellen Modelle untersuchen Umweltbeziehungen und ihre Anwendungen in Bezug auf Rasse, Ethnie, Demografie, sozioökonomischer Status und so weiter. Die folgende Rezension der Schlafstörung untersucht diese Modelle und erklärt jedes Stück Forschung, das sich auf diese bezieht und sie besser erklären soll. Die Erklärungen der Forschung und ihre Ergebnisse werden dann kritisiert, um ihre spezifischen Stärken und Schwächen zu erwähnen.\n\nEine Schlafstörung kann als eine primäre Schlafstörung, eine Schlafstörung, die mit einer anderen psychischen Störung verbunden ist, oder eine Schlafstörung, die mit anderen Problemen verbunden ist, charakterisiert werden. Primäre Schlafstörungen sind Dyssonmien oder Parasomnien, während Schlafstörungen, die mit einer anderen psychischen Störung verbunden sind, mit einem Axis I- oder Axis II-Disorder verbunden sind. Andere Kategorien von Schlafstörungen können auf medizinische Komplikationen oder die Einnahme einer Substanz zurückzuführen sein. Die Dyssomnien sind: Primäre Insomnie, Primäre Hypersomnie, Narcolepsie, Schlafatmungsstörung, Circadian-Rhythmus-Schlafstörung und Dyssomnie nicht anders spezifiziert (NOS). Während Primäre Insomnie eine Komplikation bei ausreichender oder aufrechterhaltener Schlaf ist, ist Primäre Hypersomnie eine Schwierigkeit, wach zu bleiben, sowohl für mindestens einen Monat Zeitraum. Narcolepsie beinhaltet Kataplexie und/ oder automatische REM. Während Dyssonmien sich auf die Initiierung und Behauptung des Schlafs beziehen, sind die Parasomnien Schlafstörungen, die mit Verhaltensanomalien und/ oder physiologischen Vorkommnissen verbunden sind. Parasomnien sind Albtraumstörung, Schlafterrorstörung, Schlafwanderungsstörung und Parasomnien nicht anders spezifiziert. Die Schlafstörungen, die mit einer anderen psychischen Störung verbunden sind, betreffen Schlafschwierigkeiten aufgrund von Axis I (Klinische Störungen) oder Axis II (Personlichkeitsstörungen oder geistige Behinderung). Die folgende Rezension konzentriert sich auf Insomnie und soweit auf primäre Schlafstörungen allgemein in Bezug auf die biologischen und sozio-kulturellen Modelle.\n\nDas biologische Modell von Schlafstörungen konzentriert sich auf Gene, vererbbare Faktoren und physiologisch erworbenen Aspekte von Schlafstörungen. Neuronen im Hypothalamus, die Orexin enthalten, sind für die Regulierung des Schlafs und der Wachheit verantwortlich. Diese Studie experimentierte mit Mäusen und fand heraus, dass es sich um phänotypische GABA-B-Rezeptoren auf den Orexin-Neuronen handelt, die spezifisch für den Schlaf/Wachheitszustand verantwortlich sind. Die Aktivierung des GABA-A-Rezeptors induziert Antworten, die den Schlaf fördern. Wenn sie von der Abgabe inhibiert wird, kann dies eine Verringerung der Angst und den Eintritt des Schlafs bewirken. Der GABA-B-Agonist (Baclofen) erhöhte die Schlafzeit (Matsuki et al., 2009). Solche Ergebnisse implizieren, dass die tierischen Modelle von Mäusen auf Studien in Menschen generalisiert werden können. Dies zeigt, dass es eine genetische und umweltbedingte Grundlage für den körperlichen GABA-B-Rezeptor in Menschen gibt. Ein Problem oder eine Abwesenheit dieses Rezeptors könnte die Fähigkeit beeinträchtigen, einen ausreichenden Schlaf ohne Medikamente zu haben. Die sozio-kulturelle Implikation dieser Studie ist, dass, wenn die Phänotypie vererbt wurde, dies den Schlaf regulieren könnte, und eine Veränderung des Rezeptors würde natürlicherweise den Schlaf für einen Einzelnen stören. Dies würde negative Auswirkungen auf Aspekte des Lebens wie Schule, Karriere und tägliche Ereignisse haben, die monotonen Aufgaben und Konzentration erfordern.\n\n[REWRITE]\nThe following paper deals with biological and sociocultural models in relation to the sleep disorder.

Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",

Zunächst wird eine kurze Definition der Störung bereitgestellt. Als nächstes wird die Diagnose erklärt, wobei häufige Merkmale oder „Rote Fahnen“ genannt werden. Schließlich schließt das Papier mit dem, was ein Lehrer in einer inklusiven Klassenaufteilung tun kann, um einem Schüler mit CAPD zu helfen.\n\nZentraler auditorischer Verarbeitungsstörung (CAPD) oder auditorische Verarbeitungsstörung (APD) „bezieht sich auf die Effizienz und Wirksamkeit, mit denen das zentrale Nervensystem (CNS) auditorische Informationen nutzt. Eingeschränkt definiert (C)AP bezieht sich auf die wahrnehmungsbezogene Verarbeitung auditorischer Informationen im CNS und die neurobiologische Aktivität, die diese Verarbeitung und die Elektrophysiologie auditorischer Potenziale erzeugt“ (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), was bedeutet, dass es sich um eine Störung handelt, bei der das zentrale Nervensystem (sprich das Gehirn) nicht richtig funktioniert, wenn es um das Verarbeiten gehörteter Dinge geht. Menschen mit CAPD können hören wie normal, sind also nicht als \"hörbehindert\" anzusehen; vielmehr funktioniert die im Gehirn liegende Region, die Übersetzung von, was wir hören, einschließlich das Trennen von Wörtern oder die Unterscheidung von Konversation und Hintergrundlärm, nicht wie üblich. \n\nDie frühesten Erwähnungen dieser Störung, die sich zu CAPD entwickelte, stammen aus der Mitte der 1950er Jahre, als \"Auditive Imperzeption\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) genannt, als Forscher Kinder mit kommunikativen Störungen auswerteten. Die italienische Forschungsgruppe von Bocca, Calearo und Cassinari begann 1954 mit der Entwicklung von Tests für diese Kinder; 1961 führte Kimura ein dichotisches Testen ein und formulierte ein Modell zur Erklärung der Physiologie des CANS, die dichotische Wahrnehmung unterliegt (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Eine nationale Konferenz wurde 1977 abgehalten, die die Forschung an Kindern mit CAPD anregte. \n\nCAPD manifestiert sich auf mehrere Weise: Der betroffene Person mag nicht in der Lage sein, Laut im Raum zu lokalisieren oder Schall zu hören; mag Schwierigkeiten haben, zwischen zwei oder mehr \"akustischen Ereignissen\" (Schallereignissen) zu unterscheiden; mag nicht in der Lage sein, Schallmuster zu erkennen; mag nicht in der Lage sein, Veränderungen in der Sprache (wie das Erkennen von Sarkasmus aufgrund von Veränderung der Stimme) zu unterscheiden; kann ein Laut durch einen nachfolgenden Laut blockiert sein; mag nicht die Fähigkeit haben, Schallklänge zu synthetisieren (d. h., sie in einem sinnvollen Sinn zu interpretieren, den man dann aufgreifen kann); und mag nicht in der Lage sein, die Reihenfolge der Auditorikinformationen zu bestimmen, die präsentiert werden (Ferre). \n\nUm CAPD zu diagnostizieren, muss der Patient \"systematische Beobachtung von Hörverhalten und/oder Leistungen auf Tests der auditorischen Funktion\" durchlaufen, die möglicherweise von \"Audiologen, SLPs, Psychologen und anderen\" durchgeführt werden, die verschiedene Maßnahmen verwenden, um auditorische Fähigkeiten zu bewerten (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Dies kann Fragebögen und Umfragen, die Beobachtung auditorischer Verhaltensweisen, einschließlich der Reaktion des Patienten auf bestimmte Reize, umfassen. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt gibt es kein einheitliches Werkzeug oder Test, das zu einem hohen Grad an diagnostischer Erfolg verwendet wird, und es gibt keine bekannte Ursache für die Störung. Viele Tests, die verwendet werden, stellen dem Patienten eine Vielzahl simultaner auditorischer Reize vor und fragen sie dann, bestimmte Elemente zu unterscheiden, wie ein Reihe von Wörtern oder Zahlen. Fortgeschrittene Tests beinhalten die Aufzeichnung akustischer Signale im Ohr und das Messen der Antworten auf die Signale.\n\nNow, translating back to English:\n\n[REWRITE] This paper targets three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD).

Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness with which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process the things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise, does not function as it typically should.\n\nThe first mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditive imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\nIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals.",

Ein großer Problem mit dem Ende einer Täuschung ist jedoch, dass man sich dabei isoliert fühlen kann. Daher muss man am Ende zwischen der eigenen Selbstbehauptung und der Erhaltung der Beziehungen zu jenen um sich herum entscheiden. Obwohl einige neutral auf die Tatsache reagieren, dass sie getäuscht wurden, werden andere die Täuschung nicht so leicht nehmen und werden wahrscheinlich von der ganzen Komödie beleidigt sein.\n\nDas Thema der Täuschung in der Geschlechterumkehr ist besonders problematisch, weil es viele Nebenfragen aufwirft, möglicherweise ist die wichtigste Frage dabei, warum? Warum fühlt sich der Betroffene gezwungen, seine eigene Identität aufzugeben und eine Verkleidung als das Gegenteil des eigenen Geschlechts anzunehmen? In Violas Fall ist es offensichtlich eine Form der Selbstschutz. \"Ich werde dich zu einem Kapitän in dieser Stadt bringen, wo meine Mädchenkleider liegen, durch deren sanfte Hilfe wurde ich geschützt, um diesem edlen Grafen zu dienen...\" (5.1.247-249)\n\nNachdem sie in einem fremden Land angekommen ist, fühlt sich Viola gezwungen, als Mann zu verkleiden, um sich vor möglichen Angreifern zu schützen. Violas Plan funktioniert, aber es isoliert sie auch von den Frauen um sie herum und schneidet sie von einem wichtigen Unterstützungssystem ab. Um es noch schlimmer zu machen, ist sie anscheinend so überzeugend als Mann zu erscheinen, dass Olivia sie mit Sebastian verwechselt und sich in sie verliebt. \"Woher, mein Herr? Cesario, Gatte, bleib!\" (5.1.138) Darüber hinaus muss sie auch mit unterdrückten romantischen Gefühlen zwischen ihr und Orsino kämpfen: \"Junge, du hast mir tausendmal gesagt, dass du keine Frau wie mich lieben solltest.\" (5.1.260-261)\n\nObwohl dies möglicherweise eine progressive Einstellung ist, kann das Schauspiel \"Der Zwölfte Nachmittag\" in der modernen Leseransicht als Beispiele dafür angesehen werden, wie die Täuschung die Enthüllung unterdrückter Gefühle erleichtern kann, insbesondere im Fall von Olivia und Orsino. Bestimmte Passagen scheinen anzudeuten, dass die genannten Charaktere möglicherweise unausgesprochene, unbewusste Wünsche haben, die die Erscheinung von Viola/Cesario zwingen, sich damit auseinanderzusetzen. Zum Beispiel ist Olivia vielleicht an Cesario interessiert, weil Cesario als Mann erscheint, oder verheimlicht Olivia tatsächlich heimliche Gefühle für Frauen? Man würde argumentieren, dass dies wahrscheinlich nicht der Fall ist, weil Shakespeare's Charakter Olivia sich wahrscheinlich auf die Menschen aus seiner Zeit bezieht, die andere nur aufgrund ihrer Aussehen beurteilen. Dies wird durch die Einfachheit gezeigt, mit der Olivia ihre romantischen Zuneigungen von Cesario zu Sebastian wechselt und Cesario/Viola als Familie und nicht als Liebesinteresse betrachtet: \"Eine Schwester, du bist sie.\" (5.1.315)\n\n[REWRITE] The play \"Twelfth Night\" seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful for perpetrating long periods of deception, in the end one must reject the newly formed guise, or else risk losing oneself forever in the process.

Natürlich kann eine ganze Kolonialmacht so in einem einfachen Begriff nicht erklärt werden. Die deutsche Kolonialmacht war in ihren Politiken und Herrschaftsstilen genauso vielfältig wie in der Geographie. Die Bildungsbemühungen in den Kolonien waren ähnlich vielfältig. Als die Briten 1919 Deutsch-Ostafrika (Tanganyika) übernahmen, fanden sie eine große Bevölkerung von gebildeten und literierten Afrikanern. Die deutschen Bildungsbemühungen in Kamerun und anderen Kolonien wurden auch von zeitgenössischen Autoren gelobt.\nDie Situation in Südwestafrika (heute Namibia) war eindeutig im Gegensatz dazu. Anders als in Ostafrika, wo die Regierung staatliche Schulen errichtete und eine führende Rolle bei der Bildung der Ureinwohner spielte, überließ die Regierung in Südwestafrika die Aufgabe der Bildung der Ureinwohner fast vollständig den missionarischen Gesellschaften, die nur beschränkten Regierungsunterstützung erhielten. Die Regierung investierte jedoch bedeutende Ressourcen in die Bildung von Europäern in der Kolonie, indem sie ein System staatlicher Schulen einrichtete und missionarische Schulen unterstützte und regulierte. Diese Bildungspolitiken hatten langfristige Auswirkungen auf Südwestafrika, auch nach dem Ende der deutschen Herrschaft. Während andere deutsche Kolonien eine erhebliche Anzahl von literierten und gebildeten Afrikanern aufwiesen, blieb in Südwestafrika “die überwältigende Mehrheit der Bevölkerung unberührt, unbildet und analphabetisch”. Verschiedene soziale, politische und wirtschaftliche Faktoren führten zu den unterschiedlichen Erfahrungen in Südwestafrika. Dieser Artikel zielt darauf ab, diese Faktoren zu identifizieren und besonders den neuesten Forschungen zu den Einstellungen der Siedler und der Kolonialbehörden gegenüber den einheimischen Afrikanern besondere Aufmerksamkeit zu schenken.\nEs gibt eine Fülle von Literatur zu Bildung in der deutschen Kolonialmacht speziell. Die meisten dieser Quellen sind auf Deutsch und wurden in den frühen zwanzigsten Jahrhundert, während oder kurz nach der Zeit der deutschen Kolonialherrschaft, verfasst. Der Zweck früher Arbeiten bestand hauptsächlich darin, die Merkmale der Bildungssysteme in diesen Kolonien zu beschreiben. Spätere Schriften in Englisch erweiterten den Diskurs durch vergleichende Studien der Bildung in den verschiedenen deutschen Kolonien und detailliertere Analysen spezifischer Aspekte der Bildung. Diese Studien zeigten erhebliche Unterschiede in den Bildungssystemen der verschiedenen Kolonien. Die wichtigste Arbeit, die den Gegenstand dieses Artikels explizit anspricht, ist Cohens Studie zu Bildung in Südwestafrika und Ostafrika. Cohen vergleicht die Bildungssysteme der beiden Kolonien und diskutiert die Faktoren, die die Unterschiede zwischen ihnen erklären. Nach Cohen erläutert die große Siedlerbevölkerung Südwestafrikas viele der kennzeichnenden Aspekte des Bildungssystems der Kolonie.\nIm Vergleich zu Deutschlands anderen Kolonialbesitzungen hatte Südwestafrika ein moderates subtropisches Klima, obwohl ein Großteil des Territoriums von arider Wüste bedeckt ist. Die europäische Bevölkerung Südwestafrikas spiegelte die relativ günstigen Bedingungen wider.

Eine zusätzliche Komplikation ist, dass die meisten, wenn nicht alle Genres – wie etwa Rap, Rock, Country, Jazz, Folk – mehrere Unter- und Unter-Genres innerhalb ihres Bereichs hervorgebracht haben. Arguably ist das Subgenre des Heavy Metal-Rocks zu einem der vielfältigsten und expressivsten Genres der gesamten Popmusik in den letzten 40 Jahren geworden. Es ist expressiv, da es eine breite Palette von Emotionen zeigt, obwohl sie tendenziell zur dunkleren Seite des Spektrums neigen. Es ist vielfältig, da die Menschen bald, nachdem die Anfänge des Genres begannen, erkannten, dass es eine wahre Flexibilität besaß und begannen, sie zu nutzen, um ihre eigenen Sub-Genres zu erstellen, was dann von Sub-Sub-Genres gefolgt wurde, und der Kreis fortschreitet bis heute.\n\nHeute haben wir einen Punkt im Heavy-Metal-Bewegung erreicht, an dem es so viele Nischen von Gruppen gibt, dass es schwierig ist, genau zu bestimmen, was Heavy Metal ist. Es hat sich so viele Themen aus anderen Genres integriert, aber wie alles andere, ist es von irgendwo entstanden. Um die Metal-Musik, die überall heute existiert, richtig zu verstehen, muss man erst einmal verstehen, was die Metal-Bewegung ist, und warum es eine Bewegung und nicht nur ein Genre ist.\n\nMetall ist, in vielen Hinsichten, eine Bewegung, die durch Dunkelheit definiert ist. Metall kann als \"Musik des mehr\" angesehen werden – mehr Bass, mehr Lautstärke, mehr Gewalt, mehr Theatralik. Weniger Primitivismus, mehr Chops; Menschen in Metal-Bands wissen wirklich, wie man ein Instrument spielt, und es kommt in der Musik zum Ausdruck. Metall ist auch – obwohl es vielleicht nicht überraschend ist – eine Bewegung, die stark von Drogen induziert ist. In den späten 70ern gab es einen psychedelischen Drogen-Boom, der dazu führte, dass Menschen verrückter wurden, was zu verrückten, anderen-weltlichen Aufnahmen führte, wobei die Drogen als Ausrede für ihre Schöpfung dienten. Es besitzt viele dunkle, viszerale Qualitäten, die sich in der Musikszene sehr neu anfühlten, weil ein großer Teil der populären Musik Qualitäten besaß, die nicht wahrhaftig zur dunkleren Seite des emotionalen Spektrums standen. Späteren Generationen von Metal haben einige ihrer Einflüsse aus den dunklen, viszeralen Qualitäten genommen, die so präsent waren in der Romantischen Epoche. Diese Liedtexte von Helter Skelter zeigen die dunkle Seite der Beatles. Sie zeigen eine auf und ab, die angeblich von Drogen herrührt. Dieses Lied wird von einigen als eines der ersten Heavy-Metal-Lieder angesehen. Es war eine Antwort auf ein Lied von den Rolling Stones, das auch auf der dunkleren Seite lag. Die Beatles wollten beweisen, dass sie genauso schwer sein konnten wie die Stones, also haben sie dieses Lied auf das White Album gesetzt.\n\nBack to English translation:\n\n[REWRITE] In the past 100 years, the classification of pop music has grown significantly and includes so many genres that it is challenging to list them all.

It possesses many dark, visceral qualities, which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren't true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark, visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as those from Helter Skelter demonstrate the darker side of the Beatles. They display an up-and-down quality that is supposedly rooted in drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first heavy metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones, so they put that song on the White Album. [/REWRITE]",
    "transformed": "In the past 100 years, the classification of pop music has grown significantly and includes so many genres that it is challenging to list them all. An additional complication is that most, if not all, genres – such as rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk – have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain. Arguably, the subgenre of heavy metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all pop music in the past 40 years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions, although they tend to lean towards the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that people soon realized that it had true flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own subgenres, which was then followed by sub-subgenres, and the chain continues to this day.\n\nToday, we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is difficult to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate many themes from other genres, but like everything else, it originated from somewhere. To properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today, one must first understand what the metal movement is, and why it is a movement rather than just a genre.\n\nMetal is, in many ways, a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a \"music of more\" – more bass, more volume, more violence, more theatricality. Less primitivism, more chops; people in metal bands really know how to play their instruments, and it comes through in the music. Metal is also – although it may not come as a surprise – a movement that is heavily drug-induced.

The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist.

    "raw_output": "German translation of the text:\n\nEinige Jahrzehnte bevor die Surrealisten mit ihren traumhaften Werken begannen, das Erfolg zu erringen, war der Künstler Henri Rousseau sorgfältig an seinen eigenen Träumen arbeitete, auf die kreative Ebene wie in der Realität. Die Träume, ein Gemälde aus dem Jahr 1910 des berühmten Postimpressionisten, stellt nicht nur eine Frau dar, die in Ehrfurcht vor den Wundern des Landes steht, das sie in einem Traum bereist, sondern auch Rousseaus eigene persönlichen Träume und Ziele als Künstler dar. Seit Beginn seines Werkes träumte er von Anerkennung, Akzeptanz und Lob durch andere Künstler und Kunstliebhaber, und fand heraus, dass er mit einem schwierigen inneren Dilemma konfrontiert war, dieses Streben zu erreichen. Die Träume ist das Werk, das am besten seine Karriere lang anhaltende innere Auseinandersetzung widerspiegelt: entweder sich an zertifizierte Stile von Malerei anzupassen, um von der kritischen Kunstwelt, die er so sehr bewunderte, angenommen zu werden, oder sich kreativ unabhängig und einzigartig zu sein und seinen eigenen Weg zu gehen.\n\nBevor man die Träume aus dieser Perspektive analysieren kann, muss man sich zunächst einigermaßen mit der biographischen Geschichte Rousseaus vertraut machen. Henri Rousseau wurde am 21. Mai 1844 in der Stadt Laval im nordwestlichen Frankreich geboren. Sein Vater war ein Blechschmied und Händler mit \"bürgerlicher Prosperität\" (Shattuck 47). Im Wachstum erhielt er keine formale Ausbildung in den Künsten; stattdessen wurde er bis zum Alter von vierzig Jahren für Frankreich als Gabelou, oder Angestellter der kommunalen Zollabteilung, eingesetzt, obwohl er den Fehlschlagsschlag der Bezeichnung Douanier, Zollinspektor (Shattuck 46), erhielt. Der Tod seiner ersten Frau Clémence, der auch acht Säuglinge gefolgt waren, ließ Rousseau mit nur einem Kind, einer Tochter namens Julia, und immensen Kummer zurück (Shattuck 49). Er hoffte daher auf einen neuen Lebensweg und verfolgte das Malen, um ihn Trost und neue Anfänge zu bieten. Anders als die zeitgenössischen Kollegen von Rousseau, die die Bauern in der Malerei sentimentalisiert und romantisiert haben, ist er in Wirklichkeit ein Volksmaler und hat die Hoffnungen und Träume des durchschnittlichen Mitglieds seiner Klasse.\n\nRousseaus Obsession, von der Kunstwelt akzeptiert zu werden, ist in gewissem Maße verständlich, wenn man ihn in den Kontext bringt: wie besprochen, war er nicht nur ungebildet in den formalen Malweisen und begann seine Karriere in einem viel älteren Alter, sondern produzierte auch Arbeiten in der gleichen Zeit wie viele andere talentierte und bekanntere moderne Künstler. Obwohl er bereits viele Jahre gearbeitet hatte, erhielt Rousseau erst um die gleiche Zeit, als Matisse begann, sich als Künstler einen Ruf zu schaffen, eine richtige Anerkennung für seine Kunst. In dem Buch Modern French Painters behauptet der Autor Jan Gordon, dass die beiden, während sie sich in der Kunstwelt als Konkurrenten sahen, nicht nur in Stil und Gegenstand, sondern auch in ihren Gründen für die Malerei unterschiedlich waren: „Matisse war ein Maler, der vor der Idee Angst hatte, zu malen, in einer oberflächlichen Weise, während Rousseaus Wunsch war, ein Bild zu malen, so konventionell, dass er in die Société des Artistes Français aufgenommen würde“ (92).\n\nEnglish translation back to English:\n\n[REWRITE]Several decades before the Surrealist artists began to achieve success with their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, on a creative plane as in reality.

    "raw_output": "First, I will translate the text to German:\n\nViele große Denker haben eine intime Verbindung zwischen Ethik und Ästhetik, zwischen Wahrheit und Schönheit, postuliert. Ich glaube, dass es an einem grundlegenden Niveau eine Begründung dafür gibt. Wie John Keats in \"Ode an eine griechische Urne\" sagt: \"Schönheit ist Wahrheit, Wahrheit Schönheit - das ist alles, was ihr auf Erden wisst, und alles, was ihr wissen müsst.\" Ein Großteil dessen, was wir im Leben wissen, wird über Bildung oder Erfahrung gelernt. Wir scheinen jedoch die Ethik und Ästhetik, wie Keats andeutet, ohne dass wir durch diese erwarteten Wege gelehrt werden, zu schätzen. Beide, Ethik und Ästhetik, sind ein Versuch, vielmehr zu beschreiben als zu vorschreiben. Unser Studium der Moral und Schönheit ist im Wesentlichen ein Versuch, zu erklären, warum ein Kunstwerk oder eine literarische Arbeit schön ist, oder warum eine Handlung moralisch ist, anstatt eine festgelegte Regel für das Urteilen oder die Schaffung von guter Kunst oder moralischem Verhalten. \n\nMehr zum Punkt kommen, ist die Kritik an Kunst oder Moral nie in der Lage, das Wesentliche von was gut ist oder was schön ist, vollständig zu erfassen. Eine Diskussion um den Wert von Leonardo da Vincis \"Mona Lisa\" kann sich zum Beispiel um Konzepte wie Vordergrund, Hintergrund, Kontrast oder kultureller Kontext drehen, aber schließlich beschreiben diese nicht, warum sie eine gute Kunst ist. Wenn man jedoch nach einer Lieblingsarbeit von Kunst oder Literatur gefragt wird, ist es häufig zu hören, dass eine Phrase wie \"Da gibt es einfach etwas\" vorausgeht, gefolgt von einer komplexeren oder kritischeren Erklärung. Ich glaube, dass sowohl Kunst als auch Moral niemals vollständig auf eine Beschreibung ihrer Qualitäten reduziert werden können. Wie Flannery O'Connor sagt: \"Ein Roman ist eine Möglichkeit, etwas zu sagen, das auf keine andere Weise gesagt werden kann... Du erzählst eine Geschichte, weil eine Aussage unzureichend wäre.\" Unabhängig davon, wie genau wir die Eigenschaften eines literarischen Werks beschreiben, bleibt etwas Transzendentisches zurück. Ich glaube, dass die Ethik das gleiche Eigenschaft hat. Wie Wittgenstein sagt: \"Es ist klar, dass die Ethik nicht ausgedrückt werden kann. / Die Ethik ist transzendent. / Ich schlage vor, dass es dieses 'Etwas', dieses \"je ne sais quoi\", ist, das die mächtigste Eigenschaft von Kunst und Moral ist, und dass diese transzendentale Natur beider Ethik und Ästhetik einen Verbindungspegel zwischen ihnen bietet.\"\n\nIch glaube, dass Moral und Kunst so eng miteinander verbunden sind, weil wir beide von ihnen am stärksten auf eine noumenale Ebene erfahren, wie man es auf Kantianisch ausdrücken würde. Sie wirken auf uns auf einer Ebene, die erfahren werden kann, aber nicht vollständig erklärt werden kann. Diese Verbindung ist sogar noch stärker, wenn es um die Kunst der Literatur geht. Wie McKean sagt: \"Was das Kunstwerk von der Literatur von allen anderen Künsten unterscheidet, was in Wahrheit einzigartig an der Kunst ist, ist ihre moralische Qualität. Es kann sein, dass moralische Standards für andere Künste unangemessen sind, Musik zum Beispiel, aber sie scheinen für die Literatur so relevant zu sein wie für das Leben selbst. Das Leben erfordert notwendigerweise Werte... . . . Die Literatur ist uns wichtig, genau weil die Werte, die wir dort finden.\"\n\nNow I will translate the German text back to English:\n\n[REWRITE] Many a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty.

The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",

Sie streiten mit den Germanen fast täglich.“ (Julius Caesar, 50-40 v. Chr.) Andere behaupten, dass der Begriff auf das Speer, das sie im Krieg verwendeten, bezieht, das als Ger bezeichnet wird (O.E.D., 2010), oder vielleicht auf das altirische Wort garim, das bedeutet „zu schreien“, was darauf hindeutet, dass die Deutschen laut oder störend waren.

Wer würde aus Asien, oder Afrika nach Italien, nach Deutschland, mit seinem wilden Land, seinem rauhen Himmel, seinen verstockten Sitten und Aussehen, abwandern, außer wenn es sein Zuhause war?(SIC)“ (Tacitus, 98) \n\nUnd wem wäre es gegeben, die Germania zu verlassen?

They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.\" (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the term comes from the spear used in warfare, known as a Ger (O.E.D., 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word \"garim\" meaning \"to shout\", indicating that the Germans were loud or noisy. (Names of Germany)\n\nThe early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\", which tells of the origins of the Germans, that \"I consider the Germans as indigenous and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times, it was not by land but by ship that those who sought to emigrate would arrive....... Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy, for Germany with its wild country, its harsh climate, its stern manners and appearance, unless indeed it were their home?\" (Tacitus, 98)\n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send their conquests into the lands of Germania to gather goods and lead occasional land campaigns, but ultimately return home to their vast empire. As Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods obtained from the land and their skills by serving in the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17.)

    "transformed": "Today's Germany is considered a major force, a unified nation with its unique culture spanning from the shadowy Alps to the Baltic Sea in Kiel. This culture can also be felt from Cologne on the Rhine, through the heart of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that the Germany we know today comes from several different sources and tribes.\n\nGermania is the ancestral homeland of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name originated from a Germanic tribe known as the Tungrians, and that they were previously known as Germans before crossing the Rhine and engaging in battles with the Gaulish armies (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar first used the term \"Germanus\" in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, where he conquered the Gauls and fought with Germanic tribes that often crossed the Rhine under false pretenses. He took this term from the Gauls themselves and used it to distinguish between those he had conquered (the Gauls) and those he had not.

Ohne Gefühle, stumm, mit einer geübten Aufmerksamkeit, die das Objekt des Studiums, aber nicht mit irgendeiner abstrakten Verbindung zu einem Verständnis in meinem Geist analysierte die vor meinen Augen liegende Szene.  Gedanken glitten in meinen Geist und wurden wieder so schnell beinahe, wie sie erschienen.  So geschmeidig und so sauber arbeitete mein Bewusstsein, dass es schien, als ob ich keine wirklichen Gedanken von selbst hatte, sondern eine aktive und flüssige Erfahrung von dem, was ich sah.\nEinmal auf Anraten eines Künstlers, mit dem ich gearbeitet habe, kaufte ich ein Kunstlehrbuch, das New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain (Neue Zeichnen auf der rechten Gehirnhälfte) hieß.  Ich wollte schon seit ich sechs Jahre alt war, lernen wie man malt, und dieses Buch lehrt alles von der Verständigung, was ein Bleistift ist, bis zu den Prozessen, die das Gehirn benutzt, um Linien zu interpretieren. Ein Technik, die dieses Buch lehrt, ist, einen quadratischen Rahmen um jedes Bild zu ziehen, das der Künstler studieren möchte.  Damit verwandelt man ein überwältigend detailliertes Bild, zum Beispiel ein Teller Obst auf einem Tisch, der sich in einem Wohnzimmer befindet, in ein leicht zu erfassendes Bild, dieses Obst auf einem einfachen Flachboden.  \nZum Zeitpunkt, als ich mit dem Blick nach unten auf den Teller vor mir blickte, konnte ich die Rahmen des Künstlers nicht mental projizieren.  Ich war so überwältigt, so beeindruckt, dass ich mich nur wundern konnte.  Picasso ging durch seine blaue Phase, Monet liebte Grün, die italienischen Renaissance-Meister zeigten eine Vielfalt von Farben. Wenn ich, wenn ich überhaupt vorhatte, meine Perspektive als wertvoll genug für den Titel Kunst zu betrachten, dann vor mir waren die Anfänge meines Bildes, der Anfang meiner Geschichte, Work in Braun.  \nDie Fingerspitzen berührten meinen gewählten Werkzeug der Kunst, die Muskeln spannten und lockerten sich, wenn meine Hand Raum durchquerte, die Willenskraft meines Geistes wurde zu Form und Gestalt in was vielleicht das kreative Moment meines Lebens gewesen wäre.  Wasser strömte, ruhig und glatt, kalt und sauber.  Schuppen von Materie brachen von dem Ganzen ab und wurden von nichts verschleppt.  Muskeln spannten sich, zuckten und krampften ein bisschen schneller und ängstlicher die zweite Mal, meine Hand schlug den Griff des Toilettensitzes erneut.

Ein paar weitere Entleerungen, ein paar weitere ruhige introspektive Momente für mich, dann bewegte meine Hand sich in Richtung der Wand rechts von mir, griff an das Ende des Toiletpapiers und begann, sich zu verhüllen, bis es einem Ofenhandtuch ähnelte.

Viele Faktoren sammeln sich zusammen, um diese tödliche Statistik für die jüngsten amerikanischen Fahrer zu schaffen.  Die National Institutes of Health erklären, dass eine Facette des Problems darin besteht, dass das Teenagergehirn wahrlich nicht bereit ist für die Gefahren des Fahrens.  Die einfache Erfahrung mangelnden Fähigkeiten stehen ebenfalls im Zentrum des Problems. Diese Unfähigkeit führt nicht nur zu einer höheren Anzahl von tödlichen Unfällen, sondern auch zu einer höheren Rate von Fahrzeugumschlägen, überhöhter Geschwindigkeit und Fahren von der Straße.  \nAuch fahren Teenager schlechter, wenn sie mit ihrer Altersgruppe reisen – was jeder mit einem Schuss von Selbstvertrauen weiß, dass sie auf regelmäßiger Grundlage tun.  Das Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center führte eine Studie durch, die folgende Korrelation zeigte: zwischen dem Alter des Beifahrers und der Anzahl von Verkehrsunfällen.\n\tKalifornien und andere Bundesstaaten haben versucht, die Sicherheit von Jugendlichen zu erhöhen, indem sie temporäre provisorische Lizenzen verlangen, die die Stunden begrenzen, in denen Jugendliche fahren dürfen und andere Minderjährige als Beifahrer verbieten.\n\tAber provisorische Führerscheine sind meiner Meinung nach nur ein vorübergehendes Mittel.  Das wahre Problem ist, dass—als Gruppe—die jüngsten Fahrer, gemessen an statistischen Kriterien, einfach nicht in der Lage sind, die Risiken und Verantwortlichkeiten ausreichend zu bewältigen.  Der Psychologe Marvin Zuckerman glaubt, dass 18 sogar zu jung ist für einen regulären Führerschein.  USA Today berichtet, dass Zuckerman eine Studie durchgeführt hat, die ein gemeinsames Verlangen bei jenen unter dem Alter von 19-20 nach Risiken für den einfachen Kick des Gefühls nahelegt.  Das lässt sich logisch erklären, warum es daher sinnvoll ist, das Fahren mindestens bis zur Zeit, bis der Wunsch nach Thrills abgeschwächt ist, zu verzögern.  Wenn wir weiterhin Führerscheine an junge Teenager ausstellen, werden nicht nur weiterhin tödliche Unfälle passieren, sondern die Todeszahl wird auch in den nächsten Jahren wahrscheinlich an dramatische Verhältnisse anwachsen.  Bis 2010 werden die Baby-Boomers-Babies berechtigt sein, zu fahren und Millionen neuer Teenager werden bereit sein, das Straßenverkehr zu betreten.  \nEin Gesetzgebungsakt, der sich mit diesem Thema beschäftigt, wäre durchaus klar.  Die Schulen könnten weiterhin Führerscheinprüfungen anbieten, um den Lernprozess für zukünftige Fahrer zu beginnen, aber niemand unter 18 Jahren könnte ein Kraftfahrzeug betreiben.  Ein provisorischer Führerschein könnte immer noch vor der Verleihung eines regulären Führerscheins ausgestellt werden, und eine bestimmte Anzahl praktischer Führerschein-Stundensatzungen könnte immer noch erforderlich sein.  Die genaue Anzahl der erforderlichen Stunden könnte sich auf die Anzahl der Stunden basieren, die die meisten Bundesstaaten bereits verlangen (in Kalifornien zum Beispiel beträgt diese Anzahl derzeit 6 Stunden Fahrlehrer-Training und 50 Stunden Übung mit einem Erwachsenen).  Da die tödlichen Statistiken für Jugendliche aus einer Querschnitt aller Bundesstaaten stammen, wäre einheitliches, nationales Gesetzgebung auf diesem Thema eine vernünftige und ich glaube effektive Möglichkeit,Teenager landesweit zu schützen. \nDas von mir vorgeschlagene Gesetz ist keineswegs eine neuartige Idee.\n\n[REWRITE] \nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.

    "original": "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",

    "raw_output": "Text in German:\n\nWenn ich mich durch die Bibliothek der frühzeitlichen Edison-Filme der Library of Congress kenne, entschied ich mich, alle Trickfilme anzuschauen, von denen es 1895 bis 1901 fünfzehn gab. Diese Filme nutzen in der Regel die kreative Montage, um Illusionen zu produzieren. Meine Arbeit in der Filmanalyse konzentrierte sich hauptsächlich auf die Beschreibung der Poetik für die meisten Trickfilme und die Untersuchung der evolutionären abweichenden Merkmale in einigen der späteren Filme. In der Regel sind Trickfilme aus der Zeit um die Jahrhundertwende fest im Bühnenbild festgelegt, bestehen aus einem proscenium, haben keine Kamerabewegung, verwenden lange und mittlere Shots und befolgen die stricke Regeln, dass eine Kameraeinstellung gleich einer Filmsequenz ist. Es gibt jedoch einige Filme von Anfang des 20. Jahrhunderts, die diese Richtlinien durch die Einführung von Aspekten wie mehreren Shots brechen.\n\nEines der auffälligsten Merkmale, das die Trickfilme gemeinsam haben, ist die Verfilmung in einem Bühnenbild innerhalb des Rahmens eines proscenium. Die Kamera bewegt sich nicht aus ihrer proscenium-Haltung, um Figuren oder Gegenstände zu verfolgen. Diese Komposition war in den Anfangszeiten der Filme sehr verbreitet und zog ihren Ursprung aus dem Theater und für Trickfilme dem Vaudeville und dem Zauber. Eine der Einschränkungen, die in der Verwendung des Bühnenbilds liegen, ist, dass Figuren in Trickfilmen in der Regel nur horizontal von Seite zu Seite bewegen und nicht zur Kamera oder von ihr weg wandern. Nehmen wir zum Beispiel den Ablauf des Films \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900) als Beispiel. Die Schauspieler treten von der rechten Seite ein und bewegen sich vor und zurück entlang der horizontalen Achse. Selbst wenn sie aus dem Bild rausgehen, folgt die Kamera ihnen nicht.\n\nDie proscenium-Style der Komposition bedeutet auch, dass Shots tendenziell lange Shots und seltener mittlere Shots sind. Close-up Shots werden in keinem der Trickfilme aus dem Edison-Katalog verwendet. Dies leitet sich aus der Theater- und Vaudeville-Tradition ab, wo der Zuschauer das gesamte Spiel zu jedem gegebenen Zeitpunkt sah, gefasst durch die Grenzen der Bühne. Wie in den meisten frühen Filmen bewegen sich die Schauspieler nicht von der Mittellinie in Richtung der Kamera, sodass Close-up-Shots nie vorkommen.\n\nIn der Regel folgen die meisten frühen Trickfilme der Regel, dass ein kreativer Shot einer Filmsequenz entspricht. Dies begrenzt die Länge der meisten Trickfilme auf etwa eine Minute oder weniger, je nach den pro Sekunde verwendeten Frames. Es begrenzt auch die dramatische oder narrative Verwendung der Trickfilme; die meisten von ihnen konzentrieren sich auf kurze Vaudeville-Style-Tricks, wie Magie, Verschwinden und Wechsel der Akte mit wenig Handlung. Beachten Sie jedoch, dass in einem Trickfilm ein kreativer Shot in den Augen des Zuschauers nicht unbedingt gleich einem physischen Shot ist. Ein einzelner „Shot“ kann tatsächlich mehrere miteinander verbundene Shots sein, um die Illusion von Erscheinung oder Verschwinden zu erzeugen. Schauen Sie genauer hin zu \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), einem der früheren Trickfilme. Eine gründliche Inspektion revealiert den Moment, an dem der körperliche Shot mit Mariens \"abgetrennter Kopf\" anfängt, auch wenn der ganze Film konzeptionell eine Shot für den Zuschauer ist.\n\n[REWRITE]\nWhen browsing through the Library of Congress's library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were 15 from 1895 to 1901.

One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side to side and do not walk toward or away from the camera.

It also limits the dramatic or narrative use of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. However, note that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer's eyes does not necessarily equal one physical shot. A single \"shot\" may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearance.

Als hauptsächlich Agrarist war seine Berufsausübung zusammen mit seiner kurzen Karriere in der Politik dafür verantwortlich, dass er für seine Entschlossenheit und seine Aussagekraft in Angelegenheiten der persönlichen Freiheit und der Regierung bekannt war.  Seine Hingabe an ein agrarisches System war die Grundlage für nahezu alle seiner Meinungen über die Regierung.  Sein Versuch, das, was er für die beste aller Karrieren hielt, zu bewahren und zu fördern, prägte seine Argumente über Souveränität, Verfassungsmäßigkeit und sogar das Justizsystem.\n\nJohn Taylor glaubte, dass die Vereinigten Staaten eine große Chance hatten, ein ideales System zu schaffen, da es keine native Tradition gab, die die Schöpfer der Regierung behinderte, was es ermöglichte, ein System der Selbstverwaltung zu etablieren.  Er glaubte stark an die natürlichen Rechte des Menschen und daran, dass sie alle voneinander abhängig sind – bedeuten, dass, wenn einem von ihnen versagt wird, sie alle versagen werden, und der Wert der verbleibenden wird verringert.  Diese Rechte sollten also außer Reichweite der Regierung liegen.  Er behauptete, dass das, was einige den \"Zustand der Natur\" nannten, bedeutete, dass diejenigen mit physischer Fähigkeit und bösartiger Intelligenz diejenigen waren, die profitierten, aber dass in einer Zivilisation sollte dies nicht der Fall sein.\n\nUm dieses ideale Gesellschaft zu schaffen, glaubte Taylor, dass eine Regierung geschaffen werden musste, die sich der inhärenten Guten und Bösen des Menschen Rechnung tragen musste.  Taylor war sehr streng in seinen Meinungen über eine dualistische Moral.  Er behauptete, dass \"Da die Regierung durch den Menschen ausgeübt wird, müssen alle ihre Tugend und Laster menschlich sein\" (Ibid., S. 167).  Er definierte gute Prinzipien als solche, die den privaten Besitz schützen, die Landwirtschaft verbessern und den Kapitalismus diskriminieren, und glaubte, dass eine Regierung auf guten Prinzipien gegründet ist, gerecht funktionieren würde, unabhängig von ihrer Verwaltung, die unweigerlich von Habgier und Eigeninteresse geleitet werden würde.  Eigeninteresse, glaubte er, sei die Motivation des Menschen in allen Dingen, aber dass das Verhalten nur als böse betrachtet wird, wenn es über die Schaffung einer Gesellschaft auf öffentlichem Gut hinausging und zu Untergruppen führte, die auf Kosten anderer lebten.  Eine gute Regierung war notwendig, um das natürliche Böse des Menschen zu bewahren, und selbst dann musste sie sorgfältig überwacht werden, um die Hinzufügung von schlechten Prinzipien zu vermeiden.\n\nTaylor, wie viele andere strenge Republikaner seiner Zeit, rief nach einer strengen Auslegung der Verfassung.  Er wollte eine extrem beschränkte Bundesregierung mit keinem mehr Recht oder Macht, als im Verfassungstext ausdrücklich erwähnt wurde, und wusste, dass eine umfassende Bundesregierung teuer war und daher wahrscheinlich despotisch werden würde.  Allerdings glaubte er, dass eine einfache, wörtliche Interpretation gefährlich war und ohne Bezug auf den Absicht der Autoren, solche Methode leicht korrupt werden konnte.  Ebenso betrachtete er die Erklärung der Unabhängigkeit als wahre Charta der Vereinigten Staaten, weil sie den Staat wesentlich genau als Gruppe souveräner Staaten beschrieb, anstatt als ein einziges Land.\n\n[REWRITE]\nJohn Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.

That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped.

Das war ein bisschen entmutigend, und es ist schwer zu sagen, warum das passiert sein könnte. Mit Beginn des Winters an einer New-England-Kampus gibt es eindeutig einen Rückgang bei den Menschen, die entweder Fahrrad oder zu Fuß fahren, was womöglich einen Teil des Rückgangs erklären könnte. Dezember markiert auch das Ende des Herbstsemesters, als sich alle sehr beschäftigt mit der Abgabe von Hausarbeiten, der Bearbeitung von Noten und so weiter sind. Die Ausfüllung des Verkehrslogbuchs mag einfach nur vom Radar gefallen sein für viele Leute. Zusätzlich bringt Dezember den Beginn der besetzten Feiertagszeit und den folgenden einmonatigen Urlaub für Studenten und Professoren, während dessen viele nicht einmal auf den Campus kommen müssen. Kurse beginnen dann im späten Januar wieder für das Frühlingssemester, was vielleicht auch ein Hinweis darauf ist, dass die geringe Anzahl von Einreichungen für diesen Monat darstellt. Aber keiner von all dem erklärt wirklich die geringe Anzahl von Einreichungen für Februar. Man könnte auch vermuten, dass jede solche Art von Projekt anfangs eine Welle von Energie und Enthusiasmus aufweist, die dann natürlich nachlässt. In dem Bemühen, diesem Trend entgegenzutreten, haben wir die Carpool Challenge Week geschaffen, eine besondere Blitzkampagne im März, um das Initiativ zu revitalisieren, was letztlich zu einer Zunahme von Einreichungen im Verkehrslogbuch für diesen Monat geführt hat. Eines der Herausforderungen, die wir erlebten, war also, wie man das Projektimpuls in einem Gegenpunkt von einer natürlichen Verringerung der Beteiligung zu bewahren, aber auch speziell die Probleme der Ferien und Semesterunterbrechungen in der höheren Bildung zu meistern.\n\nEine Herausforderung für dieses Projekt (oder jede alternative Verkehrskampagne) ist einfach die Tatsache, dass Menschen die Freiheit, Unabhängigkeit und Flexibilität des Autofahrens genießen. Das ist tief in unserer Kultur eingebettet. Es ist daher entscheidend, Anreize für alternative Verkehrsmittel zu bieten. Wir haben daher viele Preise in Form von Geschenzkarten an lokale Restaurants, Kaffeehäuser, Massage-Therapeuten, den örtlichen unabhängigen Buchladen und sogar einige größere nationalen Kettenläden verteilt. Es wäre jedoch interessant gewesen zu sehen, wie einige größere Preise die Beteiligung beeinflusst haben könnten – beispielsweise das Gewinnen eines Fahrrads, eines Hybridautos oder eines Elektroautos. Das könnte auch dazu beigetragen haben, den Rückgang der Beteiligung zu bekämpfen, den das Projekt erlebt hat. Die Art der Preise änderte sich nicht wirklich während des Laufs des Projekts. Wenn die Preise jedoch im Laufe des Projekts an Wert zunähmen, würde das vielleicht helfen. Die Geschenkkarten schienen anfangs ausreichend zu sein, aber wenn wir im Dezember eine Veröffentlichung über die Zusätze einiger Fahrräder angekündigt und dann im Januar die Zusätze eines Hybrid- oder Elektroautos, kann nur gedacht werden, dass das Teilnehmen und die Beteiligung stattdessen gestiegen wären anstatt zu sinken.\n\nEnglish translation:\n\n[REWRITE] In reference to Figure 17, the third month of the project saw a significant drop in commuter log submissions.

An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

Ein ETF bietet Ihnen die Diversifizierung eines Indexfonds und die Vorteile der Einzelaktienbesitz wie die Möglichkeit, kurz zu verkaufen, auf Kredit zu kaufen und bei jeder Transaktion ab einem einzigen Aktienkauf zu kaufen.  Obwohl diese Vorteile äußerst attraktiv sind, sind die Ausgabenquoten von ETFs erheblich niedriger als die der durchschnittlichen Fondsanlage.  Leider gibt es einige Nachteile, wie die Notwendigkeit, für jede Transaktion mit ETFs eine Kommission zu zahlen, genauso wie Sie für eine Aktienbestellung.  Ein weiterer Vorteil von ETFs ist die breite Palette an verfügbaren Fonds.  Obwohl diese Vorteile klar sind, ist es immer eine gute Übung für den klugen Finanzinvestor, zu überprüfen, ob die ausgesprochenen Vorteile, wie die Diversifizierung, tatsächlich existieren und in welchem Ausmaß sie existieren.  Für die Zwecke dieses Projekts werden wir den ETF IHF untersuchen und ihn gegen die Top 10-Holdings vergleichen, die den ETF ausmachen, um zu bestimmen, ob die Vorteile eines Einzel-ETFs den Vorteilen eines diversifizierten Portfolios der zehn Aktien nahekommen oder ob es bessere Konfigurationen der gleichen Aktien gibt, die ein optimales Schärfeverhältnis oder Rendite bieten.\n\nUm den ETF zu bewerten, würde es sich als ziemlich unübersichtlich gestalten, jede einzelne Position zu berücksichtigen, daher haben wir beschlossen, nur die Top 10-Holdings mit 63,58 % aller Vermögenswerte zu berücksichtigen.  Hier sind die Top 10-Holdings und der Prozentsatz der Gesamtkapitalanlagen.\n\nUm eine Schätzung davon zu erhalten, wie gut diese zehn Aktien den ETF IHF als Ganzes darstellen, können wir die derzeitigen % der Vermögenswerte, auf 100 % normalisiert, verwenden, um die Beiträge jeder Aktie zu einem Portfolios Beta und Rendite zu berechnen, wenn das Portfolio ausschließlich aus diesen 10 Aktien bestünde, in dem Verhältnis, das der ETF durch ihre Positionen festgelegt hat.  Die Berechnungen des Beta und der Rendite sind im unten stehenden Diagramm enthalten.\n\nAus dem obigen Diagramm ist ersichtlich, dass die Rendite eines Portfolios, das nur die Top 10-Holdings enthält, 6,11 % höher ist als der ETF, eine Renditeerhöhung um 16 %.  Es ist auch offensichtlich, dass das Beta der Top 10-Holdings 0,12 geringer ist als der gesamte ETF.  Aus den Ergebnissen, die bislang erreicht wurden, scheint ein Portfolio aus nur den Top 10-Holdings eine höhere Rendite mit geringerem Beta bieten zu können.

In \"Dream-Land\" verwendet Poe den Begriff \"Thulé\" in Zeile 6 und 56, den Mabbott zurückverfolgt nach Virgil. Virgil verwendete den Begriff in Bezug auf eine Insel nördlich von Britannien, die die Griechen als Rand des bekannten Welt betrachteten. Es ist sicher, dass Virgil den Begriff verwendete, aber es gibt eine weitere aktuelle Quelle, an der man Rücksicht nehmen muss. Poe war sehr interessiert an deutschen Autoren.\n\nDiese Zitate sind wichtig, weil sie Poe's Kenntnisse mit Gothe's Schreiben nachweisen. Karl J. Arndt in seinem Buch Poe's Politian und Goethe's Mignon, kommentiert die Ähnlichkeit ihrer beiden Gedichte, indem er die Schlussfolgerung zieht, dass Poe Gothe imitierte.\n\nDie Oxford-Kommentar zur englischen Literatur sagt über Gothe, dass er ein gefeierter Schriftsteller des poetischen Dramas Faust war, das in zwei Teilen veröffentlicht wurde, der erste im Jahr 1808 und der zweite im Jahr von Gothe's Tod 1832. In der poetischen Verse von Faust's zweiter Teil liegt ein kurzer Gedichtteil mit dem Titel \"Der König von Thulé\". Das Gedicht handelt von einem König, dessen Frau stirbt, nachdem sie ihm ein Becher schenkt. Nachdem seine Frau gestorben ist, beginnt er schwer zu trinken und weint aus dem Gedächtnis seiner toten Königin. Er entscheidet sich dann, dass es Zeit ist, zu sterben, und gibt seinen Besitz an seine Kinder ab, außer dem Becher. Dann geht er zu einem Felsen, wirft den Becher ins Meer, schließt die Augen und stirbt. Der Charakter des Königs von Thul und die Beschreibung des Königs in Dream-Land sind sehr ähnlich, vielleicht ein dunkler Doppelgänger von Poe's Verlust und Trinken. Faust wurde auch in ein romantisches Drama von H P Grattan in 1842 komponiert, was weniger als ein Jahr vor Poe's Verwendung des Begriffs Thule in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" geschah.\n\nPoe referiert Thule zweimal in seinen gesammelten Schriften. Einmal referiert Poe \"ultma Thule\" in The Pit and the Pendulum, aber er verwendet diesen Ausdruck in \"Dream-Land\" zweimal, als Buchende für das Gedicht. \"Der König von Thule\" und \"Dream-Land\" können als Begleitstücke gelesen werden. In \"Dream-Land\" sagt der Sprecher. Dann beschreibt er die Landschaft von Thule und wie es dunkel, einsam ist, er wird von toten Freunden gejagt und sieht eine beschattete Welt ohne Farbe. Alle diese Szenen würden in \"Der König von Thul\" von Gothe gelesen werden, als er seine Frau verloren hat, er ist einsam und hat verloren, seinen Willen zu regieren oder zu leben. Das ganze Gedicht ist eine Beschreibung, als ob der Sprecher in Goethe's Gedicht getreten ist.\n\nGothe war ein bedeutender Autor, den Poe kennen würde, wenn es keinen anderen Grund als seinen Respekt für Tennyson gäbe. Poe hatte das gesagt, wenn er gefragt wurde, ob er Tennyson bewunderte. Abgesehen von der Verbindung zu Tennyson würde Poe in den vielen Wiederholungen, die nach der ursprünglichen Veröffentlichung stattfanden, an Gothe's Werk ausgesetzt sein.\n\nBack translation to English:\n\nDream-Land is one of Edgar Allan Poe's own better poems.

Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and \"didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.\" At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded in the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the 13th, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident, five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D's in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damage claim.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff can recover damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",

Einer der zentralen Themen der heißen Diskussionen in der Klasse war, ob Islam eine feindliche Religion ist.  Ich glaube, dass die Frage noch viel relevanter heute ist als je zuvor.  Wenn man sich an die Ereignisse seit dem 11. September erinnert, habe ich persönlich beobachtet, dass die Massenmedien von einer feindlichen Haltung gegenüber dem Islam und Extremisten zu einem extremen Grad der Toleranz für den Islam in Amerika gewandelt sind.  Ich denke, dass wir 2001 niemals einen Präsidentschaftskandidaten mit dem Namen Barack Obama hätten haben können, der eine offensichtliche muslimische Hintergrund in seiner Familie hat.\n\nDie Biografie des Propheten fasziniert mich, weil nach dem, was ich über die Geschichte Mohammeds weiß, die Biografie dem Charakter des Propheten widerspricht.  Aus dem, was ich weiß und gelernt habe, dachte ich, dass Mohammed Konvertiten zum Islam zwang.  Er würde Stämme erobern und dann zwingen, den Islamreligion anzunehmen.  Aber die Biografie beschreibt Mohammed als eine Art Märtyrer, der missverstanden und sogar sich selbst unterwarf.  Nachdem, als nach und nach die Menschen das \"Wahrheit\" in seinen Lehren erkannten und sich an ihn wandten.\n\nEs gibt auch einige unheimliche Ähnlichkeiten zwischen den Ämtern Jesu und den \"Wundern\" Mohammeds.  Das offensichtlichste ist, als er Schafe und Milch nahm und es so multiplizierte, dass es genug für vierzig Männer gab.  Es ist dieser Stil der Schrift, der mir glauben lässt, dass die Autoren Mohammed als dem bescheidenen Propheten darstellen wollten, der nichts beweisen musste, sondern einfach in der Wahrheit und im Wunder lebte.  Dieser Art von Wahrnehmung ist der schlimmste, weil sie das Wunder und das Leben Jesu Christi herunterspielt.  Es ist mir wie ein Diebstahl, der versucht, den Lebensweg und die Person Jesu durch Mohammed zu übernehmen.\n\nEs gibt auch viele Geschichten in der Biografie, die es so scheinen lassen, als wenn ihr Ziel darin lag, Beweise für \"Zeugen\" oder wie die Menschen \"auf ihre eigene\" zum Islam getauft wurden.  Aber das Problem ist, dass viele der Geschichten zumindest aus einer dritten Parteiperspektive stammen.  Das heißt, in der Geschichte wird erzählt, dass der Autor von jemandem gehört hat, der von jemandem gehört hat usw.  Ich mochte das nicht sehr, weil, obwohl ihre Idee war, dass es Beweise für die Wahrheit der Geschichten bot, ich dachte, dass es die Geschichten herabwürdige und sie noch mehr verdächtig machte.\n\nIch denke, dass das, was mich am meisten stört, ist, dass sie versuchen und Muhammad als einen gottesfürchtigen Mann zu erheben und zu loben, der bescheiden, liebenswert, weise und sanft war.  Aber der Historiker widerspricht der Idee, dass Muhammad ein sanfter und bescheidener Mann war, und ich kann nicht umhin zu denken, dass die Muslime heute die wahre Geschichte hinter Mohammeds Aufstieg zur Macht kennen.\n\nGerman to English:\n\n[REWRITE] Almost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.

Wenn wir uns diese Geschichte in großen Zügen ansehen, sehen wir einen Trend, der sich von der christlichen Wurzel immer weiter entfernt. Es scheint, dass die heutige Welt eine stetig wachsende Bewusstseinsbildung und einen unerreichten progressiven Trend zeigt. Während traditionelle Menschen und weiterhin bestehen und sich jedem Art von Denkweise, die über das zum Ausgebildet wurde, widersetzen, mag diese Gruppe der Bevölkerung nicht prominent genug sein, um das Ganze zu beeinflussen.  Bei Christen wird eine historische Bewusstseinsbildung in den kommenden Jahren enorm wachsen. Ein Verlangen wird sich verbreiten, die Lehren zu unterscheiden, die in das Christentum über die Zeit hineingedacht wurden, von dem eigentlichen Zweck der Religion.  Es mag Jahre oder sogar Jahrhunderte dauern, aber das Ergebnis wird unvermeidlich sein: Es wird eine große Wende in der Trend der christlichen Geschichte geben. Es wird eine Rückkehr zu seiner ursprünglichen Form geben. Eine Bewegung wird wachsen, die die Lehren, Schicht für Schicht, entfernen wird, genau wie der Uhrurm sich rückwärts bewegt, bis nichts außer einer Vorstellung von dem übrig bleibt, was Jesus der Menschheit wegen Gottes eingeführt hat, bevor andere Denker Ansprüche ähnlicher Art vortrugen.  Wenn diese Trend durch die Vereinigten Staaten und Europa geht und die Masse in seinem Gefolge dazu bewegt, wie man in der Zeit Jesu lebend, nur seine Ideen zu befolgen, wird die Kirche als Institution stark bleiben, um den Weg zu führen.  Allerdings, weil der theologische Uhrurm sich rückwärts bewegt, wird die extreme Vielfalt in Christendom in mehr und mehr Einheitlichkeit von Überzeugungen und Praktiken zurückkehren.  Zwischen Regionen, zwischen Konfessionen, zwischen Divisionen aller Art, werden wir anstatt von Unterschieden zunehmende Ähnlichkeiten sehen.  Die menschliche Geschichte ist voller großen Wenden.  Ein Beispiel dafür ist, wie Christen einst von der römischen Kaiser verehrt wurden, verstoßen und getötet wurden.  Aber später wurde jene Kaiser eine christliche Institution.  Unsere Nation ging von der Sklaverei der Afroamerikaner zu einer afroamerikanischen Führung.  Die große Wende, die in unserer Zukunft stattfinden wird, wird sich in der Arena der christlichen Religion entfalten und Geschichte auf den Ursprung zurückführen, und Vielfalt dabei aufgeben. Es ist wichtig zu beachten, dass ein Teil dessen, was diese Prozess möglich machen wird, eine Methode sein wird, Jesu Worte als metaphorische Ausdrücke zu lesen und nicht als wörtliche Aussagen.  Was also ist es, was sich seitens Jesu Leben ereignet hat?\n       Wenn wir uns weit genug in die Geschichte zurückverfolgen, finden wir nur das Judentum, die theologische Anfangspunkt der christlichen Religion.  Monotheismus, die Wahrnehmung einer göttlich offenbarten Religion, und die Autorität der Hebräischen Schriften, standen alle in der Mitte der Religion, als die Römer Jerusalem im Jahre 63 v. Chr. in ihren Besitz nahmen.  Die jüdische Bevölkerung teilte sich nicht in einem Geist.  Sie teilten sich in Sadduzäer, Phariser, Essener, Zeloten und die Mehrheit der gewöhnlichen Menschen auf.\n\nEnglish translation back to English:\n[REWRITE] The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were initially left behind in the development of Christian thought that progressed after his death.

Here is the translation process:\n\nThe English text to German translation:\n\nIch glaube, dass \"Der Dschungel\" zeigt, wie tief menschliche Wesen von Natur aus gierig und selbstsüchtig sind. Sie denken nur daran, für sich selbst zu sorgen und ihr Leben so gut wie möglich zu machen, aber nie daran zu denken, sich um jemanden unter ihnen zu kümmern. \"Der Dschungel\" zeigt dies auf viele Weise. Der offensichtlichste Bereich ist die Eigentümer und Manager der großen Fabriken. Sie wollen nur eines: ihre Unternehmen und Fabriken so groß und großartig wie möglich zu machen. Sie denken nicht an jemanden oder etwas, das auf ihrem Weg steht oder etwas, das aufgrund ihrer Fortschritte verletzt wird. Nach Upton Sinclairs Werk sagt \"Der Schornstein der Gebäude stand klar und schwarz gegen den Himmel; hier und dort stieg aus der Masse der großen Schornsteine, mit dem Strom des Rauchs, der sich bis ans Ende der Welt erstreckte\". Sinclair versucht, ein Bild von der großen Schädigung zu malen, die diese Luftverschmutzung schafft. Er zeigt, dass die Eigentümer keine Rücksicht auf eine Person oder ein Tier nehmen, das verletzt werden könnte. Sie denken nicht an die großen Rauchwolken, die aus den Fabriken aufsteigen oder die Exkremente und Harn von Tausenden von Stallungen um die Packingtown. \n\nDie Eigentümer und Manager kümmerten sich auch nicht um ihre Arbeitnehmer, um sie reich zu machen. Sie würden alles tun, um ein oder zwei Dollar zu ersparen, \"So von der Spitze bis zur Basis ist der Ort einfach ein Kochtopf der Neid und Hass; es gibt keine Loyalität oder Decenz in ihm, es gibt keinen Ort, an dem ein Mann etwas gilt gegenüber einem Dollar\". Sie zwingen ihre Arbeitnehmer zu unmenschlichen Arbeitszeiten und ohne einen Tag Vorwarnung könnten sie Tausende von Menschen entlassen, ohne Entschädigung oder Hilfe bei der Suche nach einem neuen Job. Während der Zeit, in der \"Der Dschungel\" spielt, gab es keine Gesetze oder Vorschriften, die die Sicherheit oder das Wohlbefinden der Arbeiter schützten. Dies ermöglichte den Manager und Eigentümern, wild zu werden, und ihre Arbeitnehmer zu zwingen, die Fortschritte zu beschleunigen und unter katastrophalen Bedingungen zu arbeiten. Obwohl das Buch das nicht direkt sagt, wurden die Menschen, die in der Packingtown lebten und sich selbst im Tod arbeiteten, einfach erwartet, mit den schrecklichen Bedingungen, sowohl bei der Arbeit in den Fabriken als auch in ihrer Umgebung, umzugehen. Es gab keine Agenturen oder Organisationen, die Informationen oder Hilfe für den Arbeitnehmer bereitstellen. Es gab Gewerkschaften, die gebildet wurden, aber diese taten oft mehr Schaden als Nutzen, indem sie Geld von den armen Arbeitern machten. Die Arbeitnehmer wurden so schlecht behandelt und hatten keine Möglichkeit, dem System der Packingtown zu entkommen, dass sie als Sklaven beschrieben wurden, \"Hier ist eine Bevölkerung, die aus unteren Klassen und vorwiegend aus ausländischen Personen besteht, die sich immer wieder am Rande der Hunger und von den Wünschen von Männern hangelt, die genauso brutal und unsensibel sind wie die alten Sklavenhalter; unter solchen Umständen ist die Unmoral genau so unvermeidlich und häufig wie unter dem System der Sklavenhaltung.\"\n\nAnd now, the translated text back to English:\n\n[REWRITE] I believe that The Jungle shows how human beings are naturally greedy and self-centered deep down inside.

They don't think about the large plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \n\nThe owners and managers also didn't care about their employees' well-being while making them rich. They would do anything to save a buck, \"So from top to bottom, the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counts for anything against a dollar.\" They force their employees to work terrible hours and without any notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a new job. During the time The Jungle is set in, there were no laws or regulations protecting the workers' safety or well-being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild and force their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never explicitly says it, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the working man. There were unions formed, but these often did more harm than good by making money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",

Einige dieser Techniken sind effektiver als andere. F. Scott Fitzgerald verwendet viele dieser Techniken in seinem Roman Der große Gatsby. Manchmal kombiniert Fitzgerald einen Adjektiv und einen Substantiv, die normalerweise nicht zusammen passen, um dem Leser eine bestimmte Aura um ein Thema zu geben. Zu anderen Zeiten legt er einem Symbol Bedeutung bei und verwendet es dann für denselben Zweck. \nFitzgerald verwendet diese letzte Technik mit vielen Farben, einschließlich Gold, Grün, Weiß/Schwarz und Rot/Rosa. In seinem Roman Der große Gatsby baut F. Scott Fitzgerald Bedeutung auf für Farben, insbesondere für Weiß/Schwarz und Rot/Rosa, und verwendet sie dann später, um den Lesern eine bestimmte Erinnerung an ein Gefühl um ein wichtiges Objekt zu geben. \nDie Bedeutung, die Fitzgerald aufbaut und verwendet, für Weiß/Schwarz ist Einerleiheit, wobei Weiß ein bisschen angenehmer und höhergestellter ist und Grau älter und ausgebleicht ist. Fitzgerald legt diese Bedeutung am Anfang des Romans fest, indem er beide ständig verwendet. Daisy und Jordan sind ständig „in Weiß“ (8) - tatsächlich trägt jeder immer weiße Kleidung: Nick trägt „weiße Flanellhemden“ (41) zu Gatsbys Party, Tom trägt ein „weißes Hemd“ (36) bei seiner Begegnung mit Myrtle und Catherine ist „puderweiß“ (30). Tatsächlich trägt niemand Weiß, wenn Nick seine Eindrücke von Gatsbys Party schildert: „Die Halle... sind prächtig mit Primärfarben geschmückt“ (40). Fitzgerald definiert diese beiden Farben weiter, indem er viele alltägliche, unbedeutende Dinge mit diesen Farben bemalt: wie Nick zu seiner Arbeit geht, geht er „den weißen Abgrund des unteren New Yorks“ (56) hinunter, die Namen der Leute an Gatsbys Partys sind jetzt „graue Namen“ (61) in Nicks Zeitplan, Catherines Wohnung ist „ein Stück in einem langen weißen Kuchen aus Wohnungshäusern“ - Einerleiheit (28). Er beschreibt auch normale oder alltägliche Menschen oder Orte als weiß oder grau: Jordan und Daisy hatten eine „weiße Kindheit“ (19) zusammen, es gibt „graue Autos“ und „graue Land“ (23) im Tal der Asche, der „italienische Junge“ im Zug ist „graubraun“ (26), und der Hunderzieher ist „ein grauer alter Mann“ (27). \nNachdem Fitzgerald genug Bedeutung für Weiß/Schwarz hinzugefügt hat, verwendet er sie, um bestimmten Gegenständen Uniformität oder Einerleiheit zu signalisieren. Dieses Verwenden von Farben, um den Lesern etwas zu zeigen, beginnt mit Daisy. Nach einer langen Zeit ohne bedeutungsvolle Verwendung von beiden Farben beschreibt Fitzgerald Daisy als „in weiß“ gekleidet in „einem kleinen weißen Roadster“; die Leser beginnen, Daisy als weniger eine Charakterfigur, mehr als nur eine uniforme Hinzufügung zu sehen, etwas, was Gatsby will und sich wünscht (74). Fitzgerald verwendet mehr von dieser Technik um Daisy herum, um diese Eindrücke von Daisy als eine mehr uniforme Hinzufügung zu geben, zum Beispiel gibt es ein „graues Flaum um Daisys Kragen“ (18), und sie ist wieder in einem „weißen“ Kleid (115) vor der Begegnung zwischen Tom und Gatsby. \n\nEnglish Translation [REWRITE] Many authors use various methods to convey a certain emotional resonance or attitude towards important themes to their readers.

Häufige Anbaufrüchte sind Tomaten, Zitrusfrüchte, Blattsalate, Zucchini, Brokkoli, Kräuter, Baumfrüchte wie Aprikosen und Zitronen, Beeren, Honig und Paprika. In der San Diego-Gegend gibt es einen erheblichen Markt für biologisch angebaute Gemeinschaftsgärten, mit vielen lokalen Organisationen, die lange Wartelisten haben. Biologische Eier und Milch sind ebenfalls beliebt. Viele biologische Farmen bieten auch Touren durch ihre landwirtschaftlichen Operationen sowie Zugang zu Wanderwegen, Vogelbeobachtungen und anderen Erholungstätigkeiten an. Dies ist der Art von Betrieb, der es dem Eigentümer ermöglicht, die Vorteile von Regierungsprogrammen zu nutzen, während die Lebensräume verbessert und die Erholung genutzt werden und die Möglichkeit für Farmtouren und andere Programme zur Erschließung von Einnahmen oder für Bildungszwecke geschaffen werden.\n\nZusätzlich zum Ausfüllen eines potenziell lukratischen Nischenmarkt liegen die Vorteile der biologischen Landwirtschaft oftmals in größerer Artenvielfalt von Pflanzen und Tieren in der Gegend, dank der mangelhaften Verwendung von Chemikalien im Boden und im Wasser. Allerdings verlangt organische Landwirtschaft in einigen Aspekten höhere Kosten als konventionelle Landwirtschaft. Sie erfordert intensivere Arbeitskraft und -management, um Ungeziefer und Unkräuter zu entfernen und den Boden ohne Chemikalien zu düngen, und Verluste sind oft größer als bei konventionellen Methoden, während eine kleine biologische Farm auch den Effizienzgewinn eines großen Betriebs vermissen muss. Praktiken, die nicht mit der biologischen Landwirtschaft zusammenhängen, aber dem Wildtierwohl zugute kommen, können auch höhere Arbeitskosten verursachen, einschließlich des Anbaus von Streuobst, strategischer Weidebewirtschaftung, Entfernung invasiver Arten und aktiver Bewirtschaftung des Pflanzenwachstums, um spezifische Bedingungen wie Ränder oder offene Flächen zu schaffen. Es gibt daher viele Gründe, warum der Eigentümer in diesem Beispiel möglicherweise finanzielle Unterstützung oder Expertise in Anspruch nimmt, um sowohl Gewinne als auch Lebensräume zu maximieren.\n\nDie für dieses Szenario gewählte Fläche befindet sich in unincorporierten San Diego County, Kalifornien, neben dem Ort Potrero, es handelt sich um 160 Acres chaparral, nicht einheimische mediterrane Weidelandschaft und Eichenwald, nahe des Cleveland National Forest.

Der Plan wird noch überprüft, aber er berücksichtigt derzeit über hundert Arten von Pflanzen und Tieren. Viele sind gefährdet, wie der Stephens' Rennspitzmaus, der Berg-Gelbflügel-Frosch, mehrere Arten von Schmetterlingen und der Kalifornische Gänseflügler; andere sind rückläufig und könnten bald auf die Liste gesetzt werden, wie Burrowing Owls.\n\nDiese Gegend wurde von den Native Americans für unzählige Jahrhunderte bewohnt und wurde dann von Rindviehzüchtern und Holzhändlern in den späten 1800er Jahren besiedelt. Dieses Stück Land war Teil eines Original-Homestead-Patents und wurde wahrscheinlich für Weidewirtschaft und/oder Holzproduktion während der folgenden Jahrzehnte genutzt.\n\nIch wählte einen Stück Land von einem Immobilien-Website und recherchierte über verfügbare Regierungsprogramme, um zu sehen, welche Optionen ein kleiner Farmer in Anspruch nehmen könnte, um Kosten zu mildern und Wildtierfreundliche Betriebe zu erhalten.

Stattdessen muss man diese Kultur einfach akzeptieren, wie sie ist, und innerhalb ihrer Grenzen arbeiten, besonders in Verhandlungen, und insbesondere, wenn man mit einer schwächeren Verhandlungslage an den Tisch kommt. Ebenso kann ein Verhandler, der sich in „fremdem“ Gebiet befindet, einen Respekt für Traditionen und Überzeugungen nur nutzen, um die kulturellen Barrieren zu überwinden und die Verhandlung voranzutreiben.\n\nEs ist wichtig zu beachten, dass die Kultur nicht unbedingt auf einem nationalen/Internationalen Dualismus beschränkt ist. Die meisten Unternehmen innerhalb einer Nation haben ihre eigene Unternehmenskultur eingeführt. Zum Beispiel kann eine Unternehmenskultur lange Arbeitszeiten im Büro oder eine entspanntere Zeitplanung betonen. Beweise für eine Unternehmenskultur können in Dresscodes, Kommunikationsstilen (direkte vs. indirekte Kommunikation, Delegierung von Aufgaben) und Personalbeschaffungspraktiken gefunden werden. Einige Unternehmen ermutigen Philanthropie auf jeder Ebene, andere beschränken sie auf „unternehmensgenehmigte“ Wohltätigkeitsorganisationen oder Spenden. Man muss nur an den Unterschieden zwischen den amerikanischen Unternehmenskulturen zwischen Unternehmen (und tatsächlich existiert Intraunternehmensvielfalt sogar von Region zu Region, von städtischen zu suburbanen Umgebungen eingeschlossen) sehen, um die Vielfalt der Gedanken zu schätzen, die sich in einer bestimmten Gesellschaftskultur befinden können. Bestimmte Kulturen sind nicht annähernd so differenziert wie die amerikanische Kultur und mögen von einem Außenstehenden als gleichmäßig erscheinen, aber ein ähnliches Äußeres bedeutet einfach, tiefer zu bohren.\n\nWerte sind noch wichtiger zu verstehen, da sie den Warum einer Kultur geben. Wenn das Schonwerden oder die gemeinsame Harmonie innerhalb einer Kultur geschätzt werden, ist es sicher, dass ein Verhandler sein Unternehmen oder seinen Vorgesetzten nicht öffentlich bloßstellen wird, um am Verhandlungstisch erfolgreich zu sein.

Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one comes to the negotiation table. However, it is wise for a negotiator to learn something about their opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. [/REWRITE]",
    "transformed": "Culture plays a significant role in every negotiation. Culture can be defined by what it is not, as much as by what it actually is and what it signifies. However, culture is not homogeneous, nor is it something specific. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While understanding generalizations about a culture is appropriate, it is much more productive for a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture and how it can affect the matter at hand. When approaching a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to their own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nTrying to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to recognizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or trying to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially in negotiations, and most especially when one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds themselves in \"foreign\" territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in overcoming cultural barriers and moving the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is worth noting that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long working hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in dress codes, communication styles (direct vs. indirect communication, delegation of tasks), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level, while others restrict it to \"company-approved\" charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, as they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame their company or their superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture that gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity.

While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind.

    "raw_output": "Hier ist die Übersetzung des Textes ins Deutsche:\n\n\"Der Narr hat gesagt im Herzen, 'Es gibt keinen Gott.'\"  Diese Zitat ist zum ersten Mal in dem 14. Psalm der christlichen Bibel zu finden und wird am Anfang der Argumentation von St. Anselm zur Existenz Gottes verwendet. Diese Überzeugung scheint auch von dem anderen Autor zu sein, den wir besprechen werden, Thomas von Aquin. Da jedes von ihren Argumenten die Verteidigung desselben Konzepts ist und unsere Herausforderung darin besteht zu bestimmen, wer von den beiden das bessere ist, müssen wir aus Gründen der Kürze annehmen, dass beide in ihrem Glauben an die Existenz Gottes richtig sind, insbesondere des Gottes der Bibel. Wenn wir einen Gottartigen erlauben würden, der sich nicht vom einen in dem unsere beiden Autoren glauben, würde uns das nicht ermöglichen, ihre beiden Argumente angemessen zu vergleichen, da sie letztlich die Verteidigung eines spezifischen Gotteskonzepts sind. Dazu gesagt, denke ich, dass jeder von ihnen zwar einige gültige Punkte bringt, aber weder von ihnen bietet einen umfassenden Grund für den Glauben an Gott.\n\nUm dieses Problem zu illustrieren, werden wir zunächst die grundlegende Argumentation von St. Anselm untersuchen. Anselms Passage spiegelt einen Weg zum Verständnis durch Glauben wider, indem man innerhalb der eigenen Selbst nach Beweisen für Gott sucht. Er erklärt, dass Gott in unserem Verständnis existiert und wir seine Nichteinheitigkeit nicht wirksam vorstellen können. Während dieser Konzept, wenn es in seiner Terminologie ausgedrückt wird, etwas mühsam und manchmal unklar ist, ist der grundlegende Punkt, dass der Beweis für Gott in der eigenen Seele liegt. St. Anselm schlägt uns vor, dass wir nicht über die Grenzen unserer eigenen Seele hinausgehen müssen, um Wahrheit über Gott zu finden, sondern dass die Existenz dieses Wesens einfach dadurch wahr ist, dass wir in unserer eigenen Seele die Wahrheit erkennen, die wir für wahr anerkennen. Fremde Beweise sind offensichtlich nicht nötig. Diese Idee, dass man annimmt, ohne dass es einen unwiderlegbaren empirischen Beweis gibt, wird in christlichen Texten oft als Glaube bezeichnet.\n\nDieses Konzept ist sehr verschieden von dem, das von St. Thomas von Aquin gehalten wird. Aquinas schlägt stattdessen vor, dass die Existenz Gottes durch ausschließlich durch Vernunft und empirische Beweise bewiesen werden kann, ohne dass es auf Glauben von irgendeiner Art ankommt. Eine solche Idee wäre bei der evangelischen Verbreitung, einem wichtigen Element des Christentums, nützlich, da sie es ermöglichen würde, neue Konvertiten ohne Abhängigkeit von deren Bereitschaft an etwas zu gewinnen, das nicht bewiesen werden kann. Sie könnten stattdessen durch Logik allein überzeugt werden. St. Thomas erweitert dies auf fünf verschiedene logische Argumente, die die Existenz Gottes unterstützen: Änderung, Kausalität, Kontingenz, Grade der Exzellenz und Harmonie. In jedem davon zeigt er im Wesentlichen, dass der Beweis für Gott in der logischen Notwendigkeit für Gott liegt. Wenn Ihnen gesagt wird, dass Sie ein Puzzleteil fehlen lassen und der Rest des Puzzles zusammenstellen, bestimmt die Logik, dass Sie die Merkmale und die Existenz des fehlenden Teils kennen, ohne ihn sehen zu müssen.\n\n[REWRITE]The fool has said in his heart, 'There is no God.'

    "raw_output": "First, I will translate the given text to German:\n\nIn etwa im fünften oder sechsten Jahrhundert v. Chr. wurde ein Prinz geboren, der eines Tages Buddha heißen würde. Im Laufe seines Lebens gab er die Welt auf und wurde erleuchtet, und seine Lehren führten zur Bildung des Buddhismus – der orthodoxeste Zweig davon ist der Theravada-Buddhismus. Die Religion ist etwa zweitausendfünfhundert Jahre alt; sie sieht heute anders aus als damals, als Buddha lebte. Dies kann man überall sehen, zum Beispiel in der Theravada-Nation Sri Lanka, wo die jährliche Wasser-Schnitt-Zeremonie beobachtet wird. Mönche und Laien nehmen gemeinsam an dieser Zeremonie teil, und sie hat religiöse Bedeutung, obwohl Buddha nie über eine solche Feier gelehrt hat. Diese Unterschiede reichen von den oberflächlichen Traditionen bis zum soteriologischen Kern der Religion. Die Theravada-Buddhistengemeinde – sowohl aus monastischer als auch aus der Sicht der Laien – hat ihre dogmatischen Grundsätze im Laufe der Zeit ändern müssen. Dies kann auf Kräfte sowohl aus der Außenwelt als auch aus dem Inneren zurückgeführt werden, sowohl feindlich als auch freundlich.\n\nEs gibt eine Anzahl von Qualifikationsbegriffen, die diese Diskussion häufig verwenden wird. Es gibt den Begriff des Inneren versus Außen. Hier ist eine innere Kraft definiert als eine Kraft, die von Mitgliedern der Buddhasasana geboren wird, unabhängig von der monastischen Status. Eine äußere Kraft ist jede Kraft von Nicht-Buddhisten. Eine feindliche Kraft ist jede Kraft, die die buddhistische Gemeinschaft schädigt oder beabsichtigt, sie zu schädigen, – eine Kraft, die von einem negativen Verständnis des Buddhismus geboren wird. Eine gnädige Kraft ist eine Kraft, die nicht beabsichtigt, die buddhistische Gemeinschaft zu schädigen oder zu helfen – obwohl sie es letztendlich tun könnte, als Nebenprodukt. Diese Begriffe werden wiederholt während dieser Diskussion auftauchen.\n\nZunächst ist es wichtig, die Grundlagen der Religion zu erkunden – die Lehren, die im Kern des Theravada-Buddhismus liegen. Buddhisten suchen Zuflucht beim Doppelguten des Buddha, dem Dhamma und der Sangha. Das Dhamma besteht im Wesentlichen aus dem Tripitaka – den drei Schalen – des buddhistischen Textes. Der Sutta-Pitaka enthält alle Suttas, der Vinaya-Pitaka enthält die Disziplinregeln, und der Abhidhamma-Pitaka enthält die metaphysischen Bestandteile des Buddhismus. Die metaphysischen Vorstellungen bestehen aus Dingen wie Anatta – kein Selbst, Dukkha – inhärente Leiden in dem Leben, und Anicca – Unveränderlichkeit von allem. Nur durch die Anerkennung dieser Konzepte kann man Sansara, den Kreislauf von Tod und Wiedergeburt, beenden, der fortbesteht. Neben Sansara wird auch lobha – Verlangen, dosa – Hass, und moha – Trug – enden, wenn man erleuchtet wird. Im Vinaya-Pitaka werden Regeln für das Leben festgelegt. Für Laien gibt es fünf Gebote (Ich werde nicht töten, Ich werde nicht lügen, Ich werde nicht stehlen, Ich werde mich nicht sexuell unanständig verhalten, und Ich werde keine berauschenden Substanzen zu mir nehmen). Für Mönche gibt es viele mehr Disziplinregeln, die zu befolgen sind. Das grundlegendste dogmatische Konzept im Buddhismus ist das Konzept der vier edlen Wahrheiten. Erstens, Dukkha; die Wahrheit, dass das Leben Leiden ist. Zweitens, dass Anhaftung Leiden verursacht. Drittens, dass Leiden überwunden werden kann.\n\nNow, I will translate the German text back to English:\n\n[REWRITE] In about the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born.

(Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

Der Höhepunkt dieser Rivalität war der mexikanisch-amerikanische Krieg von 1846-1848, in dem die Vereinigten Staaten Mexiko angriffen und besiegten und sich Texas und den amerikanischen Südwesten als neues Territorium sicherten.  Viele andere Konflikte zwischen den beiden Nationen fanden statt, und sie verebbten schließlich kurz vor dem Ersten Weltkrieg.  Die Rivalität begann, als Amerikaner und Mexikaner auf wichtige Fragen wie Religion, Kultur und Tradition kollidierten und einen großen Konflikt um materielles Interesse (Schmitt 1974 S. 30-31) hatten.\n\nDies ähnelt vielen anderen Nationen, die eine andauernde Rivalität mit einem Nachbarn haben.  Nationen, die eine gemeinsame Grenze haben, neigen dazu, Interessengegensätze zu haben, die zu der Schaffung von Rivalitätspositionen zwischen den Nationen führen.  Die Vereinigten Staaten und Mexiko sind nicht unähnlich vielen anderen andauernden Rivalitäten zwischen Nationen, die eine gemeinsame Grenze haben.  David M. Pletcher (1977) erklärt, dass \"Nur in Mexiko und Kuba kann man lange anhaltende übergeordnete amerikanische diplomatische Probleme finden\" (S. 41).  Tatsächlich sind beide Nationen geografisch nahe bei den Vereinigten Staaten und haben die Vereinigten Staaten als Rivalen, während andere Nationen in Lateinamerika gute Beziehungen mit den Vereinigten Staaten haben.\n\nReligiöse Fragen schufen einen Riss zwischen den beiden Nationen, ein Problem, das viele Nationen durch die Geschichte heimgesucht hat.  Sally Frahm (2001) erklärt, dass \"wenn Amerikaner im 20. Jahrhundert dem Faschismus und dem Kommunismus entgegentraten, im 18. und 19. Jahrhundert dem Katholizismus und der Monarchie\" (S. 86).  Nicht anders als die Rivalität des Kalten Krieges zwischen den Vereinigten Staaten und der Sowjetunion war die Rivalität zwischen den Vereinigten Staaten und Mexiko eine ideologische Auseinandersetzung und eine Konkurrenz um Interessen, die jede Nation für lebenswichtig hielt.  In diesem Fall waren jedoch die ideologischen Auseinandersetzungen nicht auf die politische Struktur, sondern auf die religiösen Vorlieben der Vereinigten Staaten und Mexikos begründet.  Diese Misstrauen wuchs aus dem Misstrauen zwischen den Engländern und den Spaniern.  Die Erbschaft dieser Gefühle des Misstrauens von ihren ehemaligen Kolonialherren war ein großer Hinderungsgrund für die Einrichtung freundlicher Außenbeziehungen zwischen den Vereinigten Staaten und Mexiko.\n\nDiehl und Goerts (2000) listen 17 Streitigkeiten zwischen Mexiko und den Vereinigten Staaten während der 57-jährigen Rivalitätshistorie auf.  Die Mehrheit der Streitigkeiten zwischen der Rivalität beschrieben von Diehl und Goerts sind territoriale Fragen, die mit Überfällen von mexikanischem Gebiet in die Vereinigten Staaten und anderen Grenzproblemen zusammenhängen.  Überfälle von Banditen und Outlaws von amerikanischen Grenzsiedlungen waren ein großes Problem, das bis zu dem Zeitpunkt dauerte, an dem sowohl die Vereinigten Staaten als auch Mexiko ihre Grenzen mit militärischer Gewalt sicherten (Schmitt 1974 S. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) erklärt, dass die Rivalität zwischen den beiden Nationen begann, als \"Mexiko sich offensichtlich von den Vereinigten Staaten in einem erheblichen Maße abhängig machte\" (S. 109) und schließlich endete, als die amerikanischen Ambitionen \"sich von territorialer Expansion zu wirtschaftlicher Intervention in Mexiko änderten\" (S. 110) im späten 19.

Ich hatte meine Beruf gewählt, weil ich einen tief verwurzelten Bedarf nach Sicherheit und Stabilität hatte, die ich als Kind nicht hatte. „Du wirst immer Arbeit finden‭; ‬Leute werden immer krank‭. ‬was der Mantra war, den ich in meiner Adoleszenz und darüber hinaus hörte.

Bis heute bin ich behindert,‭ ‬und nach‭ ‬15‭ ‬Jahren von der Sozialhilfe für behinderte Menschen lebe ich tatsächlich ohne ein einziges Ding, das ich als ‚Meiniges‘ bezeichnen kann‭. ‬Ich komme zurecht,‭ ‬aber jeden Tag ist ein Kampf und ein Angriff auf meine Sicherheit,‭ ‬meine Sicherheit und mein Selbstwertgefühl. Nichts in meinem Leben ist mehr sicher,‭ ‬doch ich weiß eines zu wissen zu sein. Ich könnte diese Jahre nicht überstanden haben,‭ ‬wenn ich nicht die Hilfe meiner Familie und ein paar guter Freunde erhalten hätte,‭ ‬egal wie stark ich war. Und glaube mir,‭ ‬wenn ein echter Notfall eintritt,‭ ‬fühlt man sich gar nicht sehr stark.\n\nMeine Aussage ist, dass es in Leben immer wieder Notfälle geben wird –‭ ‬groß und klein. Es gibt keine Garantien und unabhängig davon,‭ ‬wie gut man sich vorbereitet,‭ ‬manche Dinge sind einfach zu groß, um sie allein zu bewältigen.\n\nIch stimme vollkommen zu, dass wir in den USA aufhören sollten, all unsere Eier in den ‚Behälter des großen Regierung‘ zu legen‭; ‬der ist ohnehin altmodisch und bröckelt zusammen. Auch ich würde mich sehr wünschen, dass Amerikaner wieder lernen, sich gegenseitig zu vertrauen und sich gegenseitig zu helfen, anstatt sich allein in den Garten zu schleichen und Falloutschutzschutzhütten zu bauen.\n\nDie Konservativen in den USA sprechen davon, dass das ‚rücksichtslose Individualismus‭' ‬gebaut habe, der dieses Land gebaut habe;‭ ‬aber in Wirklichkeit war es nicht der rücksichtslose Individualismus, der unsere Vorfahren in Zeiten der Not voran trieb, sondern Mitgefühl, gegenseitiger Respekt und der Austausch von Ressourcen. Die Pioniere, die die Rocky Mountains mit Wagen zogen, kamen nicht am anderen Ende an, indem sie es alleine schafften.\n\nAlso,‭ ‬bereitet euch vor. Ich bin auch vorbereitet. Ich habe ein Notfallkoffer,‭ ‬Erste-Hilfe-Kits,‭ ‬Wasserreinigungstabletten und Plastikfolie und Klebeband für die Fenster im Fall eines biologischen Angriffs. Ich habe mehrere Taschenlampen und jede Menge Batterien,‭ ‬viele Kerzen und wasserdichte Streichhölzer und Konserve. Wenn‭ ‬du das Land und die Ressourcen für ein kleines Bauernhaus und die Fähigkeit hast, dein eigenes Essen zu konservieren oder zu konservieren,‭ ‬tue es.

Gibt es Einschränkungen oder Beschränkungen, die die Richtung des evolutionären Wandels beeinflussen? Obwohl D'Arcy Thompson 1917 behauptete, dass der Zoologe \"gerade noch begonnen hat, in mathematischer Sprache sogar die einfachsten organischen Formen zu definieren\", kann man das heute noch sagen. Vor kurzem wurde mathematische Modellierung auf allgemeine Aspekte der Molluskenskeletogenese durch Ontogenese und Phylogenese angewendet (z.B. Raup und Stanley, 1981). Unsere Studie untersucht, wie die mathematische Modellierung des Ontogenetischen und Phylogenetischen Wandels in Prunum in Kombination mit experimentellen Studien verwendet werden kann, um die beteiligten Mechanismen an der Richtung und Größe des evolutionären-entwicklungsbedingten Wandels zu klären. Wir verwendeten Röntgenbildern von Prunum-Arten, um quantitative Parameter zu definieren, die dann in das Software-Programm CerioShell (Stone, 1995) eingegeben werden konnten. Wir modellierten hypothetische Schalenmorphologien, die zur Interpretation der Grenzen möglicher morphologischer Veränderungen in Prunum verwendet werden konnten. Diese Ergebnisse werden mit experimentellen und deskriptiven Studien kombiniert, um die makroevolutionären Ereignisse in dieser Klade besser zu verstehen.\n\nEine Schale kann als Struktur betrachtet werden, die sich als Rohr durch Zeit und Raum von 360 Grad zu bewegt. Diese Revolutionen oder Umdrehungen einer gewundenen Schale werden als Whorls bezeichnet, die sich um einen imaginären zentralen Achse drehten. Diese Achse verläuft durch die mittlere Säule der Schale und wird als Columella bezeichnet. Die Geschwindigkeit, mit der sich die Whorls erweitern, kann variieren, und eine kontinuierliche Linie trennt jede Whorl und wird als Sutura bezeichnet. In den meisten Schalen ist die größte Whorl der Schale die letzte Whorl (Körperwhorl). Der Sporn wird als alle Whorls außer der letzten betrachtet. Das Apex ist der Spitze des Sporns und das gegenüberliegende Ende wird als Basis bezeichnet. Das Tier verlängert sich aus seiner Schale durch eine Öffnung, die Öffnung genannt wird.\n\nSchalen können in apikalen, basal, apertural und abaperturalen Ansichten betrachtet werden. (Die \"übliche\" Orientierung einer Schale ist eine aperturale Ansicht, mit der Öffnung zum Betrachter gerichtet und mit der Spitze nach oben.) \n\nEin Methoden zur Zählung von Whorls ist unten zu sehen. Zunächst sollte die Schale von der apikalen Ansicht betrachtet werden und dann sollte bestimmt werden, wo die erste Sutura beginnt.

Whorls werden von dieser Linie gezählt und auf eine Viertel einer Whorl geschätzt.\n\nEine Schale kann als eine Serie von Öffnungen betrachtet werden, die sich durch Zeit und Raum bewegt, während das Tier seine Schale aufbaut (i.e. akkumuliert). Es ist möglich, den Pfad der Öffnung mittels Koordinaten der Mitte jeder Whorls-Öffnung sowie der horizontalen und vertikalen Radius der Öffnung zu verfolgen.\n\nDiese Trajektorie kann grafisch und mathematisch dargestellt werden.

    "original": "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",

Die vielfachen Gründe für diese Mängel werden unten diskutiert, und weisen darauf hin, dass die Gesundheitssystem zu stärken, anstatt sich auf programmatische Interventionen zu konzentrieren, erforderlich ist.\n\nIndonesien hat Verbesserungen in der Anzahl der Geburten mit einem qualifizierten Gesundheitspersonal vor Ort erzielt, mit 72% der Geburten, die diese Ziel erreichen.  Aber gesagt zu werden, dass diese Kategorie immer noch traditionelle Helfer, wie Hebammen, einschließt, die medizinische Interventionen nicht liefern können, sollten die Schwangerschaft kompliziert sein (deshalb die große Quote der durch Blutung verursachten Muttertodesfälle).  Anders ausgedrückt, die Verbesserungen in diesem bestimmten Indikator sind etwas irreführend und es bleibt noch viel zu tun.  Darüber hinaus ist es zu einem Rückgang der Prozentsätze von Diarrhöenkrisen bei Kindern zwischen fünf Jahren gekommen, die von einem Gesundheitspersonal behandelt werden.  Während die Daten über die postnatale Pflege unvollständig sind, ist es klar, dass dieses Gebiet auch von Bedenken geprägt ist, mit niedrigen Raten überall im Land.\n\nDie Kaiserschnitt-Raten sind immer noch niedriger als zu erwarten, um die 4%.  Die Kaiserschnitt-Raten deuten auch auf ein anderes besorgniserregendes Problem hin.  Während die Rate der Kaiserschnitte 7% in städtischen Gebieten beträgt, beträgt sie nur 2% in ländlichen Gebieten.  Dies zeigt die Problematik der Gleichheit der Abdeckung im ganzen Land.  Offensichtlich wird der Zugang zu Gesundheitsdiensten um die städtischen Gebiete herum konzentriert.  Ein anderes Zugangsthema ist die vertikale Gleichheit.  Es besteht ein 27%iger Unterschied in der Nutzung von Diensten zwischen den ärmsten und reichsten Quintilen.  Offensichtlich haben die Armen es wesentlich schwieriger, Gesundheitsdienste in Anspruch zu nehmen, wahrscheinlich wegen der Ausgaben aus eigener Tasche.\n\nBei der Diskussion der nächsten Schritte zur Verbesserung der neonatalen und kindlichen Pflegeindikatoren ist die grundlegende Frage, wie der Mangel an Leistungen am effektivsten anzugehen ist.  Speziell sollte Indonesien programmspezifische Ansätze entwickeln oder das Gesundheitssystem allgemein stärken, ohne sich auf die Vorsorge und Nachsorge für die Mutter und das Kind zu konzentrieren.  Es besteht kein Zweifel, dass programmangetierte Ansätze, um die Probleme oben zu lösen, attraktiv sind.  Nicht nur haben \"vertikale Ansätze\", die sich auf ein Sektorenbereich der Verbesserungen richten, sehr viel spezifischere, handhabbare Ziele und produzieren allgemein schnellere Ergebnisse.  Es gibt jedoch einige Nachteile, die berücksichtigt werden müssen.  Ein Hauptnachteil ist, dass der starke Einsatz von Programmierungen für einen bestimmten Bereich der Gesundheitssektor bedeutet, dass der Finanzierung für andere Bereiche leidet und die Personalressourcen sich in Richtung der Bereiche bewegen, die mehr Ressourcen haben (der Effekt der internationalen Finanzierung der HIV/AIDS und deren Effekt auf die Familienplanung ist ein Beispiel).  Darüber hinaus führt die Durchführung mehrerer parallel laufender Programme für einen Bereich zu einer Duplikation von Diensten, die auch zwischen den Programmen nicht koordiniert sind.  Dies führt zu einer Zunahme an Formularen und Papierkram für Materialien und Finanzierung.\n\nThe German translation back to English:\n\n[REWRITE] The rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\nIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words, the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\nCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\nIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do \"vertical approaches\" that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. [/REWRITE]",

    "raw_output": "Here's the translation to German and then back to English:\n\nEnglish to German:\n\nDie victorianischen Romane werden durch ihre überwältigende Aufmerksamkeit auf Details und ihren Fokus auf die Aristokratie der Zeit gekennzeichnet.  Zwei Romane, die als victorianisch gelten, aber von dieser Tradition abweichen, sind Oliver Twist und Wuthering Heights.  Beide Romane verwenden ein Element der Geheimnis und ein Hauch für das Bizarre, das untypisch für die Romane der Zeit ist, was die Charaktere innerhalb jeder Arbeit stärkt; sie liefern Einblicke, die anhand ihrer Motive und Emotionen erläutern.  \n\n\"Und jetzt kamen Haufen verwirrender und verwirrender Ideen auf ihn ein, was in seinem Kopf zog.  Es schien, als ob er immer noch zwischen Sikes und Crackit ging, die sich heftig stritten: die Worte, die sie sagten, klangen in seinen Ohren, und wenn er seine Aufmerksamkeit erhaschte, ... er fand heraus, dass er mit ihnen sprach....  Plötzlich trat er zurück, als er das Geräusch von Schüssen hörte; und es stieg laut und schrill in die Luft, und alle war Lärm und Tumult, als eine unsichtbare Hand ihn eilig forttrug.  Durch all diese schnellen Visionen lief eine unbestimmte, unbehagliche Bewusstsein von Schmerz, das ihn ständig quälte und marterte.\" \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n Die beiden Romane nutzen diese Geheimnis oft durch Traumsequenzen oder traumhafte Zustände, obwohl der Inhalt und die Funktion variiert in jedem bestimmten Fall.  In Oliver Twist offenbaren diese seltsamen Vorgänge oft Einblicke hinsichtlich Oliviers innerer Schichten, was ihn schmerzt, und seine Kenntnis über die wahre Natur der Dinge, die sich um ihn herum ereignen.  Wenn der Schuss auf Oliver schließlich in Kapitel 28 wiederholt wird, erlebt Oliver die Schüsse lebhaft, als ob in einem Traum, während er sich bemüht, Hilfe zu finden (siehe links).  Der Abschnitt betont die fehlende Kontrolle, die Oliver über die Ereignisse hatte, die sich ereigneten, sowie die leidvolle Situation, die seine Gesundheit erreicht hatte, die stark durch Oliviers Halluzinationen von Sikes und Crackit präsent war.  Der Schuss selbst überwältigte ihn, alle seine Sinne waren betäubt, da er den \"unsichtbaren Hand\" nicht bemerkte, die ihn forttrug; er erlebte seine Verzweiflung erneut entfernt von dem Schock des Schmerzes, da der Schmerz jetzt konstant war und mit Angst verbunden war, anstatt mit Überraschung.  Da Oliver überwältigt war, stellt sich die Frage, wessen Wille sein Unglück herbeiführte, denn es war jedenfalls nicht sein eigener.  Dieser Schuss verstärkt den Eindruck, dass Oliver über nichts Kontrolle hat, weil er sich nicht einmal bemüht, etwas über den Ausgang eines Ereignisses zu kontrollieren, selbst wenn sein Leben in Gefahr ist.  Ein wachsendes Gefühl der Niederlage in Oliver wird auch angedeutet, als ob alter Fagin ihn begann, ihn zu brechen, ihn zur Annahme dieser Verzweiflung zu zwingen, die seine Fähigkeit, zu reagieren, beeinflusste.  Andernfalls könnte angenommen werden, dass Oliver hätte wenigstens einen Versuch unternommen, zumindest für den eigenen Lebenssatz.\n\n\"Der Tag ging vorüber – Tag!  Es gab keinen Tag; er war schon wieder gegangen, als er kam – und der Abend kam wieder, der Abend so lang, und dennoch so kurz; lang in seiner furchtbaren Stille und kurz in seinen flüchtigen Stunden.\n\nGerman to English:\n\n[REWRITE]The Victorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.

Ich tat mein Bestes, um ihnen bei den Fächern zu helfen, in denen sie Schwierigkeiten hatten, aber meine Stärken lagen im Englisch und in der Lesefähigkeit. Ich wurde von einer der Lehrerinnen angeworben, um einen jungen Jungen namens Adrian zu helfen, der eine große Schwierigkeit mit dem Lesen hatte (ich glaube, er war im dritten oder vierten Schuljahr). Mir dämmerte es langsam, dass etwas nicht stimmt; er hatte die merkwürdigsten Probleme. Einige Buchstaben verstand er, wie sie auszusprechen waren, andere nicht einmal, es war das seltsamste. Genau wie ich wusste, dass er von lateinamerikanischer Abstammung war, sprach er aber perfektes Englisch. Wir kämpften, bis ich seine Mutter traf. Ich half dabei, ein paar Kinder zu betreuen (wir haben hier keinen besseren Ausdruck), während der Rest der Schule einen Ausflug unternahm, als seine Mutter hereinkam. Seine Mutter sprach kein Wort Englisch, nur Spanisch. Mit meiner sehr schlechten Kenntnis des Spanischen (ich lernte es gerade erst) konnten wir uns irgendwie verständigen. Es war in diesem Moment, als mir wie ein Schlag ins Gesicht kam: Adrian konnte gut lesen, er wusste nur nicht gut das englische Alphabet. Ich weiß nicht, ob diese Erkenntnis ihm jemals half, aber ich hoffe, dass er jetzt besser ist.\n\nIch erzähle diese Geschichte, um mich auf das Problem der Sprachbarriere in den Schulen zu konzentrieren, besonders in Kalifornien. Ich erzähle sie auch, um zu beweisen, dass es nicht immer so offensichtlich ist, wie wir denken. Selbst bei einem Kind, das perfektes Englisch spricht, kann das Lesen noch ein enormer Hindernislauf sein. Ich denke, dass jeder zustimmen kann, dass dieses Problem existiert, also was tun wir? In Adrians Fall war die Lösung ziemlich einfach: ein Tutorium in englischer Lesefähigkeit, insbesondere des Alphabets und der Aussprache. Aber für die vielen Kinder, die fast kein Englisch sprechen, ist die Lösung viel komplexer. Es gibt keine einzigartige Antwort. Das Doppelprogramm, die Mainstream-Immersion, private Tutoren, ESL-Klassen, keines davon wird das Problem alleine lösen. Die Lösung liegt darin, alle oben genannten Dinge zu kombinieren!\n\nZuerst muss man sagen, dass das Doppelprogramm eine großartige Idee ist. Nicht nur für Kinder, deren erste Sprache Spanisch ist, sondern für alle Kinder. Kinder in zweiwegigen bilingualen Bildungsprogrammen haben nachgewiesen, dass sie akademisch besser abschneiden. Viele Ängste umgeben diese Idee, dass es ein Verschwendung von Ressourcen ist und dass die meisten Kinder in der Schule keine Vorteile daraus ziehen werden. Das ist falsch. Wenn wir dieses Art von Programmen in den Klassenzimmern als Regel, nicht als Ausnahme anwenden würden, würden sich alle Kinder davon profitieren. Wie geht man damit um? Sollen wir alle Lehrer bilingual sein? Nein, das wäre unvernünftig und unrealistisch. Aber ich denke, dass es keinen Grund gibt, warum wir nicht spezielle Hilfskräfte, Tutoren, wie man sie nennen will, haben können, die bilingual sind.\n\nNow, I will translate the German text back to English:\n\n[REWRITE] A few years ago, I worked in an after-school program teaching elementary school students.

Er hatte sich in den letzten Monaten abgemagert, und seine Kleidung hing matt von seinem Körper. Sein Haar war weniger geworden, dünner als ich mich erinnerte. Er starrte weiterhin in den Regen, vermied Augenkontakt. Ich fühlte mich allein, Angst und unfähig, mit meinem Vater darüber zu sprechen, wie sehr ich ihn vermissen würde, denn darüber zu sprechen würde es nur realer machen für uns beide.

    "raw_output": "Deutsche Version:\n\nDer traditionelle \"Gothic Novel\" ist in Substanz und Name ein \"Oxymoron für 'Alt-Neu'\", wie Ian Watt es in The Rise of the Gothic Novel beschreibt. Der gothische Modus wurde verrissen, gelobt, für die mangelnde Tiefe beschuldigt und für das 'schreckliche Sublime' gelobt, das er zu evokieren schien (Burke).  Das Original \"Gothic Novel\", Horace Walpoles The Castle of Otranto, verwendete die Ideen beider \"alten\" und \"moderner\" Romane, um die proto-Gothische Gattung zu schaffen und eine neue Methode der literarischen Ausdrucksform zu schaffen. Walpole nutzte \"alte\" Theaterelemente und 'neue' Nachahmung der Natur in 'modernen' Romanen, um, wie er es \"A Gothic Story\" nennt, was zu präsentieren (Walpole 4). Der Gothic-Genre verwendet viele Reminiscenzen an mittelalterliche gotische Theater, Architektur und Traditionen.  Als The Castle of Otranto veröffentlicht wurde, war das Wort \"gothisch\" bereits verwendet worden, um viele verschiedene Völker, Stile und Zeitperioden zu beschreiben. Es wurde als archaisch oder unsophistiziert empfunden in Anbetracht der \"modernen\" gesellschaftlichen und literarischen \"Fortschritte\". Die Kombination aus dem mehr theatralischen \"Gothic\" und der neuen Format des Romans (erlaubt dem Leser einen persönlicheren Blick in die Psychologie der Charaktere) ist es, was es ermöglicht, dass das Gothic so lange anhalten kann und für einen Leser, der in der Zeit weit entfernt von der ursprünglichen Schrift geschrieben ist, wieder einmal veraltet und neu erscheint.\n\nEinige der wichtigsten gothischen Ideen, die in den Gothic-Novellen präsent sind, ist das Konzept der Ritterlichkeit. Die mittelalterliche Idee der Ritterlichkeit, das Prozedere zur Ausbildung eines richtigen Ritters, wird sowohl in der ursprünglichen Gothic Novel, The Castle of Otranto, beibehalten und transformiert. Ritterlichkeit ist besonders für gothische Schriftsteller wichtig wegen dessen, was sie darstellte – der klassische Ritter, tapfer, ehrenhaft, kompetent – und der vermuteten oder wahrgenommenen Mangel an diesem Ideal, den diese Schriftsteller (insbesondere Walpole) in Gesellschaft sahen. Durch die Verwendung der ritterlichen Konzepte und Manieren wird der \"gotische Vergangenheit\" idealisiert und romantisiert (deutend auf die zukünftige Entwicklung von Gothic zu Romantik) und wird verwendet, um die Gegenwart zu verbessern. Walpole war, als er The Castle of Otranto schrieb, inmitten einer politisch unruhigen Zeit und war verzweifelt über die mögliche Zukunft. Er, in Politik eingetaucht und (diskutabel) ungerechte Vorwürfe ausgesetzt, mag begonnen haben, sogar wenn nicht explizit, anzunehmen, dass die vermeintliche Moral und die angeborene \"Gute\" in den Menschen, die in der gothischen Epoche präsent waren, auf jene, die die \"Gegenwart\" ausmachten, in irgendeiner Weise verloren gegangen seien. In seiner Schrift wird dieser Begriff in mehreren Charakteren klar sichtbar, ein solcher Charakter ist Frederic. Der Leser kann, bevor er Frederic trifft, sehen, dass er viele ritterliche Züge aufweist, er ist, vor allem, ein Fürst, er hat gelitten, wurde angemessen von Tragödie betroffen, die er verlässt und wird derzeit angenommen, durch Ungläubige getötet zu sein. Die Figur des \"galanten und höflichen Ritters\" ist, naturgemäß, übertrieben, die bald zu sein, Gothic-Trope der Exzess bringt in Spiel (66).\n\n[REWRITE] \nThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and name, an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel.

The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",

Das Konzept der Supply-Chain-Management wurde 1982 von Keith Oliver, einem Berater, erfunden. Keith Oliver beschrieb den Gesamtprozess der Planung, Umsetzung und Kontrolle von Prozessen in der Lieferkette, um die Bedürfnisse der Kunden schnell und effizient zu erfüllen. Es gibt sechs Schlüsselfaktoren für eine Supply-Chain: Produktion, Versorgung, Lagerbestand, Standort, Transport und Information. Unternehmen nutzen diese sechs Schlüsselfaktoren, um dem Kunden die beste Kundenservice zu bieten.\n\nDie Produktion ist der erste Schritt im Supply-Chain-Prozess. Die Produktion bildet die Grundlage für den gesamten Supply-Chain-Prozess. Die Produktionstage werden die Zeit, den Grund, den Ort und die Methode beschreiben, wie alles produziert wird. Manager müssen wissen, was Kunden wollen. Um Manager wissen zu lassen, was Kunden wollen, können Manager den Markt untersuchen. Der Markt ist der größte Indikator, um zu bestimmen, was die Kunden fordern. Sobald Manager den Markt analysiert haben und die Kundenbedürfnisse verstanden, sind sie bereit, zu entscheiden, welche Produkte hergestellt werden sollen und wie viele von diesen Produkten hergestellt werden sollen. Nachdem die Leitung entschieden hat, was produziert werden soll und wie viel davon, sind sie bereit, zu entscheiden, wo die Produkte hergestellt werden sollen und welcher Standort am besten für die Menge und Qualität der Produkte ist, wobei die Kundenerwartungen und -zufriedenheit berücksichtigt werden müssen.\n\nNachdem der Standort für die Produktion der Produkte entschieden wurde, geht der nächste Schritt darin daran, dass Manager sich auf die Terminplanung und die Wartung der Maschinen konzentrieren. Die Produktion ist ein sehr wichtiger Schritt im Supply-Chain-Prozess. Jede Details ist im gesamten Prozess entscheidend. Wenn jede Details nicht entsprechend geplant wird, kann dies dem Unternehmen in der langfristigen Perspektive viel Zeit und Geld kosten. Zum Beispiel arbeitete ich in Wal-Mart und Target-Einzelhandelsgeschäften. Beide Unternehmen haben eine Konzeption, ein Buch und einen Prozess für jede Einheit des Unternehmens. Es gibt einen geplanten Aufbau, wie ein Arbeitnehmer-Outfit aussehen sollte, die Empfang von Sendungen aus LKWs. Durch geplante Prozesse kann ein Unternehmen reibungslos arbeiten, ohne Verwirrung über Richtung und Erwartungen.\n\nDas zweite Schlüsselfaktor in der Supply-Chain-Management ist die Versorgung. Die Versorgung wird als strategische Entscheidungen definiert, die gefällt werden müssen, um die Kernkompetenzen einer Einrichtung zu bestimmen und Partnerschaften mit externen Unternehmen aufzubauen. Ein Unternehmen kann viele verschiedene Produktionsabteilungen für ein einzelnes Produkt haben. Jede Abteilung besteht aus verschiedenen Geräten, Arbeitern und Spezialisten. Der Manager muss entscheiden, welche Abteilung am besten für die verschiedenen Prozesse des Produkts geeignet ist. Die Führungskraft kann auch entscheiden, die Arbeit an andere Unternehmen auszulagern. Der Hauptgrund, warum ein Manager die Arbeit an Unternehmen auslagert, ist es, Geschwindigkeit zu erzielen. Geschwindigkeit ist die Fähigkeit, Qualität und Flexibilität zu bieten, während gleichzeitig Kosten reduziert oder niedrige Kosten gehalten werden.\n\nEnglish Translation (rewritten):\n\n[REWRITE] Supply Chain Management is the flow of processes for transporting goods from customer orders through the raw materials stage, supplier management, production, and product distribution to the customer.

Birma, auch bekannt als Myanmar, ist ein südostasiatisches Land, das von einer tyrannischen Militärjunta regiert wird, die 1962 durch einen Putsch an die Macht kam. Im Jahr 2007 fanden eine Reihe von Straßenprotesten statt, die erste öffentlichen Proteste in einer Dekade. Anführer dieser Proteste waren eine große Anzahl von burmesischen Mönchen, die der \"Saffron Revolution\" den Namen gaben, benannt nach der Farbe ihrer Roben. Nach den ersten wenigen Aufständen begann das Publikum großes Interesse an den Protesten zu zeigen, und während die burmesische Regierung den Mönchen zunächst zögerlich erlaubte, friedliche Versammlungen abzuhalten, eskalierte die Gewalt bald in einen Krieg zwischen den Mönchen und der Militärjunta, mit der Militär, die aktiv in Klöster im ganzen Land einfielen und plünderten. Ausländische Journalisten wurden auf der Stelle verhaftet und eingesperrt, und ein japanischer Fotojournalist namens Kenji Nagai wurde am 27. September 2007 getötet, nur weil er an einem Straßenprotest anwesend war. Während die amtliche Todeszahlen bei 13 betragen, ist Colonel Hla Win, der vor der offiziellen Meldung einige Tage vorher desertiert war, zitiert als Gesagt, „Viele mehr Menschen wurden in den letzten Tagen getötet als Sie gehört haben. Die Leichen können in mehreren Tausend gezählt werden.\"\n\nDas ist nichts Neues. Während dies einige der jüngsten Beispiele für die Vorfälle in unserer Welt sind, hat das Bekenntnis einer Regierung, Widerstand zu unterdrücken und ihre Bürger zu beherrschen, seit Beginn der Zivilisation existiert. Die frühen römischen Kaiser erklärten sich selbst als von den Göttern auserwählt, um über jedes Aspekt ihrer Gesellschaft zu herrschen. Die japanischen Kaiser werden tatsächlich für Götter gehalten, die in unser Welt geschickt wurden, um ihr Volk durch die Erfindung von Motorola-Mobiltelefonen und Hara-Kiri zu Kultur zu bringen, und unser gegenwärtige Präsident, George W. Bush, hat wöchentliche Konferenzen mit Ted Haggard, dem Führer von World Stupid People, einem Tochterunternehmen der Republikanischen Partei.\n\nEinige der bekanntesten Beispiele dieser Aktionen sind solche Ereignisse wie der 4. Juni 1989 Protest in Tiananmen-Platz, an dem Intellektuelle, Gewerkschafter und Studenten zusammenkamen, um gegen die autoritäre Herrschaft der Regierung zu protestieren. Die Todeszahlen in diesem Fall reichen von offiziellen Berichten der chinesischen Regierung, die 200-300 Tote meldeten, bis hin zu Berichten der chinesischen Roten Kreuz, die zwischen 2.000-3.000 Tote meldeten. Ein weiteres Beispiel ist der Rutshengenozid der 1990er, bei dem Hutu-Militärgemeinschaften, unterstützt durch die Regierung Ruandas, einen systematischen Mord an allen Tutsi und politischen Moderaten begannen, unabhängig von ihren ethnischem Hintergrund. Hitlers 'Drittes Reich', ein Zeitraum von mehreren Jahren und mehreren Ländern, in dem alle Juden, die ihre Hintergrund hatten, eingefangen und getötet wurden, ist ein weiteres extrem Beispiel.\n\nBack to English:\n\n[REWRITE] Hitler is alive in Burma, as a sign says.\n\nEllen Page, the star of Juno, stands alone on a corner of a street with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with a Sharpie onto her sign.

    "original": "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

    "raw_output": "Hier ist die deutsche Übersetzung des gegebenen Textes:\n\nDuke Ellingtons Nachlass im Jazz entsteht in großem Maße aus seiner Lebensdauer und, umgekehrt, seiner kreativen Fähigkeit, sein Orchester zu formen. Ellingtons Präsenz am Piano ist in vielen der für diese Übung ausgewählten Kompositionen subtil, aber als Komponist zeigte er sich hervorragend in der Schaffung von reichen und komplexen Stücken, die die individuellen Fähigkeiten der Bandmitglieder hervorheben. Ellington gestaltete den Rahmen, in dem ein Solist frei improvisieren konnte, sowie geschriebene Stücke und Phrasen, die auf den besonderen Stil der Bandmitglieder abzielten, um musikalische Ideen zu betonen. Bei diesem Vorgehen betonte er auch den Ton des Orchesters im Allgemeinen, indem er kohärente und originelle Klangbilder für jedes Stück schuf. Ellingtons Meisterschaft bei der Steuerung des individuellen Klangs der Spieler sowie ihrer Positionierung innerhalb eines wachsenden Ensembles ermöglichte ihm, einige der innovativsten und brillantesten Stücke in der Jazzgeschichte zu schreiben.\n\nDas Grove Music Lexikon, in seiner Diskussion über Ellingtons Klang und Innovation, erwähnt Creole Love Call in Bezug auf die Verwendung von \"Stimme als Jazzinstrument\" während seiner Karriere. Dies ist ein frühes Beispiel für Ellingtons Verwendung der Stimme, um Texturen und Farben hinzuzufügen, ohne durch die Hemmschwelle von Texten behindert zu werden. Creole Love Call zeigt auch Ellingtons Fähigkeit, den Stil seiner Solisten zu unterstützen, was sich während seiner Karriere deutlich zeigt. Diese langsam, überlegene zwölf-Takt-Blues-Komposition enthält sechs Chöre, nämlich:\n\nChorus 1: Ruf und Antwort zwischen Stimme und Querrahmen, wobei die Stimme zunächst glatt und melodisch beginnt und dann zu einem raueren Klang zu Beginn des Endes übergeht.\nChorus 2: Muteder Trompetensolo, das die Grundmelodie erweitert und mehrere erweiterte blaue Töne betont.\nChorus 3: Schwungvoller Klarinetten-Solo in einem hohen Register, begleitet von einem subtilen synkopierten Piano-Phrasen.\nChorus 4: Das gesamte Orchester echoht den ersten Chor mit einem Ruf und einer Antwort durch die Blech- und Querrahmen-Sektionen.\nChorus 5: Der klimaktische Chor des Stücks, wobei die Querrahmen nun den Ruf und die Antwort in einem hohen Register beginnen und von der Blech- und Rhythmusgruppe durch synkopierte Stop-Time unterlegt werden.\nChorus 6: Eine Rückkehr zur Struktur des ersten Chors, wobei Ruf und Antwort zwischen Stimme und Querrahmen stattfinden. In diesem Chor nimmt die Stimme den Klang des \"Growl\"-Technik an, solo wie ein Instrument.\nTag: Kurzer Tag, gefeiert durch einen vokalen Run und einen dissonanten Novitäten-Ende durch eine Trompete.\n\nEllingtons Verwendung der Stimme, um einem Dimension des Klangfarben-Tons zu diesem Stück hinzuzufügen, ist ein Beispiel für ein stilistisches Merkmal, das sich durch sein Werk zieht.\nIn Hot and Bothered, aufgenommen ein Jahr später, kombiniert Ellington seine Fähigkeit zur engeren Instrumentierung mit seinem Ohr für Klangfarben. Ein Ruf und ein Antwort-Phrasen zwischen \"Bubber\" Miley auf muted Trompete und Baby Cox's Scat-Singing verwendet die vokalen Elemente von Miley's Spiel und die instrumentalen Aspekte von Cox's Stimme, um ein reiches und komplementäres Klangbild zu schaffen. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) verlängert diese Ideen, da Ellington Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, einen Stammgast in Ellingtons Orchester, zu großem Erfolg verwendet, um die Melodie auf muted Trompete einzuführen.\n\n[REWRITE]\nDuke Ellington's legacy in jazz stems largely from his longevity and, by extension, his creative ability to shape his orchestra.

As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for herself, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch... sweetie, I... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a step stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.",

In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages.

    "raw_output": "The original text is translated to German as follows:\n\nIm Jahr 2007 geriet die Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika in eine finanzielle Krise. Die Arbeitslosigkeit stieg an, der Immobilienmarkt brach ein und viele der größten und wichtigsten Unternehmen Amerikas litten unter großer Not. Diese Wirtschaftskrise hält bis heute an, daher müssen wir die Frage stellen: Wie kam diese Krise zustand, und wie können wir sie stoppen? Kurz gesagt wurde die finanzielle Krise durch selbstsüchtige und naive politische Entscheidungen verursacht, die Banken und Unternehmen unter Druck setzten, Subprime-Kredite in eine bereits unzureichende und unerfahrene finanzielle Infrastruktur zu vergeben. Gleichzeitig wurden Fannie Mae (FNMA) und Freddie Mac (FHLMC) unter Druck gesetzt, diese Hypotheken zu unterwirten und sie in CDOs und CDS zu verpacken. Als die Gläubiger auf diese Kredite nicht zahlten, waren die Banken an Kapitalreserve knapp und übertrugen diesen Chaos auf die neu verpackten Hypotheken, die sie verkauft hatten, und auf die restliche Wirtschaft.\n\nDie finanzielle Krise hat ihre Wurzeln im Jahr 1999 der Clinton-Ära, als der Präsident sich um eine zweite Amtszeit bemühte. Er strebte danach, seine Popularität zu erhöhen. Um dies zu erreichen, lockerte die Clinton-Administration die Kreditbeschränkungen, was dem Subprime-Krisen sieben Jahre später den grimmen Vorhang vor die Bühne setzte. Steven Holmes von der New York Times berichtete 1999, dass Fannie Mae, das größte Unterstützer von Wohnhypotheken in dem Land, unter zunehmendem Druck von der Clinton-Administration stand, Hypotheken unter mittellosen und moderaten Einkommensgruppen zu vergeben und von Aktionären unter Druck stand, seine beeindruckende Gewinnwachstumsrendite aufrechtzuerhalten. Holmes ging weiter davon aus, dass die Konsequenzen dieser Maßnahmen die folgenden würden: „Aber die vom Staat subventionierte Corporation mag in einer Wirtschaftskrise Schwierigkeiten bekommen und muss ähnlich wie die Spar- und Darlehenskreditanstalt der 1980er Jahre in Schieflage geraten.“ Wie im Vorwort detailliert beschrieben wurde, und wie Holmes vorausgesagt hatte, werden unbedachte Kredite bestimmt zum Zusammenbruch der Wirtschaft führen.\n\nViele Faktoren trugen dazu bei, dass die Wirtschaft in einen Niedergang geriet, ein davon war die neue und komplexe Struktur der Hypotheken. Kreditverträge mit variabler Zinsen, Mortgage-Backed-Securities und collateralisierte Schuldverschreibungen (CDOs) wurden im Vorfeld der Krise weit verbreitet eingesetzt und dienten nur dazu, mehr Sektoren der Wirtschaft in den Immobilienmarkt einzubinden. Dies führte dazu, dass US-Haushalte und Finanzmärkte im Allgemeinen übermäßig Gott und Untergang in den Immobilienmarkt investierten, wodurch sie extrem anfällig für sogar kleine Preisänderungen wurden.\n\nTatsächlich brach die Immobilienblase, und die Banken, die diese Hypotheken-Securities gekauft hatten, wurden besudelt. Die fünf größten US-Investmentbanken zusammen meldeten 2007 insgesamt 4,1 Billionen Dollar an Hypothekendebit in Rechnung, was etwa 30% des US-Bruttoinlandsprodukts entspricht. Letztendlich wurden Bear Sterns und Merrill Lynch sehr günstig verkauft, Lehman Brothers wurde aufgelöst und Goldman Sachs und Morgan Stanley wurden gezwungen, sich zu kommerziellen Banken zu entwickeln und unter intensiver Regulierung zu stehen. Fannie und Freddie hatten 5 Billionen Dollar an Hypothekendebit und wurden im September 2008 unter die Regierungskontrolle gestellt.\n\nThe German translation is then translated back to English as follows:\n\n[REWRITE] In 2007, the United States of America fell into a financial crisis.

Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

Die Exposition ist das kleine Teufelchen auf deiner Schulter, das sagt, dass du die Geschichte loswerden solltest, um zu den guten Teilen (nicht zu verwechseln mit dem Teufel auf der anderen Schulter, der dir anraunt, dass du deiner Leser jede einzelne Details von jedem Charakter vorzuführen sollst).\n\nExposition bedeutet, der Leser zu sagen, was passiert ist, typischerweise in einfachen Prosa.  In Filmen passiert die Exposition, wenn ein Charakter einem anderen einen Kernladung von Information anträgt, ähnlich wie \"Der Rime des alten Seglers\".  In der Fiktion ist es der Autor, der die Geschichte erzählt.\n\nEin Beispiel ist an der Zeit.  Wenn du eine Geschichte liest, wirst du erzählt, dass die Heldin ihren geliebten an einem bestimmten Ort und zu einem bestimmten Zeitpunkt traf, dass sie in einer Gala-Feier geheiratet hat und dass ihr Ehemann vor ihren Augen ermordet wurde.  Du würdest nicht erwarten, dass dies die gesamte Sequenz auf zwei Seiten einnimmt, während beide nur jeweils zwei Zeilen Gespräch haben.  Du würdest erwarten, dass der Autor Zeit auf den Charakter des Ehemanns verwendet, indem er durch dessen Rede und Benehmen zeigt, wie tief die Liebe ist, die er für seine Frau hat, und du würdest genauso erwarten, dass die Heldin durch große und kleine Wege zeigt, wie sehr das Leben mit ihm ihre verändert und bereichert hat (vor allem wenn die Geschichte später sagt, dass dies der Fall ist).  Eine passende Einführung in den Charakter des Ehemanns würde es dir ermöglichen, emotional mit seinem Schicksal verbunden zu sein und dir würde das Einsehen vermitteln, was sie in ihm sah, wie tief ihre Bindung war, Hinweise darauf, was sie in ihm sah, was ihre Gedanken, Überzeugungen und Träume waren, reflektiert durch den Prisma seiner Augen, und so weiter.  Du würdest seine Ermordung mit ihr trauern und dadurch mehr mit der Heldin selbst verbunden werden.\n\nKurz gesagt, du würdest erwarten, dass es Fleisch auf dem knochenhaften Rahmen der Handlung gibt: \"Sie trafen sich, sie heirateten, er starb.\"\n\nAls Schreiber musst du dieses Fleisch liefern.  (*schaut auf die Metapher, seufzt, geht weiter*)  Manchmal ist es verlockend, gewisse Dinge zu übergehen.

Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of too much information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nYour gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the backstory out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core dump of information, à la \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.\n\n[/REWRITE]",

He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime.

    "raw_output": "Ich habe zwei Nachrichten von Columbus, Ohio, gesehen. Die erste, die live war, war NBC 4 am Morgen des 13. August 2011. Die Hauptsache war eine Geschichte über einen Mann namens Shad Hostettler in Ashley, Ohio, der seine Ehefrau gestochen hatte. Sein Name wurde jedoch nicht genannt. Sie zeigten seine Haftfotografie und er sah aus wie pure Bosheit. Sie widmeten nur etwa zwei Minuten dieser Geschichte, da sie sich entwickelte. Die einzigen Details, die sie lieferten, waren, dass er sie mehrmals gestochen hatte und festgenommen worden war. Ich denke, sie haben die richtige Menge Zeit für diese Geschichte verwendet.\n\nDie zweite Geschichte war über einen Vorfall von morgendlichem Schusswaffeneinsatz von Travis Buyers, 18. Er wurde im Sharon-Woods-Gebiet angeschossen und war schwer verletzt; es gab keine Festnahmen oder Verdächtige zu diesem Zeitpunkt. Die SWAT-Einheit untersuchte das Verbrechen. Diese Geschichte schien kurz zu sein, und ich glaube, das könnte daran liegen, dass es sich um einen \"schwarzen\" Mann oder ein schwarzes Viertel handelte. Ich habe (und ich denke seit Jahren) bemerkt, dass Minderheiten bei Verbrechen als Opfer vernachlässigt werden. Wenn zum Beispiel ein \"weißer\" Kind oder Erwachsener entführt oder vermisst wird oder Opfer eines Verbrechens ist, wird die Medien wütend; aber wenn ein Minderheitenschädel ist, ist man glücklich, wenn es überhaupt erwähnt wird.\n\nDie nächste Geschichte handelte von einem Schussloch, das man in einem Med-Flieger gefunden hatte. Details wurden genannt, wo sie dachten, dass der Vorfall stattgefunden hatte. Es war bestimmt worden, dass es sich um eine .22er-Kugel aus einem Gewehr handelte, die den Hubschrauber getroffen hatte. Crime-Stoppers bieten einen Belohnungsscheck in Höhe von fünf.000 Dollar für Hinweise an, die zu der Festnahme des Schützen führen.\n\nDie nächste Geschichte betraf die Regen und die für Samstag nachmittag vorhergesagten Gewitter. Sie sagten, dass die Temperaturen am Wochenende im mittleren bis unteren Achtzehn Grad bleiben würden. Die Länge der Zeit war ein bisschen zu kurz, aber sie wollten sie als \"Aufforderung\" verwenden, damit man weiterhin zuschauen würde.\n\nSie lieferten auch eine Geschichte über einen Raubüberfall eines Clime Road UDF in Columbus. Sie sagten, es sei ein dunkelhäutiger Schwarzer gewesen, der den Laden ausgeraubt hatte. Er trug eine Sweatshirt-Hoodie. Sie sagten, er sei etwa 1.80 m groß und wiege etwa 68 kg. Ich dachte, sie würden ungewöhnlich viel Zeit darauf verwenden, zu betonen, dass es sich um einen Schwarzen handelte und wie dunkel er war.\n\nEine weitere Geschichte war über einen Rene Rodriguez, der ein verurteilter texanischer Drogenkönig war. Er war wegen einer Verschwörung zum Handel mit Marihuana in großen Mengen aus Texas in Ohio verurteilt worden. Ein kurioses Detail, das ich bemerkt habe, war, dass anstatt zu sagen, er sei zu 25 Jahren in Haft verurteilt worden, sie sagten \"300\" Monate. Ich bin nicht sicher, ob sie dachten, das klinge härter oder was sie damit erreichen wollten. Sie erwähnten auch, dass er ein Hispano-Mann war, denke aber, dass es sich nicht auf die Geschichte wirklich auswirkte.\n\n[REWRITE]\nI watched two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio.

Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost.

Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride.

In diesem Band liegen viele Emotionen: Liebe, Stolz, Neid und Grausamkeit, um nur ein paar zu nennen. Brüder verstehen sich gegenseitig, viel mehr als jeder andere mit diesem Band, und sie können nur sich selbst sehen, wenn sie ihren Bruder ansehen. Es ist, wenn eine Situation am schwierigsten ist, wenn sich die wahre Natur dieses Bandes zeigt, sei es gut oder böse. Wenn diese Emotionen klar werden, ziehen sie einen großen Preis mit sich. Ein Teil der Verständigung der Emotionen, die durch diesen Bruderband entstehen, ist es, sich mit den Konsequenzen auseinanderzusetzen, die sie mit sich bringen. Wenn man einem Bruder in die Augen schauen kann und in der Person sehen kann, ihre eigene Reflexion, sieht man sich selbst nicht so, wie andere sie sehen, sondern wie man wirklich ist. In ihren Handlungen und den Konsequenzen dieser Handlungen liegt ihr wahrer Charakter. In „Der rote Ibis“ erforschen zwei Brüder dieses Thema und all die tobenden Emotionen, die es begleiten. Durch einen dichten, lebendig beschriebenen Landschaft, setzen diese zwei Jungen auf eine erfolglose Reise aus. Bittere Enttäuschung klaffen mit intensivem Stolz in der dramatischen Szene zusammen, und nur einer der Brüder entkommt mit seinem Leben. Das Thema wird durch direkte Charakterisierung des Protagonisten, Doodle, und ihre Interaktionen miteinander sowie durch die Perspektive des Erzählers, der die komplexen Gefühle des Protagonisten und seine Sicht der Welt um ihn herum mitteilt, beide derer sind erhebliche Einflüsse auf seine Handlungen.\n\nDie Handlungen des Protagonisten können alle zusammengefasst werden durch eine Schlüssel-Emotion: Stolz. Von dem Moment an, als er und sein kleiner Bruder Doodle zusammen ausgehen, bis zu ihrer letzten, fatefulen Exkursion, fühlt sich der Protagonist gegenüber Doodle verärgert. Er hatte einen Bruder erwartet, der ihn all seine weltlichen Fähigkeiten unterrichten konnte, wie „...meinen Atem anzuhalten, zu laufen, zu springen oder die Reben in der alten Frauensumpf zu erklimmen...\" Er hatte einen Bruder erwartet, der die Rolle eines „... jemanden einholen könnte, der mit zu Pferdskopf eilt und mit einem, der auf der großen Pinie hinter der Scheune sitzt...\" Offensichtlich sind diese Dinge unmöglich, gegeben Doodles Zustand. Doodle wurde mit einem extrem schwachen Herzen geboren und es war unwahrscheinlich, dass er auch nur überleben würde. Selbst dann, war es fast unmöglich, dass er jemals an körperlich anstrengender Aktivität teilnehmen würde. Was einem jungen Protagonisten, dessen Kopf voller wilde Fantasien ist, einen schweren Schlag versetzt, um alle diese Träume in einer Sekunde zu zerstören. Tatsächlich ist sogar gezeigt, dass er gegen den kleinen Jungen Wut empfindet, als er sich daran erinnert, sich damit begonnen zu haben, den Gedanken an seine Ermordung durch Erstickung mit einem Kissen zu überlegen. Welcher Kind würde die Präsenz von Vernunft haben, um Kindermord in Betracht zu ziehen? Dennoch schmilzt sein Herz, wenn der kleine Junge ihn anlächelt. Ein einfaches Verhalten gab dem Protagonisten so viel Hoffnung! Dies zeigt, dass seine Überzeugung wahrscheinlich nicht sehr stark war. Im Hintergrund seines Gehirns hatte er einen instinktiven Liebesgefühl für seinen Bruder.\n\nEnglish translation back to English:\n\n[REWRITE] There is a bond between brothers, an unbreakable, irreversible bond.

Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth.\n\nGerman Translation:\n\nDas menschliche Gehirn ist ein komplexes, kreatives Informationsverarbeitungssystem. Als die Technologie von primitiv zu modern fortschritt, haben auch die verwendeten Metaphern zur Beschreibung des Gehirns vorgeschritten. Anfangs wurde es verglichen mit einem Wachstift, dann mit einer Schriftrolle, dann mit einem Buch und schließlich mit einem Computer. Wenn Sie mehr über das Gehirn lernen, achten Sie darauf, dass die Nützlichkeit dieser Metaphern begrenzt ist und zu falschen Schlussfolgerungen führen kann.\nDie Informationsverarbeitung beginnt mit Eingaben von den Sinnesorganen, die physische Reize wie Berührung, Hitze, Schallwellen oder Photonen von Licht in elektrochemische Signale umwandeln. Die sensorische Information wird wiederholt durch die Algorithmen des Gehirns in der bottom-up- und top-down-Verarbeitung umgewandelt. Zum Beispiel, wenn man sich ein Bild eines schwarzen Kartons auf einem weißen Hintergrund ansieht, baut bottom-up-Verarbeitung zusammen sehr einfache Informationen wie Farbe, Orientierung und wo die Grenzen des Objekts sind – wo die Farbe sich signifikant in einem kurzen Raum ändert –, um zu entscheiden, dass man einen Karton sieht. Die top-down-Verarbeitung verwendet die Ergebnisse aus einigen Schritten der bottom-up-Verarbeitung, um die Erkennung des Kartons zu beschleunigen. In diesem Beispiel könnte die top-down-Verarbeitung Ihnen helfen, das Objekt als schwarzen Karton anzuerkennen, anstatt einen Kartonförmigen Loch in dem weißen Hintergrund.\nSobald die Information zu einem Grad verarbeitet wurde, entscheidet ein Aufmerksamkeitsfilter darüber, wie wichtig das Signal ist und welches kognitive Prozesse es zur Verfügung gestellt werden sollten. Zum Beispiel verarbeitet Ihr Gehirn jede einzelne Grashalme, wenn Sie nach unten auf Ihre Schuhe schauen, verhindert jedoch ein gesundes Aufmerksamkeitsfilter, dass Sie sie einzeln wahrnehmen. Im Gegensatz dazu könnten Sie Ihr Name herausfiltern, selbst wenn er in einem lauten Raum gesprochen wird. Es gibt viele Verarbeitungsstufen, und die Ergebnisse der Verarbeitung werden durch Aufmerksamkeit wiederholt moduliert.\nDamit das Gehirn Informationen verarbeiten kann, muss es zunächst gespeichert werden. Es gibt mehrere Arten von Gedächtnis, einschließlich sensorischer, arbeitender und langfristiger. Zunächst wird die Information kodiert. Es gibt spezifische Kodierungen für jede Art von sensorischer Reize. Zum Beispiel kann ein verbaler Input strukturiert kodiert werden, was bedeutet, was das gedruckte Wort aussieht, phonemisch kodiert werden, was bedeutet, was das Wort klingt, oder semantisch kodiert werden, was bedeutet, was das Wort bedeutet. Sobald die Information gespeichert ist, muss sie aufrechterhalten werden. Einige Tierstudien legen nahe, dass die Arbeitsgedächtnis, das Informationen für etwa 20 Sekunden speichert, durch einen elektrischen Signal, das durch eine bestimmte Reihe von Neuronen fließt, für einen kurzen Zeitraum aufrechterhalten ist. Informationen im langfristigen Gedächtnis werden angenommen, in der Struktur bestimmter Arten von Proteinen aufrechterhalten zu sein.\nEs gibt zahlreiche Modelle, wie das Wissen im Gehirn organisiert ist, einige basieren auf der Art, wie menschliche Subjekte Erinnerungen abrufen, andere basieren auf der Computerwissenschaft und andere auf der Neurophysiologie. Das semantische Netzwerkmodell besagt, dass es Knoten gibt, die Konzepte darstellen, und dass die Knoten aufgrund ihrer Verwandtschaft vernetzt sind. Zum Beispiel könnte in einem semantischen Netzwerk „Sessel“ mit „Tisch“ verbunden sein, der an „Holz“ angebunden sein kann und so weiter.\n\nEnglish Translation:\n\n[REWRITE] The human brain is a complex, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions. Information processing begins with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the results from some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background. Once information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For instance, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly. In order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means.

Seine Menschen werten Gemeinschaft über den Einzelnen, und werden von Anfang an darauf konditioniert, unmittelbare Glückseligkeit über alles andere zu verfolgen. Die Bürger werden als Puppen in einem größeren Spiel offenbart, die an einen Ideologie gefesselt sind, wie sie von dem Weltencontroller diktiert wird. Durch die Untersuchung des Werkes unter dem Licht der marxistischen Theologie bemerkt man die untergründigen Vermutungen des Autors in Bezug auf die Entwicklung der genannten Systeme. Häufige Begriffe aus dem Marxismus, wie Homogenität und Reification, unter anderem, verstärken die Idee, dass Huxleys Roman ein Kommentar über die Mängel in der sich entwickelnden Wirtschaft seiner Zeit ist.\n\nKapitalismus wird durch den Gebrauch des marxistischen Thesen bekannt als falsche Bewusstsein satirisiert. Im Grunde wird dem gewöhnlichen Bürgertum die wahre Beziehung zu anderen Klassen in wirtschaftlichen Begriffen vorenthalten, da sie hauptsächlich daran interessiert sind, ihren eigenen Gewinn zu verfolgen. Es wird gesagt, dass dies das Ergebnis der ideologischen Kontrolle der Proletarier und der gemeinsamen Arbeitnehmer ist, etwas, das sich durch die Konditionierung der Menschen in Brave New World offensichtlich abzeichnet. Die unteren Klassen, Delta, Gamma usw., haben keinerlei wahre Willensentscheidung; durch Hypnopaedie wird der Wunsch, zu konsumieren, zu verbringen, zu genießen, über alles andere gestärkt. Dies wird durch den Weltencontroller manipuliert, wie zuvor erwähnt. Hegemonie, im Wesentlichen die Idee, dass Gruppen sozialer Klassen von einer separaten Gruppe von Individuen in Gänze beherrscht werden, wird offensichtlich in diesem Fall verwendet. Die unteren Klassen sind gänzlich unbewusst der Manipulation, wörtlich 'sich in eine Ideologie hinein zu kaufen, die diese Struktur unterstützt' (d.h. Kapitalismus & Konsumismus). 'Die oberen Klassen werden geboren mit der Fähigkeit, das zu erkennen, aber tun nichts; nur wenige Alphas oder Betas, wie Bernard, tun mehr als ebenso ihr Platz zu akzeptieren.  Tatsächlich sind die Interaktionen zwischen den sozialen Klassen, wie im folgenden mehr im Detail besprochen wird, wichtige Hinweise auf die wahrgenommene Unterdrückung des Kapitalismus.\n\nBeziehungen zwischen unterschiedlichen Individuen existieren in Brave New World nicht. Der Roman scheint die Charaktere nicht zu unterscheiden - sie haben, selbst unter den Hauptfiguren, keine Tiefe. Vielleicht will Huxley suggerieren, dass der Aufstieg der Technologie und des Kapitalismus zusammen den Menschen ihre freie Willensentscheidung und Ausdruck entziehen. Liebe existiert nicht, noch die Extremformen einer Emotion; vielmehr werden die Interaktionen auf der Oberfläche gehalten, dargestellt durch die Bemerkungen der Männlichen über die Frauen hauptsächlich über ihre körperliche Erscheinung (d.h. pneumatisk Qualität) und die unbeschämten Kommentare der weiblichen über ihre Begegnungen, sozusagen.  Darüber hinaus zeigt die absolute Einigkeit jeder sozialen Klassen mit ihrem Status in der Hierarchie das sozioökonomische Effekt des Kapitalismus an.  Ihre absolute Treue zu ihrer Rolle in der Gemeinschaft ist ein Hinweis auf marxistische Gedanken über die Proletarier, die sich falsch davon überzeugt sind, ihre eigene Überlegenheit über alles andere, solange sie weiterhin konsumieren, gehorchen, sich mit dem Rest ihrer Peers in Einklang bringen.\n\nTranslated German text:\n\nAldous Huxley [REWRITE]criticizes the threatened threat of both technology and the capitalist structure through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World.

For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land.

As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle.

A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms.

Für viele, darunter auch mich selbst, ist es ein Problem, sich auf dem Campus zurechtzufinden. Mein erstes Studienjahr hatte ich in einem Zimmer im East Halls-Schlafheim, sehr weit auf der östlichen Seite des Campus, außer dem Stadion und dem Bryce Jordan Center nicht mitgezählt. Um von meinem Zuhause im Stuart Hall zu den Klassen im weit entfernten Willard-Gebäude, nahe dem Campuszentrum, zu gelangen, brauchte ich bis zu 25 Minuten zu Fuß, besonders wenn das Wetter schlecht war, wie es in State College oft ist. Als ich mich mit einem alten Schüler unterhielt, der nicht viel älter ist als ich, erfuhr ich, dass die East Halls-Schlafheime vor nicht allzu langer Zeit noch von der restlichen Schule durch riesige unbebaute Flächen abgetrennt waren. Heute sind diese leeren Räume mit Sportplätzen, großen neuen Gebäuden, einschließlich der neuen Creamery und des neuen Gesundheitsdienstebaus, und umgeben mit Wohnungen gefüllt. Mit der weiteren Ausweitung des Campus wird es immer schwieriger, von einem Ort zum anderen zu gelangen. Was ist die beste Lösung für das Problem der Mobilität? Auf einem College-Campus ist es das Fahrrad. Doch das Fahrrad allein löst keine Probleme. Die Schüler müssen darauf fahren, und der Campus muss den Bedürfnissen der Fahrradfahrer angepasst werden.\n\nIch unterhielt mich mit einem Freund von mir, der kurz vor dem Fahrradfahren nach einer mehrjährigen Pause wieder damit begonnen hat. Er sagte mir, dass er sich wunderte, warum er jemals aufgehört hatte. \"Fahrräder sind großartig,\" sagte er, \"für einige Jahre war es nicht cool, ein Fahrrad zu fahren, aber es ist die beste Art, sich fortzubewegen.\" Neben den Vorteilen für die Gesundheit ist das Fahrradfahren die effizienteste Art, zu reisen. Ein Schälchen Haferflocken und ein bisschen körperliche Anstrengung können einen über 30 Meilen hinaus bringen. Wie viele Undergrads wie ich lebe ich außerhalb des Campus; genauso weit vom Campuszentrum entfernt wie einige Schlafheime. Die beste Entscheidung, die ich dieses Jahr getroffen habe, war es, ein Fahrrad zu kaufen. Jeden Tag habe ich Kurse in Thomas-Gebäude, leicht 25 Minuten Fußweg von meinem Zuhause entfernt. Wenn ich schnellen Tempo halte, kann ich mit dem Fahrrad diese Zeit auf 5 Minuten verkürzen. Das einzige Problem ist, dass die Pollock Road der direkteste Weg von meinem Haus zu Thomas-Gebäude ist und nicht immer eine leichte Straße für Fahrräder ist. Es gibt Dinge zu sagen, die für das Gehwegfahren sprechen, aber persönlich bin ich zu beschäftigt, um zu Fuß zu gehen. Wenn ich kein Fahrrad hätte, wäre das Walking mein einziger zuverlässiger Weg, um zur Klasse zu gelangen. Der Weg zu Thomas jeden Tag würde mich zusätzlich 30-40 Minuten abnehmen. Das wäre über 2,5 Stunden pro Woche. Dazu kämen dann alle anderen Zeit, die ich für das Gehwegfahren zu anderen Klassen, Terminen und Ähnlichem verbringen müsste. Das wäre mehr Zeit, als ich mir erübrigen könnte.\n\n[REWRITE] I have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters.
