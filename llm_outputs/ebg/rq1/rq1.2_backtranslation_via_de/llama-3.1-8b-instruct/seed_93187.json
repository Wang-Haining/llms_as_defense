Werte, die ich der Sozialarbeit bieten kann, sind unter anderem Dienst, Respekt, ethische Natur, mein Engagement, Beziehungen zwischen anderen zu verbessern und mich selbst beruflich zu verbessern, um in meinem Fachgebiet kompetent zu bleiben. Diese Kernwerte sind nicht nur für Sozialarbeiter wichtig; sie sind mir persönlich wichtig.\n\nIch wollte immer anderen helfen, aber ich war unsicher, welcher Karrierverlauf ich verfolgen wollte. Während meiner Jahre in der Highschool und im College sah ich viele Menschen, die ihre Probleme verleugneten und einige benutzten weniger als ideale Coping-Mechanismen. Aufgrund der Situationen, die ich beobachtet habe, entschied ich mich, einen Bachelorabschluss in Psychologie zu erwerben. Noch immer unsicher, welcher Karrieverlauf ich verfolgen sollte, beschloss ich, eine Pause zu machen, als ich 2009 von der Piedmont College abschloss. Eines Tages im Sommer besuchte ich einen Freund, der mich einem 16-jährigen Jungen vorstellte, der nervös auf ihrem Sofa saß. Sie erklärte mir, warum er dort war: um vor seinen misshandelnden Eltern zu fliehen. Am nächsten Tag erfuhr ich, dass er die Polizei zu seiner Eltern' Haus angerufen hatte. Um herauszufinden, ob ich auf eine Weise helfen könnte, fuhr ich zu seinem Elternhaus. Als ich dort war, erklärte ich den Polizisten meine Bedenken privat und erzählte ihnen, dass ich gerade einen Abschluss in Psychologie von der Piedmont College erworben hatte. Die Polizei bat mich, mit den Eltern zu sprechen, da es für den Jugendlichen nichts gab, was die Gesetze für ihn tun konnten. Als ich die Eltern über die Situation befragte, schienen sie nervös und verwendeten Vorwände, um ihren Sohnes Verhalten zu beschreiben, das \"manipulativ\" war, da er sich an \"einfache\" Konflikte mit Außenstehenden herantrat. Nach dieser speziellen Erfahrung begann ich, mich ernsthaft mit einer Karriere in der Sozialarbeit zu befassen, um Kindern mit \"einfachen\" Konflikten zwischen Familienmitgliedern zu helfen.\n\nEin weiterer Wert, der für das Feld der Sozialarbeit wichtig ist, ist die soziale Gerechtigkeit. Als Gesellschaft behaupten wir, dass der Einzelne wichtig ist, und wir trauern um diejenigen, die wir verloren haben. Das Konzept des \"Einzelnen\", das die Gesellschaft hält, ist eher ein Anhänger archaischer Traditionen als eine tatsächliche Einmaligkeit. Wenn also die Gesellschaft die verlorenen Individuen trauert, dann warum streben wir danach, ähnlich wie \"jeder andere\" zu sein? Ich bin ein Einzelner und genieße es nicht, mich selbst durch die Begrenzung zu behindern, ähnlich wie andere zu sein. Während meiner Jahre in der Highschool und im College protestierte ich gegen soziale Ungerechtigkeiten, sobald ich konnte: Ich färbte mein Haar in un natürlich Farben, trug Kleidung, die meiner Persönlichkeit entsprach, stach meine Ohren durch, erklärte meine Beteiligung an der GSBA (Bündnis Gleichberechtigung), kämpfte gegen Rassismus und Diskriminierung, sobald ich sie sah, usw. Ich glaube an soziale Gerechtigkeit und ich werde weiterhin gegen soziale Ungerechtigkeiten protestieren.\n\nEnglish translation:\n\n[REWRITE] In pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Department of Family and Child Protection to help children who have been abused or neglected and to provide support for troubled families.

The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified.

Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",

Die soziokulturellen Modelle beobachten Umweltbeziehungen und ihre Anwendungen auf Rasse, Ethnie, Demografie und sozioökonomischen Status. Die folgende Überprüfung von Insomnie bezieht sich auf diese Modelle und erläutert jedes Stück der ausgewählten Forschung, um sie in Beziehung zu setzen und sie besser zu erklären. Die Erklärungen der Forschung und ihre Ergebnisse werden dann kritisiert, um ihre spezifischen Stärken und Schwächen zu erwähnen.\n\nEin Schlafstörung kann als primäre Schlafstörung, Schlafstörung in Bezug auf eine andere psychische Störung oder Schlafstörung in Bezug auf andere Probleme karakterisiert werden. Primäre Schlafstörungen sind Dyssonmien oder Parasomnien, während Schlafstörungen in Bezug auf eine andere psychische Störung an einem Axis I oder Axis II Störung verwandt sind. Andere Kategorien von Schlafstörungen können auf medizinische Komplikationen oder die Aufnahme eines Stoffs zurückzuführen sein. Die Dyssomnien sind: Primäre Insomnie, Primäre Hypersomnie, Narcolepsie, Schlafbezogene Atmungsstörung, Circadian-Rhythmus-Schlafstörung und Dyssomnie Nicht anderweitig Spezifiziert (NOS). Während Primäre Insomnie eine Komplikation in ausreichender oder aufrechterhaltener Schlaf darstellt, ist Primäre Hypersomnie eine Schwierigkeit bei der Erhaltung der Wachheit, sowohl für mindestens einen Monat Zeitraum. Narcolepsie beinhaltet KatalEPSie und/ oder automatische REM. Während die Dyssonmien sich auf das Initiieren und sich im Schlaf befinden konzentrieren, sind die Parasomnien Schlafstörungen, die mit Verhaltensanomalien und/ oder physiologischen Vorkommnissen verbunden sind. Parasomnien sind Albtraumstörung, Schlaf-Terrorstörung, Schlafwanderstörung und Parasomnien Nicht anderweitig Spezifiziert. Die Schlafstörungen in Bezug auf eine andere psychische Störung betreffen Schwierigkeiten beim Schlafen, die sich auf einen Axis I (Klinische Störungen) oder Axis II (Persönlichkeitsstörungen oder geistige Behinderung) beziehen.

Neuronen im Hypothalamus, die Orexin enthalten, sind für die Regulierung des Schlafes und der Wachheit verantwortlich. Diese Studie experimentierte mit Mäusen und fand heraus, dass es sich um phänotypische GABA_B-Rezeptoren auf den Orexin-Neuronen handelt, die speziell für Schlaf- und Wachzustände verantwortlich sind. Die Aktivierung des GABA_A-Rezeptors induziert Reaktionen, die den Schlaf fördern. Wenn es von der Firing gehemmt wird, kann dies zu reduzierter Angst führen und den Schlaf induzieren. Der GABA_B-Agonist (Baclofen) erhöhte die Schlafzeit (Matsuki et al., 2009). Solche Ergebnisse implizieren, dass die Tierschädlingsmodelle von Mäusen auf Studien bei Menschen generalisiert werden können. Dies zeigt, dass es eine genetische und umweltbedingte Grundlage für den physischen GABA_B-Rezeptor in Menschen gibt. Ein Problem oder eine Abwesenheit dieses Rezeptors könnte die Fähigkeit beeinträchtigen, einen ausreichenden Schlaf ohne Medikamente zu haben. Die soziokulturelle Implikation dieser Studie ist, dass, wenn das Phänotyp vererbt wird, dies den Schlaf regulieren könnte, und eine Änderung des Rezeptors würde den Schlaf natürlich stören für einen Einzelnen.

Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers.

Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiological activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiological auditory potentials\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder in which the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process what is heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered \"hearing impaired\"; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should.\n\nThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD was from the mid-1950s, called \"auditory imperception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura \"introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CNS underlying dichotic perception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more \"acoustic events\" (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on a change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (i.e., interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\nIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with \"systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function,\" which may be conducted by \"audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no single tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals.",

Ein großes Problem bei der Beendigung einer Täuschung besteht jedoch darin, dass man sich im Prozess abgelehnt fühlen könnte. Daher muss man sich am Ende entscheiden, ob man sich selbst oder die Beziehungen zu den Menschen um sich herum retten will. Obwohl einige sich neutral auf das Entdecken reagieren, dass sie getäuscht wurden, reagieren andere nicht so lässig und werden durch die ganze Fassade verletzt.\nBesonders problematisch ist die Thematik der Täuschung in der Geschlechterumkehr, da sie viele Nebenthemen hervorbringt, von denen das Wichtigste vielleicht ist: Warum? Warum fühlt der Betroffene den Bedarf, seine eigene Identität abzulehnen und eine Verkleidung in Form des gegenteiligen Geschlechts anzunehmen? In Violas Fall ist es offensichtlich eine Form der Selbstschutz. „Ich werde dich zu einem Hauptmann in dieser Stadt bringen / Wo meine Jungfrau zu finden sind, bei deren sanfter Hilfe / Ich überlebt und um den ehrenwerten Grafen zu dienen.“ (5.1.247-249)\n\nNachdem sie in einer fremden Stadt angekommen ist, muss Viola sich als Mann zu verkleiden, um sich vor Angreifern zu schützen. Die Verkleidung von Viola funktioniert, aber sie trennt sie auch von den Frauen um sie herum, indem sie ihr von einem wichtigen Unterstützungsnetzwerk abschneidet. Der Schaden wird noch dadurch verschlimmert, dass sie so überzeugend ist, wie sie als Mann zu erscheinen, dass Olivia sie mit Sebastian verwechselt und sich in sie verliebt. „Wohin, mein Herr? Cesario, Ehemann, bleib!“ (5.1.138) Zu allem Überfluss muss sie sich auch mit unterdrückten romantischen Gefühlen zwischen ihr und Orsino auseinandersetzen: „Junge, du hast mir schon tausend Mal gesagt / Dass du keine Frau lieben wirst wie mich.“ (5.1. 260-261)\n\nObwohl dies eine eher fortschrittliche Haltung sein mag, kann ein moderner Leser Twelfth Night als ein Beispiel dafür sehen, wie Täuschung die Entdeckung unterdrückter Emotionen erleichtern kann, insbesondere bei den Fällen von Olivia und Orsino. Einige Passagen schließen nahe, dass die genannten Charaktere möglicherweise unausgesprochene Unterbewusstseinswünsche haben, die der Erscheinung von Viola/Cesario zulasten kommen. Zum Beispiel ist Olivia an Cesario vielleicht nicht attraktiv, weil Cesario als Mann erscheint, oder lebt Olivia tatsächlich heimlich Gefühle für Frauen? Man würde argumentieren, dass dies wahrscheinlich nicht der Fall ist, weil Shakespeares Charakter Olivia eher dazu tendiert, die Menschen ihrer Zeit zu spotten, die andere nur aufgrund ihrer Äußerlichkeiten beurteilen. \nBelegt wird dies durch die Leichtigkeit, mit der Olivia ihre romantischen Wünsche von Cesario zu Sebastian wechseln und Cesario/Viola als Familie und nicht als Liebesinteresse betrachten: „Eine Schwester bist du.“ (5.1.315)\n\n[REWRITE] Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process.

Arguably hat das Sub-Genre des Heavy Metal Rock sich im Laufe der letzten 40 Jahre zu einem der vielfältigsten und ausdrucksstärksten Genres der Populärmusik entwickelt. Es ist ausdrucksvoll, weil es eine breite Palette von Emotionen zeigt, obwohl sie in Richtung der dunkleren Seite des Spektrums neigen. Es ist vielfältig in der Art, dass sich die Menschen bald nach dem Beginn des Genres reiben, dass es echte Flexibilität hat und sie sich darin ausnutzen, um ihre eigenen Sub-Genre zu schaffen, was dann von Sub-Sub-Genres gefolgt wurde, und die Kette reicht bis heute.\n\nHeute haben wir an einem Punkt im Heavy Metal anlangen, an dem es so viele Nischen von Gruppen gibt, dass es schwierig ist, genau zu bestimmen, was Heavy Metal ist. Es hat sich so viele Themen aus anderen Genres angeeignet, aber wie bei allem anderen, ist es irgendwoher entstanden. Um das Metal-Musik zu verstehen, die überall heute existiert, muss man zuerst verstehen, was der Metal-Bewegung ist, und wieso es eine Bewegung anstatt nur ein Genre ist.\n\n‎\t‏Metal ist auf viele Arten eine Bewegung, die durch Dunkelheit definiert ist. Metal kann als eine ‚Musik des mehr‘ betrachtet werden – mehr Bass, mehr Lautstärke, mehr Gewalt, mehr Theater. Weniger Primitivismus, mehr Chopps – die Menschen in Metalbands können ihre Instrumente sehr gut spielen, und das kommt durch in der Musik. Metal ist auch – obwohl es nicht überraschen sollte – eine Bewegung, die stark von Drogen beeinflusst ist. Es gab in den 70ern ein psychedelisches Drogenboom, der zu verrückteren Menschen führte, was dazu führte, dass sie verrückte, andere-weltliche Aufnahmen machten, und nutzten die Drogen als Ausrede für ihre Schaffung. Es hat viele dunkle,  viszerale Qualitäten, die sehr neu in der Musikszene waren, weil eine große Menge von Populärmusik Qualitäten besaß, die nicht wahrhaftig zur dunkleren Seite des emotionalen Spektrums standen. Außerdem haben spätere Generationen von Metal Einflüsse aus den dunklen, viszeralen Qualitäten genommen, die so präsent waren in der romantischen Epoche. Die folgenden Liedtexte ausdrücken die Dunkelheit, die so ein Grundelement der Bewegung ist: (Byrne)\n\nDiese Liedtexte von Helter Skelter zeigen die dunkle Seite der Beatles. Es zeigt eine auf und ab, vermutlich von Drogen. Diese Songs werden von einigen als einer der ersten Heavy-Metal-Songs angesehen. Es war eine Reaktion auf einen Rolling-Stones-Song, der auch auf der schwereren, dunkleren Seite war. Die Beatles wollten beweisen, dass sie so schwer wie die Stones sein können, also legten sie das Lied auf The White Album.\n\nEnglish Translation (back to English):\n \nThe classification of popular music has changed so much over the last 100 years that it's difficult to list all the genres. It complicates things that almost all genres – rap, rock, country, jazz, folk – have spawned sub and sub-sub genres. Arguably, the subgenre of heavy metal rock has developed over the past 40 years into one of the most diverse and expressive genres of popular music. It is expressive because it shows a broad range of emotions, although it tends to lean towards the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginning of the genre, people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to exploit it to create their own subgenre, which was then followed by sub-subgenres, and the chain continues to this day.\n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has incorporated so many themes from other genres, but like everything else, it originated from somewhere. To properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today, one must first understand what the metal movement is, and why it's a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal can be considered, in many ways, a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a \"music of more\" – more bass, more volume, more violence, more theatrics. Less primitivism, more chops – people in metal bands can play their instruments very well, and it comes through in the music. Metal is also – although it may not come as a surprise – a movement heavily influenced by drugs. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the 70s that led to crazier people, which led them to make crazy, otherworldly records, and use the drugs as an excuse for their creation. It has many dark, visceral qualities, which were very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren't true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also, later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark, visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement: (Byrne)\n\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter show the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down, supposedly of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first heavy metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier, darker side.

    "original": "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",

    "raw_output": "German translation:\n\nEinige Jahrzehnte bevor die Surrealisten ihre traumähnlichen Werke malten, schuf der Künstler Henri Rousseau sorgfältig seine eigenen Träume, wörtlich und metaphorisch. \"Der Traum\", ein Gemälde von 1910, dem berühmten Post-Impressionisten, stellt nicht nur eine Frau dar, die sich vor den Wundern der Landschaft erstaunt, die sie in einem Traum besucht, sondern auch Rousseaus eigene Träume und Ziele als Künstler. Seit Beginn seiner Arbeit träumte er von Anerkennung, Akzeptanz und Anerkennung durch andere Künstler und Kunstliebhaber und fand heraus, dass er mit einer schwierigen inneren Distanz zu kämpfen hatte, um dieses Streben zu erreichen. \"Der Traum\" ist das Werk von Henri Rousseau, das seine lebenslangen inneren Anstrengungen am besten widerspiegelt: entweder sich den Kritikern der Kunstwelt anzupassen, die er so sehr bewunderte, oder sich kreativ unabhängig und einzigartig zu sein und seinen eigenen Weg zu gehen.\n\nBevor man \"Der Traum\" unter diesem Gesichtspunkt analysieren kann, muss man zunächst mit Rousseaus biografischer Geschichte vertraut sein. Henri Rousseau wurde am 21. Mai 1844 in der Stadt Laval in Nordwestfrankreich geboren. Sein Vater war Schmied und Einzelhandelswarenhändler und \"genoss bürgerliches Wohlstand\" (Shattuck 47). Als junger Mann erhielt er keine formale Ausbildung in den Künsten und arbeitete stattdessen bis zum Alter von 40 Jahren für Frankreich als Gabelier, oder Mitarbeiter der städtischen Zollbehörde, obwohl er den Missverständlichen Spitznamen Douanier, Zollinspektor erhielt (Shattuck 46). Der Tod seiner ersten Frau Clémence, der Tod von acht Säuglingskindern folgte und ließ Rousseau nur noch einen Sohn, die Tochter Julia, und unglaubliche Trauer zurück (Shattuck 49). Deshalb hoffte er, in einem neuen Leben Zuflucht zu finden und suchte Trost und neue Anfänge in der Malerei. Im Gegensatz zu seinen zeitgenössischen Kollegen, die die Bauern in der Malerei sentimentalisierten und romantisierten, ist er in Wirklichkeit ein Volksmaler und hat die Hoffnungen und Träume eines durchschnittlichen Mitglieds seiner Klasse.\n\nRousseaus Obsession, von der Kunstwelt anerkannt zu werden, ist in gewisser Weise verständlich, wenn man im Kontext bewertet: wie besprochen, war er nicht nur ungebildet in den Formalen Künsten und begann seine Karriere mit einem viel älteren Alter, sondern er produzierte Werke in der gleichen Zeit wie viele andere talentierte und bekanntere moderne Künstler. Obwohl er bereits viele Jahre gearbeitet hat, erhielt er erst um die gleiche Zeit, als Matisse seine Karriere als Künstler begann, für sein Kunstwerk die angemessene Anerkennung.\n\nEnglische Übersetzung:\n\n[REWRITE] A few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and metaphorically. \"The Dream\", a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter.

    "raw_output": "German translation:\n\nViele große Denker haben eine intime Verbindung zwischen Ethik und Ästhetik, zwischen Wahrheit und Schönheit postuliert. Ich glaube, dass es bei einer fundamentalen Ebene einen Grund für dies gibt. Wie John Keats in \"Ode an eine griechische Urne\" sagt: \"Schönheit ist die Wahrheit, Wahrheit Schönheit - Das ist alles, was ihr auf Erden wisst, und alles, was ihr wissen müsst.\" Viele Dinge, die wir im Leben wissen, sind durch Bildung oder Erfahrung gelernt. Allerdings scheinen wir die Ethik und Ästhetik, wie Keats andeutet, ohne eine gegebene Art der Lehre zu schätzen. Beide Ethik und Ästhetik sind ein Versuch, sich zu beschreiben, anstatt Vorstellungen zu machen. Unsere Studien zur Moralität und Schönheit sind im Wesentlichen Versuche, zu erklären, warum ein Kunstwerk oder eine literarische Arbeit schön ist, oder warum eine Handlung moralisch ist, anstatt ein Satz von Regeln zum Urteilen oder Schaffen von gutem Kunst oder moralischem Verhalten.\n\nMehr noch, die Kritik an Kunst oder Moral ist nie in der Lage, die Essenz von dem, was gut ist oder was schön ist, vollständig zu erfassen. Eine Diskussion über den Wert von Leonardos Mona Lisa könnte sich um Konzepte wie Vordergrund, Hintergrund, Kontrast oder kultureller Kontext drehen, aber letztendlich beschreiben diese nicht, warum es sich um gute Kunst handelt. Vielmehr ist es gängig, wenn man nach einem Lieblingswerk der Kunst oder Literatur gefragt wird, eine Phrase zu hören, die sich ähnelt, \"Es gibt einfach etwas an ihr\", gefolgt von einer komplexeren oder kritischeren Erklärung. Ich glaube, dass sowohl Kunst als auch Moral nie vollständig auf eine Beschreibung ihrer Qualitäten reduziert werden können. Wie Flannery O'Connor sagt, \"Eine Geschichte ist eine Möglichkeit, etwas zu sagen, das auf keine andere Weise gesagt werden kann. ... Du erzählst eine Geschichte, weil eine Aussage unzureichend wäre.\" Wenn wir, wie komplett wir auch die Eigenschaften eines literarischen Werks beschreiben, gibt es etwas Transzendentes, das noch übrig bleibt. Ich glaube, dass die Ethik auch denselben Charakter hat. Wie Wittgenstein sagt, \"Es ist klar, dass die Ethik nicht ausgedrückt werden kann. / Die Ethik ist transzendental. / Ich denke, dass es ist dieses ‚Etwas‘, dieses 'c'est la vie', das diese Eigenschaft von Kunst und Moral ist und dass diese transzendentale Natur von Ethik und Ästhetik einen Brückenschlag zwischen ihnen bietet.\"\n\nIch glaube, dass Moralität und Kunst so eng miteinander verbunden sind, weil wir beide von ihnen auf einer noumenalen Ebene am stärksten erfahren. Sie wirken auf uns auf einer Ebene, die erfasst werden kann, aber nicht vollständig erklärt werden kann. Dieser Zusammenhang ist sogar stärker, wenn es um die Kunst der Literatur geht. Wie McKean sagt, \"Was am meisten die Literatur von den anderen Künsten unterscheidet, was wahrhaftig eine Einzigartigkeit der Kunst ist, ist ihre moralische Qualität. Es mag sein, dass moralische Standards für andere Künste ungeeignet sind, Musik zum Beispiel, aber sie scheinen für die Literatur genauso relevant zu sein wie für das Leben selbst. Leben ist unvermeidlich mit Werten verbunden. ... Die Literatur ist uns wichtig, genau deshalb, weil wir in ihr die Werte finden, die wir brauchen.\"\n\n[REWRITE]\n\nMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty.

    "original": "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses.

Das gleiche Kulturbild kann man auch in Köln auf der Rhein, durch den Mittelpunkt Deutschlands bis zur sächsischen Stadt Dresden auf der Elbe spüren. Mit einer so einzigartigen Kultur sollte es nicht verwundern, dass Deutschland so wie wir es heute kennen, aus mehreren verschiedenen Quellen und Stämmen kommt.\n\nDie Germania ist das Stammesland der Deutschen. Die Herkunft des Namens ist unter Historikern und Wissenschaftlern stark umstritten. Tacitus behauptete, dass der Name von einem germanischen Stamm bekannt war, der damals als Tungrier bezeichnet wurde, und dass sie zuvor als Deutsche bezeichnet wurden, bevor sie den Rhein überschritten und gegen die gallischen Kräfte kämpften (Tacitus, 98).  Julius Caesar verwendete zum ersten Mal das Wort \"Germanus\" in seinem Kommentar zur gallischen Krieg, in dem er die Gallier besiegte und mit germanischen Stämmen kämpfte, die oft unter betrügerischen Gründen den Rhein überschritten. Er nahm dieses Wort von den Galliern selbst und verwendete es, um zwischen denjenigen zu unterscheiden, die er besiegt hatte (die Gallier) und jenen, die er nicht besiegt hatte. Während der Ursprung unsicher ist, glauben einige, dass es sich auf einen Nachbarn in der gallischen Sprache bezog. In dem ersten Kapitel seines ersten Buches über diese Kriege schreibt Julius Caesar: \"Die Deutschen, die jenseits des Rhein wohnen, mit denen sie (die Gallier) ständig Krieg führen..... Sie kämpfen mit den Deutschen in fast täglichen Schlachten.\" (Julius Caesar, 50-40 v. Chr.)\n\nAndere behaupten, dass der Name von dem Speer kommt, der in Kriegsführung verwendet wurde, bekannt als \"ger\" (O.E.D, 2010), oder vielleicht von dem alten irischen Wort \"garim\" bedeuten \"zuschreien\", was darauf hindeutet, dass die Germanen laut oder störend waren. (Namen von Deutschland)\n\nDer frühzeitige Römerhistoriker Tacitus schrieb in seinem AD 98 \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\", das von der Herkunft der Germanen erzählte, dass \"wir sie als ursprünglich und nicht mit anderen Rassen durch Einwanderung oder Verkehr vermischt ansehen sollten. Denn in früheren Zeiten war es nicht durch Land, sondern auf Schiffen, dass diejenigen, die sich emigrieren wollten, ankamen....... Wer würde aus Asien, oder Afrika, nach Italien, nach Germania gehen, mit seinem wilden Land, seinen rauhen Himmel, seinen störrischen Sitten und Gesichtern, es sei denn, es war sein Zuhause?(SIC)\" (Tacitus, 98)\n\nUnd wer würde Rom nach Germania verlassen? Sicherlich nicht die Römer, noch nicht zumindest. Sie würden ihre Eroberungen in die Länder von Germania senden, um Waren zu erhalten, und führten hin und wieder eine Landkampagne durch, aber am Ende kehrten sie größtenteils zurück nach Hause in ihr gewaltiges Reich. So wie die germanischen Stämme in der Mitte des ersten Jahrhunderts zu erscheinen begannen, lebten sie an den Grenzen des römischen Reiches und handelten ihre Güter, die sie aus dem Land nahmen, und ihre Fähigkeiten, indem sie in den Reihen des römischen Heeres dienten.

The same cultural landscape can be felt from Cologne on the Rhine, through the heart of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we know it today comes from several different sources and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origin of the name is highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic tribe known as the Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98).

Ohne Emotionen, still und mit einer geübten, aber abweisenden Bewusstheit, die die zugrunde liegende Bedeutung des Gegenstands nicht verstand, analysierte mein Verstand das Bild vor meinen Augen.  Gedanken tauchten in meinem Bewusstsein auf und verschwanden genauso schnell, wie sie erschienen waren.  So glatt und sauber arbeitete mein Bewusstsein, dass es schien, als hätte ich keine Gedanken.  Ich hatte nur eine lebendige und flüssige Erfahrung von dem, was ich sah.\n\nEines Tages, auf Empfehlung eines Künstlers, mit dem ich gearbeitet habe, kaufte ich ein Kunstbuch namens \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\" (Neuer Zeichnen auf der rechten Gehirnhälfte).  Ich hatte mich schon mit sechs Jahren daran versucht, malen zu lernen, und dieses Buch enthält Unterricht in allem, von der Erklärung, was ein Bleistift ist, bis hin zu den Prozessen, mit denen das Gehirn Linien interpretiert.  Eine Technik, die das Buch beibringt, ist es, eine rechteckige Rahmung um jedes Bild zu setzen, das ein Künstler studieren möchte.  Dadurch wird ein überwältigend detailliertes Bild, wie zum Beispiel eine Schüssel mit Obst auf einem Tisch in einer Küche, die an ein Esszimmer anschließt, in ein leicht zu fassendes Bild, diese Schüssel mit Obst auf einer einfachen Ebene.\n\nIn dem Moment, als ich nach unten auf die Schüssel vor mir starrte, konnte ich den von dem Künstler vorgeschlagenen Rahmen mental nicht projizieren.  Ich war überwältigt, erstaunt, und konnte nur stehen und staunen.  Picasso ging durch seine blaue Phase, Monet liebte das Grüne, die italienischen Renaissance-Meister zeigten ein Spektrum an Farben.  Wenn ich mich je daran gewagt hätte, meine Perspektive als würdig des Titels \"Künstlerisch\" zu betrachten, dann standen vor mir die Anfänge meiner Bilder, der Beginn meiner Geschichte, \"Work in Brown\".  \n\nMeine Fingertippen berührten meinen gewählten Kunstwerkzeug, die Muskeln spannten sich und lockerten sich, während meine Hand durch den Raum glitt, und mein Willen wurde in Form gebracht, was zu dem kreativsten Moment meines Lebens hätte werden können.  Wasser schwappte, ruhig und glatt, klar und sauber.  Flocken von Materie brachen von der Gesamtheit ab und wurden zu Nichts getragen.  Muskeln spannten sich, zuckten und zuckten ein wenig schneller und ängstlicher beim zweiten Mal, meine Hand schlug erneut gegen den Griff des Toilets.  Der ekelerregende braune Päckchen weigerte sich, sich zu bewegen, blieb wie eine Schnecke am Boden des Toilets haften.\n\nMithilfe eines Mopps, den ich locker in der Hand hielt, mit Füßen einen Fuß auseinander, einem unangenehmen grünen Krawattenknoten um den Hals, runzelte ich leicht die Stirn, während ich auf das unverschämte Bündel von verarbeitetem Tier- und Pflanzenmaterial starrte, das jemand als Nachricht für diejenigen, die die Toiletten im Rite Aid saubermachten, hinterlassen hatte.  Ein paar weitere Aufräumungen, ein paar weitere ruhige, introspektive Momente für mich selbst, dann glitt meine Hand in Richtung Wand rechts, griff in das Ende des Toilettpapiers und formte sich zu einer Art Handtasche, die einem Ofenhandschuh ähnelt.  Stehend aufrecht, dann leicht nach vorn gebeugt, tauchte meine Hand langsam in die Schüssel ein, wie eine Mutter, die in den Ofen geht, um das Thanksgiving-Hähnchen zu braten...\n\nUnd hier ist die Übersetzung des deutschen Textes zurück ins Englisch:\n\n[REWRITE] I stared downward, my consciousness was blank and didn't comprehend what I was seeing.

Mehrere Faktoren kommen zusammen, um dieses tödliche Statistik-Vektor für die jüngsten amerikanischen Fahrer zu schaffen.  Die National Institutes of Health erklären, dass ein Aspekt des Problems darin besteht, dass das junges Gehirn einfach nicht bereit ist für die Gefahren des Fahrens.  Einfache Unversiertheit liegt auch am Herzen des Problems. Diese Unversiertheit verursacht nicht nur mehr fatale Unfälle, sondern auch eine höhere Rate von Fahrzeugumstürzen, Höchstgeschwindigkeitsverletzungen und Abstürzen von der Straße.\n\nTeenager fahren auch viel schlechter, wenn sie mit ihren Peers unterwegs sind – was jeder, der ein bisschen Verstand besitzt, weiß, dass sie sich regelmäßig tun.  Das Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center hat eine Studie durchgeführt, die die folgende Korrelation zeigt: zwischen dem Alter des Passagiers und dem Anzahl der Straßenverkehrsunfälle, die vorkommen.\n\nKalifornien und andere Staaten haben versucht, die Sicherheit der jungen Fahrer zu erhöhen, indem sie temporäre provisorische Führerscheine vorschreiben, die die Stunden begrenzen, die Jugendliche fahren dürfen und andere Minderjährige als Passagiere verbieten.\n\nAber provisorische Führerscheine sind, meine Meinung nach, stoppbeschäftigte Maßnahmen.  Die wahre Frage ist, dass - als Gruppe - die jüngsten Fahrer, gemäß statistischer Marker, nicht in der Lage sind, die Risiken und Verantwortlichkeiten zu bewältigen.  Der Psychologe Marvin Zuckerman glaubt, dass sogar 18 zu jung ist, um einen regulären Führerschein zu behalten.  USA Today berichtet, dass Zuckerman Forschungen durchgeführt hat, die eine gemeinsame Neigung unter den jüngeren als 19-20 Jahre hervorheben, Risiken aufgrund des bloßen Schauerfreudens zu nehmen.  Es ist dann logisch, das Fahren aufzuschieben, bis die Neigung zum Schauerfreudensuchverhalten abgeebnet ist.  Wenn wir weiterhin Führerscheine an junge Jugendliche ausstellen, werden nicht nur tödliche Unfälle weiterhin passieren, sondern der Todesfall dürfte in den nächsten Jahren auf erstaunliche Ausmaße anwachsen.  Bis 2010 werden die Baby-Boomer-Babies fahrtauglich sein und Millionen neue Fahrer werden bereit sein, auf die Straße zu fahren.\n\nGesetze, die sich mit diesem Problem befassen, wären vernünftig und leicht umzusetzen.  Schulen könnten weiterhin Führerscheinkurse anbieten, um den Lernprozess für zukünftige Fahrer zu beginnen, aber niemand unter 18 Jahren dürfte einen Motorwagen bedienen.  Ein provisorischer Führerschein könnte noch vor der Erteilung eines Vollfähigkeitsführerscheins ausgestellt werden, und eine bestimmte Anzahl an praktischen Führerschein-Stunden wäre noch erforderlich.  Die genaue Anzahl der Stunden könnte sich auf die Anzahl der Stunden beziehen, die bereits die Mehrheit der Staaten vorschreibt (in Kalifornien zum Beispiel beträgt die aktuelle Anzahl 6 Stunden Fahrtraining im Beisein eines Erwachsenen und 50 Stunden Praxis mit einem Erwachsenen).  Da die tödlichen Statistiken für junge Fahrer aus einer Querschnitt aller Staaten kommen, wäre einheitliches, nationales Gesetzgebung in diesem Bereich eine vernünftige und ich glaube wirksame Methode, um Jugendliche im gesamten Land zu schützen. \n\nDie von mir vorgeschlagene Gesetzesänderung ist keineswegs eine neue Idee.\n\nEnglish translation back to English:\n\n[REWRITE] Teenagers are dying behind the wheel.

Since the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation.\n\nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.",

Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot.

    "raw_output": "Original German translation:\n\nBei der Durchsicht der Bibliothek des Kongresses hat sich der Entschluss gefasst, alle Trickfilme von 1895 bis 1901 anzusehen. Diese Filme nutzen häufig kreative Schnitttechniken, um Illusionen zu produzieren. Meine Filmstudien konzentrierten sich hauptsächlich auf die Ästhetik der Trickfilme und auf die untersuchung der evolutiven Eigenschaften, die sich in einigen der späteren Filme finden. In der Regel sind Trickfilme aus der Zeit um die Jahrhundertwende in einem festen Rahmen, bestehend aus einer Frontalprospekt, gefilmt, zeigen keine Kamerabewegungen, verwenden lange und mittellange Einstellungen und folgen streng der Methode, die eine Einstellung nur mit einer Einstellung gleichsetzt. Es gibt jedoch einige Filme am Anfang des 20. Jahrhunderts, die diese Richtlinien durchbrechen, indem sie Aspekte wie mehrere Einstellungen einführen. \n\nEin der bemerkenswerteste Aspekt, der sich bei den Trickfilmen gemeinsam findet, ist die Aufnahme in einem Innenraum innerhalb des Rahmens einer Frontalprospekt. Die Kamera bewegt sich von ihrer Prospektpositions nicht aus, um Figuren oder Gegenstände zu verfolgen. Diese Komposition war sehr verbreitet in frühen Filmen und zog ihren Ursprung aus dem Theater und, speziell bei Trickfilmen, dem Vaudeville und der Zauberkunst. Eines der Einschränkungen, die sich in der Verwendung des Bühnenraums ergeben, ist, dass die Figuren in Trickfilmen normalerweise nur seitwärts bewegen und nicht in Richtung oder weg vom Kamera gehen. Nehmen wir beispielsweise die Aktion in dem Film \"Uncle Josh im Spukschloß\" (1900). Die Schauspieler betreten von rechts und bewegen sich entlang der horizontalen Achse hin und her. Selbst wenn sie aus dem Bild gehen, folgt die Kamera ihnen nicht.\n\nDie Komposition im Stil der Frontalprospekt bedeutet auch, dass Einstellungen normalerweise lange Einstellungen und, seltener, mittellange Einstellungen sind. Nahsichten wurden in keinem der Trickfilme des Edison-Katalogs verwendet. Dies nimmt Bezug auf die Theater- und Vaudeville-Tradition, bei der das Publikum die gesamte Vorstellung gleichzeitig sah, eingebettet in die Grenzen der Bühne. Wie bei den meisten frühen Filmen bewegen sich die Schauspieler nicht vom Mittelgrund zum Kamera, sodass Nahsichten nie auftreten.\n\nIn der Regel folgen die meisten frühen Trickfilme dem Muster, dass eine konzeptionelle Einstellung einer Einstellung entspricht. Diese Einschränkung begrenzt die Länge der meisten Trickfilme auf etwa eine Minute oder weniger, abhängig von der Anzahl der Frames pro Sekunde, die verwendet werden. Es begrenzt auch die dramatische oder narrative Verwendung der Trickfilme; die meisten von ihnen konzentrieren sich auf kurze Vaudeville-Stile, wie Magie, Verschwinden und Tauschhandlungen mit wenig Geschichte. Beachten Sie jedoch, dass in einem Trickfilm eine konzeptionelle Einstellung nicht unbedingt einer physischen Einstellung entspricht. Eine einzelne \"Einstellung\" kann tatsächlich mehrere zusammengefügte Einstellungen sein, um die Illusion von Erscheinung oder Verschwinden zu erzeugen. Sehen Sie sich beispielsweise \"Die Hinrichtung von Maria Stuart, Königin von Schottland\" (1895), einen der früheren Trickfilme, an. Eine gründliche Untersuchung zeigt den Moment, an dem die physische Einstellung mit Marias \"abgetrennter\" \"Kopf\" beginnt, obwohl der gesamte Film konzeptionell einer einzigen Einstellung entspricht.\n\nEnglish translation back to English:\n\n[REWRITE]Upon going through the Library of Congress's library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films from 1895 to 1901.

Obwohl er hauptsächlich ein Landwirt war,  beleuchtete seine kurze politische Karriere und seine Professsion hervorragend seine Dedikation und seine Offenheit in Angelegenheiten persönlicher Freiheit und Regierung.  Seine Dedikation an die agrarische Systematik war die Grundlage für fast alle seiner Meinungen hinsichtlich der Regierung.  Seine Bemühungen, das zu bewahren, was er als das höchste aller Berufe betrachtete, färbte seine Argumente hinsichtlich der Souveränität, der Verfassungsmäßigkeit und sogar des Gerichtswesens.\n \nJohn Taylor war der Meinung, dass die Vereinigten Staaten eine großartige Gelegenheit hatten, ein ideales System zu schaffen,  da keine einheimische Tradition die Schöpfer der Regierung behinderte, was es ermöglichte, ein System der Selbstregierung zu etablieren.  Er glaubte stark an die natürlichen Rechte des Menschen, und an die Tatsache, dass sie voneinander abhängig sind – was bedeutet, dass, wenn einem verwehrt wird, sie alle wiederum scheitern werden, und der Wert der verbleibenden geringer wird.  Diese Rechte sollten deshalb jenseits der Reichweite der Regierung liegen.  Er behauptete, dass das, was man den \"Staat der Natur\" nannte, bedeutete, dass diejenigen mit körperlicher Stärke und bösartiger Intelligenz profitierten, aber dass in einer Zivilisation, das nicht so sein sollte.\n \nUm dieses ideale Gesellschaft zu schaffen, glaubte Taylor, dass eine Regierung geschaffen werden muss, die die inhärenten Guten und Schlechten inmenschlichen Wesen berücksichtigt.  John Taylor war sehr streng in seinen Meinungen hinsichtlich einer dualistischen Moral.  Er behauptete, dass \"Während Regierung durch den Menschen ausgeübt wird, müssen ihre Tugenden und Lastern sie selbst sein\" (Ibid., S. 167).  Er definierte gute Prinzipien als solche, die private Eigentum schützen, die Landwirtschaft verbessern und Kapitalismus entmutigen und glaubte, dass eine Regierung, die auf guten Prinzipien gegründet war, unabhängig von ihrer Verwaltung gleichmäßig funktionieren würde, was unvermeidlich durch Avarice und Eigeninteresse geführt wurde, er glaubte, dass Eigeninteresse, Menschen Beweggrund in allem ist, aber dass die Eigenschaft nur als böse angesehen wurde, wenn sie über die Schaffung einer Gesellschaft auf der Grundlage des Gemeinsinn führte zu Untergruppen, die auf Kosten anderer existieren.  Eine gute Regierung war erforderlich, um die natürliche Böseheit des Menschen zu bewahren, und selbst dann musste sie sorgfältig beobachtet werden, um die Hinzufügung von schlechten Prinzipien zu vermeiden.\n \nTaylor, wie viele andere strenge Republikaner seiner Zeit, forderte eine strenge Auslegung der Verfassung.  Er wollte eine sehr eingeschränkte Bundesregierung, mit kein mehr Rechten oder Macht, als ausdrücklich in der Verfassung genannt wurden.  Er wusste, dass eine ausgedehnte Bundesregierung teuer war, und daher wahrscheinlich despotisch.  Doch glaubte er, dass eine einfache, wörtliche Auslegung gefährlich war, und dass ohne Bezugnahme auf den Willen der Schreiber, ein solcher Methodus leicht korrupt werden konnte.  Selbst mehr, er betrachtete die Erklärung der Unabhängigkeit als wahre Charta der Vereinigten Staaten, weil sie deutlicher die Länder als eine Gruppe von souveränen Staaten beschreibt, anstatt eines Volkes.\n\nNow I will translate the German version back to English.\n\n[REWRITE] John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.

That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth.

Mit Beginn des Winters an einem Campus in New England gibt es eindeutig einen Rückgang bei der Anzahl der Fahrgäste, die entweder mit dem Fahrrad oder zu Fuß zum Campus kommen, was möglicherweise einen Teil des Rückgangs erklären kann. Dezember markiert das Ende des Herbstsemesters, in dem jeder sehr beschäftigt ist, Schularbeiten zu erledigen, Noten auszuwerten und den Rest zu erledigen. Die Füllung des Fahrgastprotokolls kann einfach aus den Fokus verloren gegangen sein. Zudem bringt Dezember die Beginn der Feiertagszeit und den darauf folgenden einmonatigen Urlaub für Studenten und Dozenten, in der Zeit viele keine Anlass haben, zum Campus zu kommen. Kurse beginnen dann im späten Januar für das Frühjahrssemester, was vielleicht auch ein Hinweis auf die geringe Anzahl der Einreichungen für diesen Monat ist. Aber nichts davon erklärt wirklich die geringe Anzahl der Einreichungen für Februar. Man könnte auch vermuten, dass jeder Projekt dieser Art anfangs einen Anfangsschub an Energie und Aufregung haben wird, der dann natürlich abklingen wird. Um diesem Trend entgegenzuwirken, haben wir den Carpool Challenge Week erstellt, eine besondere Blitzkampagne im März, um das Projekt wiederzubeleben, was tatsächlich zu einem Anstieg der Einreichungen im entsprechenden Monat führte.

It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as winning a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change throughout the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreased.",

Ein ETF gibt Ihnen die Diversifizierung eines Indexfonds und die Vorteile der Einzelaktienbesitz wie die Fähigkeit, kurz zu verkaufen, auf Margen zu kaufen und bis zu einer einzigen Aktie in jeder Transaktion zu kaufen.  Obwohl diese Vorteile sehr attraktiv sind, sind die Gebührenquoten von ETFs deutlich niedriger als die der durchschnittlichen Fondsgesellschaft.  Leider gibt es einige Nachteile, wie beispielsweise die Notwendigkeit, eine Provision für jede Transaktion mit ETFs zu zahlen, genau wie bei einer Aktienbestellung.  Ein weiterer Vorteil von ETFs ist die breite Palette an verfügbaren Fonds.  Obwohl diese Vorteile klar sind, ist es immer eine gute Übung für den gewieften Anleger, zu bewerten, ob die angegebenen Vorteile, wie Diversifizierung, tatsächlich existieren und in welchem Umfang sie existieren.  Für die Zwecke dieser Bemühungen werden wir das ETF IHF untersuchen und es gegen die besten 10 Hintergrundbesitzungen vergleichen, die die ETFs ausmachen, um zu bestimmen, ob die Vorteile des Besitzes einer einzelnen ETF den Vorteilen eines diversifizierten Portfolios der zehn Aktien nahe kommen und ob es bessere Konfigurationen der gleichen Aktien gibt, die ein optimales Schärfe-Verhältnis oder Rendite bieten.\n\nUm das ETF zu bewerten, würde es sich zu umständlich werden, jede Holding aufzuführen, daher haben wir beschlossen, nur die besten 10 Haltungen aufzuführen, die 63,58 % aller Vermögenswerte des ETF ausmachen.  Unter diesem Abschnitt sind die besten 10 Haltungen und das Prozentsatz der Gesamtwerte.\n\nUm zu schätzen, wie gut diese 10 Aktien das ETF IHF als Ganzes darstellen, können wir den aktuellen % der Vermögenswerte, normalisiert auf 100 %, verwenden, um die Beiträge jeder Aktie zu einem Portfolios Beta und Rendite zu berechnen, wenn das Portfolio aus diesen 10 Aktien bestünde und in demselben Verhältnis, das der ETF durch ihre Haltungen festgelegt hat.  Die Berechnungen von Beta und Rendite sind in dem untenstehenden Diagramm enthalten.\n\nAus dem Diagramm geht hervor, dass die Rendite eines Portfolios, das nur die besten 10 Haltungen enthält, 6,11 % höher ist als das ETF, eine Renditeerhöhung von 16 %.  Es ist auch offensichtlich, dass das Beta der 10 besten Haltungen 0,12 geringer ist als das Gesamtbeta des ETF.  Aus den Ergebnissen, die bislang erreicht wurden, scheint ein Portfolio der besten 10 Haltungen eine höhere Rendite mit einem niedrigeren Beta bieten zu können.  Es besteht jedoch die Möglichkeit, dass die Mittelwerte dieser beiden Portfolios nicht statistisch unterschiedlich sind.\n\nUm zu bestimmen, ob diese Portfolios statistisch unterschiedlich sind, wird die Standardabweichung jeder der besten 10 Aktien ermittelt und auf 100 % normalisiert, um ihre kumulierte Standardabweichung mit der des ETF IHF zu vergleichen.\n\nEnglish translation back to English:\n\n[REWRITE] An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security designed to track an index, a commodity, or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.

He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking.

    "raw_output": "Der Traumland ist eines von Edgar Allan Poe's selbstproklamierten besseren Gedichten. In \"Traum-Land\" verwendet Poe den Begriff \"Thulé\" in Zeile 6 und 56, den Mabbott auf Virgil zurückführt. Virgil verwendete den Begriff in Bezug auf eine Insel nördlich von Britannien, die die Griechen als Rand der bekannten Welt ansahen. Es ist sicher, dass Virgil den Begriff tatsächlich verwendete; jedoch gibt es eine aktuellere Quelle, zu der einige Anerkennung entgegengebracht werden muss. Poe war sehr an deutschen Autoren interessiert.\n\nDieser Zitat ist wichtig, weil es Poe's Bekanntheit mit Gothes Schreiben zeigt. Karl J. Arndt, in seinem Buch \"Poe's Politian und Goethe's Mignon\", kommentiert die Ähnlichkeit ihrer beiden Gedichte und zieht den Schluss, dass Poe Gothe nachgeahmte.\n\nDie Oxford Companion to English Literature spricht von Gothe als eines der berühmten Schreiber des poetischen Dramas Faust, das in zwei Teilen veröffentlicht wurde, der erste im Jahr 1808 und der zweite im Jahr von Gothes Tod 1832. In der poetischen Verse des zweiten Teils von Faust liegt ein kurzer Gedichtbogen namens \"Der König von Thulé\" verborgen. Das Gedicht handelt von einem König, dessen Frau nachdem sie ihm ein Gefäß schenkt, nach ihrem Tod stirbt. Nachdem seine Frau gestorben ist, beginnt er zu trinken und zu weinen, weil er die Erinnerungen an seine tote Königin vor sich hat. Dann entscheidet er, dass es Zeit für ihn ist zu sterben und gibt seine Besitztümer an seine Kinder ab, mit Ausnahme des Gefäßes. Er geht dann an eine Klippe, wirft das Gefäß in den Ozean, schließt die Augen und stirbt. Der Charakter des Königs von Thule und die Beschreibung des Königs in Traum-Land sind sehr ähnlich, vielleicht ein dunkler Doppelgänger von Poe's Verlust und seinem Trinken. Faust wurde auch in eine romantische Tragödie von H P Grattan 1842 zusammengestellt, was weniger als ein Jahr vor Poe's Verwendung des Begriffs Thule in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" war.\n\nPoe referiert Thule zweimal in seinen gesammelten Schriften. Einmal verwendet Poe \"ultma Thule\" in The Pit and the Pendulum, aber er verwendet diesen Ausdruck in \"Traum-Land\" zweimal, als Rand für das Gedicht. \"Der König von Thule\" und \"Traum-Land\" können als Begleitstücke gelesen werden. In \"Traum-Land\" sagt der Sprecher. Er beschreibt dann die Landschaft von Thule und wie sie dunkel, einsam, von Toten umgeben ist, und er sieht eine schattierte Welt ohne Farbe. Alle dieser Szenen würden man in \"Der König von Thule\" von Gothe lesen, da er seine Frau gerade verloren hat, einsam ist und seine Fähigkeit, zu regieren, oder sogar zu leben, verloren hat. Das gesamte Gedicht ist eine Beschreibung, als ob der Sprecher in Gothes Gedicht getreten wäre.\n\nGothe war ein bedeutender Autor, den Poe kennen gelernt haben würde, wenn nicht für den Respekt, den er für Tennyson hatte. Poe sagte Folgendes, als man ihn fragte, ob er Tennyson bewunderte. Außer der Verbindung zu Tennyson würde Poe durch die vielen Wiedergaben, die nach der originalen Veröffentlichung stattfanden, an Gothes Werk ausgesetzt gewesen sein.\n\n[REWRITE]\nDream-land is considered one of Edgar Allan Poe's more notable poems.

To claim punitive damages, the plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant's actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known that not cleaning the spill would probably cause harm because multiple customers slipped and fell in the months prior to Palmer's accident; and despite this knowledge, he still failed to clean the spill. Palmer's argument that Martin's actions were despicable are less convincing, but are still reasonable given the fact that six slip-and-fall incidents occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate measures to ensure the safety of his store. On October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne, an employee of D&D Markets, informed his manager, Paul Martin, of an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on a break and \"didn't have time for customer complaints.\" At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way. At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill and suffered a serious back injury. Before Palmer's accident, five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D's in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damage claim. In California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be \"despicable\" and committed with \"a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff's rights when the defendant \"was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.\" Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",

Einer der Hauptschwerpunkte des heißen Diskurses in der Klasse war, ob oder nicht der Islam eine feindliche Religion ist.  Ich glaube, dass die Frage noch heute mehr relevant ist als je zuvor.  Wenn ich mich auf die Ereignisse seit 9/11 zurückbegebe, habe ich persönlich beobachtet, wie die Massenmedien von einer feindlichen Sichtweise des Islam und Extremisten zu einer extremer Form der Toleranz für den Islam in Amerika wechselten.  Ich denke nicht, dass wir 2001 jemals einen Präsidentschaftskandidaten mit dem Namen Borac Obama hätten haben können, der eine offensichtliche muslimische Hintergrund in seiner Familie hatte.\nDie Biographie des Propheten fasziniert mich, weil, laut dem, was ich über die Geschichte Mohammeds weiß, der Biographie widerspricht der Charakter des Mohammed.  Aus dem, was ich weiß und gelernt habe in der Vergangenheit, dachte ich, dass Mohammed Zwänge zum Islam gezwungen hätte.  Er würde Konquiere und übernehmen Stämme und zwingen sie dann dazu, die Islamreligion anzunehmen.  Aber laut der Biographie wurde Mohammed als ein Art Märtyrer geschrieben, der missverstanden und sich sogar anderen gegenüber bescheiden zeigte.  Und nachdem einer nach dem anderen kamen zu sehen die ‘Wahrheit’ in seinen Lehren und suchten ihn auf.\nEs gibt auch einige unglaubliche Ähnlichkeiten zwischen der Missionen des Jesus und die ‘Wunder’ des Mohammed.  Die offensichtlichste ist, als er Schafe und Milch nahm und es multiplizierte, sodass es für mehr als 40 Männer genug gab.  Diese Art der Schreibweise macht mich glauben, dass die Schreiber Mohammed als einen bescheidenen Propheten darstellen wollten, der nichts beweisen musste, sondern einfach in Wahrheit und Wunder lebte.  Diese Art der Logik ist der Schlimmste, weil sie die Wunder und das Leben Jesu Christi herunterspielt.  Für mich ist es, als stieben sie und versuchten, den Lebens- und Personlichkeit des Jesus durch Mohammed zu klauen.\nEs gibt auch viele Geschichten in der Biographie, die so erscheinen, als sei es Teil ihrer Agenda, Beweise für ‘Zeugen’ oder von der Art zu liefern, wie sich Menschen ‘selbst’ zum Islam bekehrt haben.  Aber das Problem ist, dass viele Geschichten aus einer dritten Parteiperspektive stammen.  Das ist in der Geschichte, die der Autor illustriert, er hörte, dass so-und-so von so-und-so usw.  Ich gefiel das nicht, weil ihr Gedanke war, dass es Beweise für die Wahrheit der Geschichten lieferte, dachte ich, dass es die Geschichten minderte und sie immer mehr verdächtig erscheinen ließ.\nIch denke, das, was mich am meisten daran stört, ist, dass sie versuchen und den Muhammad als einen gottfürchtigen Mann zu erheben, der bescheiden, liebenswert, weise und sanft war.  Aber die Geschichte widerspricht der Idee, dass Mohammed ein sanfter und bescheidener Mann war, und ich kann nicht umhin, zu denken, wenn die Muslime heute das wahre Wirken hinter Mohammeds Aufstieg zur Macht kennen.\n\nÜbersetzung zurück ins Englisch:\n\n[REWRITE] Almost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.

Wenn wir diese Geschichte in breiten Strichen betrachten, sehen wir einen Trend, der Christentum weiter und weiter von seinem Ursprung entfernt.  Es scheint, dass die heutige Welt ein wachsendes Bewusstsein und einen unerhörten progressiven Trend zeigt.  Während traditionelle Menschen bleiben und sich gegen jedes Art von Denken, das über das gelehrt wurde, wehren werden, mag diese Teilmengen der Bevölkerung möglicherweise nicht prominent genug sein, um die gesamte Bevölkerung zu beeinflussen.  Unter Christen wird ein historisches Bewusstsein in den kommenden Jahren immens wachsen.  Ein Sehnen wird sich verbreiten, um die Lehren zu unterscheiden, die über die Zeit in das Christentum hineingebracht wurden, von dem eigentlichen Zweck der Religion, die ihr Namensgeber ist.  Es mag Jahrzehnte oder sogar Jahrhunderte dauern, aber das Ergebnis wird unvermeidlich sein:  Es wird ein großer Umkehrschlag in der Trend der christlichen Geschichte geben.  Es wird eine Rückkehr zu ihrer ursprünglichen Form geben.  Eine Bewegung wird wachsen, die Schichten der Lehren entfernen wird, ein nach dem anderen, genau wie der Uhr zurückläuft, bis nichts mehr übrig ist, außer einer Vorstellung davon, was Jesus der Menschheit im Auftrag Gottes eingebracht hat, bevor irgendwelche andere Denker solche Ansprüche machten.  Wenn dieser Trend durch die Vereinigten Staaten und Europa geht und Tausende in seinem Gefolge anruft, um wie in der Zeit Jesu zu verehren, nur seine Ideen folgend, wird die Kirche als Institution stark bleiben, um den Weg zu weisen.  Allerdings, weil der theologische Uhrenzeiger rückgängig gemacht wird, wird die extreme Vielfalt in Christentum in immer mehr Einheitlichkeit von Glauben und Praxis umkehren.  Zwischen Regionen, zwischen Konfessionen, zwischen allen Arten von Spaltungen werden wir stattdessen zunehmende Ähnlichkeiten sehen.  Die menschliche Geschichte ist voller großer Umkehrungen.  Ein Beispiel dafür ist, wie Christen zu einer Zeit verfolgt, ausgestoßen und getötet wurden von der römischen Kaiserzeit.  Doch später wurde dieses Reich zu einer christlichen Institution.  Unser Land ging von der Sklaverei der Afroamerikaner zur afroamerikanischen Führung.  Die große Umkehr, die in unserer Zukunft bevorsteht, wird sich in der Arena der christlichen Religion abspielen, indem sie die Geschichte aufsucht, um die Quelle, und die Vielfalt auf dem Weg, aufhebt.  Es ist wichtig zu beachten, dass ein Teil dessen, was diese Entwicklung ermöglichen wird, ein Verfahren sein wird, Jesu Worte als metaphorische Bedeutungen zu lesen, und nicht als wörtliche Aussagen.  Dann, was geschah in der Zeit Jesu?\n        Wenn wir weit genug zurück in die Geschichte blicken, finden wir nur Judentum, das theologische Anfang für die christliche Religion.  Monotheismus, die Wahrnehmung einer gottgeoffneten Religion und die Autorität der hebräischen Schriften, waren alle am Kern der Religion, als die Römer Jerusalem im Jahr 63 v. Chr. in Besitz nahmen.

They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",

Der offensichtliche Hauptbereich ist die Besitzer und Manager der großen Fabriken. Sie möchten nur ihre Unternehmen und Fabriken so groß und großartig wie möglich machen. Sie kümmern sich nicht um jemanden oder etwas, das sich ihnen in den Weg stellt oder getroffen wird, weil es durch ihre Fortschritte entsteht. Nach Upton Sinclairs Werk, \"Die Zeichnung der Gebäude stand klar und schwarz gegen den Himmel; hier und da aus der Masse ragten die großen Schornsteine, mit dem Strom des Rauches, der sich bis ans Ende der Welt erstreckte\". Sinclair versucht, ein Bild von der großen Schädigung zu malen, die diese Verschmutzung schafft. Er zeigt, dass die Besitzer keine Rücksicht auf jemanden oder ein Tier nehmen, das zu Schaden kommt. Sie kümmern sich nicht um die großen Rauchfahnen, die aus den Fabriken aufsteigen, oder das Tierkot- und Urinabfließen aus den Tausenden von Gefangenenställen in Packingtown. Die Besitzer und Manager kümmerten sich auch nicht um ihre Arbeitnehmer, die sie reich machen. Sie würden alles tun, um einen extra Dollar zu machen oder zu sparen, \"So von oben bis unten ist der Ort einfach ein brodelnder Topf von Neid und Hass; es gibt keine Loyalität oder Decence an diesem Ort; es gibt keinen Ort, an dem ein Mann gegen einen Dollar gezählt wird\".

Es gab Gewerkschaften, die gebildet wurden, aber diese taten mehr Schaden als Hilfe, indem sie Geld von den armen Arbeitern machte.

They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" Sinclair tries to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. The owners and managers did not care about their employees who work for them to make them rich. They would do anything to make an extra dollar or save one, \"So from top to bottom the place is simply a boiling cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" They force their employees to work awful hours and then without any warning they might lay off multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era that The Jungle is set in, there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers' safety or well-being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never directly says it, the people who worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions formed, but these often did more harm than good, making money off the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\" [/REWRITE]",

Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30).

Einige dieser Techniken sind effektiver als andere. F. Scott Fitzgerald verwendet viele dieser verschiedenen Techniken in seinem Roman The Great Gatsby. Manchmal verwendet Fitzgerald einen Adjektiv und einen Nomen zusammen, die normalerweise nicht so in Verbindung stehen, um den Lesern ein bestimmtes Aura um ein Thema zu geben. Andere Male verwendet er eine Bedeutung für ein Symbol und verwendet es dann für denselben Zweck. Fitzgerald verwendet diese letzte Technik mit vielen Farben, einschließlich Gold, Grün, Weiß/ Grau und Rot/Rosa. In seinem Roman The Great Gatsby baut Fitzgerald eine Bedeutung für Farben auf, insbesondere Weiß/Grau und Rot/Rosa, und verwendet diese dann später, um den Lesern ein bestimmtes Erinnerung an ein Gefühl um ein wichtiges Objekt zu geben.\n\nFitzgerald baut die Bedeutung auf, die er auf weiß/grau verwendet, und verwendet sie dann, um Lesern eine bestimmte Erinnerung an ein Gefühl um ein wichtiges Objekt zu geben. Die Bedeutung, die Fitzgerald für Weiß/Grau baut und verwendet, ist Uniformität, mit Weiß als etwas Nützlicher und höheren Standes und Grau als etwas Älter und verblasst. Fitzgerald setzt diese Bedeutung am Anfang des Romans mit konstanten Verwendungen beider fest. Daisy und Jordan sind ständig \"in Weiß\" (8) - tatsächlich trägt jeder immer weiß: Nick trägt \"weiße Flanellen\" (41) zu Gatsbys Party, Tom trägt \"ein weißes Hemd\" (36) wenn er Myrtle trifft, und Catherine ist \"pulverweiß\" (30). Tatsächlich sind die einzige Zeit, an der Menschen nicht in Weiß sind, wenn Nick seine Eindrücke von Gatsbys Party sammelt: \"die Halle... sind aufdringlich mit primären Farben\" (40). Fitzgerald definiert diese beiden Farben weiterhin, indem er viele alltägliche, unbedeutende Dinge in diese Farben kleidet: als Nick zur Arbeit geht, geht er \"die weißen Tiefen des unteren New Yorks\" (56) hinunter, die Namen der Leute bei Gatsbys Partys sind \"graue Namen\" (61) auf Nicks Zeitplan, Catherines Wohnung ist \"ein Stück in einem langen weißen Kuchen von Wohneinheiten\" - Uniformität (28). Er beschreibt auch einfache oder alltägliche Menschen oder Orte als weiß oder grau: Jordan und Daisy hatten eine \"weiße Jugend\" (19) zusammen, es gibt \"graue Autos\" und \"graue Land\" (23) im Tal der Asche, das \"italienische Kind\" im Zug ist \"grau\" (26), und der Hundehändler ist \"ein grauer alter Mann\" (27). Nachdem Fitzgerald genügend Bedeutung auf Weiß/Grau aufgebaut hat, verwendet er sie, um Uniformität oder Unbedeutung an bestimmten Themen zu zeigen. Diese Nutzung von Farben, um Lesern etwas zu zeigen, beginnt mit Daisy. Nach langer Zeit ohne bedeutungsvolle Verwendung beider Farben beschreibt Fitzgerald Daisy als \"in weiß\" gekleidet in \"ein kleines weißes Wagentürchen\"; die Leser beginnen, Daisy als weniger einer Charakter zu sehen, mehr als nur eine uniforme Hinzufügung, etwas, das Gatsby will und sehnt (74). Fitzgerald verwendet mehr dieser Technik um Daisy herum, um dieses Eindruck von Daisy zu geben, als eine uniforme Hinzufügung, zum Beispiel gibt es einen \"grauen Schleier von Daisys Fellkragen\" (18), und sie ist wieder in einem \"weißen\" Kleid (115) bevor Tom und Gatsby sich begegnen.\n\nEnglish translation:\n\n[REWRITE] Many authors use various methods to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude towards important subjects.

Gemeinsame Kulturen umfassen: Tomaten, Zitrusfrüchte, Blattsalate, Kürbis, Brokkoli, Kräuter, Baumfrüchte wie Pflaumen und Zitronen, Beeren, Honig und Paprika. Es gibt einen erheblichen Markt für Bio-Konsumgüter der Gemeinschaftsbetriebe in der Region San Diego, mit vielen lokalen Organisationen, die lange Wartelisten haben. Bio-Eier und Milch sind auch sehr beliebt. Viele Bio-Betriebe bieten zudem Touren durch ihre landwirtschaftlichen Betriebe sowie Zugang für Wandern, Vogelbeobachtung und andere Freizeitaktivitäten an. Dies ist der Typ von Betrieb, der es dem Eigentümer ermöglichen würde, die Vorteile der Regierungsprogramme zu nutzen, während die Habitat verbessert wird, was den Freizeitnutzen und die Schaffung einer Gelegenheit für Farmenfahrten und andere Programme zur Erschließung von Einnahmen oder für Bildungszwecke ermöglicht.\n\nZusätzlich zum Ausfüllen eines potenziell lukrativen Nischenmarktes umfassen die Vorteile des Bio-Landbaus oft eine höhere Artenvielfalt bei Pflanzen und Wildtieren in der Gegend, dank der Mangel an Chemikalien im Boden und im Wasser.  Allerdings hat Bio-Landbau in einigen Hinsichten höhere Kosten als konventioneller Landbau. Er erfordert intensiveren Arbeitskräfte und Management zum Entfernen von Schädlingen und Unkraut und zur Düngung des Bodens ohne Chemikalien, und Verluste sind oft größer als mit konventionellen Methoden, während ein kleiner Biohof auch die Effizienz des großen Unternehmens fehlt. Praktiken, die nicht mit dem Bio-Landbau zusammenhängen, aber dem Wildtieren zugute kommen, können auch höhere Arbeitskosten verursachen, einschließlich der Pflanzung von Zwischenfrüchten, der strategischen Weidewechselung, der Entfernung invasiver Arten und der aktiven Bewirtschaftung der Pflanzenwachstums, um bestimmte Bedingungen wie Ränderhabitate oder Blöcke freier Erdoberflächen bereitzustellen. Daher gibt es viele Gründe, warum der Eigentümer in diesem Beispiel möglicherweise finanzielle Hilfe oder Expertise in Anspruch nehmen möchte, um sowohl Gewinne als auch Habitatqualität zu maximieren.\n\nDas für diesen Szenario ausgewählte Land liegt an einem Grundstück neben dem Ort Potrero, in unincorporierten San Diego County, California.

    "original": "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",

Zum Beispiel kann eine Unternehmenskultur die Betonung von Langzeitaufenthalten im Büro oder eine entspanntere Arbeitszeit betonen. Beweise einer Unternehmenskultur sind in Kleiderordnungen, Kommunikationsstilen (direkte v. indirekte Kommunikation, Delegation von Aufgaben), und Personalentscheidungen sichtbar. Einige Unternehmen ermutigen Philanthropie auf jeder Ebene von Mitarbeitern, andere beschränken sie auf „Unternehmensgenehmigte“ Wohltätigkeitsorganisationen oder Spendenaktionen. Man muss nur darauf schauen, wie sich die Unternehmenskultur in den USA von Unternehmen zu Unternehmen unterscheidet (und tatsächlich existiert auch eine Intra-Unternehmensvielfalt von Region zu Region, von städtischen zu suburbanen Umgebungen eingeschlossen), um die Vielfalt der Vorstellungen zu schätzen, die in einer bestimmten gesellschaftlichen Kultur wohnen können. Bestimmte Kulturen sind nicht annähernd so segmentiert wie die amerikanische Kultur, und mögen uniformer erscheinen, wenn man sie aus der Ferne betrachtet, aber ein ähnliches Äußeres ist einfach ein Hinweis darauf, tiefer zu bohren.\n\nWerte sind noch wichtiger zu verstehen, weil sie den Warum einer Kultur liefern. Wenn der Gesichtserhalt oder die Gemeinschaftsverständigung innerhalb einer Kultur geschätzt werden, ist es sicher, dass ein Verhandler seinen Unternehmen oder seinen Vorgesetzten nicht öffentlich schamlos machen wird, um auf der Verhandlungstafel erfolgreich zu sein. Ebenso wird ein Verhandler, der einer Kultur angehört, die dem wert legt, einen harten Deal zu erzielen, nicht unbedingt dazu getrieben sein, sich am frühesten Gelegenheit zu ergeben. Diese allgemeinen Spekulationen berücksichtigen ist wichtig, bevor man am Verhandlungstisch erscheint. Doch ist es nützlich, etwas über seinen Gegner auf persönlicher Ebene zu lernen, um die Verhandlung effektiv zu gestalten.\n\n[REWRITE]\n\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined by what it is not, what it is, and what it represents. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it something specific. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements like “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic.

This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God.

The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct.

    "raw_output": "Original German Translation:\nUm die Zeit des fünften oder sechsten Jahrhunderts v. Chr. wurde ein Prinz geboren, der eines Tages Buddha genannt werden würde. Während seines Lebens verzichtete er auf die Welt und wurde erenlicht, und seine Lehren führten zur Bildung des Buddhismus – des orthodoxesten Zweigs davon ist der Theravada-Buddhismus. Die Religion ist etwa 2500 Jahre alt; sie sieht heutzutage anders aus als zu der Zeit, als Buddha lebte. Dies wird überall sichtbar, für ein Beispiel in der Theravada-Nation Sri Lanka, wo das jährliche Wassertrennungsfest beobachtet wird. Mönche und Laien nehmen gemeinsam an diesem Fest teil, und es hat einige religiöse Bedeutung, trotzdem Buddha nie über irgendeine Festlichkeit dieser Art gelehrt hat. Diese Unterschiede reichen von den oberflächlichen Traditionen bis hin zum soteriologischen Kern der Religion. Die Theravada-Buddhistengemeinde, sowohl aus monastischem als auch aus laienhafter Perspektive, musste ihre dogmatischen Prinzipien im Laufe der Zeit ändern. Dies kann auf Kräfte sowohl von außen als auch von innen, sowohl feindselig als auch gnädig, zurückgeführt werden.\n\nEs gibt eine Reihe von qualifizierenden Begriffen, über die diese Diskussion häufig Gebrauch macht. Es gibt das Konzept von innen gegen Außen. Hier ist eine innere Kraft definiert als eine Kraft, die von Mitgliedern der Buddhasasana ausgeht, unabhängig von dem monastischen Status. Eine äußere Kraft ist jede Kraft von Nicht-Buddhisten. Eine feindselige Kraft ist jede Kraft, die dem Buddhisten-Gemeinde schadet oder beabsichtigt, sie zu schädigen – eine Kraft, die von einem negativen Wahrnehmung des Buddhismus entsteht. Eine gnädige Kraft ist eine Kraft, die nicht beabsichtigt, Schaden oder Hilfe für die Buddhistengemeinde zu zufügen – obwohl sie letztlich eines oder das andere als Beiwerk an der Hand bringt. Diese Begriffe werden wiederholt im Laufe dieser Diskussion aufkommen.\n\nZu Beginn ist es wichtig, die Grundlagen der Religion zu erforschen – die Lehren, die an der Spitze des Theravada-Buddhismus liegen. Buddhisten suchen Zuflucht im Dreier-Gemälde – im Buddha, im Dhamma und im Sangha. Das Dhamma besteht im Wesentlichen aus den Tripitaka – den drei Körben – der buddhistischen Schriften. Das Sutta Pitaka enthält alle Suttas, das Vinaya Pitaka enthält die disziplinarischen Regeln, und das Abhidhamma Pitaka enthält die metaphysischen Bestandteile des Buddhismus. Die metaphysischen Vorstellungen umfassen Dinge wie Anatta – keine Seele, Dukkha – innewohnender Leid in dem Leben, und Anicca – Unveränderlichkeit von allem. Nur durch die Anerkennung dieser Konzepte kann man Sansara, den Kreislauf von Tod und Wiedergeburt, beenden, der kontinuierlich geschieht. Neben Sansara wird auch lobha – Begierde, dosa – Hass, und moha – Wahn – enden, wenn man erenlicht wird. Im Vinaya Pitaka sind Regeln für das Leben festgelegt. Für Laien gibt es fünf Gebote (Ich werde nicht töten, ich werde nicht lügen, ich werde nicht stehlen, ich werde nicht unangemessenes Verhalten zeigen, und ich werde keine berauschenden Substanzen zu mir nehmen). Für Mönche gibt es viele mehr disziplinarische Regeln, die zu befolgen sind. Die grundlegendste dogmatische Vorstellung im Buddhismus ist die Vorstellung der vier edlen Wahrheiten. Als erste, Dukkha; die Wahrheit, dass das Leben Leiden ist. Als zweites, dass die Beziehung führt zu Leiden. Als drittes, dass Leiden überwunden werden kann.\n\n[REWRITE]\nAround the time of the 5th or 6th century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born.

(Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

Der Höhepunkt dieser Rivalität war der mexikanisch-amerikanische Krieg von 1846-1848, in dem die Vereinigten Staaten Mexiko angriffen und besiegten und sich Texas und den amerikanischen Südwesten als neues Territorium sicherten.  Viele andere Konflikte zwischen den beiden Nationen fanden statt, schließlich erloschen sie gerade noch vor dem Ersten Weltkrieg.  Die Rivalität begann, als Amerikaner und Mexikaner auf wichtige Themen wie Religion, Kultur und Tradition auseinandergingen und hatte einen großen Konflikt von materiellem Interesse (Schmitt 1974 S. 30-31).\n\nDas ist nicht unähnlich vielen anderen Nationen, die eine lange Rivalität mit einem Nachbarn haben.  Nationen, die eine gemeinsame Grenze teilen, neigen dazu, Interessengegensätze zu haben, die sich zu konkurrierenden Positionen zwischen den Nationen entwickeln.  Die Vereinigten Staaten und Mexiko sind nicht unähnlich vielen anderen langfristigen Rivalitäten zwischen Nationen, die eine gemeinsame Grenze teilen.  David M. Pletcher (1977) sagt, dass \"nur in Mexiko und Kuba kann man lang anhaltende übergeordnete amerikanische diplomatische Probleme finden\" (S. 41).  Tatsächlich sind beide Nationen geografisch nah an den Vereinigten Staaten und waren Rivalen der Vereinigten Staaten, während andere Nationen in Lateinamerika gute Beziehungen mit den Vereinigten Staaten hatten.  \n\nReligiöse Fragen schufen einen Riss zwischen den beiden Nationen, ein Problem, das viele Nationen durch die Geschichte geplagt hat.  Sally Frahm (2001) sagt, dass \"wenn Amerikaner im zwanzigsten Jahrhundert gegen Faschismus und Kommunismus standen, im achtzehnten und neunzehnten Jahrhundert gegen Katholizismus und Monarchie\"  (S. 86).  Nicht unähnlich der Rivalität zwischen den Vereinigten Staaten und der Sowjetunion während des Kalten Krieges war diese Rivalität sowohl eine ideologische Konfrontation als auch eine Konkurrenz um Interessen, die jede Nation für vital hielt.  In diesem Fall jedoch basierte die ideologische Konfrontation nicht auf der politischen Struktur, sondern auf den religiösen Vorlieben der Vereinigten Staaten und Mexikos.  Diese Misstrauen wuchs aus dem Misstrauen zwischen den Engländern und Spaniern.  Die Erbinummer dieser Gefühle des Misstrauens von ihren ehemaligen Kolonialherren war ein bedeutender Hinderungsgrund für die Einrichtung von freundlichen Beziehungen zwischen den Vereinigten Staaten und Mexiko.\n\nDiehl und Goerts (2000) führen 17 Konflikte zwischen Mexiko und den Vereinigten Staaten im 57-jährigen Rivalitätszeitraum auf.  Die Mehrheit der Konflikte zwischen der Rivalitätszeitraum, die von Diehl und Goerts beschrieben, sind territoriale Fragen, die mit Grenzüberfällen aus mexikanischem Territorium in die Vereinigten Staaten und andere Grenzprobleme zusammenhängen.  Die Grenzüberfälle von Banditen und Auswüchsen aus amerikanischen Grenzstädten waren ein großes Problem, das bis zu dem Zeitpunkt andauerte, an dem sowohl die Vereinigten Staaten als auch Mexiko militärische Kräfte auf ihren Grenzen einsetzten (Schmitt 1974 S. 97).  \n\nSchmitt (1974) erklärt, dass die Rivalität zwischen den beiden Nationen zu abnehmen begann, als \"Mexiko deutlich von den Vereinigten Staaten in einem wesentlichen Maße abhängig wurde\" (S. 109) und schließlich endete, als die amerikanischen Ambitionen \"sich von territorialer Expansion zu wirtschaftlicher Intervention in Mexiko\" (S. 110) im späten 19. Jahrhundert änderten.\n\n[REWRITE] The United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations that were once plagued by a long-standing rivalry spanning 57 years, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145). The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory. Many other clashes occurred between the two nations, finally subsiding just before the First World War. The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed over key issues such as religion, culture, and tradition and had a major conflict of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31). This is not unlike many other nations that have a long-standing rivalry with a neighbor. Nations that share a border tend to have clashes of interests that lead to the creation of rival positions between the nations. The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other long-standing rivalries between nations that share a common border. David M. Pletcher (1977) states that \"only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America have enjoyed good relations with the United States. Religious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem that has plagued many nations throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) states that \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\"  (p. 86). Not unlike the Cold War's rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, which was both an ideological struggle and a competition over interests each nation deemed vital, in this case, however, the ideological struggles were not based on the political structure but on the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico. This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish. Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico. Diehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States during the 57-year rivalry period. The majority of disputes between the rivalry period, described by Diehl and Goerts, are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into the United States and other frontier problems. Border raids by bandits and outlaws from American border towns were a major problem that persisted until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97). Schmitt (1974) explains that the rivalry between the two nations began to abate as \"Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a significant way\" (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions \"changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico\" (p. 110) in the late 19th century.

Ich hatte meine Beruf gewählt, weil ich ein tief verwurzeltes Bedürfnis nach Sicherheit und Stabilität hatte, die ich als Kind nicht hatte. „Du kannst immer Arbeit finden, Menschen werden immer krank.\" war das Mantra, das ich als ich die Adoleszenz erreichte und darüber hinaus hörte. Also, auch wenn mein Traum es war, Wissenschaftlerin oder Journalistin zu werden – vorzugsweise ein bisschen von beidem – wählte ich den Beruf der Krankenschwester.\n\nDennoch war ich da: 46 Jahre alt und ledig, ohne Geld im Bankkonto und ohne in der Lage sein zu arbeiten. Bis heute bin ich behindert und nach 15 Jahren, in denen ich auf Sozialhilfe für behinderte Menschen angewiesen war, habe ich ganz genau nichts mehr, was ich als \"mein\" bezeichnen kann. Ich komme zurecht, aber jeden Tag ist ein Kampf und eine Bedrohung aus meiner Sicherheit, meiner Sicherheit und meinem Selbstwertgefühl. Nichts mehr ist in meinem Leben sicher, doch ich weiß eines mit Sicherheit: Ich wäre ohne die Hilfe meiner Familie und ein paar guten Freunden nie zurechtkommen. Und glauben Sie mir, wenn ein wahres Unglück eintritt, fühlen Sie sich gar nicht stark. \n\nMeine These ist, dass es in Leben immer Notfälle gibt - groß oder klein. Es gibt keine Garantie, und keine Vorbereitung kann helfen, wenn man allein ist. \n\nIch stimme ganz und gar der Meinung zu, dass wir in den USA aufhören müssen, alle unsere Eier in das große Regime zu legen; der Zustand ist ohnehin beißlich und bricht zusammen. Doch ich würde lieber sehen, dass Amerikaner wieder lernen, sich gegenseitig zu vertrauen und sich gegenseitig zu helfen und nach Hilfe zu fragen, als jeden von uns einzeln toben und das Überleben in der Wüste zu suchen.\n\nDie konservativen Amerikaner sprechen von dem \"rugged individualismus\", der dieses Land gebaut hat; aber es war nicht der Rugged Individualismus, der unsere Vorfahren in schweren Zeiten aus dem Weg half, sondern es war die Mitleid, das gegenseitige Respekt und die Teilung der Ressourcen, die sie weiterbrachten. Die Pioniere, die die Rocky Mountains in Wagenzügen überquerten, kamen nicht am anderen Ufer an, indem sie das Abenteuer allein angingen.\n\nAlso, bereiten Sie sich vor. Ich habe auch einen Katastrophenkoffer; Ersatzleuchten, Ersatzbatterien, Wasserreinigungstabletten und Plastikfolie und Klebeband für die Fenster, im Falle eines biologischen Angriffs. Ich habe mehrere Taschenlampen und alle möglichen Batterien, viele Kerzen und wasserdichte Streichhölzer und Konserven, auch.

Gibt es Einschränkungen oder Zwänge, die die Richtung des evolutionären Wandels beeinflussen? Obwohl D’Arcy Thompson 1917 bereits festgestellt hat, dass „der Zoologe noch nicht einmal zu träumen beginnt, die einfachsten organischen Formen in mathematischer Sprache zu definieren\", gilt das noch heute. In jüngster Zeit wurde mathematische Modellbildung auf allgemeine Aspekte der Mollusken-Skelettentwicklung sowohl auf der Ebene der Ontogenese als auch der Phylogenese (z.B. Raup und Stanley, 1981) angewendet. Unsere Studie untersucht, wie die mathematische Modellierung der Ontogenese und Phylogenese in Prunum in Kombination mit experimentellen Studien dazu beitragen kann, die Mechanismen zu klären, die den Richtungs- und Größenwandel des evolutionären-entwicklungsbedingten Wandels betreffen. Wir haben X-Röntgenbilder von Prunum-Spezies verwendet, um quantitative Parameter zu bestimmen, die ihrerseits verwendet werden konnten, um hypothetische und reale Skelettformen zu modellieren. Diese Parameter wurden in das Softwareprogramm CerioShell (Stone, 1995) eingegeben. Wir haben hypothetische Schalenmorphologien modelliert, die verwendet werden können, um die Grenzen möglicher morphologischer Veränderungen in Prunum zu interpretieren. Diese Ergebnisse werden mit experimentellen und beschreibenden Studien kombiniert, um die makroevolutionären Ereignisse in dieser Klade besser zu verstehen.\n\nEine Schale kann als eine Struktur betrachtet werden, die sich über eine Zeitdauer von 360 Grad durch den Raum bewegt. Diese Revolutionen oder Wenden einer gewundenen Schale werden als Whorls bezeichnet, die um einen imaginären Mittelpunkt rotieren. Dieser Mittelpunkt verläuft durch die zentrale Säule der Schale und wird als Columella bezeichnet. Die Geschwindigkeit, mit der sich die Whorls erweitern können variieren, und eine kontinuierliche Linie trennt jeden Whirl und wird als Sutura bezeichnet. In den meisten Schalen ist der größte Whirl der Schale der letzte Whirl (Körperwhirl). Die Spitze wird als alle Whorls außer dem letzten betrachtet. Der Apex ist der Gipfel der Spitze und der gegenüberliegende Ende wird als Basis bezeichnet. Das Tier streckt sich aus seiner Schale durch einen Öffnung namens Apertur heraus.\n\nSchalen können in apikal, basal, apertural und abapertural Ansichten betrachtet werden. (Die \"übliche\" Orientierung einer Schale ist eine aperturale Ansicht, wobei die Apertur zum Betrachter zeigt und der Apex nach oben weist.)\n\nEin Verfahren zur Zählung der Whorls ist unten zu sehen. Zuerst sollte die Schale aus der apikalen Sicht betrachtet werden und dann sollte bestimmt werden, wo der erste Sutura beginnt. Eine Linie kann dann gezogen werden, die die Schale in zwei Teile teilt. Whorls werden von dieser Linie gezählt und auf ein Viertel eines Whirl geschätzt.\n\nEine Schale kann als eine Reihe von Öffnungen betrachtet werden, die sich durch Zeit und Raum bewegen, während das Tier seine Schale aufbaut (i.e. akkumuliert). Es ist möglich, den Pfad der Apertur über die Koordinaten des Mittelpunkts jeder Whorl-Aperture sowie der horizontalen und vertikalen Radius der Aperture zu verfolgen.\n\nDiese Trajektorie kann graphisch und mathematisch dargestellt werden.

    "original": "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.

    "raw_output": "The German translation of the original text is:\n\nDie Rate von Neugeborenen- und Säuglingssterblichkeit in Indonesien blieb in den letzten zehn Jahren recht konstant.  Während das Land viele der Millenniumsziele, wie die Ziele für Wasser und Sanitärversorgung, erreichen kann, sind die Rate der Verbesserungen für Kinder- und Müttergesundheit weit hinter den notwendigen Verbesserungen zurück, um die Ziele bis 2015 zu erreichen.  Die verschiedenen Gründe für diese Mängel werden unten diskutiert und zeigen, dass es notwendig ist, das Gesundheitssystem zu stärken anstelle, sich auf programmatische Eingriffe zu konzentrieren.\n\nIndonesien hat Verbesserungen in der Anzahl der Geburten mit einem qualifizierten Gesundheitspersonal vorgenommen, wobei 72% der Geburten diesen Ziel erreichen.  Es gibt jedoch weiterhin traditionelle Helfer, wie Hebammen, die keine medizinischen Eingriffe vornehmen können, falls die Schwangerschaft kompliziert ist (siehe daher die hohe Anzahl der Muttersterblichkeit durch Blutung).  Mit anderen Worten lassen sich die Verbesserungen in diesem speziellen Indikator irreführend ansehen und es gibt noch viel zu tun.  Darüber hinaus ist es zu einer Abnahme der Anzahl der Diarrhoe-Fälle in Kindern unter fünf Jahren gekommen, die von einem Gesundheitspersonal behandelt werden.  Während die Daten zur postnatalen Pflege unvollständig sind, ist klar, dass dieses Gebiet auch ein Anliegen ist, mit niedrigen Raten im ganzen Land.\n\nKaiserschnitt-Raten sind immer noch niedriger als erwartet, etwa 4%.  Die Kaiserschnitt-Raten zeigen jedoch auch ein anderes besorgniserregendes Problem.  Während die Rate von Kaiserschnitten in städtischen Gebieten 7% beträgt, ist sie nur 2% in ländlichen Gebieten.  Dies zeigt das Problem der Gleichheit bei der Versorgung im ganzen Land.  Offensichtlich liegt die Zugänglichkeit der Gesundheitsdienstleistungen im Wesentlichen in städtischen Gebieten.  Ein weiteres Problem der Zugänglichkeit betrifft die vertikale Gleichheit.  Es besteht ein 27-Prozent-Schub bei der Nutzung von Diensten zwischen den ärmsten und reichsten Quintilen.  Offensichtlich finden die Armen es viel schwieriger, Gesundheitsdienstleistungen in Anspruch nehmen zu können, wahrscheinlich aufgrund der Kosten aus eigener Tasche.\n\nBei der Diskussion der nächsten Schritte zur Verbesserung der Neugeborenen- und Muttergesundheitsindikatoren ist die grundlegendste Frage, wie man am effektivsten die Mangel an Dienstleistungen angehen kann.  Insbesondere ist die Frage, ob Indonesien spezifische Programmbereiche entwickeln oder das Gesundheitssystem insgesamt stärken sollte, ohne sich auf die Pränatal- und postnatale Pflege der Mutter und des Kindes zu konzentrieren.  Es ist klar, dass programmatische Ansätze, um die oben genannten Probleme zu lösen, anziehend sind.  Sie haben nicht nur viel zielgerichtetere, verhandelbare Ziele, sie erzielen auch in der Regel schnellere Ergebnisse.  Es gibt jedoch einige Nachteile zu beachten.  Ein bedeutendes Nachteil ist, dass das Investieren in Programmierung in einem bestimmten Bereich des Gesundheitssektors bedeutet, dass das Geld für andere Bereiche leidet und die menschlichen Ressourcen sich der Arbeit in dem Bereich zuwenden, der mehr Ressourcen hat (das Beispiel für die Auswirkungen der internationalen Finanzierung auf HIV/AIDS und die Auswirkungen auf die Familienplanung ist ein Beispiel).  Darüber hinaus resultiert die Durchführung mehrerer paralleler Programme in einem Bereich in einer Duplikation von Dienstleistungen, die auch zwischen den Programmen keinen Abstimmungsprozess durchlaufen.  Dies führt zu einer Zunahme an Formularen und Papierkram für Ausstattung und Finanzierung.\n\nThe English translation back to the original is:\n\n[REWRITE]The rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained relatively stable for the last ten years. While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015. The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\nIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target. However, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage). In other words, the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done. In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional. While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\nCesarian-section rates are still lower than expected, around 4%. The c-section rates also point to another concerning issue. While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural. This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country. Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas. Another issue of access concerns vertical equity. There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles. Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nWhen discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service. Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child. There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive. Not only do \"vertical approaches\" that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.

Die Erschießung selbst überwältigte ihn, alle seine Sinne waren betäubt, da er die \"unbekannte Hand\", die ihn forttrug, nicht bemerkte; er erlebte seine Verzweiflung wieder, entfernt vom Schock des Schmerzes, da der Schmerz jetzt konstant und mit Angst, statt mit Überraschung verbunden war.  Mit Oliviers Überwältigung ergibt sich die Frage, wessen Wille sein Unglück verursacht hat, da es sicher nicht sein eigen war.  Diese Erschießung unterstreicht die Idee, dass Oliver über nichts mehr Kontrolle hat, da er sich nicht einmal bemüht, Kontrolle über einen Ereignisses Lauf zu gewinnen, selbst wenn sein Leben in Gefahr ist.  Auch ein wachsendes Gefühl der Niederlage bei Oliver wird durch diese Auswahl angedeutet, als ob alter Fagin ihn bereits gebrochen hätte, ihn in die Annahme dieser Verzweiflung gezwungen hatte, seine Fähigkeit, zu reagieren.

Ich tat mein Bestes, um ihnen in allen Fächern zu helfen, in denen sie Schwierigkeiten hatten, aber meine Stärken lagen in Englisch und Lesen. Ich wurde von einem der Lehrer gebeten, einem Jungen namens Adrian zu helfen, der in der dritten oder vierten Klasse war. Er hatte große Schwierigkeiten beim Lesen und es fiel mir auf, dass etwas nicht stimmte. Manche Buchstaben verstand er, wie sie sich aussprechen, andere nicht mal annähernd. Es war das Merkwürdigste. Ich war mir sicher, dass er einem Latino-Mann entsprang, aber der Junge sprach perfekt Englisch. Wir kämpften weiter, bis ich seine Mutter traf. Ich half gerade ein paar Jungen zu babysitten, während der Rest der Gruppe auf einer Exkursion war, als seine Mutter hereinkam. Sie sprach kein Wort Englisch, nur Spanisch. Mit meinem sehr schlechten Wissensstand im Spanisch (ich lernte gerade erst) konnten wir uns aber irgendwie verständigen. Es fiel mir dann wie ein Schlag ins Gesicht: Adrian konnte lesen, er wusste nur nicht gut, wie sich die englische Alphabet ausgesprochen wird. Ob dies ihm jemals behilflich war, weiß ich nicht, aber ich hoffe, dass es ihm jetzt besser geht.\n\nIch erzähle diese Geschichte, um das Problem der Sprachbarriere in Schulen anzusprechen, besonders in Kalifornien. Ich erzähle sie auch, um zu beweisen, dass es nicht immer so offensichtlich ist wie wir denken. Selbst beim Kind, das perfekt Englisch spricht, kann das Lesen noch eine riesige Hürde sein. Ich denke, dass sich jeder einig ist, dass dieses Problem existiert, aber was tun wir? In Adrians Fall war die Lösung ziemlich einfach: Englisch-Lektionen, insbesondere das Alphabet und die Aussprache. Für die vielen Kinder, die kaum Englisch sprechen, ist die Lösung viel komplexer. Es gibt keine einfache Antwort. Das Bilingual-System, das Immersionsprogramm, private Tücher, ESL-Klassen, kein einzelnes dieser Dinge kann das Problem lösen. Die Lösung liegt in der Kombination aller dieser Dinge!\n\nZunächst einmal ist das Bilingual-System eine großartige Idee. Nicht nur für Kinder, deren erste Sprache Spanisch ist, sondern für alle Kinder. \"Kinder in Zweisprachigkeitsprogrammen haben sich wissenschaftlich bewiesen, besser zu abschneiden als ihre Mitschüler.\" Einiges Angst und Misstrauen umgibt diese Idee, dass es sich um einen Verschwendung von Ressourcen handelt und dass die meisten Kinder in Schulen keinen Nutzen daraus ziehen würden. Aber das ist falsch. Wenn wir diese Art von Programmen in den Klassenzimmern als Regel, statt als Ausnahme, anwenden, würde sich jeder von ihnen profitieren.\n\nWie gehen wir aber vor? Brauchen wir alle Lehrer zu bilingualen zu machen? Nein, das wäre unvernünftig und unrealistisch.

Einige von uns werden in die Sonntagsschule geschickt, um darüber zu lernen, während andere ins Tempel kommen oder innerhalb von sich selbst nach Antworten suchen.  Viele von uns akzeptieren die Religionen, die uns von unseren Eltern übergeben wurden.  Einige von uns jedoch ablehnen sie vollkommen, leugnen, dass es außerhalb unseres eigenen persönlichen egozentrischen Universums nichts geben kann.  Wir übernehmen eine Werte-Struktur nur um sie später zu wechseln und einen anderen an ihre Stelle zu setzen.  Was immer wir wählen, wir reisen, um einen Teil von uns selbst durch unsere eigenen einzigartigen Perspektiven der Spiritualität zu definieren.  Wir suchen nach einem Licht in der Dunkelheit, um uns aus den Schatten herauszuführen und in die Sonne zu bringen.\n\n \"Ein Kardinal,\" sagte mein Vater, als ich ihn fragte, was sein Lieblingstyp von Vogel sei.  Wir saßen auf der Vorderseite unseres Hauses, hörten dem Regen, der auf das Blechdach oben prallte, während wir Zigaretten rauchten.  Die Regenrinnen brachten den Regen herab, ertränkten die Pflanzen an der Kante der Veranda.  Er sah in den Regen hinaus, den Art von Blick, der halb nachsuchend, halb zurückdenkend ist.  Er war im Laufe der letzten Monate dünner geworden und seine Kleidung hing schlaff von seinem Körper ab. Sein Haar war dünner als ich mich erinnerte, spärlicher.  Er starrte immer noch in den Regen hinein, vermeidete Augenkontakt.  Ich fühlte mich allein, ängstlich, und unfähig, meinem Vater wegen der Größe meines Verlustes zu sprechen, weil es nur noch realer machen würde, wenn wir darüber sprachen.  Ich umarmte ihn, setzte mich wieder hin, rückte meinen Stuhl ein bisschen näher an ihn heran und schloss mich in das Gaffen in den fallenden Regen des Juni abends an.\n\nMein Vater starb im Dezember dieses Jahres, fünf Tage nach meinem 22. Geburtstag.  Die Chemo und die Strahlentherapie hatten mein Vaters Leiden nicht gelindert, aber ihn ein paar weitere Monate über die Prognosen der Ärzte hinaus am Leben gehalten; was der Wert war, wenn er nur länger leiden musste, konnte ich nicht definieren.  Was für ein Gott würde das tun, dachte ich mir selbst.  Allein in der Nacht sagte ich keine Gebete.  Wenn Gott existierte, dachte ich, er hatte mich lange Zeit nicht mehr gehört.\n\nIch wollte nicht zusehen, wie er aus diesem Leben in ein anderes ging.  Also tat ich es nicht.  Ich konnte nicht zusehen, wie das Leben, das mich geschaffen hatte, endete.  Ich wollte mich an meinen Vater erinnern, indem ich mich an, wie er gelebt hat, und nicht, wie er gestorben ist.  Außerdem wusste ich, dass ich meinen Vater besser kannte als sie, besser als seine Familie kannte, und wusste, dass Dad nicht wünschen würde, dass sein einziges Kind zu seinem Tod eine Zuschauerin wäre.

Der gotische Modus wurde verteufelt, gelobt, beschuldigt, an nichtige Tiefe zu haben und für das \"schreckliche Erhabene\" gelobt, das es zu erwecken schien (Burke). Die ursprüngliche \"gotische Erzählung\", Horace Walpoles \"The Castle of Otranto\", verwendete die Ideen von \"alt\" und \"modernen\" Romanen, um den proto-gotischen Genre zu schaffen und eine neue Methode der literarischen Ausdrucksform zu schaffen. Walpole verwendete \"alte\" theatralische Elemente und 'neuen' Nachahmungen von Natur in \"modernen\" Romane, um was er \"eine gotische Geschichte\" nannte (Walpole 4). Das Gothic-Genre nutzt viele Rückbezüge auf mittelalterliche gotische Theater, Architektur und Traditionen. Selbst zur Zeit der Veröffentlichung von \"The Castle of Otranto\" war der Begriff \"gotisch\" verwendet worden, um viele verschiedene Völker, Stile und Zeiträume zu beschreiben. Es wurde als archaisch oder unsophistisch in der Konfrontation mit \"modernen\" gesellschaftlichen und literarischen \"Fortschritten\" wahrgenommen. Die Kombination der mehr theatralischen \"Gotischen\" und der neuen Format des Romans (was dem Leser einen persönlicheren Blick auf die Psychologie der Charaktere ermöglicht) ist es, was es Gothic ermöglicht, für so lange Zeit zu bleiben und für einen Leser, der aus der Zeit des ursprünglichen Schreibens weit entfernt ist, zugleich veraltet und neu zu werden.\n\nEines der prominentesten gothischen Ideen in gothischen Romanen ist das Konzept der Ritterlichkeit. Die mittelalterliche Idee der Ritterlichkeit, das Training eines rechten Ritters, wird sowohl aufbewahrt als auch umgewandelt in der ursprünglichen gotischen Erzählung, The Castle of Otranto. Ritterlichkeit ist besonders wichtig für die Gotischen Schriftsteller, weil es das klassische Ritter, tapfer, ehrenhaft, fähig, und der vermutete oder wahrgenommenen Mangel an diesem Ideal, die Schriftsteller (insbesondere Walpole) sahen in der Gesellschaft. Durch die Verwendung der ritterlichen Konzepte und Manieren wird die \"gotische Vergangenheit\" idealisiert und romantisiert (winkend auf die zukünftige Evolution von Gothic zu romantisch) und wird verwendet, um das gegenwärtige zu verbessern. Walpole war, als er The Castle of Otranto schrieb, inmitten einer politisch belasteten Zeit und war entmutigt über die mögliche Zukunft. Er, in Politik und (debatierbar) unfaire Anschuldigungen vertieft, mag sich, selbst wenn nicht explizit, gedacht haben, dass die vermutete Moral und die angeborene \"Gute\" in Menschen in der gotischen Zeit auf irgendeine Weise verloren gegangen sei in den Personen, die die 'aktuelle' Gesellschaft ausmachten. In seinen Schriften ist dies offensichtlich an mehreren Charakteren, einem davon ist der Charakter Frederic. Der Leser kann vor dem Treffen mit Frederic sehen, dass er viele ritterliche Eigenschaften personifiziert, er wird als: \n\nDie Beschreibung von ihm umfasst viele traditionelle ritterliche Bilder; Frederic ist, in erster Linie, ein Prinz, er hat gelitten, wurde angemessen von einer Tragödie betroffen, die er verließ und wird derzeit vermutet, von Infideln getötet zu sein.

The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",

Der Begriff des Supply Chain Management wurde 1982 von Keith Oliver, einem Berater, erfunden. Keith Oliver beschrieb den Gesamtvorgang der Planung, Implementierung und Kontrolle des, was in der Lieferkette passiert, um die Kundenbedürfnisse in einer schnellen und effizienten Weise zu erfüllen.  Es gibt sechs zentrale Elemente in einer Lieferkette: Produktion, Versorgung, Bestand, Standort, Transport und Informationen. Geschäftsleiter verwenden diese sechs zentralen Elemente, um den besten Kunden Service an die Kunden zu liefern. \n\nDie Produktion ist der erste Schritt im Supply-Chain-Prozess. Die Produktion ist die Grundlage für den gesamten Supply-Chain-Prozess. Der Produktionsprozess wird die Zeit, den Grund, den Standort und die Methode beschreiben, wie alles hergestellt wird. Die Manager müssen wissen, was die Kunden wollen. Um die Manager zu wissen, was die Kunden wollen, können sie sich an dem Markt anschauen. Der Markt ist der größte Indikator, um zu bestimmen, was die Kunden verlangen.  Sobald Manager den Markt analysiert haben und die Nachfrage der Kunden verstanden haben, sind sie bereit, zu entscheiden, welche Produkte produziert werden sollen und wie viele dieser Produkte produziert werden sollen. Nachdem die Verwaltung entschieden hat, was produziert wird und wie viel, sind sie bereit, zu entscheiden, wo die Produkte produziert werden sollen und in welchem Werk es am besten für Volumen und Qualität des Produkts ist, wobei der Kundenbedarf und die Kundenzufriedenheit im Auge behalten werden müssen. Nachdem der Standort für die Produktion der Produkte bestimmt wurde, ist das nächste Schritt für Manager der Fokus auf die Arbeitsbelastung, die Wartung von Maschinen. Die Produktion ist ein sehr wichtiger Schritt in der Supply-Chain-Prozess. Jeder Details ist wichtig im gesamten Prozess. Wenn jeder Details nicht entsprechend geplant wird, kann es der Firma viel Zeit und Geld im Laufe der Zeit kosten. Beispielsweise arbeitete ich einmal in Walmart- und Target-Laden. Beide Unternehmen haben ein Design, ein Buch und einen Prozess für jede Einheit des Geschäfts. Es gibt einen geplanten Aufbau, wie die Uniform der Mitarbeiter aussehen sollte, bis zur Empfang von Sendungen aus LKWs. Wenn die Prozesse geplant sind, ermöglicht dies einem Unternehmen, ohne Verwirrung und Erwartungen problemlos zu arbeiten.  \n\nDas zweite Schlüssellement im Supply-Chain-Management ist die Versorgung. Versorgung ist definiert als die strategischen Entscheidungen, die zum Bestimmen der Kernfähigkeiten eines Werkes und der Partnerschaften für Outsourcing getroffen werden sollten. Ein Unternehmen mag viele verschiedene Abteilungen für die Produktion eines einzelnen Produkts haben.  Alle Abteilungen bestehen aus verschiedenen Maschinen, Arbeitern und Spezialisten. Der Manager muss entscheiden, welche Abteilung am besten zu den verschiedenen Prozessen des Produkts passt.  Die Verwaltung mag auch entscheiden, das Werk an andere Unternehmen auszulagern. Der Hauptgrund, warum ein Manager das Werk an Unternehmen auslagern würde, ist, um Geschwindigkeit zu schaffen. Geschwindigkeit ist die Fähigkeit, Qualität und Flexibilität währenddessen zu liefern, während gleichzeitig Kosten reduziert werden oder sich auf niedrige Kosten halten.\n\nEnglish translation:\n\n[REWRITE] Supply chain management is the stream of processes that encompasses the customer order process, from raw materials to the delivery, production, and distribution of products to the customer.

Both companies have a designed layout of how an employee's uniform should look, from receiving shipments from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\nThe second key element in supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product. All divisions consist of different equipment, workers, and specialists. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product. Management may also decide to outsource work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels.",

Birma, auch als Myanmar bekannt, ist ein südostasiatisches Land, das von einem tyrannischen Militärjunta regiert wird, das 1962 durch einen Putsch an die Macht kam. 2007 fanden eine Reihe von Straßenprotesten statt, die ersten öffentlichen Proteste in einer Dekade. An der Spitze einer großen Anzahl von birmanischen Mönchen fanden diese Proteste den Namen „Die Saffronrevolution“ ein, benannt nach der Farbe der Roben, die die Mönche trugen. Nach den ersten wenigen Aufständen begann die breite Öffentlichkeit sich für die Proteste zu interessieren, und während die birmanische Regierung zunächst widerwillig den Mönchen gestattete, friedliche Versammlungen abzuhalten, eskalierte die Gewalt bald in eine von einigen als allumfassende Krieg zwischen den Mönchen und der Militärdiktatur, mit der Militärdiktatur, die aktiv in Klöster und Tempel in der ganzen Landes eindrang und verwüstete. Ausländische Journalisten wurden auf der Stelle eingefangen und inhaftiert, und ein japanischer Fotojournalist namens Kenji Nagai wurde am 27. September 2007 einfach deswegen getötet, weil er an einer Straßenprotest teilgenommen hat. Während die offizielle Opferzahl bei 13 liegt, ist Colonel Hla Win, der sich einige Tage vor der offiziellen Meldung aus der Armee abgesetzt hatte, zitiert worden: „Viele mehr Menschen sind in den letzten Tagen getötet worden, als Sie gehört haben. Die Toten können in Tausenden gezählt werden.“\n\nDas ist nichts Neues. Während diese sind einige der jüngsten Beispiele für Grausamkeiten in unserem Welt, hat die Sehnsucht eines Regimes, Widerstand zu unterdrücken und seine Bürger vollständig zu beherrschen, sich seit der Zeit der Zivilisation etabliert. Frühere römische Kaiser erklärten sich selbst als von den Göttern auserwählt, um über alle Aspekte ihrer Gesellschaft zu herrschen. Japanische Kaiser werden als Götter angesehen, die in unsere Welt geschickt wurden, um ihre Leute zu einer prosperierenden Welt zu führen, durch die Erfindung von Motorola-Handys und Hara-Kiri, und unsere aktuelle Präsidentin, George W. Bush, hat wöchentliche Konferenzen mit Ted Haggard, dem Führer von Stupid People Worldwide, einer Unterabteilung der Republikanischen Partei.\n\nEinige der bekanntesten Beispiele für solche Maßnahmen sind solche Ereignisse wie der Protest am 4. Juni 1989 in Tiananmen-Platz, an dem Intellektuelle, Gewerkschafterinnen und Studenten sich gegen die autoritäre Herrschaft der Regierung versammelten. Die Opferzahl in diesem Fall variiert stark, wobei offizielle Berichte der chinesischen Regierung 200-300 Tote angeben, während die chinesische Rote Kreuz 2.000-3.000 Tote vermeldet. Ein weiteres Beispiel ist die genozidale Massaker der 1990er in Ruanda, wo Hutu-Milizengruppen, unterstützt von der ruandischen Regierung, eine systematische Ermordung aller Tutsi und politischer Mitte, unabhängig von ihren ethnischen Hintergründen, begannen. Hitlers 'Drittes Reich', ein Zeitraum von mehreren Jahren und mehreren Ländern, wo jeder mit jüdischem Hintergrund verhaftet und getötet wurde, ist ein weiteres extremes Beispiel.\n\n[REWRITE]\nHitler is alive in Burma, according to the sign.\n\nEllen Page, the star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with a Sharpie onto her sign.

    "original": "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

Ellingtons Präsenz am Klavier ist in vielen der für diese Aufgabe ausgewählten Kompositionen subtil, aber als Komponist gelang es ihm, reiche und komplexe Stücke zu schaffen, die die individuellen Fähigkeiten der Bandmitglieder hervorheben. Ellington formulierte den Rahmen, in dem ein Solist frei improvisieren konnte, sowie schrieb eng orchestrierte Stücke und Phrasen, die die spezifische Stilistik der Bandmitglieder hervorheben und musikalische Ideen hervorheben. Indem er dies tat, betonte er auch den Ton des Orchesters im Allgemeinen, erzeugte kohärente und originelle Klangfarben für jedes Stück. Ellingtons Meisterschaft bei der Beherrschung der individuellen Spielerklänge sowie der Art und Weise, wie sie sich in einem wachsenden Ensemble fügten, ermöglichte ihm, einige der innovativsten und brillantesten Stücke der Jazzgeschichte zu schreiben.\n\nDas Grove Music-Lexikon erwähnt Creole Love Call, wenn es um Ellingtons Klang und Innovation geht, indem es die Verwendung der Stimme als \"Jazz-Instrument\" über sein gesamtes Karriere hinweg hervorhebt. Dies ist ein frühes Beispiel für Ellingtons Gebrauch der Stimme, um Texturen und Farben hinzuzufügen, ohne die Einschränkung von Texten. Creole Love Call demonstriert auch Ellingtons Fähigkeit, den Stil seiner Solisten zu unterstützen, was sich im gesamten seiner Karriere zeigt. Dieses langsame, bedachte zwölf-Takt-Bluesstück enthält sechs Refrains, wie folgt:\nRefrain 1: Ruf und Antwort zwischen Stimme und Rieden, wobei die Stimme glatt und melodisch beginnt und sich zum Ende hin in einem raueren Ton umwandelt.\nRefrain 2: Gedämpfter Trompetensolo, das die grundlegende Melodie erweitert und mehrere verlängerte Blau-Noten betont.\nRefrain 3: Schwungvolles Klarinetten-Solo in einem hohen Register, begleitet von einem subtilen synkopierten Klavierphrasen.\nRefrain 4: Das gesamte Orchester wiederholt den ersten Refrain mit einem Ruf und einer Antwort durch die Blech- und Rieden-Sektionen.\nRefrain 5: Der klimaktische Refrain des Stücks, wobei die Rieden nun den Ruf beginnen lassen und mit einem synkopierten Stop-Time von der Blech- und Rhythmus-Sektion unterlegt sind.\nRefrain 6: Ein Rückkehr zur Struktur des ersten Refrains, mit Ruf und Antwort zwischen Stimme und Rieden. In diesem Refrain nimmt die Stimme die Klangfarbe des \"Growl\"--Technik an, Solo als Instrument.\nEtikett: Kurzes Etikett, das eine Vocalrun und einen dissonanten Novelty-Ending durch einen Posaunenspiel zeigt.\nEllingtons Gebrauch der Stimme, um eine Dimension von Klangfarbe in diesem Stück beizutragen, ist ein Beispiel für ein stilistisches Merkmal, das durch seine Arbeit hindurchläuft.\n\nIn Hot and Bothered, aufgenommen ein Jahr später, kombiniert Ellington seine Fähigkeit zur engen Orchestrierung mit seinem Gehör für Klangfarben. Ein Ruf und Antwort zwischen \"Bubber\" Miley auf gedämpfter Trompete und Baby Cox Scat-Singing nutzt die Vocal-Elemente von Miley's Spiel und Instrumental-Aspekte von Cox's Stimme, um ein reiches und komplementäres Klangbild zu schaffen. In It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) erweitern diese Ideen Ellington, indem er Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, einen feste Bestandteil in Ellingtons Orchester, mit großem Erfolg verwendet, um die Melodie auf gedämpfter Posaune einzuführen.\n\nHier ist die Übersetzung zurück ins Englisch:\n\n[REWRITE] Duke Ellington's legacy in jazz is largely due to his longevity and, by extension, his creative ability to shape his orchestra.

And it was still there three years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had decided she needed someone rather than a thing. But she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to win her over, but no one had met her expectations. She often questioned herself with this strange notion, trying to figure out what could possibly cause such a strange phenomenon in a teenage girl. The years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to speculate on. So she lived on, constantly questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and, oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very rare. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she countered their energies with her extroverted and fun personality, making her very likable in combination with the fact that she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a peaceful day. As she walked from room to room, searching for new inspiration for herself, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain, as she continued to say \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to offer assistance. \"Ouch... sweetie, I... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and strained, and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, mixed with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately examined, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off a step stool while trying to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.",

Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP.

Die Arbeitslosenquote stieg an, der Immobilienmarkt brach zusammen und viele der größten und wichtigsten Unternehmen des Landes wurden in den Ruin getrieben. Diese Rezession hält an, daher müssen wir die Frage stellen: Wie kam diese Krise zustande und wie können wir sie aufhalten? Kurz gesagt, die Finanzkrise wurde durch egoistische und naiv nachdenkenlose politische Entscheidungen ausgelöst, die Banken und Unternehmen unter Druck setzten, Subprime-Kredite in eine bereits unzureichende und unreife Finanzinfrastruktur zu vergeben. In dieser Zeit wurden Fannie Mae (FNMA) und Freddie Mac (FHLMC) unter Druck gesetzt, diese Hypotheken zu sichern und neu zu verpacken in CDOs und CDSs. Als die Gläubiger diese Kredite nicht mehr bedieneten, waren die Banken mit Kapitalreserve ausgestattet und übertrugen den chaotischen Zustand auf die neu verpackten Hypotheken, die sie verkauft hatten, und auf das gesamte Wirtschaftssystem.\n\nDie Wurzeln der Finanzkrise datieren auf das Jahr 1999 in der Ära Clinton, als der Präsident nach einer zweiten Amtszeit strebte. Er suchte nach einer Möglichkeit, seine Popularität zu erhöhen. Zu diesem Zweck lockerte die Clinton-Administration die Kreditvergabebedingungen, was den tristen Vorläufer des Subprime-Szenarios sieben Jahre später schuf. Steven Holmes von der New York Times berichtete 1999, dass Fannie Mae, der größte Hypothekenverpacker des Landes, zunehmend unter Druck geraten war, Hypothekendarlehen unterhalb und bei mittleren Einkommensgruppen auszugeben und von Aktionären gedrängt wurde, seine außergewöhnlichen Gewinne aufrechtzuerhalten. Holmes ging richtig daran vorbei, die Folgen dieser Maßnahmen zu erkennen: \"Aber das von der Regierung geförderte Unternehmen könnte bei einer Wirtschaftskrise in Schwierigkeiten geraten und zu einer Rettungsaktion seitens der Regierung führen, ähnlich wie die der Sparer- und Kreditgenossenschaften in den 1980er Jahren.\" Wie im Vorwort detailliert beschrieben und wie Holmes vorausgesehen hatte, würde unberatenes Kreditgeben zweifellos zu einer Wirtschaftskrise führen.\n\nViele Faktoren trugen dazu bei, dass die Wirtschaft in eine Talfahrt geriet, darunter die neue und komplexe Struktur der Hypotheken. Veränderliche Hypothekendarlehen, -sicherheiten und Kollateralisierung von Schuldverschreibungen (CDOs) wurden im Vorfeld der Krise ausgiebig eingesetzt und verbanden weitere Sektoren der Wirtschaft mit dem Immobilienmarkt. Dies führte dazu, dass sich US-Haushalte und Finanzmärkte im Allgemeinen selbst über Gebühr in den Immobilienmarkt einklinkten und sich dadurch extrem anfällig für kleine Preissenkungen machten.\n\nTatsächlich brach der Immobilienblase und die Finanzinstitute, die diese Hypotheken-Sicherheiten gekauft hatten, wurden im Stich gelassen. Die fünf größten US-Investmentbanken berichteten zusammen über 4,1 Billionen Dollar an Hypothekendarlehen, was etwa 30% des US-GDP ausmachte. Am Ende wurden Bear Sterns und Merrill Lynch zu einem Spottpreis verkauft, Lehman Brothers wurde zerschlagen, und Goldman Sachs und Morgan Stanley wurden gezwungen, zu kommerziellen Banken zu werden, die unter strenger Regulierung standen. Fannie und Freddie hatten einen Schuldenstand von 5 Billionen Dollar und wurden im September 2008 unter die Kontrolle der Regierung gestellt.\n\nTranslation back to English:\n\n[REWRITE] In 2007, the United States fell into a deep financial crisis.

Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nYour gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had eggs Benedict for breakfast.",

I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime.

Die Hauptsendung handelte von einem Mann in Ashley, Ohio, der seine Ehefrau erstochen hatte. Sein Name war Shad Hostettler, aber seine Frau hieß nicht. Sie zeigten sein Porträtaufnahme, und er sah aus wie pure Bösartigkeit. Sie widmeten nur etwa zwei Minuten dieser Geschichte, weil sie sich noch entwickelte. Die Einzelheiten, die sie gaben, waren, dass er sie mehrfach erstochen und festgenommen hatte. Ich denke, sie haben für diese Geschichte angemessene Zeit eingesetzt.\n\nDie zweite Geschichte handelte von einem frühen Morgen-Schusswechsel von Travis Buyers, 18. Er wurde im Sharon-Woods-Gebiet angeschossen und war schwer verletzt; zu dieser Zeit waren keine Festnahmen gemacht worden, und es gab keine Verdächtigen. Die SWAT-Einheit untersuchte das Verbrechen. Diese Geschichte schien kurze zu sein, und ich denke, das mag daran gelegen haben, dass eine \"schwarze\" Person beteiligt war oder in einem schwarzen Stadtteil lebte. Ich bemerkte (und habe seit Jahren bemerkt), dass Minderheiten bei Verbrechen als Opfer leicht übergangen werden. Wenn ein \"weißer\" Kind oder Erwachsener entführt oder vermisst wird oder ein Opfer eines Verbrechens ist, gehen die Medien verrückt; aber wenn es sich um eine Minderheit handelt, ist es Glück, wenn es überhaupt erwähnt wird.\n\nDie nächste Geschichte handelte von einem Schussloch, das in dem Med-Flight-Helikopter gefunden worden war. Details wurden über den Ort gegeben, an dem sie dachten, dass der Vorfall passiert war. Es wurde festgestellt, dass es sich um eine .22-Kaliber-Kugel aus einem Gewehr handelte, die den Helikopter getroffen hatte. Crime-Stoppers bietet eine Belohnung von fünf tausend Dollar für Hinweise, die zu einer Festnahme des Schützen führen.\n\nDie nächste Geschichte handelte von einer Regen- und Gewittervorhersage für Samstag nachmittag. Sie sagten, dass die Temperaturen am Wochenende in den mittleren bis niedrigen Achtzigern blieben würden. Die Länge der Geschichte war ein bisschen zu kurz, aber sie wollten sie als \"Aufforderung\" nutzen, damit man weiterhin zuhört.\n\nSie lieferten auch eine Geschichte über einen Raubüberfall auf eine UDF an der Clime Road in Columbus. Sie sagten, dass ein dunkelhäutiger Schwarzer den Laden ausgeraubt hatte, der einen Hoodie-Sweatshirt trug. Sie sagten, dass er etwa 1,80 Meter groß und 68 Kilo wog. Ich dachte, sie widmeten ungewöhnlich viel Zeit dem Hinweis darauf, dass er schwarz war und wie dunkel er war.\n\nEine andere Geschichte handelte von Rene Rodriguez, einem verurteilten texanischen Drogen-König. Er war wegen des Versuchs, in großen Mengen Marihuana aus Texas in Ohio zu verteilen, verurteilt worden. Etwas Merkwürdiges bemerkte ich, nämlich dass sie stattdessen von \"300 Monaten\" sprachen, anstatt zu sagen, dass er 25 Jahre im Gefängnis verbringen musste. Ich bin nicht sicher, was der Hintergrund dabei war, ob sie dachten, das klinge schärfer oder was. Sie erwähnten auch, dass er ein Hispano-Mann war, ich denke, das war für die Geschichte nicht wirklich relevant.\n\nEnglish translation:\n\n[REWRITE] I watched two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio.

In dieser Bindung liegen viele Gefühle: Liebe, Stolz, Neid und Grausamkeit, nur um ein paar zu nennen. Brüder verstehen einander, viel besser als jeder andere mit einer solchen Art von Bindung, und sie können sich nur selbst sehen, wenn sie ihren Bruder ansehen. Es ist, wenn die Situation am dramatischsten ist, wenn die wahre Natur dieser Bindung durchscheint, sei es gut oder böse. Wenn diese Gefühle klar werden, tragen sie einen hohen Preis mit sich. Ein Teil des Verständnisses für die in dieser Brüderbindung geborenen Gefühle besteht darin, sich mit den Konsequenzen auseinanderzusetzen, die sie mit sich bringen. Wenn man einen Bruder in die Augen sehen kann und innerhalb dieser Person ihr eigenes Abbild erkennen kann, sieht man sich selbst nicht wie andere, sondern so, wie man wirklich ist. In ihren Handlungen und den Konsequenzen dieser Handlungen liegt ihre wahre Charakter.\n\nIn „Der rote Ibis“, erforschen zwei Brüder dieses Thema und alle der wütenden Emotionen, die damit einhergehen. Durch eine reiche, lebendig beschriebene Landschaft, setzen diese beiden Jungen auf eine sinnlose Reise aus. Verbitterte Enttäuschung klaffen mit intensivem Stolz in der dramatischen Szene, und nur einer der Brüder entkommt mit seinem Leben. Das Thema wird durch direkte Charakterisierung des Protagonisten, Doodle, und seiner Interaktionen mit ihm ausgedrückt, sowie durch die Perspektive des Erzählers, die die komplexen Gefühle des Protagonisten und seine Sicht der Welt um ihn herum vermittelt, die beide stark auf seine Handlungen Einfluss haben.\n\nDie Handlungen des Protagonisten lassen sich durch eine Schlüssel emotional zusammenfassen: Stolz. Von dem Moment an, als er und sein kleiner Bruder Doodle gemeinsam ausgingen, bis zu ihrer letzten, fatefulen Exkursion, fühlte der Protagonist Zorn gegenüber Doodle. Er hatte sich gewünscht, einen Bruder zu haben, den er alle seine weltlichen Fähigkeiten beibringen konnte, wie \"...meine Atmung anzuhalten, zu rennen, zu springen oder an den Ranken in Altweiberschwamm zu klettern...\". Er wollte einen Bruder, der die Rolle einnehmen konnte, \"...jemanden, der nach Horsehead Landing rennen kann und jemanden, der mit mir in der Spitze der großen Pinie hinter dem Stall sitzen kann...\". Offensichtlich sind diese Dinge unmöglich, gegeben Doodles Zustand. Doodle wurde mit einem extrem schwachen Herz geboren, was es unwahrscheinlich machte, dass er überleben würde. Selbst dann war es fast unmöglich, dass er jemals an körperlich anstrengenden Aktivitäten teilnehmen würde. Was für einen Schlag für den jungen Protagonisten, dessen Kopf voller wilder Fantasien war, um alle diese Träume in einem Augenblick zu zerbrechen. Tatsächlich ist er sogar gezeigt, Wut gegen den kleinen Jungen zu hegen, da er sich erinnert, beginnen zu überlegen, ihn zu ersticken, indem er ihn mit einem Kissen erstickt. Welcher Art Kind würde die Anwesenheit des Geistes haben, infanti-zid zu überlegen? Doch sein Herz schmilzt, wenn der kleine Junge ihn anlächelt. Ein einfaches Handeln gab dem Protagonisten so viel Hoffnung! Dies zeigt, dass seine Überzeugung wahrscheinlich nicht sehr stark war.

    "original": "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",

    "raw_output": "Text to German:\n\nDas menschliche Gehirn ist ein komplexes, kreatives Informationsverarbeitungssystem. Mit fortschreitender Technik von primitiv zu modern veränderten sich auch die metaphorischen Beschreibungen des Gehirns. Zunächst wurde es mit einer Wachsplatte verglichen, dann mit einem Blatt Papyrus, dann mit einem Buch und schließlich mit einem Computer. Wenn Sie mehr über das Gehirn lernen, sollten Sie sich daran erinnern, dass die Nützlichkeit dieser Metaphern begrenzt ist und zu falschen Schlussfolgerungen führen kann. \n\nDie Informationsverarbeitung beginnt mit Eingaben aus den Sinnesorganen, die physische Reize wie Berührung, Hitze, Schallwellen oder Lichtstrahlen in elektrochemische Signale umwandeln. Die sensorische Information wird durch die Algorithmen des Gehirns in beiden Richtungen (bottom-up und top-down) wiederholt transformiert. Zum Beispiel, wenn Sie ein Bild eines schwarzen Kastens auf einem weißen Hintergrund betrachten, wird der bottom-up-Prozess zusammen mit sehr einfachen Informationen wie Farbe, Orientierung und dem Standort der Objektgrenzen - wobei die Farbe in einem kurzen Abstand signifikant verändert wird - entscheiden, dass Sie einen Kasten sehen. Der top-down-Prozess verwendet die Entscheidungen, die in bestimmten Schritten des bottom-up-Prozesses getroffen wurden, um die Erkennung des Kastens zu beschleunigen. Der top-down-Prozess in diesem Beispiel könnte Ihnen helfen, das Objekt als schwarzen Kasten und nicht als kastenförmiges Loch im weißen Hintergrund zu erkennen.\nWenn die Information zu einem gewissen Grad verarbeitet wurde, entscheidet ein Aufmerksamkeitsfilter, wie wichtig das Signal ist und welche kognitiven Prozesse es zur Verfügung gestellt werden sollten. Zum Beispiel verarbeiten Sie, obwohl Ihr Gehirn jede einzelne Grasblättchen, wenn Sie hinunter auf Ihre Schuhe schauen, verhindert ein gesundes Aufmerksamkeitsfilter, dass Sie sie einzeln wahrnehmen. Im Gegensatz dazu könnten Sie Ihr Name auswählen, sogar wenn er in einem lauten Raum ausgesprochen wird. Es gibt viele Stufen der Verarbeitung, und die Ergebnisse der Verarbeitung werden durch Aufmerksamkeit wiederholt moduliert.\nUm das Gehirn Informationen verarbeiten zu lassen, muss es zunächst gespeichert werden. Es gibt mehrere Arten von Gedächtnis, einschließlich sensorischem, arbeitendem und langfristigem. Zuerst wird Informationen kodiert. Es gibt Arten der Kodierung, die spezifisch für jede Art von sensorischer Reize sind. Zum Beispiel kann ein verbaler Eingang struktural, auf das Erscheinungsbild der gedruckten Wörter beziehungsweise phonemisch, auf das Klangbild der Wörter beziehungsweise semantisch, auf das Bedeutungsbild der Wörter beziehungsweise bezeichnet werden. Sobald Informationen gespeichert sind, müssen sie aufrechterhalten werden. Einige Tierstudien deuten darauf hin, dass das arbeitende Gedächtnis, das Informationen für etwa 20 Sekunden aufbewahrt, durch einen elektrischen Signalstrom unterstützt wird, der durch eine bestimmte Reihe von Neuronen für einen kurzen Zeitraum läuft. Informationen im langfristigen Gedächtnis werden angenommen, in der Struktur bestimmter Arten von Proteinen aufbewahrt zu sein.\nEs gibt zahlreiche Modelle, wie das Wissen im Gehirn organisiert ist, einige auf der Art und Weise basierend, wie sich Personen an Erinnerungen erinnern, andere auf der Computerwissenschaft und andere auf der Neurophysiologie. Das semantische Netzwerkmodell besagt, dass es Knoten gibt, die Konzepte darstellen, und dass die Knoten aufgrund ihrer Verwandtschaft miteinander vernetzt sind. Zum Beispiel könnte im semantischen Netzwerk \"Sessel\" mit \"Tisch\" verbunden sein, der mit \"holz\" verbunden sein und so weiter.\n\nTranslation back to English:\n\n[REWRITE]The human brain is a complex, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\n\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or light rays into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\n\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\n\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimulus. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\n\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth.[/REWRITE]",

Seine Leute werten die Gemeinschaft höher als den Einzelnen und werden von Anfang an gelehrt, die sofortige Freude über alles andere zu verfolgen. Die Bürger werden als Figuren in einem größeren Spiel entlarvt, die in einem von der Weltverwalter diktierten einengenden Ideologie gefangen sind. Durch die Untersuchung des Werkes unter dem Mikroskop der marxistischen Theologie fällt auf, dass der Autor mit den Entwicklung der oben genannten Systeme verborgene Verdächtigungen hat. Häufig verwendetes Terminus in Marxismus, wie Homogenität und Reifikation, unter anderem, stärken die Idee, dass Huxleys Roman ein Kommentar über die Mängel in der sich entwickelnden Wirtschaft von seiner Zeit ist.\n\nKapitalismus wird durch den Einsatz des marxistischen Theses, der falschen Bewusstseinsform, satirisiert. Im Wesentlichen wird dem gewöhnlichen Bürgertum das Wissen über wahre Beziehungen zu anderen Klassen in wirtschaftlicher Hinsicht vorenthalten, da sie sich hauptsächlich auf ihren eigenen Gewinn konzentrieren. Dies wird als Ergebnis ideologischer Kontrolle von der Proletarier und Gemeinschaftsarbeitern angesehen, was in der Verfassung der Menschen in Brave New World offensichtlich ist. Die unteren Klassen, Delta, Gamma usw., haben keine wahre eigene Willensentscheidung; durch Hypnopaedie wird der Wunsch, zu konsumieren, auszugeben, zu sich zu ergötzen, über alles anderes gestärkt. Dies wird, wie bereits erwähnt, vom Weltverwalter manipuliert. Hegemonie, im Wesentlichen die Idee, dass Gruppen sozialer Klassen von einer separaten Gruppe von Individuen in Gänze beherrscht werden, wird in diesem Fall offensichtlich verwendet. Die unteren Klassen sind völlig ahnungslos über die Manipulation, fast wörtlich 'in eine Ideologie investieren, die diese Struktur unterstützt' (d.h. Kapitalismus und Konsumismus). ' Die oberen Klassen werden mit der Fähigkeit geboren, es zu erkennen, tun aber nichts; wenige Alphas oder Betas außer Charakteren wie Bernard tun mehr als zu akzeptieren ihre Position. Tatsächlich sind die Interaktionen zwischen den sozialen Klassen, wie im Detail diskutiert wird, wichtige Anzeichen der wahrgenommenen Unterdrückung des Kapitalismus.\n\nBeziehungen zwischen verschiedenen Individuen bestehen in Brave New World nicht. Der Roman scheint die Charaktere zu verweigern, sie fehlen, selbst bei Hauptcharakteren, an Tiefe. Vielleicht will Huxley mit der Idee anführen, dass der Aufstieg der Technologie und des Kapitalismus zusammen den Menschen ihre freie Willensentscheidung und Ausdrucksfähigkeit rauben. Liebe existiert nicht, noch die Extreme einer einzelnen Emotion; vielmehr werden die Interaktionen auf der Oberfläche gehalten, dargestellt deutlich durch die Bemerkungen der Männer über die Frauen hauptsächlich über ihre körperliche Erscheinung (d.h. Pneumatische Qualität), und die unverfrorenen Bemerkungen der Frauen über ihre Begegnungen, sozusagen. Darüber hinaus zeigt die absolute Achtung der sozialen Klassen für ihre Position in der Hierarchie den sozioökonomischen Effekt des Kapitalismus. Ihre absolute Treue zu ihrer Rolle in der Gemeinschaft ist ein Hinweis auf marxistische Gedanken über die Proletarier, die sich falsch versichert fühlen, dass sie über alles anderes ihre eigene Überlegenheit haben, solange sie weiterhin konsumieren, zu folgen, mit dem Rest ihrer Mitbürger in Einklang zu bleiben.\n\nEnglish translation:\n\n[REWRITE]  Aldous Huxley criticizes the impending threat of both technology and the capitalist structure that reinforces it through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World.

For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week.

    "raw_output": "The original English text is translated into German as follows:\n\nIch bin schon fast zwei und ein halb Jahre lang Student hier an der University Park, oder vier und ein halb Semester, und vielen anderen auch mir selbst ist es ein Problem, sich auf dem Campus zurechtzufinden. Mein erster Semester wohnte ich in einem Zimmer im Ostflügel der East Halls; eigentlich der weitest entfernte Teil des Campus, wenn man den Sportplatz und das Bryce Jordan Center nicht mitzählt. Von meinem Zimmer im Stuart Hall bis zu meinen Kursen in Gebäuden wie dem Willard Building, die viele Meter vom Campuszentrum entfernt liegen, brauchte ich bis zu 25 Minuten zu Fuß, besonders wenn das Wetter schlecht war, wie es oft in State College der Fall ist. Als ich mit einem alten Kommilitonen gesprochen habe, erfuhr ich, dass die East Halls-Wohnheime nicht lange Zeit von den restlichen Gebäuden getrennt waren durch riesige Flächen unbebaute Land. Heute sind diese leeren Flächen mit Sportplätzen, neuen Gebäuden wie der neuen Creamery und dem neuen Gesundheitsdienstebau überbaut und mit Wohnungen umgeben. Da der Campus weiter wächst, wird es immer schwieriger, von einem Ort zum anderen zu gelangen. Die beste Lösung für das Problem der Mobilität ist ein Fahrrad, aber das Fahrrad alleine löst das Problem nicht. Die Studenten müssen es fahren und der Campus muss den Bedürfnissen der Fahrradfahrer angepasst werden.\n\nIch habe mit einem Freund gesprochen, der kürzlich nach einem mehrjährigen Hiatus wieder mit dem Fahrrad fahren begann. Er erwähnte, dass er sich fragte, warum er überhaupt aufgehört hatte. „Fahrräder sind großartig“, sagte er, „für einige Jahre war es nicht cool, ein Fahrrad zu fahren, aber es ist die beste Möglichkeit, sich zu bewegen“. Außer, dass sie gut für die Körper sind, ist Fahrradfahren die effizienteste Möglichkeit, sich zu bewegen. Ein Haferflocken-Topf und ein bisschen körperliche Anstrengung bringen dich 30 Meilen oder mehr. Gleich wie viele Studierende, wohne ich jetzt außerhalb des Campus; genauso weit vom Campuszentrum entfernt wie einige Wohnheime. Die klügste Entscheidung, die ich diesen Jahr getroffen habe, war, ein Fahrrad zu kaufen. Jeden Tag habe ich eine Vorlesung im Thomas-Gebäude, das leicht 25 Minuten Fußweg von meinem Heim entfernt ist. Wenn ich schnell genug pedalier, kann Fahrradfahren diese Zeit auf 5 Minuten verkürzen. Das einzige Problem ist, dass die Pollock Road die direkteste Route zum Thomas-Gebäude von meinem Haus ist und es ist nicht immer eine einfache Route, entweder mit dem Fahrrad oder ohne. Es gibt auch viele Vorteile von Spaziergängen, aber ich bin persönlich viel zu beschäftigt, um zu gehen. Wenn ich mein Fahrrad nicht hätte, wäre das Gehen meine einzige verlässliche Option, um zur Vorlesung zu gelangen. Gehen zu Thomas jeden Tag würde mir 30-40 Minuten extra aus meiner Woche nehmen. Das sind über zwei und eine halbe Stunde pro Woche. Hinzu kommen alle anderen Minuten, die ich mit Gehen zu anderen Vorlesungen, Terminen und dergleichen verbringen würde. Das sind mehr Minuten, als ich mir erlauben kann.\n\nThe English translation of the German text is:\n\n[REWRITE] I've been a student here at University Park for almost two and a half years, or four and a half semesters, and for many others, including myself, navigating the campus can be a problem.
