Die Werte, die ich der Sozialarbeit bringen kann, sind: Dienst, Respekt, ethische Natur, der Einsatz, Um Beziehungen zwischen anderen zu verbessern und mich selbst professionell zu verbessern, um in meinem Feld fachkundig zu bleiben. Diese Grundwerte sind nicht nur für Sozialarbeiter wichtig, sondern auch für mich persönlich.\n\nIch habe immer anderen helfen wollen, aber ich war unsicher bezüglich der Karriere, die ich verfolgen wollte. Während meiner Jahre in der Schule und an der Universität sah ich viele Einzelpersonen, die ihre Probleme in der Verneinung flohen und einige nutzten weniger ideale Schutzmechanismen. Aufgrund der Situationen, die ich gesehen habe, entschied ich mich, einen Bachelorabschluss in Psychologie zu verfolgen. Noch immer unsicher bezüglich der Karriere, beschloss ich, eine Pause einzulegen, sobald ich von der Piedmont College 2009 abgeschlossen hatte. Ein Tag im Sommer besuchte ich einen Freund, der mich einem sechzehnjährigen Jungen vorstellte, der nervös auf ihrem Sofa saß. Sie erklärte, warum er sie besuchte: um zu entkommen, um von seiner missbrauchenden Eltern zu fliehen. Am nächsten Tag erfuhr ich, dass er die Polizei bei seinen Eltern angerufen hatte. Um zu sehen, ob ich auf irgendeine Weise helfen konnte, fuhr ich zu seinem Elternhaus. Sobald ich dort war, erklärte ich meinen Bedenken privat den Polizisten und erzählte ihnen, dass ich gerade einen Abschluss in Psychologie von Piedmont College abgeschlossen hatte. Die Polizei bat mich, mit den Eltern zu sprechen, da es für den Teenager nichts gab, was die Gesetze für ihn tun konnten. Als ich die Eltern über die Situation befragte, schienen sie nervös und verwarfen sie ihre Sohn „manipulativ“ zu beschreiben, weshalb er externe Mittel einsetzte, um „einfache“ Konflikte zu lösen. Nach dieser bestimmten Erfahrung begann ich ernsthaft daran zu denken, mich für eine Karriere in der Sozialarbeit zu entscheiden, um Kindern mit „einfachen“ Konflikten zwischen Familienmitgliedern zu helfen.\n\nEin weiterer Wert, der für das Feld der Sozialarbeit wichtig ist, ist soziale Gerechtigkeit. Als Gesellschaft behaupten wir, dass der Einzelne wichtig ist und wir trauern um jene, die wir verloren haben. Der Begriff des „Einzelnen“, den die Gesellschaft hält, ist mehr ein Anhänger archaischer Traditionen als Aktuelles Etwas. Wenn wir also als Gesellschaft individuelle Menschen trauern, warum streben wir danach, ähnlich wie „alle anderen“ zu sein? Ich bin ein Einzelner und genieße es nicht, mich selbst so zu beschränken, um ähnlich wie andere zu sein. Während meiner Jahre an der Schule und an der Universität protestierte ich gegen soziale Ungerechtigkeiten, wenn ich konnte: Ich färbte mein Haar in unnatürliche Farben, trug Kleidung, die meiner Persönlichkeit entsprach, bohrte meine Ohrläppchen über die traditionelle Set, erklärte meine Einbindung mit dem GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), kämpfte gegen Rassismus und Diskriminierung, wo immer ich sie sah, etc. Ich glaube an soziale Gerechtigkeit und werde weiterhin gegen soziale Ungerechtigkeit protestieren.\n\nBack to English:\n[REWRITE]I plan to engage with the Division for Family and Children Services in order to help children who have been abused or neglected and to provide support for families burdened with problems. The values I can bring to social work are: service, respect, an ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field.

The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",

Die soziokulturellen Modelle untersuchen die Umweltbeziehungen und ihre Anwendungen auf Rasse, Ethnie, Demografie und sozioökonomischen Status. Die folgende Überprüfung von Insomnie untersucht diese Modelle und erklärt jede angegebene Forschung, um sie zu relacionieren und sie besser zu erklären. Die Erklärungen der Forschung und ihrer Ergebnisse werden dann kritisiert, um ihre spezifischen Stärken und Schwächen zu erwähnen.\n\nEin Schlafstörung kann als primäre Schlafstörung, eine Schlafstörung im Zusammenhang mit einer anderen psychischen Störung oder eine Schlafstörung im Zusammenhang mit anderen Problemen gekennzeichnet werden. Primäre Schlafstörungen sind Dyssonmien oder Parasomnien, während Schlafstörungen im Zusammenhang mit einer anderen psychischen Störung mit einem Axis I- oder Axis-II-Disorders verbunden sind. Andere Kategorien von Schlafstörungen können durch medizinische Komplikationen oder die Einnahme einer Substanz verursacht werden. Die Dyssonmien sind: Primäre Insomnie, Primäre Hypersomnie, Narcolepsie, Schlafbezogene Schlafstörung, Zirkadianer Schlafstörung und Dyssomnie Nicht Sonst Spezifisch (NOS). Während Primäre Insomnie eine Komplikation bei ausreichender oder aufrechterhaltener Schlaf ist, ist Primäre Hypersomnie eine Schwierigkeit, wach zu bleiben, sowohl für mindestens einen Monat Zeitraum. Narcolepsie beinhaltet KatalEPSie und/ oder automatische REM. Während Dyssonmien sich auf die Initialisierung und die Wartung eines Schlafes konzentrieren, sind Parasomnien Schlafstörungen, die mit Verhaltensstörungen und/ oder physiologischen Vorkommnissen verbunden sind. Parasomnien sind Albtraumstörung, Schlafterrorstörung, Schlafwandelstörung und Parasomnien Nicht Sonst Spezifisch.

Neuronen im Hypothalamus, die Orexin enthalten, sind für die Regulierung des Schlafes und der Wachheit verantwortlich. Diese Studie experimentierte mit Mäusen und fand heraus, dass es phenotypische GABAB-Rezeptoren auf den Orexin-Neuronen gibt, die speziell für Schlaf- und Wachzustände verantwortlich sind. Die Aktivierung des GABAA-Rezeptors induziert Antworten, die den Schlaf fördern. Wenn es von der Entladung gehemmt wird, kann dies zu reduzierter Angst führen und den Schlaf induzieren. Der GABAB-Agonist (Baclofen) erhöhte die Schlafdauer (Matsuki et al., 2009). Solche Ergebnisse implizieren, dass die Tiermodelle von Mäusen auf Studien an Menschen übertragen werden können. Dies zeigt, dass es eine genetische und umweltbezogene Grundlage für den physischen GABAB-Rezeptor in Menschen gibt. Ein Problem oder eine Abwesenheit dieses Rezeptors könnte die Fähigkeit beeinträchtigen, ohne Medikamente ausreichend zu schlafen. Die soziokulturelle Implikation dieser Studie ist, dass, wenn das Phänotyp vererbt wurde, dies den Schlaf regulieren könnte, und eine Veränderung des Rezeptors würde den Schlaf für einen Einzelnen natürlich stören.

Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",

Als Nächstes wird die Diagnose erklärt, wobei gängige Merkmale oder \"Warnzeichen\" erläutert werden. Schließlich schließt das Papier mit dem ab, was ein Lehrer in einem integrativen Klassenzimmerumfeld tun kann, um einen Schüler mit CAPD zu unterstützen.\n\n\tDer Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) oder Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) \"bezieht sich auf die Effizienz und Wirksamkeit, mit der das zentrale Nervensystem (CNS) auditiven Informationen nutzt. In einer engen Definition bezieht sich (C)AP auf die wahrnehmungsbezogene Verarbeitung auditiver Informationen im CNS und die neurobiologische Aktivität, die diese Verarbeitung und die Ursache für elektrophysiologische auditiven Potentiale ist\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), was bedeutet, dass es eine Störung ist, bei der das zentrale Nervensystem (d. h. der Gehirn) nicht richtig verarbeitet, was gehört wird. Personen mit CAPD können normal hören und werden daher nicht als \"hörbehindert\" angesehen; vielmehr funktioniert das Gebiet des Gehirns, das die Worte übersetzt, was wir hören, oder Konversation von Hintergrundgeräuschen unterscheidet, nicht wie gewöhnlich. \n\n\tDie früheste Erwähnung der Störung, die sich zu CAPD entwickelt hat, stammt aus den 1950er Jahren, als \"auditiver Wahrnehmung\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) hieß, als Forscher Kinder mit kommunikativen Störungen bewerteten. Die italienische Forschungsgruppe von Bocca, Calearo und Cassinari begannen 1954 mit der Entwicklung von Tests für diese Kinder; 1961 wurde Kimura \"dichotische Prüfungen eingeführt und ein Modell entwickelt, um die Physiologie des CANS unterzulicht, die dichotische Wahrnehmung aufweist\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Eine nationale Konferenz wurde 1977 durchgeführt, die die Forschung zu Kindern mit CAPD anregte. \n\n\tCAPD manifestiert sich auf vielfältige Weise: Der betroffene Person kann möglicherweise nicht lokalisiert oder gehört Klang im Raum; kann Schwierigkeiten haben, zwischen zwei oder mehr \"akustischen Ereignissen\" (Klangvorkommnisse) zu unterscheiden; kann nicht erkennen, wie sich Klangmuster verhalten; kann nicht erkennen, wie sich die Sprache ändert (wie er Sarcasmus anhand von Veränderungen der Stimme zu erkennen); ein Klang kann durch einen nachfolgenden Klang blockiert werden; kann nicht in der Lage sein, Klanghinweise zu synthetisieren (d. h., sie so zu interpretieren, dass sie dann gehandelt werden kann); und kann nicht ermitteln, in welcher Reihenfolge auditorische Informationen präsentiert werden (Ferre).\n\n\tZur Diagnose von CAPD muss der Patient mit \"systematischer Beobachtung des Hörenverhaltens und/oder Leistungen bei Tests der auditiven Funktion\" untersucht werden, die möglicherweise durch \"Audiologen, SLPs, Psychologen und andere durchgeführt werden, die eine Vielzahl von Maßnahmen verwenden, um auditiv-relevante Fähigkeiten zu bewerten\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Dies kann Fragebögen und Umfragen, Beobachtungen von auditiven Verhaltensweisen umfassen, einschließlich der Antwort des Patienten auf bestimmte Reize. Es gibt derzeit kein einziges Werkzeug oder Test, das mit einem hohen Erfolgssatz eingesetzt wird, und es gibt keine bekannte Ursache für die Störung. Viele der verwendeten Tests präsentieren dem Patienten mehrere, gleichzeitig auditorische Reize und bitten ihn dann, bestimmte Artikel zu unterscheiden, wie eine Reihe von Wörtern oder Zahlen. Fortgeschrittene Tests umfassen das Aufzeichnen von akustischen Signalen im Ohr und das Messen der Antworten auf die Signale.\n\nEnglish translation:\n\n[REWRITE]This paper addresses three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD).

Ein großes Problem bei der Beendigung einer Täuschung ist jedoch, dass man sich in diesem Prozess abgelehnt fühlen kann. Daher muss man am Ende entscheiden, ob man sich selbst oder die Beziehungen zu den Menschen um sich herum erhalten möchte. Obwohl einige Menschen neutral auf das Entdecken reagieren, dass sie getäuscht wurden, werden andere es nicht so locker nehmen und werden wahrscheinlich von der ganzen Farce beleidigt sein.\nDas Thema der Täuschung in der Geschlechterrollenreversal ist besonders problematisch, weil es viele weitere Probleme aufwirft, vielleicht das Wichtigste ist, warum? Warum fühlt sich das Thema die Notwendigkeit, seine eigene Identität abzulehnen und eine Verkleidung in Form des gegenteiligen Geschlechts anzunehmen,? In Violas Fall ist es offensichtlich eine Form der Selbstschutz. „Ich werde dich zu einem Kapitän in dieser Stadt bringen,/ Wo meine Jungfrauinnenhaare liegen,/ Bei deren sanfter Hilfe bin ich bewahrt, um diesem edlen Grafen zu dienen…“ (5.1.247-249)\nNachdem sie sich in einem fremden Land neu eingerichtet hat, fühlt sich Viola gezwungen, als Mann zu täuschen, um sich vor Angreifern zu schützen. Violas Plan funktioniert, aber es isoliert sie auch von den Frauen um sie herum, schneidet sie von einem wichtigen Unterstützungssystem ab. Um die Sache noch schlimmer zu machen, ist sie so überzeugend darin, als Mann zu erscheinen, dass Olivia sie mit Sebastian verwechselt und sich in sie verliebt. „Woher, mein Herr? Cesario, Ehemann, bleib.“ (5.1.138) Dazu kommt, dass sie auch mit unterdrückten romantischen Gefühlen zwischen ihr und Orsino zu kämpfen hat: „Knabe, du hast mir tausendmal gesagt, dass du nie eine Frau lieben würdest wie mich.“ (5.1. 260-261)\nObwohl dies möglicherweise eine progressive Einstellung ist, kann das moderne Leser das Stück als eine Illustration dafür sehen, wie Täuschung helfen kann, unterdrückte Gefühle freizulegen, insbesondere in den Fällen von Olivia und Orsino. Bestimmte Passagen scheinen anzudeuten, dass die genannten Charaktere möglicherweise unausgesprochene Unterbewusstseinswünsche haben, die die Erscheinung von Viola/Cesario ihnen zwingt, sich damit auseinanderzusetzen. Zum Beispiel, ist Olivia möglicherweise von Cesario angezogen, weil Cesario als Mann erscheint, oder versteckt Olivia tatsächlich Gefühle für Frauen? Man würde argumentieren, dass dies wahrscheinlich nicht der Fall ist, weil Shakespeare’s Charakter Olivia eher dazu tendiert, jene von seiner Zeit zu parodieren, die andere nur aufgrund ihrer Körperlichkeit beurteilen.\n\n[REWRITE]The play Twelfth Night seems to say that, although disguise is in fact useful in perpetuating long periods of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed disguise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process.

Das deutsche Kolonialreich war in Politik und Herrsungsstil genauso vielfältig wie in der Geographie. Die Bildungsvorschriften in den Kolonien waren ähnlich divers. Als die Briten 1919 Deutsch-Ostafrika (Tanganyika) übernahmen, fanden sie eine große Population von gebildeten und literaten Afrikanern.

Im Gegensatz zu Ostafrika, wo das Regime staatliche Schulen eingerichtet hatte und eine führende Rolle bei der Bildung der Einheimischen spielte, wurde die Bildung der Einheimischen in Südwestafrika fast vollständig den Missionssellschaften überlassen, die nur begrenkten Regierungshaushalt erhielten. Die Regierung investierte jedoch erhebliche Ressourcen in die Bildung der Europäer in der Kolonie, indem sie ein System staatlicher Schulen einrichtete, sowie die Missionarschulen stärker unterstützte und regulierte. Diese Bildungspolitiken hatten langfristige Auswirkungen auf Südwestafrika, auch nach der Zeit der deutschen Herrschaft. Während andere deutsche Kolonien eine bedeutende Anzahl von gebildeten und literaten Afrikanern aufwiesen, blieb die \"überwältigende Mehrheit der Bevölkerung in Südwestafrika unberührt, unbelehrt und ungebildet\". Verschiedene soziale, politische und wirtschaftliche Faktoren führten zu dem unterschiedlichen Erfahrung des Südwestafrikas. Diese Arbeit zielt darauf ab, diese Faktoren zu identifizieren und dabei besonderes Augenmerk auf neuere Forschung zu den Einstellungen der Siedler und der kolonialen Behörden zu den einheimischen Afrikanern zu legen.\n\nEin reichhaltiges literarisches Werk behandelt speziell die Bildung im deutschen Kolonialreich. Die meisten dieser Quellen sind auf Deutsch und wurden im frühen 20. Jahrhundert, während oder kurz nach der Zeit der deutschen Kolonialherrschaft, geschrieben. Der Zweck früherer Werke bestand hauptsächlich darin, die Merkmale der Bildungssysteme in diesen Kolonien zu beschreiben.

Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",

    "raw_output": "English to German translation:\n\nDie Klassifizierung von Popmusik hat sich in den letzten 100 Jahren zu einem so großen Genre entwickelt, dass es schwierig ist, alle darin aufzulisten.  Es kompliziert die Angelegenheit, dass die meisten, wenn nicht alle Genres – Rap, Rock, Country, Jazz, Folk und viele andere – mehrere Unter- und Unter-Genres innerhalb ihrer Domäne hervorgebracht haben. Arguably ist das Unter-Genre des Heavy Metal Rock eines der vielfältigsten und ausdrucksvollsten Genres aller Popmusik in den letzten 40 Jahren geworden. Es ist ausdrucksvoll, da es eine breite Palette von Emotionen zeigt, obwohl sie tendenziell zur dunkleren Seite des Spektrums neigen. Es ist vielfältig, da die Menschen bald nach dem Beginn des Genres erkannten, dass es eine echte Flexibilität hatte und begannen, sie auszunutzen, um ihre eigenen Unter-Genres zu schaffen, die dann von Unter-Unter-Genres gefolgt wurden, und der Kreis reicht bis heute.\n\nHeute haben wir in der Heavy-Metal-Bewegung erreicht, dass es so viele Nischen von Gruppen gibt, dass es schwierig ist zu bestimmen, was genau Heavy Metal ist. Es hat sich so viele Themen von anderen Genres aufgenommen, aber wie bei allem andern, ist es aus irgendetwas hervorgegangen. Um das Metal-Musik, die überall heute existiert, richtig zu verstehen, muss man zunächst verstehen, was die Metal-Bewegung ist und warum sie eine Bewegung und nicht nur ein Genre ist.\n\nMetal ist, in vielen Dingen, eine Bewegung, die durch die Dunkelheit definiert ist. Metal kann als \"Musik von mehr\" angesehen werden – mehr Bass, mehr Lautstärke, mehr Gewalt, mehr Theatralik. Weniger Primitivismus, mehr Finesse; Menschen in Metal-Bands wissen wirklich, wie man ihre Instrumente spielt, und das kommt in der Musik zum Ausdruck. Metal ist auch – obwohl es vielleicht nicht überraschen sollte – eine Bewegung, die stark von Drogen beeinflusst ist. Es gab eine psychedelische Drogenwelle in den späten 70ern, die zu verrückteren Menschen führte, was wiederum dazu führte, dass sie verrückte, andere-weltliche Aufnahmen machten, wobei die Drogen als Ausrede für ihre Schöpfung verwendet wurden. Es besitzt viele dunkle, urchige Qualitäten, die für die Musikszene sehr neu waren, da ein großer Teil der populären Musik Qualitäten besaß, die nicht der dunkleren Seite des emotionalen Spektrums entsprachen. Außerdem haben spätere Generationen von Metal einige ihrer Einflüsse von der dunklen, urchigen Qualität genommen, die so präsent waren in der Romantischen Epoche. Lieder wie folgendes drücken die Dunkelheit aus, die ein so großes Merkmal der Bewegung ist: (Byrne)\n\nDiese Lieder von Helter Skelter zeigen die dunkle Seite der Beatles. Sie zeigt ein Auf und Ab, das angeblich von Drogen herrührt. Dieses Lied gilt bei einigen als eines der ersten Heavy-Metal-Lieder. Es war eine Antwort auf ein Rolling-Stones-Lied, das auch eine dunklere Seite hatte. Die Beatles wollten beweisen, dass sie so schwer sein konnten wie die Stones, also haben sie das Lied auf das White Album gesetzt.\n\nGerman to English translation:\n\n[REWRITE]\nThe classification of popular music has grown over the past 100 years into such a large genre that it is difficult to list all of them.  It complicates matters that the majority, if not all genres – rap, rock, country, jazz, folk and many others – have produced several sub and sub-subgenres within their domain. Arguably, the subgenre of heavy metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past 40 years. It is expressive because it shows a wide range of emotions, although they tend to lean towards the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse because people soon after the start of the genre realized that it had a real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own subgenre, which was then followed by sub-subgenres, and the chain continues until today.\n\nAt present, we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is difficult to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres, but like everything else, it originated from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today, one must first understand what the metal movement is, and why it's a movement rather than just a genre.\n\nMetal is, in many ways, a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a \"music of more\" – more bass, more volume, more violence, more theatricality. Less primitivism, more mastery; people in metal bands really know how to play their instruments, and it comes through in the music. Metal is also – although it may not come as a surprise – a movement that is heavily influenced by drugs. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70s that led to people becoming crazier, leading to them making crazy, otherworldly records, using the drugs as an excuse for their creation.

Furthermore, later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark, visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement: (Byrne)\n\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. They exhibit an up and down, allegedly due to drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first heavy metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier, darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones, so they put that song on The White Album.\n\n[/REWRITE]",

    "original": "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",

    "raw_output": "Die surrealistischen Künstler begannen ihre traumhaften Werke einige Jahrzehnte vor dem berühmten Post-Impressionisten Henri Rousseau zu malen, der seine eigenen Träume, sowohl wörtlich als auch bildlich, sorgfältig gestaltete. Das Gemälde \"Der Traum\" von 1910, das vom berühmten Maler stammt, stellt nicht nur eine Frau dar, die in Staunen die Wunder der Welt betrachten muss, die sie in einem Traum besucht, sondern auch Rousseaus eigene Träume und Ziele als Maler. Als er mit seiner Arbeit begann, träumte er von Anerkennung, Akzeptanz und Lob von anderen Künstlern und Kunstliebhabern und fand heraus, dass er sich einer schwierigen inneren Dilemmata gegenübersah, um dieses Anliegen zu erreichen. Das Gemälde \"Der Traum\" ist das Werk von Henri Rousseau, das sein lebenslanges inneres Ringen am besten widerspiegelt: entweder sich bestimmten Stilen der Malerei anzupassen oder sie nachzuahmen, um von der kritischen Kunstwelt, die er so liebte, anerkannt zu werden, oder sich kreativ unabhängig und einzigartig zu geben und seinen eigenen Weg zu gehen.\n\nBevor man \"Der Traum\" aus dieser Perspektive analysieren kann, muss man sich zuerst mit Rousseaus biografischer Geschichte vertraut machen. Henri Rousseau wurde am 21. Mai 1844 in der Stadt Laval im Nordwesten Frankreichs geboren. Sein Vater war ein Blechschmied und Eisenwarenhändler, der \"besitzt bürgerlichen Wohlstand genoss\" (Shattuck 47). Während seiner Kindheit erhielt er keine formelle Ausbildung in den Künsten; stattdessen arbeitete er bis zum Alter von 40 Jahren für Frankreich als Gabelou, oder Angestellter der kommunalen Mautbehörde, obwohl er den Ehrentitel douanier, Zollbeamter, trug (Shattuck 46). Der Tod seiner ersten Ehefrau Clémence, der Tod der acht Säuglinge folgte, führte zu einem nur noch lebenden Kind, einer Tochter namens Julia, und einer enormen Trauer (Shattuck 49). Deshalb hoffte er, in einem neuen Leben Zuflucht zu finden und das Malen, um ihm Trost und neue Anfänge zu bieten. Anders als Zeitgenossen von Rousseau, die die Bauern in der Malerei sentimentalisiert und romantisiert haben, ist er im Wesentlichen ein Volksmaler und hat die Hoffnungen und Träume eines durchschnittlichen Mitglieds seiner Klasse.\n\nRousseaus Verlangen nach Anerkennung durch die Kunstwelt ist in einem gewissen Maße verständlich, wenn man es im Kontext bewertet: wie besprochen, war er nicht nur ungebildet in den Weisen der formellen Malerei und begann seine Karriere in einem viel älteren Alter, sondern produzierte Werke in der gleichen Zeit, wie viele andere talentierte und besser bekannte moderne Künstler. Obwohl er schon viele Jahre gearbeitet hat, erhielt er erst um die gleiche Zeit, als Matisse seine Reputation als Künstler aufbaute, richtige Anerkennung für sein Kunstwerk. In dem Buch \"Moderne französische Maler\", behauptet der Autor Jan Gordon, dass die beiden, obwohl sie in der Kunstwelt Konkurrenten waren, nicht nur in Stil und Gegenstand sondern auch in ihren Gründen für das Malen unterschiedlich waren: \"Matisse war ein Maler, der Angst vor einer trivialischen Malerei hatte, während Rousseaus Wunsch darin bestand, ein so konventionelles Bild zu malen, dass er in die Artiste Français aufgenommen wurde\" (92).\n\n[REWRITE] The surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works a few decades before the famous Post-Impressionist Henri Rousseau started crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. \"The Dream,\" a 1910 painting by the renowned artist, represents not only a woman who is in awe at the wonders of the world she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau's own dreams and goals as a painter.

Ich glaube, dass es einen Grund für diese Verbindung auf einer grundlegenden Ebene gibt. Wie John Keats in \"Ode an eine griechische Urne\" sagt, \"Schönheit ist Wahrheit, Wahrheit Schönheit - Das ist alles / Was ihr auf Erden wisst, und das wisst ihr nicht zu wissen zu brauchen.\" Vieles, was wir im Leben wissen, lernen wir durch Bildung oder Erfahrung. Aber wir scheinen Ethik und Ästhetik, wie Keats impliziert, ohne in diesen erwarteten Weisen gelehrt, zu schätzen. Beide Ethik und Ästhetik sind ein Versuch, anstatt zu verschreiben. Unsere Studien der Moral und Schönheit sind, im Wesentlichen, Versuche, zu erklären, warum ein Kunstwerk oder eine Literaturstück schön ist, oder warum eine Handlung moralisch ist, anstatt ein Satz von Regeln für den Urteilssitz, oder die Schaffung, gute Kunst oder moralisches Verhalten.\n\nMehr noch, die Kritik an Kunst oder Moral ist nie in der Lage, das Wesen des Guten oder des Schönen vollständig zu erfassen. Eine Diskussion über die Bedeutung von Leonardo da Vincis Mona Lisa, zum Beispiel, mag sich um Konzepte wie Vordergrund, Hintergrund, Kontrast oder kulturellem Kontext drehen, aber am Ende beschreiben diese nicht, warum es eine gute Kunst ist. Anstatt, wenn man gefragt wird, über ein Lieblingswerk der Kunst oder Literatur, ist es üblich, zu hören, dass ein Satz ähnlich wie „Es gibt einfach etwas daran“ folgt, bevor ein komplexer oder kritischer Erklärung folgt. Ich glaube, dass sowohl Kunst als auch Moral niemals vollständig auf eine Beschreibung ihrer Qualitäten reduziert werden können. Wie Flannery O'Connor sagt, \"Eine Geschichte ist eine Möglichkeit, etwas auszudrücken, das nicht anders ausgedrückt werden kann. . . . Man erzählt eine Geschichte, weil eine Aussage unzureichend wäre.\" Unabhängig davon, wie vollständig wir die Eigenschaften eines literarischen Werkes beschreiben, bleibt etwas Transzendent, was noch übrig ist. Ich glaube, dass Ethik diese Eigenschaft auch hat. Wie Wittgenstein sagt, \"Es ist klar, dass Ethik nicht ausgedrückt werden kann. / Ethik ist transzendent. / . Ich schlage vor, dass es dieses 'Etwas', dieses je ne sais quoi ist, was Kunst und Moral ihre mächtigste Eigenschaft ist, und dass diese transzendente Natur beider Ethik und Ästhetik ein Bindeglied zwischen ihnen bietet.\"\n\nIch glaube, dass Moral und Kunst so eng miteinander verbunden sind, weil wir beide von ihnen auf einer noumenalen Ebene am stärksten erfahren, wie es sich auf eine kantische Terminologie bezieht. Sie wirken auf uns auf einer Ebene, die erfahren werden kann, aber nicht vollständig erklärt werden kann. Diese Verbindung wird sogar stärker, wenn es um die Kunst der Literatur geht. Wie McKean sagt, \"Was am meisten Literatur von den anderen Künsten unterscheidet, was in Wahrheit einzigartig an der Kunst ist, ist ihre moralische Qualität. Es mag sein, dass moralische Standards für andere Künste unangemessen sind, Musik zum Beispiel, aber sie scheinen relevant zu Literatur wie auch zur eigenen Lebensweise zu sein. Lebendig ist unbedingt mit Werten verbunden. . . . Literatur ist uns wichtig, genau deshalb, weil die Werte, die wir dort finden.\"\n\nEnglish translation from German text:\n\n[REWRITE]Many a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty.

    "original": "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire.

Die gleiche Kultur kann man von Köln am Rhein, durch das Zentrum Deutschlands bis zur sächsischen Stadt Dresden an der Elbe spüren. Mit einer solchen einzigartigen Kultur verwundert es nicht, dass Deutschland wie wir es heute kennen, von verschiedenen Quellen und Stämmen kommt.\n\nGermania ist das Geburtsland der Deutschen. Die Herkunft des Namens ist unter Wissenschaftlern und Historikern hoch umstritten. Tacitus behauptete, dass der Name von einem germanischen Stamm, den man damals als Tungrier bezeichnete, stammte, und dass sie zuvor als Deutsche bezeichnet wurden, bevor sie den Rhein überschritten und sich mit den gallischen Kräften (Tacitus, 98) auseinandersetzten. Julius Caesar führte das Wort \"Germanus\" zum ersten Mal in seinem Kommentar über die gallischen Kriege ein, wo er die Gallier besiegte und mit germanischen Stämmen kämpfte, die oft unter unheilvollen Vorzeichen den Rhein überschritten. Er übernahm dieses Wort von den Galliern selbst und verwendete es, um zwischen denen zu unterscheiden, die er besiegt hatte (die Gallier) und denen, die er noch nicht besiegt hatte. Während die Herkunft unsicher ist, glauben einige, dass es sich auf einen Nachbarn in der gallischen Sprache bezieht. Im ersten Kapitel seines ersten Buches über diese Kriege schreibt Julius Caesar: \"Die Deutschen, die jenseits des Rheins wohnen, mit denen sie (die Gallier) ständig Krieg führen........ Sie haben mit den Deutschen fast täglich Kämpfe.\" (Julius Caesar, 50-40 v. Chr.) Andere behaupten, dass der Begriff von der Sprengwaffe, die sie im Krieg verwendeten, bekannt als \"ger\" (O.E.D, 2010), oder vielleicht von dem alten irischen Wort \"garim\", was \"schreien\" bedeutet, was darauf hindeutet, dass die Deutschen laut oder störend waren. (Name Deutschlands)\n\nDer frühzeitige römische Historiker Tacitus schrieb in seinem AD 98 in \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\", das die Ursprünge der Deutschen beschrieb, dass \"Ich die Deutschen als ursprünglich und nicht gemischt mit anderen Rassen durch Einwanderung oder Interesse ansehen. Denn in früheren Zeiten waren es nicht die Landstraßen, sondern die Schiffe, auf denen sich diejenigen befanden, die auswandern wollten....... Wer würde aus Asien oder Afrika nach Italien, in das wilde Land, in die rauhen Himmel und in die trübselige Art und Weise der Deutschen, außer seinem Zuhause, fortreisen?(SIC)\" (Tacitus, 98) \n\nWer würde aus Rom in die Germania auswandern? Sicherlich nicht die Römer, nicht noch nicht zumindest. Sie würden ihre Eroberungen in die Länder der Germania senden, um Güter zu erlangen, und führen gelegentlich eine Feldzüge, aber letztendlich kehrten sie meistens zurück in ihr weitverbreitetes Imperium zurück. Als sich die germanischen Stämme im Mittelalter des ersten Jahrhunderts zu manifestieren begannen, lebten sie an den Grenzen des Römischen Imperiums und handelten ihre Güter, die sie aus dem Land gewonnen hatten, und ihre Fähigkeiten, indem sie in den Reihen der römischen Armee dienten (Ozment, 2005, S. 17.)\n\nFinal English translation:\n\n[REWRITE] Today, Germany is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from the shadows of the Alps in Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. The same culture can be felt from Cologne on the Rhine, through the center of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it's no surprise that Germany as we know it today comes from various sources and tribes. Germania is the ancestral homeland of the Germans. The origin of the name is highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name originated from a Germanic tribe known as the Tungrians at that time, and that they were previously known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and fought the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar first used the word \"Germanus\" in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he defeated the Gauls and fought with Germanic tribes that often crossed the Rhine under ominous circumstances. He took this word from the Gauls themselves and used it to distinguish between those he had conquered (the Gauls) and those he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: \"The Germans, who live beyond the Rhine, with whom the Gauls are constantly waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.\" (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the term comes from the spear used in warfare, known as a \"ger\" (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word \"garim\", meaning \"to shout\", which indicated the Germans were loud or noisy.

Die einfache Erfahrung mangelt es auch am Herzen des Problems.  Diese Unfälle, die durch das mangelnde Verständnis verursacht werden, führen nicht nur zu mehr tödlichen Unfällen, sondern auch zu einer höheren Rate von Fahrzeugrückwärtsrollen, Geschwindigkeitsüberschreitungen und Abdriften von der Straße. \nJugendliche fahren auch viel schlechter, wenn sie mit ihren Peers reisen, was jeder mit einem Funken Verstand weiß, dass sie regelmäßig tun.  Das Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center führte eine Studie durch, die die folgende Korrelation zeigte: zwischen dem Alter des Fahrgasts und der Anzahl der Verkehrsunfälle, die eintreten.\n  Kalifornien und andere Bundesstaaten haben versucht, die Sicherheit von Jugendlichen zu erhöhen, indem sie temporäre provisorische Führerscheine einführen, die die Fahrstunden der Jugendlichen beschränken und andere Minderjährige als Fahrgäste verbieten.\n  Provisorische Führerscheine sind jedoch nach meiner Meinung nur Notlösungen.  Das eigentliche Problem ist, dass - als Gruppe - die jüngsten Fahrer, gemessen an allen statistischen Markern, einfach nicht in der Lage sind, die Risiken und Verantwortlichkeiten angemessen zu handhaben.  Psychologe Marvin Zuckerman glaubt, dass selbst 18 Jahre zu spät für einen regulären Führerschein ist.  USA Today berichtet, dass Zuckerman Forschungen durchgeführt hat, die einen gemeinsamen Wunsch bei jenen unter 19-20 Jahren aufdecken, Risiken für die pure Freude des Gefühls zu übernehmen.  Es ist dann logisch, das Fahren zu verzögern, bis der Wunsch, Risiken zu übernehmen, begonnen hat, sich auszubilden.  Wenn wir weiterhin Führerscheine an junge Jugendliche erteilen, werden nicht nur weiterhin tödliche Unfälle eintreten, sondern die Todeszahlen werden wahrscheinlich in den nächsten Jahren auf erschreckende Proportionen anschwellen.  Bis 2010 werden die Baby-Boom-Babys fähig sein, zu fahren und Millionen neuer Jugendlicher werden bereit sein, die Straße zu betreten.\n  Gesetze, die sich mit dieser Angelegenheit befassen, wären erheblich einfach.  Schulen könnten weiterhin Fahrunterricht anbieten, um den Lernprozess für zukünftige Fahrer zu beginnen, aber niemand unter 18 Jahren könnte ein Motorfahrzeug betreiben.  Ein provisorischer Führerschein könnte immer noch vor der Vergabe eines vollwertigen Führerscheins ausgestellt werden, und eine bestimmte Anzahl an praktischen Fahrstunden würde immer noch erforderlich sein.  Die genaue Anzahl der erforderlichen Stunden könnte sich auf die Anzahl der Stunden beziehen, die bereits die Mehrheit der Bundesstaaten fordert (in Kalifornien zum Beispiel beträgt diese Zahl derzeit 6 Stunden hinter dem Steuer und 50 Stunden mit einem Erwachsenen).  Da die tödlichen Statistiken für Jugendliche aus einer Querschnittssample aller Bundesstaaten stammen, wäre eine einheitliche, nationale Gesetzgebung auf diesem Gebiet eine vernünftige – und ich glaube effektive – Möglichkeit, Jugendliche über das ganze Land zu schützen.\n  Die Gesetgebung, die ich vorschlage, ist in keiner Weise ein neues Konzept.\n\nEnglish translation back:\n\n[REWRITE]Teenagers are dying behind the wheel.

Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog.

Diese Filme nutzen allgemein kreative Schnitttechniken, um Illusionen zu erzeugen. Meine filmwissenschaftliche Untersuchung konzentrierte sich hauptsächlich auf das Beschreiben der Poesie der meisten Trickfilme und das Studium der evolutionären Außenseitermerkmale in einigen der späteren Filme. Hauptsächlich sind Trickfilme um die Jahrhundertwende gebunden, bestehen aus einem statischen Bildschirm, bestehen aus einer vorderen Vorhalle, machen keinen Gebrauch von Kamerabewegungen, verwenden Lang- und Mittelbilder und folgen streng der Methode, eine einzige Einstellung = ein einziger Film. Es gibt jedoch einige Filme am Anfang des 20. Jahrhunderts, die diese Richtlinien durchbringen, indem sie Aspekte wie mehrere Einstellungen einführen.\nEines der auffälligsten Merkmale, die die Trickfilme gemeinsam haben, ist ihre Aufnahme innerhalb eines Innenraums innerhalb des Rahmens einer vorderen Vorhalle. Die Kamera bewegt sich nicht von ihrer Vorhalle-Position, um Figuren oder Gegenstände zu verfolgen. Diese Komposition war sehr verbreitet in frühen Filmen und leitete ihre Wurzeln aus dem Theater und, für Trickfilme, Vaudeville und Zauberkunst. Eines der Einschränkungen, die sich aus der Verwendung der Bühne ergeben, besteht darin, dass Figuren in Trickfilmen allgemein nur seitwärts laufen, und nicht in Richtung der Kamera oder von der Kamera weg. Nehmen wir zum Beispiel das Handlung in dem Film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). Die Schauspieler treten von der rechten Seite ein und bewegen sich hin und her entlang der horizontalen Achse. Selbst als sie aus dem Bild rausgehen, folgt die Kamera ihnen nicht.\nDie Kompositionsweise der vorderen Vorhalle bedeutet auch, dass Einstellungen tendenziell Lang- und seltener Mittelschnitte sind. Nahaufnahmen werden in keinem der Trickfilme aus dem Edison-Katalog verwendet. Dies erbt sich aus der Theater- und Vaudeville-Tradition, in der der Zuschauer die gesamte Aufführung zur gegebenen Zeit sieht, eingefasst durch die Grenzen der Bühne. Wie in den meisten frühen Filmen bewegen sich die Schauspieler nicht von der Mittelzone in Richtung der Kamera, daher kommt es zu keinen Nahaufnahmen.\nIm Allgemeinen folgen die meisten frühen Trickfilme dem Muster, wonach eine konzeptuelle Einstellung einem Film entspricht. Dies begrenzt die Länge der meisten Trickfilme auf etwa eine Minute oder weniger, je nach verwendeter Bilder pro Sekunde. Es begrenzt auch den dramatischen oder narrativen Einsatz der Trickfilme; die meisten von ihnen fokussieren sich auf kurze Trickfilme im Stil von Vaudeville, wie Zauberkunst, Verschwinden und Wechselakte mit wenig Geschichte. Beachten Sie jedoch, dass in einem Trickfilm eine konzeptionelle Einstellung im Auge des Betrachters nicht tatsächlich einer physischen Einstellung entspricht. Ein einzelnes 'Szenario' kann tatsächlich mehrere miteinander verbundene Einstellungen sein, um die Illusion von Auftreten oder Verschwinden zu erzeugen. Schauen Sie sich sorgfältig den Film The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), einen der früheren Trickfilme, an. Eine sorgfältigere Inspektion offenbart den Moment, an dem die physische Einstellung mit Marys 'abgetrenntem' 'Kopf' beginnt, obwohl die gesamte Filmkonzeption für den Betrachter als eine einzige Einstellung gilt.\n\nEnglish translation:\n[REWRITE] I approached the film archive of the Library of Congress of early Edison films and decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901.

    "original": "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

Das war ein bisschen entmutigend, und es ist schwer zu sagen, warum genau das passiert sein könnte. Mit Beginn des Winters auf einem Campus in New England gibt es eindeutig einen Rückgang in der Anzahl der Menschen, die sich entweder mit dem Fahrrad oder zu Fuß bewegen, was möglicherweise einen Teil des Rückgangs erklären könnte. Dezember markiert ferner das Ende des Herbstsemesters, wenn jeder sehr beschäftigt ist, um Aufgaben abzuschließen, Prüfungen zu verarbeiten und so weiter. Die Einreichung der Pendlereinträge könnte einfach von vielen Leuten auf den Rücken der Sonnenuhr gefallen sein. Darüber hinaus bringt Dezember den Beginn der vorweihnachtlichen Feiertage und den folgenden monatlichen Ferien für Studenten und Hochschullehrer, während derer viele überhaupt nicht auf dem Campus anwesend brauchen. Die Kurse beginnen dann im späten Januar für das Frühjahrssemester, was vielleicht auch ein Hinweis darauf ist, dass die Anzahl der Einreichungen im Januar niedrig war. Aber nichts davon erklärt wirklich die geringe Anzahl der Einreichungen für Februar. Man könnte auch spekulieren, dass jedes solche Projekt anfangs eine Explosion an Energie und Aufregung aufweist und dann naturgemäß abnehmen wird. Um diesem Trend entgegenzuwirken, haben wir den Carpool-Challenge-Wochenende geschaffen, eine besondere Blitzkampagne im März, um das Initiative wieder aufzupeppen und die Einreichungen zu erhöhen.

Wir haben viele Preise in Form von Geschenkzertifikaten an lokale Restaurants, Kaffee-Shops, Massagetherapeuten, dem lokalen unabhängigen Buchladen und sogar an einige größere nationale Kettenhändler verteilt. Es wäre jedoch interessant gewesen zu sehen, wie einige noch größere Preise die Teilnahme beeinflusst hätten – wie zum Beispiel das Los einer schönen Fahrrad, Hybridfahrzeug oder Elektroauto. Dies hätte auch geholfen, jener Abstufung in der Beteiligung, die das Projekt erlebte, zu entgegenwirken. Die Art der Preise änderte sich aber nicht wirklich während des Projekts. Wenn die Preise jedoch über Laufzeit des Projekts an Wert zunähmen, könnte das helfen.

    "transformed": "Referring back to Figure 17, there was a significant drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. This was a bit demotivating, and it's difficult to say why that happened exactly. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a decrease in the number of people who commute by bicycle or on foot, which may account for some part of the decline. December marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing their coursework, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might simply have slipped off the radar screen for many people. Furthermore, December brings the start of the holiday season and the month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not need to be present on campus at all. Classes resume for the spring semester in late January, which may also indicate a low number of submissions for that month.

Ein ETF gibt Ihnen die Diversifikation eines Indexfonds und die Vorteile einer einzelnen Aktienbesitz, wie die Fähigkeit, short zu verkaufen, auf Kredit zu kaufen und bis zu einer einzigen Aktie in jeder Transaktion zu erwerben.  Obwohl diese Vorteile sehr attraktiv sind, sind die Kosten des ETFs viel niedriger als die der Durchschnittsaktiengesellschaft.  Leider gibt es einige Nachteile, wie zum Beispiel die Notwendigkeit, bei jeder Transaktion mit ETFs eine Provision zu zahlen, genau wie bei einem Aktienkauf.  Ein weiterer Vorteil der ETFs ist die breite Palette an verfügbaren Fonds.  Obwohl diese Vorteile klar ausgedrückt sind, ist es immer ein gutes Übung für den geschickten Finanzinvestor, zu prüfen, ob die ausgesprochenen Vorteile, wie Diversifikation, tatsächlich existieren und inwieweit sie existieren.  Für die Zwecke dieser Anstrengung werden wir den ETF IHF untersuchen und ihn gegen die Top 10-Holdings vergleichen, die den ETF ausmachen, um zu bestimmen, ob die Vorteile eines Einzel-ETFs den Vorteilen eines diversifizierten Portfolios der zehn Aktien nahekommen und ob es bessere Konfigurationen der gleichen Aktien gibt, die einen optimierteren Sharp-Ratio oder Return bieten.\n\nUm den ETF zu bewerten, würde es sich zu umfangreich machen, alle Einzelheiten aufzuführen, daher haben wir entschieden, nur die Top 10-Holdings mit einem Anteil von 63,58 % aller Vermögenswerte aufzuführen.  Hier sind die Top 10-Holdings und der Anteil der Gesamtemitteln angegeben.\n\nUm eine Schätzung zu erhalten, wie gut diese zehn Aktien den ETF IHF als Ganzes repräsentieren, können wir die derzeitigen % der Vermögenswerte, normalisiert auf 100 %, verwenden, um die Beiträge jeder Aktie zu einem Portfolios Beta und Rendite zu berechnen, wenn das Portfolio ausschließlich aus diesen 10 Aktien bestünde, in dem Verhältnis, das der ETF durch ihre Einzelheiten festgelegt hat.  Die Berechnungen des Beta und der Rendite sind im folgenden Diagramm enthalten.\n\nAus dem obigen Diagramm ist deutlich, dass die Rendite eines Portfolios, das nur die Top 10-Haltungen umfasst, 6,11 % höher ist als der ETF, eine Renditeerhöhung um 16 %.  Es ist auch deutlich, dass das Beta der Top 10-Haltungen 0,12 niedriger ist als der ETF als Ganzes.  Aus den bislang erzielten Ergebnissen scheint ein Portfolio aus nur den Top 10-Haltungen einen höheren Rendite mit einem niedrigerem Beta bieten zu können.  Es besteht jedoch die Möglichkeit, dass die Mittelwerte dieser beiden Portfolios nicht statistisch verschieden sind.\n\nUm zu prüfen, ob diese Portfolios statistisch verschieden sind, wird die Standardabweichung jeder der 10 Aktien bestimmt und auf 100 % normalisiert, um ihren kumulierten Standardabweichung zu vergleichen, dem des ETF IHF.\n\n[REWRITE]An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.

In \"Traumland\" verwendet Poe den Begriff \"Thulé\" in Zeile 6 und 56, den Mabbott auf Virgil zurückführt. Virgil verwendete den Begriff in Bezug auf eine Insel nördlich von Britannien, die die Griechen als Rand der bekannten Welt betrachteten. Es ist sicher, dass Virgil den Begriff verwendet hat, aber es gibt eine weitere, aktuellere Quelle, der man seine Verdienste zuerkennen muss. Poe war sehr interessiert an deutschen Autoren.\n\nDieser Zitat ist wichtig, da es die Bekanntheit Poes mit Gothes Schreiben zeigt. Karl J. Arndt in seinem Buch Poe’s Politian und Goethes Mignon, merkt sich die Ähnlichkeit ihrer beiden Gedichte und zieht den Schluss, dass Poe Gothe imitierte.\n\nDie Oxford Companion to English Literature sagt über Gothe, war ein renommierter Schriftsteller des poetischen Dramas Faust, das in zwei Teilen erschienen ist, der erste im Jahr 1808 und der zweite im Jahr seines Todes 1832. Im poetischen Vers von Faust's zweitem Teil liegt ein kurzer Gedicht, der Titel lautet \"Der König von Thulé\".  Das Gedicht handelt von einem König, dessen Ehefrau stirbt, nachdem sie ihm ein Gefäß übergibt. Nachdem seine Frau gestorben ist, beginnt er, stark zu trinken und zu weinen von dem Gedächtnis seiner toten Königin. Er entscheidet dann, dass es Zeit für ihn ist zu sterben und gibt seinen Besitz an seine Kinder, außer dem Gefäß, ab. Dann geht er zu einem Felsen, wirft das Gefäß in den Ozean, schließt die Augen und stirbt. Die Haltung des Königs von Thule und die Beschreibung des Königs in Traumland sind sehr ähnlich, vielleicht ein dunkler Doppelgänger von Poes Verlust und Trinkkorb. Faust wurde auch in einem romantischen Drama von H P Grattan 1842 komponiert, was weniger als ein Jahr vor Poes Verwendung des Begriffs Thule in „The Pit and the Pendulum“ war. \n\nPoe verweist auf Thule zweimal in seinen gesammelten Schriften. Einmal bezieht Poe „ultma Thule“ auf The Pit and the Pendulum, aber er verwendet diesen Ausdruck in \"Traumland\" zweimal, als Buchende. \"Der König von Thule\" und \"Traumland\" können als Begleitstücke gelesen werden. In \"Traumland\" sagt der Sprecher. Er beschreibt dann die Landschaft von Thule und wie sie dunkel, einsam, von toten Freunden verfolgt wird, und sieht ein beschattetes Welt ohne Farbe. Alle diese Szenen würden in \"Der König von Thule\" von Gothe gelesen werden, da er seine Frau verloren hat, ist einsam und hat seine Fähigkeit, zu regieren oder überhaupt zu leben, verloren. Das gesamte Gedicht ist eine Beschreibung, als ob der Sprecher in Goethes Gedicht Fuß gefasst hat.\nGothe war ein bedeutender Autor, den Poe hätte kennen müssen, wenn nicht wegen des Respekts für Tennyson. Poe sagte das, als er gefragt wurde, ob er Tennyson bewundert. Abgesehen von der Verbindung zu Tennyson wäre Poe durch die vielen Wiedergaben, die nach der ursprünglichen Veröffentlichung stattfanden, mit Gothes Werk in Berührung gekommen.\n\nBack translation to English:\n\nDreamland is one of Edgar Allan Poe's self-proclaimed better poems.

Um einen Anspruch auf eine Ersatzleistung geltend zu machen, muss der Kläger Beweise vorlegen, dass die Handlungen des Beklagten mit einem vorsätzlichen und bewussten Missachtung der wahrscheinlichen Schäden assoziiert sind, die sich aus dem Verhalten ergeben, sowie dass die Handlungen verwerflich waren. Palmer wird argumentieren können, dass Martin hätte wissen müssen, dass die Wahrscheinlichkeit eines Schadens beim Unreinigen eines Ausrutschers ist, weil mehrere Kunden von D&D infolge von Ausrutschern in den Monaten vor Palmers Unfall verletzt wurden und trotz dieses Wissens noch nicht das Unreinigen des Ausrutschers in Angriff genommen hat. Palmers Argument, Martins Handlungen seien verwerflich, sind weniger überzeugend, aber noch angesichts der Fakten, dass im Jahr 2009 sechs Ausrutscherepisoden aufgetreten waren und Martin immer noch nicht entsprechende Maßnahmen zu treffen hatte, um die Sicherheit seines Ladens zu gewährleisten.\n\nAm 13. Oktober 2009 um 17 Uhr teilte Rich Wayne, ein Mitarbeiter von D&D Markets, seinem Manager, Paul Martin, mit, dass es in einem Gang eine Apfelmussschmiere gab.

Haddigan, auch Mr. Martin von dem Unfall und Martin antwortete in gleicher Weise.  Um 17:30 Uhr am Dreizehnten verlor die Klägerin, Jennifer Palmer, auf der Schmiere aus und erlitt einen schweren Rückenverletzung. Vor Palmers Unfall waren fünf verschiedene Ausrutscherepisoden in D&D im Jahr 2009 gemeldet worden.

Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294 (a) (Lexis 2010). Der Gesetzestext definiert Bosheit als Verhalten, das darauf abzielte, Schaden zu verursachen, oder im Falle fehlender Absicht muss das Verhalten „verwerflich“ sein und mit einem „bewussten und willkürlichen Missachten der Rechte oder Sicherheit anderer“ verbunden sein. id. bei § (c) (1). Die Gerichte haben das Verhalten als boshaft bezeichnet, wenn es mit einem bewussten Missachten der Rechte des Klägers erfolgte, wenn der Beklagte „wusste, dass die wahrscheinlichen gefährlichen Folgen seines Verhaltens bekannt waren und er absichtlich und vorsätzlich versäumte, diese Folgen zu vermeiden“.

Einer der Hauptschwerpunkte der heftigen Diskussion in der Klasse war, ob der Islam eine feindliche Religion ist.  Ich glaube, dass diese Frage heute genauso relevant ist wie nie zuvor.  Wenn man sich die Ereignisse seit dem 11. September ansieht, habe ich persönlich beobachtet, wie die Massenmedien von einem feindlichen Blickwinkel auf den Islam und Islamistischen Extremisten hin zu einem Extrem von Toleranz gegenüber dem Islam in Amerika übergegangen sind.  Ich denke, dass wir 2001 nicht einmal einen Präsidentschaftskandidaten mit dem Namen Barack Obama haben könnten, der offensichtlich muslimische Hintergründe in seiner Familie hatte.\n\nDie Biografie des Propheten fasziniert mich, weil sie laut dem, was ich von der Geschichte von Muhammad weiß, die Biografie mit dem Charakter von Muhammad widerspricht.  Ich dachte, dass Muhammad nach dem, was ich in der Vergangenheit gelernt habe, Zwangsbekehrungen durchsetzen würde.  Er würde Stämme erobern und übernehmen und dann zwangsweise zur Islamischen Religion bekehren.  Aber laut der Biografie wird Muhammad als eine Art Märtyrer beschrieben, der missverstanden und sogar sich selbst verhüllt hat.  Nachdem sich mehrere Leute langsam zu der 'Wahrheit' in seiner Lehre bekehrten und nach ihm suchten.\n \nEs gibt auch einige unheimliche Ähnlichkeiten zwischen den Wirkungen Jesu und den 'Wundern' von Muhammad.  Die offensichtlichste ist, als er Mutterkäse und Milch nahm und multiplizierte, sodass es genug für vierzig Männer gab.  Es ist dieser Stil der Schreibweise, der mich glaubhaft macht, dass die Schreiber Muhammad als den bescheidenen Propheten sehen wollten, der nichts beweisen musste, sondern einfach in der Wahrheit und Wundern lebte.  Dieser Art von Fehlschluss ist der schlimmste, da er die Wunder und das Leben von Jesus Christus herunterspielt.  Es ist mir, als würden sie versuchen, das Leben und die Personlichkeit von Jesus über Muhammad zu stehlen und zu übernehmen.\n \nEs gibt auch viele Geschichten in der Biografie, die es so erscheinen lassen, als ob ihr Ziel darin besteht, 'Zeugen' zu beweisen oder herauszufinden, wie sich Menschen 'auf eigene Faust' zum Islam bekehren.  Aber das Problem ist, dass viele der Geschichten aus einem Drittpersonenperspektive stammen.  Das heißt, in der Geschichte wird der Autor illustriert, dass er von jemandem gehört hat, der von jemand anderem und so weiter.  Ich mochte das nicht so sehr, weil obwohl ihre Idee war, dass es Beweise für die Wahrheit der Geschichten lieferte, dachte ich, dass es die Geschichten herunterspielte und sie noch viel mehr verdächtig machte.\n \nIch denke, das, was mich am meisten plagt, ist, dass sie versuchen, Muhammad als einen frommen Mann zu erhöhen, der bescheiden, liebenswürdig, weise und sanft war.  Aber die Geschichte widerspricht der Idee, dass Muhammad ein sanfter und bescheidener Mann war, und ich kann nicht umhin zu denken, ob die Muslime von heute die wahren Hintergründe hinter Muhammads Aufstieg zur Macht kennen.\n\nEnglish translation:\n\n[REWRITE] Almost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.

Wenn wir uns diesem historischen Prozess in großen Zügen ansehen, sehen wir eine Tendenz des Christentums, immer weiter von seinem Ursprung weg zu bewegen. Es scheint, dass der heutige Zeitgeist ein wachsendes Bewusstsein und einen unvorhergesehenen progressiven Trend zeigt. Während traditionelle Menschen bleiben und sich gegen jedes Art von Denken wehren, das ihnen nicht gelehrt wurde, mag diese Bevölkerungsgruppe nicht prominent genug sein, um das Ganze zu beeinflussen. Unter Christen wird ein historisches Bewusstsein in den kommenden Jahren enorm wachsen. Es wird sich ein Sehnen breiten, die Lehren zu unterscheiden, die über die Zeit in das Christentum aufgenommen wurden, von dem wahren Zweck der Religion, die mit ihrem Namensgeber verbunden ist.  Es wird dauern, möglicherweise Jahrzehnte oder sogar Jahrhunderte, aber das Ergebnis ist unvermeidlich:  Es wird eine große Umkehr im Trend der christlichen Geschichte geben.  Es wird eine Rückkehr zu seiner ursprünglichen Form geben.  Eine Bewegung wird an Zahl zunehmen, die die Schichten von Lehren abtragen wird, eine nach der anderen, so als würde die Uhr rückwärts laufen, bis nichts mehr übrig ist als die Vorstellung von dem, was Jesus der Menschheit auf behalf des Gottes vorgestellt hat, bevor andere Denker solche Ansprüche machten.  Wenn dieser Trend durch die Vereinigten Staaten und Europa schwappt und die Massen in seinem Gefolge dazu bringt, wie wir lebten, als Jesus lebte, nur seine Ideen zu befolgen, wird die Kirche als Institution stark bleiben, um den Weg zu weisen.  Doch weil die theologische Uhr rückwärts gegangen ist, wird die extreme Verbreitung der Vielfalt in Christendom in mehr und mehr Uniformität von Glauben und Praxis umkehren.  Zwischen Regionen, zwischen Bekenntnissen, zwischen Teilungen jeder Art werden wir stattdessen anstelle von Unterschieden zunehmende Ähnlichkeiten sehen. Die menschliche Geschichte ist voller großer Rückkehrungen.  Ein Beispiel dafür ist, wie Christen zu einer Zeit verfolgt, verstoßen und getötet wurden von der römischen Kaiserzeit.  Doch später wurde jene Kaiserzeit eine christliche Institution.  Unser Land ging von der afroamerikanischen Sklaverei zur afroamerikanischen Führung.  Die große Umkehr, die in unserer Zukunft bevorsteht, wird sich in dem Bereich der christlichen Religion abspielen, die Geschichte auf den Grund zurückführen und Vielfalt im Prozess aufheben.  Es ist wichtig zu beachten, dass ein Teil dessen, was diese Prozess ermöglichen wird, eine Methode der Lesung Jesu' Worte als metaphorisch, und nicht als wörtliche Aussagen.  Also, was geschah seit Jesus' Lebenzeit?\n       Wenn wir weit genug zurück in die Geschichte schauen, finden wir nur Judentum, die theologische Anfangsphase der christlichen Religion.  Monotheismus, die Vorstellung einer gottgeoffneten Religion, und die Autorität der hebräischen Schriften, waren alle am Kern der Religion, als die Römer Jerusalem im Jahr 63 v. Chr. in Besitz nahmen.  Die jüdische Bevölkerung teilte sich nicht in einem Geist.  Sie teilten sich in Sadduzäer, Phariser, Essener, Zeloten und eine Mehrheit der einfachen Leute auf.\n\nBack translation to English:\n[REWRITE] The teachings of Jesus and the convictions he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that continued after his death.

Sie wollen nur für sich selbst sorgen und ihr Leben so gut wie möglich machen, aber niemanden, der niedriger als sie ist, beachten. \"Der Dschungel\" zeigt dies auf viele Weise. Die offensichtlichste Stelle ist die Eigentümer und Manager der großen Fabriken. Sie wollen nur ihre Unternehmen und Fabriken so groß und großartig wie möglich machen. Sie kümmern sich nicht um jemand oder etwas, das auf dem Weg steht oder etwas, das aufgrund ihrer Fortschritte verletzt wird. Nach Upton Sinclairs Werk \"Der Dschungel\" \"stehen die Gebäude klar und schwarz gegen den Himmel; hier und da ragte aus der Masse die großen Schornsteine empor, mit dem Fluß von Rauch, der sich bis ans Ende der Welt erstreckte\". Sinclair versucht, ein Bild des großen Schadens zu malen, den diese Verschmutzung verursacht. Er zeigt, dass die Besitzer keine Rücksicht auf irgendeine Person oder Tiere nehmen, die verletzt werden könnten. Sie kümmern sich nicht um die großen Rauchwolken, die aus den Fabriken aufsteigen, oder um die Tierkot- und Urinabläufe aus den Tausenden von Stallungen in Packingtown.\n\nDie Eigentümer und Manager kümmerten sich auch nicht um ihre Mitarbeiter, die sie reich machten. Sie würden alles tun, um ein oder zwei Dollar mehr zu machen oder zu sparen, \"Von oben bis unten ist der Ort ein brodelnder Kessel der Eifersüchteleien und Hass; es gibt keinen Loyalitäts- oder Anstand irgendwo, es gibt keinen Platz, an dem ein Mann gegen einen Dollar gezählt wird\". Sie zwangen ihre Mitarbeiter, langen Stunden zu arbeiten und ohne einen Tages Kündigungsfrist könnten sie Hunderte von Leuten auf einmal ohne Entschädigung oder Unterstützung bei der Suche nach einer neuen Arbeit entlassen. Während der Epoche, in der \"Der Dschungel\" spielt, gab es nicht viele, wenn überhaupt, Gesetze oder Vorschriften, die die Arbeitnehmer schützten oder ihr Wohlbefinden. Dies ließ die Manager und Besitzer ihren Mitarbeitern freien Lauf, sie zwangen sie, den Fortschritt voranzutreiben und in katastrophalen Bedingungen zu arbeiten. Obwohl das Buch dies nicht direkt sagt, waren die Menschen, die sich in Packingtown lebten und arbeiteten, einfach darauf angewiesen, mit den schrecklichen Bedingungen während der Arbeit in den Fabriken und dem Leben drumherum fertig zu werden. Es gab keine Agenturen oder Organisationen, die Informationen bereitstellten oder Unterstützung für die Arbeitnehmer. Es gab Gewerkschaften, die gebildet wurden, aber diese taten mehr Schaden als Hilfe, indem sie Geld von den armen Arbeitern machten. Die Arbeitnehmer wurden so schlecht behandelt und hatten keine Möglichkeit, dem System von Packingtown zu entkommen, und wurden daher als Sklaven beschrieben, \"Hier ist eine Bevölkerung, die niedrigste Klasse und hauptsächlich aus Ausländern, die immer auf dem Sprung zum Hungertuch geschlagen sind und von der Gnade von Männern abhängen, die so brutal und unsensibel sind wie die alten Sklavenhalter,; unter solchen Umständen ist Immoralität genauso unvermeidlich und weit verbreitet wie unter dem System der Sklaverei durch Besitz.\"\n\n[REWRITE] I believe that The Jungle shows how people deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered.

Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40).

Translate the English text to German:\n\nViele Autoren verwenden verschiedene Methoden, um ihren Lesern ein bestimmtes Gefühl oder eine bestimmte Einstellung gegenüber wichtigen Themen zu vermitteln. Einige dieser Techniken sind wirkungsvoller als andere. F. Scott Fitzgerald verwendet viele dieser Techniken in seinem Roman \"Der große Gatsby\". Manchmal verwendet Fitzgerald ein Adjektiv und ein Substantiv zusammen, die normalerweise nicht auf diese Weise passen, um den Lesern ein bestimmtes Aura um ein Thema zu geben. Manchmal verwendet er eine Bedeutung für ein Symbol und verwendet es dann für diesen Zweck. Fitzgerald verwendet diese letzte Technik mit vielen Farben, einschließlich Gold, Grün, Weiß/Grau und Rot/Pink. In seinem Roman \"Der große Gatsby\" baut F. Scott Fitzgerald Bedeutungen für Farben auf, insbesondere Weiß/Grau und Rot/Pink, und verwendet sie dann später, um den Lesern ein bestimmtes Erinnerungszeichen an ein bestimmtes Gefühl um ein wichtiges Objekt zu geben.\n\nFitzgerald baut die Bedeutung, die er für Weiß/Grau aufbaut und verwendet, auf Uniformität auf, wobei Weiß ein bisschen nobler und höhergestellt ist und Grau älter und abgenutzt ist. Fitzgerald setzt diese Bedeutung am Anfang des Romans fest, indem er beide fortwährend verwendet. Daisy und Jordan sind ständig \"in Weiß\" (8) - tatsächlich trägt jeder immer weiß: Nick trägt \"Weißflanell\" (41) auf Gatsbys Party, Tom trägt eine \"weiße Hose\" (36) bei seinem Treffen mit Myrtle und Catherine ist \"puderweiß\" (30). Tatsächlich sind die einzigen Male, an denen Menschen nicht in Weiß sind, wenn Nick seine Eindrücke von Gatsbys Party bekommt: \"die Hallen... sind geschmückt mit Grundfarben\" (40). Fitzgerald definiert diese beiden Farben weiter, indem er sie oft bei alltäglichen, unbedeutenden Dingen verwendet: als Nick zur Arbeit geht, geht er \"die weißen Schluchten des unteren New Yorks\" (56) hinunter, die Namen der Leute auf Gatsbys Partys sind jetzt \"graue Namen\" (61) auf Nicks Zeitplan, Catherines Wohnung ist \"ein Stück in einem langen weißen Kuchen von Mietshäusern\" - Uniformität (28). Er beschreibt auch einfache oder alltägliche Menschen oder Orte als Weiß oder Grau: Jordan und Daisy hatten eine \"weiße Jugend\" (19) zusammen, es gibt \"graue Autos\" und \"graue Landschaft\" (23) im Tal der Asche, der \"italienische Junge\" im Zug ist \"grau\" (26) und der Hundehändler ist \"ein grauer alter Mann\" (27).\n\nNachdem Fitzgerald genügend Bedeutung für Weiß/Grau aufgebaut hat, verwendet er sie, um Uniformität oder Unbedeutendheit bestimmten Objekten zu signalisieren. Das Verwenden von Farben, um den Lesern etwas zu zeigen, beginnt mit Daisy. Nach langer Zeit ohne bedeutungsvolle Verwendung beider Farben beschreibt Fitzgerald Daisy als \"in weiß\" gekleidet in \"einem kleinen weißen Roadster\"; die Leser beginnen, Daisy als weniger eine Charakter zu sehen, mehr wie ein einheitliches Element, etwas, das Gatsby will und sich wünscht (74). Fitzgerald verwendet diese Technik um Daisy herum, um diese Eindrücke von Daisys Uniformität zu vermitteln, zum Beispiel gibt es einen \"grauen Nebel in Daisys Fellkragen\" (18) und sie ist wiederum in einem \"weißen\" (115) Kleid vor der Begegnung von Tom und Gatsby.\n\n2.

Sie erfordert intensiveres Personal und Management, um Schädlinge und Unkraut loszuwerden und das Boden ohne Chemikalien zu düngen, und Verluste sind oft größer als mit konventionellen Methoden, während eine kleine organische Farm auch den Effizienzgrad großer Betriebe fehlt. Praktiken, die nichts mit der organischen Landwirtschaft zu tun haben, aber dem Schutz von Wildtieren nützlich sind, verursachen auch höhere Arbeitskosten, einschließlich des Anbaus von Zwischenfrüchten, gezielter Weidemanagement, Entfernung invasiver Arten und aktive Bewirtschaftung von Pflanzenwachstum, um bestimmte Bedingungen wie Habitats am Rande oder von offenen Flächen zu schaffen. Daher gibt es viele Gründe, warum der Grundstückseigentümer in diesem Szenario finanzielle Hilfe oder Expertise in der Maximierung sowohl von Gewinnen als auch von Habitatqualität sucht.\n\tDas für dieses Szenario gewählte Grundstück liegt in einer Parzelle neben der Stadt Potrero, in unincorporierten San Diego County, Kalifornien.

It is 160 acres of chaparral, non-native Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but it currently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\nThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\nI chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations. As a model of what someone farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area.",

Kultur kann durch das, was sie nicht ist, genauso definiert werden wie durch, was sie tatsächlich ist und was sie darstellt. Kultur ist nicht homogen, noch ist sie eine bestimmte Sache. Sie ist auch nicht einzigartig oder uniform. Aussagen wie „Alle Russen sind stur“ oder „Alle Japaner sind zuvorkommend“, sind von Natur aus breit und zu einfach. Während das Verständnis allgemeiner Kulturzuschreibungen angemessen ist, ist es viel produktiver für einen Verhandler, die Bedeutung einer Kultur für das betrachtete Thema und wie die Kulturhaltung die Verhandlungen beeinflussen kann und wird, zu verstehen. Wenn man sich einer ausländischen Kultur nähert, erlebt man sie in einer Weise, die mit seiner eigenen Kultur vergleichbar ist, und Vergleiche ergeben sich von selbst. \n\nDas Versuchen, eine ausländische Kultur oder Mentalität zu verstehen, kann alles umfassen, von der Studie ihrer Geschichte bis hin zum Erkennen ihrer Vorurteile. Vielmehr als ein Urteil oder das Versuchen, eine Kultur zu ändern, muss man sie einfach akzeptieren, wie sie ist, und innerhalb ihrer Grenzen arbeiten, insbesondere innerhalb des Verhandlungsrahmens, und besonders, wenn man mit einer schwächeren Verhandlungsposition an den Tisch kommt. Ebenso kann es hilfreich sein, wenn ein Verhandler sich auf „fremdem“ Territorium befindet, Respekt für Traditionen und Überzeugungen zu zeigen, um kulturelle Barriers zu überwinden und die Verhandlungen voranzutreiben.\n\nEs ist wichtig zu beachten, dass Kultur nicht unbedingt sich auf eine national/internationale Dichotomie beschränkt. Die meisten Unternehmen innerhalb eines Landes haben ihre eigene Unternehmenskultur. Zum Beispiel kann eine Unternehmenskultur längerer Arbeitstage im Büro oder eine entspanntere Arbeitszeit betonen. Hinweise auf eine Unternehmenskultur können in Kleidervorschriften, Kommunikationsstilen (direkte v. indirekte Kommunikation, Abteilungsvergaben), und Einstellungspraktiken gefunden werden. Einige Unternehmen ermutigen Philanthropie auf jeder Stufe von Mitarbeitern, andere beschränken sie auf „unternehmensgenehmigte“ Wohltätigkeitsveranstaltungen oder Spenden. Man muss nur die Unterschiede in der amerikanischen Unternehmenskultur von Unternehmen zu Unternehmen (und tatsächlich existiert Intraunternehmensdiversität sogar von Region zu Region, von städtischen zu ländlichen Umgebungen eingeschlossen) sehen, um die Vielfalt der Gedanken zu schätzen, die in einer bestimmten gesellschaftlichen Kultur residieren können. Bestimmte Kulturen sind nicht annähernd so gerichtet wie die amerikanische Kultur und erscheinen einem Außenstehenden gleichmäßiger, aber ähnliche Oberflächen sind nur ein Hinweis, tiefer zu bohren.\n\nWerte sind noch wichtiger zu verstehen, weil sie die Warum-Frage einer Kultur beantworten. Wenn das Wahren oder das Gemeinschaftliche Harmonie innerhalb einer Kultur geschätzt werden, ist es sicher, dass ein Verhandler nicht seine Firma oder seinen Vorgesetzten öffentlich beschämen wird, um erfolgreich an der Verhandlungstafel zu sein. Ebenso wird ein Verhandler aus einer Kultur, in der einem harten Handel mehr Gewicht eingeräumt wird, nicht unbedingt dazu getrieben sein, sich am frühesten Gelegenheit zu ergeben. Diese Allgemeinheiten zu berücksichtigen ist wichtig, bevor man an den Verhandlungstisch kommt. Eine jedoch ist es, über seinen Gegner auf persönlicher Ebene etwas zu erfahren, um die Verhandlung effektiv zu machen.\n\n[REWRITE] Culture plays a significant role in any negotiation.

Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind.

Dieses Zitat erscheint zum ersten Mal im Psalm 14 der christlichen Bibel und wird an der Anfang von St. Anselms Argument für die Existenz Gottes erwähnt. Diese Überzeugung scheint auch von dem anderen Autor zu sein, mit dem wir uns beschäftigen werden, Thomas von Aquin. Da jede ihrer Argumente in der Verteidigung des gleichen Konzepts steht, und unsere Herausforderung darin besteht, festzustellen, wer von den beiden besser ist, müssen wir für den Zweck der Kürze annehmen, dass sie beide in ihrer Überzeugung von der Existenz Gottes richtig sind, insbesondere dem Gott der Bibel. Durch die Annahme eines Gott-ähnlichen Wesens, das sich vomjenigen unterscheidet, in dem unsere beiden Autoren glauben, würde es uns nicht ermöglichen, ihre beiden Argumente angemessen zu vergleichen, da sie in der Verteidigung eines bestimmten Gotteskonzepts stehen. Ich möchte anmerken, dass beide zwar gültige Punkte aufbringen, jedoch weder einer eine umfassende Grundlage für das Glauben an Gott bietet.\n\nUm dieses Argument zu illustrieren, werden wir zunächst den grundlegenden Argument von St. Anselm untersuchen. Anselms Passage spiegelt einen Weg auf, der durch Glauben zu Verstehen führt, indem man sich selbst such nach Beweisen für Gott. Er erklärt, dass Gott innerhalb unseres Verständnisses existiert, daher können wir nicht effektiv seinen Nichtbestand denken. Dieser Konzept, ausgeführt in seiner Terminologie, ist ein bisschen mühsam und manchmal unklar, die grundlegende Idee ist jedoch, dass der Beweis für Gott in unser eigenem Geist liegt. St. Anselm schlägt uns vor, dass wir uns nicht darüber hinaus wagen müssen, um Wahrheit über Gott zu finden, sondern dass die Existenz dieses Wesens einfach dadurch wahr ist, dass man das erkennt, was man innerlich für wahr zu wissen glaubt. Fremde Beweise sind vermutlich nicht erforderlich. Diese Idee ist oft als Glaube in christlichen Texten bezeichnet.\n\nDieser Gedanke ist sehr unterschiedlich von dem, der von Thomas von Aquin gehalten wird. Aquinas schlägt vor, dass die Existenz Gottes vollständig durch Vernunft und empirische Beweise nachgewiesen werden kann, ohne dass irgendeine Art von Glaube erforderlich ist. Ein solcher Idee wäre bei der Evangelisierung von Vorteil, einem wichtigen Element der Christenheit, da es ermöglichen würde, neue Konvertiten ohne Abhängigkeit von deren Bereitschaft an etwas zu glauben, das nicht beweisbar ist. Sie könnten stattdessen allein durch Logik überzeugt werden. Thomas von Aquin erweitert fünf verschiedene logische Argumente, die die Existenz Gottes untermauern: Veränderung, Kausalität, Kontingenz, Stufen der Vollkommenheit und Harmonie. In jedem von ihnen zeigt er in der Tat, dass der Beweis für Gott in der logischen Notwendigkeit für Gott liegt. Wenn man Ihnen gesagt wird, dass Sie ein Puzzlestück vermissen, und Sie sammeln den Rest des Puzzles, bestimmt die Logik, dass Sie von den Merkmalen und der Existenz des fehlenden Stücks wissen können, ohne es zu sehen.\n\nEnglish Translation:\n\n[REWRITE] The fool has said in his heart, 'There is no God.'

    "raw_output": "Hier ist die Übersetzung des Textes in Deutsch:\n\nIn der fünften oder sechsten Jahrhundert vor Christus wurde ein Prinz geboren, der eines Tages als Buddha bezeichnet werden würde. Während seines Lebens gab er die Welt auf und wurde erleuchtet, und seine Lehren führten zur Bildung des Buddhismus – der orthodoxeste Zweig davon wird als Theravada Buddhismus bezeichnet. Die Religion ist etwa fünfzehnhundert Jahre alt; sie sieht heute anders aus als damals, als Buddha lebte. Dies kann man überall sehen, zum Beispiel in der Theravada-Nation Sri Lanka, wo das jährliche Wasser-schneidceremonie beobachtet wird. Mönche und Laien nehmen an dieser Zeremonie teil, und sie hat einen religiösen Sinn, trotzdem Buddha nie über eine solche Feier gelehrt hat. Diese Unterschiede reichen von den oberflächlichen Traditionen bis zum soteriologischen Kern der Religion. Die Theravada-Buddhistengemeinschaft, sowohl aus monastischer als auch aus Laiensicht, hat seine dogmatischen Grundsätze im Laufe der Zeit ändern müssen. Dies kann auf Kräfte sowohl auswendig als auch innen attribuiert werden, sowohl feindlich als auch gütlich.\n\nEs gibt eine Anzahl von Qualifikationsbegriffen, die diese Diskussion häufig benutzen wird. Da ist der Begriff innen vs. außen. Hier ist eine innere Kraft definiert als eine Kraft, die von Mitgliedern der Buddhasasana ausgeht, unabhängig von dem monastischen Status. Eine äußere Kraft ist jede Kraft von Nicht-Buddhisten. Eine feindliche Kraft ist jede Kraft, die die buddhistische Gemeinschaft schädigt oder beabsichtigt, sie zu schädigen – eine Kraft, die durch eine negative Wahrnehmung des Buddhismus entsteht. Eine gütliche Kraft ist eine Kraft, die nicht beabsichtigt, Schaden anzurichten oder der buddhistischen Gemeinschaft zu helfen – obwohl sie letztendlich eines oder das andere als Nebenprodukt anrichten mag. Diese Begriffe werden wiederholt im Laufe dieser Diskussion auftauchen.\n\nZuerst ist es wichtig, die Grundlagen der Religion zu untersuchen – die Lehren, die sich im Kern des Theravada-Buddhismus befinden. Buddhisten suchen Zuflucht in den drei Juwelen des Buddha, des Dhamma und des Sangha. Das Dhamma besteht im Wesentlichen aus dem Tripitaka – den drei Körben – buddhistischer Texte. Der Sutta Pitaka enthält alle Suttas, der Vinaya Pitaka enthält die disziplinarischen Regeln, und der Abhidhamma Pitaka enthält die metaphysischen Komponenten des Buddhismus. Die metaphysischen Vorstellungen umfassen Dinge wie Anatta – keine Seele, Dukkha – das inherent Schmerz in dem Leben, und Anicca – die Unveränderlichkeit von allem. Erst wenn man diese Konzepte erkennt, kann man Sansara – den Kreis von Tod und Wiedergeburt – beenden, der kontinuierlich auftritt. Neben Sansara werden auch lobha – Verlangen, dosa – Hass, und moha – Verblendung beendet, wenn man erleuchtet wird. Im Vinaya Pitaka werden Regeln für das Leben festgelegt. Für Laien gibt es fünf Prinzipien (Ich werde nicht töten, Ich werde nicht lügen, Ich werde nicht stehlen, Ich werde mich nicht sexuell unanständig verhalten, und Ich werde keine berauschenden Substanzen konsumieren). Für Mönche gibt es viele mehr disziplinarische Regeln, die zu befolgen sind. Das grundlegendste dogmatische Konzept im Buddhismus ist das Konzept der vier edlen Wahrheiten. Erstens, Dukkha; die Wahrheit, dass das Leben leidvolles ist. Zweitens, dass Bindung Schmerz verursacht. Drittens, dass Schmerz überwunden werden kann.\n\n[REWRITE] In the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born.

An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community – a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community – though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\nFirst, it is essential to investigate the basics of the religion – the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka – the three baskets – of Buddhist texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta – no soul, Dukkha – inherent suffering in life, and Anicca – impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which occurs continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha – desire, dosa – hatred, and moha – delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome.",

(Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

(Diehl und Goerts 2000 S. 145). Der Höhepunkt dieser Rivalität war der mexikanisch-amerikanische Krieg von 1846-1848, bei dem die Vereinigten Staaten Mexiko angreifen und besiegen und für sich Texas und den amerikanischen Südwesten als neues Territorium sicherten. Viele andere Zusammenstöße fanden zwischen den beiden Nationen statt, schließlich ebbte der Konflikt vor dem Ersten Weltkrieg ab. Die Rivalität begann, als Amerikaner und Mexikaner auf wichtige Themen wie Religion, Kultur und Tradition kollidierten und einen großen Konflikt aufgrund von materiellem Interesse hatten (Schmitt 1974 S. 30-31).\n\nDas ist nicht anders als bei vielen anderen Nationen, die eine anhaltende Rivalität mit einem Nachbarn haben. Nationen, die eine gemeinsame Grenze haben, neigen dazu, Interessenkonflikte zu haben, die zu rivalisierenden Positionen zwischen den Nationen führen. Die Vereinigten Staaten und Mexiko sind nicht anders als viele andere anhaltende Rivalitäten zwischen Nationen, die eine gemeinsame Grenze haben. David M. Pletcher (1977) sagt, dass \"nur in Mexiko und Kuba kann man lang anhaltende übergeordnete amerikanische diplomatische Probleme finden\" (S. 41). Tatsächlich sind beide Nationen geografisch nah an den Vereinigten Staaten und waren Rivalen der Vereinigten Staaten, während andere Nationen in Lateinamerika gute Beziehungen zum Vereinigten Staaten genießen und genießen haben. \n\nReligiöse Probleme schufen einen Bruch zwischen den beiden Nationen, ein Problem, das viele Nationen durch die Geschichte geplagt hat. Sally Frahm (2001) sagt, dass \"wenn im 20. Jahrhundert Amerikaner gegen Faschismus und Kommunismus waren, im 18. und 19. Jahrhundert waren sie gegen Katholizismus und Monarchie\" (S. 86). Ebenso war die Rivalität der Kalten Krieg wie der zwischen den Vereinigten Staaten und der Sowjetunion eine ideologische Auseinandersetzung und eine Konkurrenz um Interessen, die jede Nation für lebenswichtig hielt. In diesem Fall jedoch basierten die ideologischen Auseinandersetzungen nicht auf der politischen Struktur, sondern auf den religiösen Vorlieben der USA und Mexiko. Dieser Misstrauenswüten wuchs aus dem Misstrauen zwischen den Engländern und Spaniern. Diese Gefühle des Misstrauens von ihren ehemaligen Kolonialherren ererbten, war ein großer Hindernis bei der Errichtung freundlicher Beziehungen zwischen den Vereinigten Staaten und Mexiko. \n\nDiehl und Goerts (2000) listen 17 Zwister zwischen Mexiko und den Vereinigten Staaten in der 57-jährigen Rivalität. Die Mehrheit der Meinungsverschiedenheiten zwischen der Rivalität wurden von Diehl und Goerts beschrieben sind territoriale Probleme, die mit Überfällen aus mexikanischem Gebiet in die Vereinigten Staaten und andere Grenzprobleme zusammenhängen. Überfälle von Banditen und Ganoven aus amerikanischen Grenzstädten waren ein großes Problem, das bis beide die Vereinigten Staaten und Mexiko ihre Grenzen mit militärischer Gewalt kontrollieren (Schmitt 1974 S. 97). \n\nSchmitt (1974) erklärt, dass die Rivalität zwischen den zwei Nationen begann, sich zu verringern, da \"Mexiko offensichtlich von den Vereinigten Staaten in einem erheblichen Maße abhängig wurde\" (S. 109) und schließlich endete, als \"amerikanische Ambitionen sich von territorialer Expansion zu wirtschaftlicher Intervention in Mexiko\" (S. 110) in der späten zweiten Hälfte des 19.

Ich hatte meine Beruf gewählt, weil ich eine tief verwurzelte Notwendigkeit für Sicherheit und Stabilität hatte, die ich als Kind nicht hatte. ‭\"‬Du wirst immer Arbeit finden‭; ‬Menschen werden immer krank werden.‭\" ‬war das Mantra, das ich überall hörte, als ich in die Adoleszenz und darüber hinaus kam. Also -‭ ‬obwohl mein Traum es war, Wissenschaftler oder Journalist zu sein, am liebsten ein bisschen von beidem,‭ ‬wählte ich den Beruf der Krankenschwester.\n\nDoch schon da war ich:‭ ‬46‭ ‬Jahre alt, allein, ohne Geld im Bankkonto und nicht in der Lage, zu arbeiten. Bis heute bin ich behindert,‭ ‬und nach‭ ‬15‭ ‬Jahren, in denen ich auf Sozialhilfe angewiesen war, habe ich nichts mehr, was ich als ‟mein“ bezeichnen könnte. Ich komme gerade so zurecht,‭ ‬doch jeden Tag ist ein Kampf und eine Bedrohung meiner Sicherheit,‭ ‬meiner Sicherheit und meiner Selbstachtung. In meinem Leben ist nichts mehr sicher,‭ ‬doch es gibt eines, was ich wahr wissen kann. Ich wäre nicht durchgekommen, wenn ich nicht auf die Hilfe meiner Familie und ein paar guter Freunde gezählt hätte,‭ ‬egal wie stark ich war. Und glaub mir,‭ ‬wenn echte Katastrophen eintritt,‭ ‬fühlt man sich überhaupt nicht stark.\n\nMeine Aussage ist, dass es in dem Leben immer Notfälle geben wird - große und kleine. Es gibt keine Garantie und es gibt keine Garantie dafür, dass man mit der Vorbereitung gut zurechtkommt,‭ ‬dass man manche Dinge nicht alleine bewältigen kann.\n\nIch stimme voll und ganz der Meinung, dass wir in den USA die Pflicht haben, unsere Eier nicht mehr alle in das große Regierungsbündel zu legen‟; ‬die Großmutter ist durch und fällt auseinander,‭ ‬wir wissen es bereits. Doch ich würde lieber sehen, dass Amerikaner wieder lernen, sich gegenseitig zu vertrauen‭–‬sich gegenseitig zu helfen und um Hilfe zu bitten,‭ ‬als dass jeder von uns allein in den Garten geht, um Schutzhütten zu bauen.\n\nDie Konservativen in den USA sprechen über den‟rugged individualism‟, der dieses Land aufgebaut hat;‭ ‬doch in Wirklichkeit war es nicht der rücksichtslose Individualismus, der unsere Vorfahren in harten Zeiten durchhielt, sondern Mitgefühl, gegenseitiger Respekt und der Wissensaustausch. Die Pioniere, die über die Rocky Mountains in Wagenzügen zogen, kamen nicht an der Küste an, indem sie es allein schafften.\n\nAlso,‭ ‬seidet ihr bereit. Ich bin es. Ich habe einen Notfallkoffer;‭ ‬Erste-Hilfe-Sets,‭ ‬Wasserreinigungstabletten und Plastikfolie und Klebeband für die Fenster im Fall eines biologischen Angriffs. Ich habe mehrere Taschenlampen und jede Menge Batterien,‭ ‬viele Kerzen und wasserdichte Streichhölzer und Konserven,‭ ‬außerdem. Wenn du Land und Ressourcen für einen kleinen Hof hast und in der Lage bist, dein eigenes Essen zu konservieren oder zu bewahren‭–‬tun es.

    "original": "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.

Gibt es Einschränkungen oder Beschränkungen, die die Richtung des evolutionären Wandels beeinflussen? Auch wenn D’Arcy Thompson 1917 feststellte, dass \"der Zoologe noch kaum begonnen hat, die einfachsten organischen Formen in mathematischer Sprache zu definieren\", ist das heute noch der Fall. In jüngster Zeit wurde mathematische Modellierung auf allgemeine Aspekte der Skelettentwicklung von Mollusken sowohl durch Ontogenese als auch durch Phylogenese angewendet (z. B. Raup und Stanley, 1981). Unsere Studie untersucht, wie die mathematische Modellierung von ontogenetischen und phylogenetischen Veränderungen in Prunum in Verbindung mit experimentellen Studien eingesetzt werden kann, um die Mechanismen zu erhellen, die am evolutionaryen Entwicklungswandel beteiligt sind, sowohl in Bezug auf die Richtung als auch die Größe. Wir haben X-radiographische Bilder von Prunum-Arten verwendet, um quantitative Parameter zu definieren, die in der Folge verwendet werden können, um hypothetische und reale Skelett morphologien zu modellieren. Diese Parameter wurden in das Software-Programm CerioShell (Stone, 1995) eingegeben. Wir haben hypothetische Schalenmorphologien modelliert, die verwendet werden können, um die Grenzen möglicher morphologischer Veränderungen in Prunum zu interpretieren. Diese Ergebnisse werden mit experimentellen und deskriptiven Studien kombiniert, um makroevolutionäre Ereignisse in dieser Klade besser zu verstehen.\n\nEine Schale kann als eine Struktur gedacht werden, die einen Röhrenabschnitt durchläuft, der sich über eine Zeitdauer von 360 Grad durch einen Raum bewegt. Diese Revolutionen oder Wendungen einer gewundenen Schale werden als Windungen bezeichnet, die sich um eine imaginäre zentrale Achse drehen. Diese Achse verläuft durch die Mittelsäule der Schale und wird als Columella bezeichnet. Die Geschwindigkeit, mit der sich die Windungen erweitern, kann variieren, und eine kontinuierliche Linie trennt jede Windung und wird als Suture bezeichnet. In den meisten Schalen ist die größte Windung der Schale die letzte Windung (Körperwindung). Die Spitze bezeichnet sich als alle Windungen außer der letzten. Der Apex ist der Spitze der Spitze, und der gegenüberliegende Endpunkt wird als Basis bezeichnet. Das Tier dringt aus seiner Schale durch eine Öffnung namens Apertur heraus.\n\nSchalen können in apikaler, basaler, apertural und abaperturaler Ansicht betrachtet werden. (Die \"gewöhnliche\" Orientierung einer Schale ist eine aperturale Ansicht, mit der Apertur gegenüber dem Betrachter und mit der Spitze nach oben.)\n\nEin Verfahren zum Zählen der Windungen ist unten zu sehen. Zuerst sollte die Schale aus der apikalen Ansicht betrachtet werden und dann sollte bestimmt werden, wo die erste Sutura beginnt. Eine Linie kann dann gezogen werden, die die Schale in zwei Teile trennt. Windungen werden zählend von dieser Linie abgezählt, und sie werden auf die Viertel einer Windung geschätzt.\n\nEine Schale kann als eine Reihe von Öffnungen betrachtet werden, die sich über die Zeit und den Raum als das Tier seine Schale aufbaut. Es ist möglich, den Pfad der Apertur über die Koordinaten des Zentrums jeder Windung und die horizontale und vertikale Radius der Apertur zu verfolgen.\n\nDiese Trajektorie kann graphisch und mathematisch dargestellt werden. Sobald eine mathematische Formulierung erstellt wurde, kann sie dann variieren und die Skelettentwicklung des Mollusken modifizieren.\n\nEnglish Translation:\n\n[REWRITE]Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do? Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change? Although in 1917 D’Arcy Thompson stated that “even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms”, the same can be said today. Recently, mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum, in combination with experimental studies, can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995). We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels through 360 degrees of space over a time period. These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls, which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis. This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary, and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl (body whorl). The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire, and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views. (The \"usual\" orientation of a shell is an apertural view, with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.)\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below. First, the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins. A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.

Während das Land auf Kurs ist, viele der Millenniumsziele, wie die Ziele für Wasser- und Abwasserversorgung, zu erreichen, sind die Verbesserungen im Bereich der Kinder- und Müttergesundheit weit hinter den erforderlichen Verbesserungen zurück.  Die verschiedenen Gründe für diese Mängel werden im Folgenden besprochen, und sie weisen auf die Notwendigkeit hin, das Gesundheitssystem zu stärken, anstatt sich auf programmatische Interventionen zu konzentrieren.\n\nIndonesien hat in der Anzahl der Geburten mit einem qualifizierten Gesundheitsarbeiter, mit 72% der Geburten, eine Verbesserung erzielt.  Unterstreicht man jedoch, dass diese Kategorie auch traditionelle Arbeiter, wie Hebammen, einschließt, die nicht medizinische Interventionen durchführen können, wenn die Schwangerschaft kompliziert ist (daher die hohe Anzahl der durch Blutungen verursachten Muttersterblichkeit).  Anders ausgedrückt, sind die Verbesserungen, die in dieser bestimmten Indikator erzielt wurden, irreführend und es besteht noch viel Arbeit zu leisten.  Darüber hinaus gibt es eine Abnahme der Quote der durch einen Gesundheitsfachmann behandelten Durchfallfälle bei Kindern unter fünf Jahren.  Während die Daten zur Nachsorge von Neugeborenen unvollständig sind, ist klar, dass dieser Bereich auch ein Anliegen darstellt, mit niedrigen Raten in ganz Indonesien.\n\nDie Sektionsraten sind noch niedriger als erwartet, um die 4 %.  Die Sektionsraten weisen darauf hin, dass ein anderes besorgniserregendes Problem besteht.  Während die Rate der Sektionen in städtischen Gebieten 7% beträgt, beträgt sie nur 2% in ländlichen Gebieten.  Dies weist auf das Problem hin, dass die Gleichheit der Versorgung in ganz Indonesien besteht.  Offenbar liegt der Fokus der Zugänglichkeit von Gesundheitsdiensten in städtischen Gebieten.  Ein weiteres Anliegen ist die vertikale Gleichheit.  Es besteht ein 27-prozentiger Leistungsunterschied im Bereich der Nutzung der Dienste zwischen den ärmsten und reichsten Quintilen.  Es ist offensichtlich, dass die Armen es viel schwieriger haben, Gesundheitsdienste zu erreichen, wahrscheinlich aufgrund von Selbstkosten.\n\nBei der Diskussion der nächsten Schritte zur Verbesserung der Indikatoren für neonatale und mütterliche Pflege ist die grundlegendste Frage, wie man die mangelnde Dienstleistung am effektivsten anspricht.  Insbesondere sollte Indonesien besonderen Ansätze entwickeln oder das Gesundheitssystem stärken, ohne sich auf Vorsorge- und Nachsorge für die Mutter und das Kind vor und nach der Schwangerschaft zu konzentrieren.  Es ist keine Frage, dass programmatische Ansätze, um die Probleme oben zu lösen, attraktiv sind.  Nicht nur haben 'vertikale Ansätze', die sich auf ein bestimmtes Sektor der Verbesserungen richten, viel zielführende, verwaltebare Ziele, sie bringen auch allgemein schnellere Ergebnisse.  Es gibt jedoch einige Einschränkungen, die berücksichtigt werden müssen.  Einer der Haupteinschränkungen ist, dass das Investieren in Programme für ein bestimmtes Gebiet der Gesundheitsbranche bedeutet, dass die Mittel für andere Bereiche leiden und menschliche Ressourcen sich auf das Arbeitsgebiet konzentrieren, das mehr Ressourcen hat (der Effekt der internationalen Finanzierung für HIV/AIDS und sein Effekt auf die Familienplanungssektor ist ein Beispiel).  Darüber hinaus führt die Durchführung mehrerer paralleler Programme für ein bestimmtes Gebiet zur Doppelerfassung von Dienstleistungen, die auch zwischen den Programmen nicht koordiniert sind.  Dies führt zu einer Zunahme von Formularen und Papierschredder für Lieferungen und Finanzierung.\n\nEnglish translation back to English:\n\n[REWRITE] The rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained relatively stable over the last ten years.

Plötzlich sprang er zurück bei dem Bericht von Feuerwaffen; und es erhoben sich laute Schreie und Schreie; Lichter glänzten vor seinen Augen, und alles war Lärm und Tumult, als eine unsichtbare Hand ihn hastig forttrug.  Durch all diese schnellen Visionen lief eine unbestimmte, unruhige Bewusstseinslage, die ihn ständig quälte und plagte.\"\n\n(Dickens, 220)\n\nDie beiden Romane nutzen dieses Geheimnis oft durch Traumsequenzen oder traumähnliche Zustände, obwohl der Inhalt und die Funktionen in jedem spezifischen Fall variieren.

Wenn die Schießerei, in Kapitel 28, schließlich wiederaufgenommen wird, erlebt Oliver sie lebhaft wieder, als ob in einem Traum, während er sich abmüht, um Hilfe zu finden (siehe links). Die Passage betont die Mangel an Kontrolle, die Oliver über die sich abspielenden Ereignisse hatte, sowie die schlimmen Verhältnisse, in denen sich seine Gesundheit befindet, die stark durch Olivers Halluzinationen von Sikes und Crackit präsent ist.

Ich versuchte mein Bestes, ihnen zu helfen, wo immer sie Schwierigkeiten hatten, aber meine Stärken lagen in Englisch und Lesen. Ich wurde von einem der Lehrer gebeten, einen Jungen namens Adrian zu helfen, der viel Schwierigkeiten mit dem Lesen hatte. Ich glaube, er war in dritten oder vierten Klasse. Es fiel mir auf, dass etwas nicht stimmte; er hatte das merkwürdigste Problem. Einige Buchstaben konnte er perfekt aussprechen, andere nicht einmal annähernd. Es war das merkwürdigste. Sie wissen, er war von lateinamerikanischer Abstammung, und zwar bin ich sicher, aber der Junge sprach perfekt Englisch. Wir kämpften weiter, bis an dem Tag, an dem ich seine Mutter traf. Ich half dabei, einige Jungen zu betreuen (für die Abkürzung ist es besser) während der Rest des Nachmittagsprogramms auf einer Exkursion war, als seine Mutter hereinkam. Seine Mutter sprach kein Wort Englisch, nur Spanisch. Mit meinem sehr schlechten Spanischkenntnissen (ich lernte gerade erst) konnten wir uns verständigen. Aber es war dann, dass es mir wie ein Sack Steine ins Hirn fiel: Adrian konnte lesen, aber er kannte das englische Alphabet nicht gut. Ich weiß nicht, ob diese Erkenntnis ihm jemals viel half, aber ich hoffe, dass er jetzt besser ist.\n\nIch erzähle diese Geschichte, um mich auf das Problem des Sprachbarriers in den Schulen zu beziehen, besonders in Kalifornien. Ich erzähle sie auch, um zu beweisen, dass es nicht immer so offensichtlich ist, wie wir denken. Selbst ein Kind, das perfekt Englisch spricht, kann beim Lesen noch Schwierigkeiten haben. Ich denke, dass jeder zustimmen kann, dass dieses Problem besteht, also was machen wir? In Adrians Fall war die Lösung einfach: Tutoren im Englischen Lesen, insbesondere das Alphabet und die Aussprache. Aber für die vielen Kinder, die kaum Englisch sprechen, ist die Lösung viel komplexer. Es gibt keine einfache Antwort. Das Doppelte Sprachsystem, die Durchmischung, Private Tutoren, ESL-Kurse, keines davon, allein, wird dieses Problem lösen. Die Lösung liegt in der Kombination aller der oben genannten.\n\nZunächst einmal ist das Doppelte Sprachsystem eine großartige Idee. Nicht nur für Kinder, deren erster Sprache Spanisch ist, sondern für alle Kinder. „Kinder in Zweiweg-Bilingual-Unterrichtsprogrammen haben sich akademisch über ihre Mitschüler bewährt“ . Einiges Sorge umgibt diese Idee, dass es ein Verlust an Ressourcen ist und dass die meisten Kinder in den Schulen keinen Vorteil davon haben werden. Aber das ist falsch. Wenn wir diese Arten von Programmen im Klassenzimmer als die Regel anwenden, anstatt als Ausnahmen, würden alle Kinder davon profitieren. Aber wie gehen wir damit um? Brauchen wir alle Lehrer zweisprachig zu machen? Nein. Das wäre unvernünftig und leicht unrealistisch. Aber ich denke, dass es keinen Grund gibt, warum wir nicht spezielle Hilfskräfte, Tutoren, nennen wir sie wie wir wollen, haben, die zweisprachig sind.\n\nEnglish Translation:\n\n[REWRITE] A few years ago, I worked in an after-school program tutoring elementary school children.

    "raw_output": "Here's the translation of the given text to German:\n\nDer traditionelle \"Gothic Novel\" ist in Substanz und im Namen ein \"Oxymoron für 'Alt-Neu'\", wie Ian Watt es in \"The Rise of the Gothic Novel\" beschreibt. Die gotische Mode wurde beschimpft, gelobt, beschuldigt, kein echtes Tiefe zu haben, und für den \"furchtbaren Sublimen\" Aspekt hochgelobt, den sie zu evokieren schien (Burke).  Die ursprüngliche \"Gothic Novel\", Horace Walpoles \"The Castle of Otranto\", verwendete die Ideen sowohl der \"alten\" als auch der \"modernen\" Romane, um den proto-gotischen Genre zu schaffen, und einen neuen literarischen Ausdruck zu verfeinern. Walpole verwendet \"alte\" Theaterelemente und \"neue\" Imitation von Natur in \"modernen\" Romane, um das, was er \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4) nennt, vorzustellen. Die gotische Gattung verwendet viele Hinweise auf mittelalterliche gotische Theater, Architektur und Traditionen. Schon bei der Veröffentlichung von \"The Castle of Otranto\" wurde der Begriff \"gotisch\" verwendet, um viele verschiedene Völker, Stile und Zeiträume zu beschreiben. Es wurde als archaisch oder unverfeinert angesehen im Gegensatz zu den \"modernen\" sozialen und literarischen \"Fortschritten\". Die Kombination der mehr theatralischen \"Gothic\" und der neuen Romanformat (der den Leser einen persönlicheren Blick auf die Psychologie der Charaktere ermöglicht) ist es, was es ermöglicht, dass das Göttliche für so lange Zeit bleibt, und wird gleichzeitig veraltet und neu für einen Leser, der viel von der Zeit entfernt ist, in der das Original geschrieben wurde.\n\nEiner der wichtigsten gotischen Ideen, die in gotischen Romanen vorkommen, ist der Begriff der Ritterlichkeit. Die mittelalterliche Idee der Ritterlichkeit, der Prozess der Ausbildung eines richtigen Ritters, wird sowohl beibehalten als auch transformiert in der ursprünglichen gotischen Novelle, \"The Castle of Otranto\". Ritterlichkeit ist besonders wichtig für gotische Schriftsteller wegen dessen, was sie repräsentierte - der klassische Ritter, tapfer, ehrenhaft, fähig - und dem vermuteten oder wahrgenommenen Mangel an diesem Ideal, den Schriftsteller (insbesondere Walpole) sahen in der Gesellschaft. Durch die Verwendung der ritterlichen Konzepte und Manieren wurde der \"gotische Vergangenheit\" idealisiert und verklärlicht (deutend auf die zukünftige Entwicklung von Gothic zu Romantik) und wurde verwendet, um den Gegenwart zu verbessern. Walpole war, als er \"The Castle of Otranto\" schrieb, inmitten einer politisch turbulenten Zeit und war von der möglichen Zukunft enttäuscht. Er, in der Politik und (umstritten) ungerechtfertigten Verurteilungen, mag vielleicht gedacht haben, sogar wenn nicht explizit, dass das vermutete Moral und angeborene \"Gutes\" in Leuten, die in der \"gotischen Epoche\" vorherrschten, in jenen Personen, die die \"Gegenwart\" bilden, verloren gegangen war. In seiner Schrift ist dies klar in mehreren Charakteren zu sehen, einem davon ist der Charakter Frederic. Der Leser kann vor dem Kennenlernen mit Frederic erkennen, dass er viele chivalrische Züge aufweist, er ist, zuerst, ein Fürst, er hat gelitten, wurde angemessen von Tragödie getroffen, die er verlassen hat, und ist derzeit vermutet, von Heiden getötet worden zu sein. Die Figur des \"galanten und höflichen Ritters\" ist, natürlich, übertrieben, bringt die bald zu werden Gothic-Trope der Exzess in Gang (66).\n\nAnd here's the German translation back to English:\n\n[REWRITE] The traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name, an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in \"The Rise of the Gothic Novel.\" The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).

It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\nOne of the most prominent Gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, \"The Castle of Otranto.\" Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented - the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent - and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners, the \"Gothic past\" becomes idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote \"The Castle of Otranto,\" in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have begun to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the Gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing, this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits; he is described as:\n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course, exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66).",

The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",

Der Begriff Supply-Chain-Management wurde 1982 von Keith Oliver, einem Berater, eingeführt. Keith Oliver beschrieb den umfassenden Prozess der Planung, Implementierung und Kontrolle der Prozesse im Lieferkettensystem, um Kundenbedürfnisse schnell und effizient zu erfüllen.  Es gibt sechs Schlüsslelemente, die die Lieferkette ausmachen: Produktion, Beschaffung, Lagerbestand, Standort, Transport und Informationen. Geschäftsleiter nutzen diese sechs Schlüsslelemente, um den besten Kundendienst an Kunden zu bieten.\n\nDie Produktion ist der erste Schritt im Supply-Chain-Prozess. Die Produktion ist die Grundlage für den gesamten Supply-Chain-Prozess. Der Produktionsstadium soll die Zeit, den Grund, den Ort und die Methode bestimmen, bei der alles hergestellt wird. Manager müssen wissen, was Kunden wollen. Um herauszufinden, was die Kunden wollen, können Manager den Markt analysieren. Der Markt ist der größte Indikator, um zu entscheiden, was die Kunden fordern.  Sobald Manager den Markt analysiert haben und die Kundenbedürfnisse verstehen, sind sie bereit, zu entscheiden, welche Produkte hergestellt werden sollen, und wie viele von diesen Produkten hergestellt werden sollen. Nachdem die Leitung entschieden hat, was produziert und wie viel produziert wird, sind sie bereit zu entscheiden, an welchem Standort die Produkte hergestellt werden sollen und welchem Betrieb am besten für die Mengen und Qualität des Produkts geeignet ist, wobei die Kundenbedürfnisse und die Kundenzufriedenheit berücksichtigt werden müssen.  Nachdem der Standort der Produktion der Produkte entschieden wurde, konzentrieren sich die Manager auf die Terminplanung der Arbeitslast und die Instandhaltung von Geräten. Die Produktion ist ein sehr wichtiger Schritt im Supply-Chain-Prozess.  Jeder Einzelheit ist im gesamten Prozess von entscheidender Bedeutung. Wenn jede Einzelheit nicht entsprechend geplant wird, könnte dies dem Unternehmen in der langfristigen Zukunft viel Zeit und Geld kostete. Zum Beispiel habe ich in Wal-Mart und Target-Großmärkten gearbeitet. Beide Unternehmen haben eine Konzeption, ein Buchletten und einen Prozess für jeden Aspekt des Unternehmens. Es gibt einen gestalteten Layout, wie ein Angestellter aussehen sollte, bis hin zu der Empfang von Lieferungen von Trucks. Durch die Festlegung von Prozessen kann ein Unternehmen reibungslos arbeiten, ohne Verwirrung über Richtung und Erwartungen.\n\nDas zweite Schlüsslelement des Supply-Chain-Managements ist die Beschaffung. Die Beschaffung wird definiert als strategische Entscheidungen, die treffen werden sollten, um die Kernkompetenzen eines Werks und Partnerschaften zur Outsourcing zu bestimmen. Ein Unternehmen kann viele verschiedene Divisionen für eine einzelne Produktlinie haben.  Jede Division besteht aus verschiedenen Geräten, Arbeitern und Spezialisten. Der Manager muss entscheiden, welche Division am besten für die unterschiedlichen Prozesse des Produkts geeignet ist.  Die Management kann auch entscheiden, Aufträge an andere Unternehmen auszulagern. Der Hauptgrund, warum ein Manager Aufträge an Unternehmen auslagert, ist, um Geschwindigkeit zu schaffen. Geschwindigkeit ist die Fähigkeit, Qualität und Flexibilität zu liefern, während gleichzeitig Kosten reduziert werden oder Kosten auf niedrigem Niveau gehalten werden.\n\nTranslation back to English:\n\n[REWRITE] Supply chain management refers to the streams of processes that involve moving goods from the customer order to the raw material stage, procurement, production, and distribution of products to the customer.

After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest.

Burma, auch bekannt als Myanmar, ist ein südostasiatischer Staat, der von einer tyrannischen Militärjunta beherrscht wird, die 1962 durch einen Staatsstreich an die Macht kam. Im Jahr 2007 kam es zu einer Reihe von Straßenprotesten, die ersten öffentlichen Proteste in einem Jahrzehnt. Anführend war eine große Zahl von Birmas Mönchen, die diese Proteste den Namen \"Die Saffronrevolution\" verdienten, nach dem Farbton der Roben, die die Mönche trugen. Nach den ersten wenigen Aufständen begann die breite Öffentlichkeit an den Protesten Interesse zu haben, und wenn die burmesische Regierung zunächst zögerlich den Mönchen gewährte, sich in friedlichen Versammlungen zu beteiligen, eskalierte die Gewalt bald in einen Krieg, den einige als vollständigen Krieg zwischen den Mönchen und der Militärjunta betrachteten. Die Militärjunta führte aktiv Eingriffe und Plünderungen von Klöstern in ganz Burman durch. Ausländische Journalisten wurden eingefangen und inhaftiert, wenn sie gesehen wurden, und ein japanischer Fotojournalist namens Kenji Nagai wurde am 27. September 2007 einfach nur deshalb getötet, weil er an einer Straßenprotest teilgenommen hatte. Während die offizielle Todeszahl bei 13 liegt, sagte Oberst Hla Win, der vor der offiziellen Meldung einige Tage aus der Armee desertiert war, \"Viele mehr Menschen wurden in den letzten Tagen getötet, als Sie gehört haben. Die Toten können in mehreren tausend gezählt werden.\"\n\nDies ist nichts Neues. Während diese einige der neuesten Beispiele von Atrocitäten in unserer Welt sind, hat die Regierungsabsicht, Widerstand zu unterdrücken und ihre Bürger vollständig zu beherrschen, seit der Entstehung der Zivilisation bestanden. Frühere römische Kaiser erklärten sich selbst zu gewählt durch die Götter, um eine vollständige exekutive Herrschaft über jeden Aspekt ihrer Gesellschaft zu haben. Japanische Kaiser werden als tatsächliche Götter angesehen, die in unser Welt geschickt wurden, um ihre Menschen zu führen, um sie zu Wohlstand zu führen, dank der Einführung von Motorola-Handys und Hara-Kiri, und unser jetziger Präsident, George W. Bush, hat wöchentliche Konferenzen mit Ted Haggard, dem Führer von Stupid People Worldwide, einer Unterabteilung der Republikanischen Partei.\n\nEinige der bekanntesten Beispiele dieser Handlungen sind solche Vorfälle wie der Protest am 4. Juni 1989 auf dem Tiananmen-Platz, an dem Intellektuelle, Gewerkschaftsaktivisten und Studenten zusammenkamen, um gegen die autoritäre Herrschaft der Regierung zu protestieren. Die Todeszahlen in diesem Fall reichen von offiziellen Berichten des chinesischen Regierung von 200-300 Toten bis hin zu Berichten des chinesischen Roten Kreuzes, dem zufolge 2.000 bis 3.000 Menschen getötet wurden. Ein weiteres Beispiel ist die Rwanada-Massaker der 1990er, bei dem Hutu-Milizengruppen, unterstützt von der Regierung Ruandas, eine systematische Ermordung aller Tutsis sowie politischer Mitte, unabhängig von ihren ethnischen Hintergründen, begannen. Hitlers 'Drittes Reich', eine Periode, die mehrere Jahre und mehrere Länder umfasst, in der jeder mit jüdischen Hintergrund zusammengetrieben und getötet wurde, ist ein weiteres extrem Beispiel.\n\n[REWRITE]\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, the star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with a Sharpie onto her sign.

Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

Ellingtons Präsenz am Klavier ist in vielen der für diese Aufgabe ausgewählten Kompositionen subtil, aber als Komponist hat er sich in der Schaffung reicher und komplexer Stücke hervorgetan, die die individuellen Fähigkeiten der Bandmitglieder hervorhoben. Ellington gestaltete das Framework, in dem ein Solist frei improvisieren konnte, sowie geschlossene Orchesterstücke und Phrasen, die sich auf den besonderen Stil der Bandmitglieder beziehen, um musikalische Ideen hervorzuheben. In diesem Zusammenhang betonte er auch den Ton der Bigband allgemein, indem er kohärente und originelle Klänge für jedes Stück schuf. Ellingtons Meisterschaft in der Beherrschung der individuellen Sound der Spieler sowie die Art und Weise, wie sie zusammen in einem wachsenden Ensemble passten, ermöglichte ihm, einige der innovativsten und brillantesten Stücke in der Jazzgeschichte zu schreiben.\n\nDer Grove-Musik-Atlas erwähnt Creole Love Call in Bezug auf die Verwendung der Stimme \"als Jazzinstrument\" während seiner gesamten Karriere. Dies ist ein frühes Beispiel für Ellingtons Verwendung der Stimme, um Textur und Farbe hinzuzufügen, ohne von den Einschränkungen von Liedern beeinträchtigt zu werden. Creole Love Call zeigt auch Ellingtons Fähigkeit, den Stil seines Solisten zu ehren, was sich auch während seiner gesamten Karriere zeigt. Dieser langsame, überlegene Zwölferblues-Komposition enthält sechs Refrains, wie folgt:\n\nRefrain 1: Ruf und Antwort zwischen Stimme und Rohrblattinstrumenten, wobei die Stimme glatt und melodisch beginnt und sich am Ende in einen raueren Klang verwandelt.\nRefrain 2: Getönter Trompetensolo, das die grundlegende Melodie erweitert und mehrere verlängerte Blaunoten betont.\nRefrain 3: Schwimmende Klarinetten-Solo in einer hohen Oktave, unterstützt von einem subtilen synkopierten Klavierphrasen.\nRefrain 4: Die gesamte Bigband wiederholt den ersten Refrain mit einer Antwort und einem Ruf durch die Blech- und Rohrblatt-Abteilungen.\nRefrain 5: Der dramatische Refrain des Stücks, da die Rohrblattinstrumente nun den Ruf und die Antwort in einer hohen Oktave beginnen, unterstützt von synkopierten Stop-Time von der Blech- und Rhythmus-Abteilungen.\nRefrain 6: Eine Rückkehr zur Struktur des ersten Refrains, mit Ruf und Antwort zwischen Stimme und Rohrblattinstrumenten. In diesem Refrain nimmt die Stimme den Klang des \"Growl\"-Technik an und solo's wie ein Instrument.\nScheibe: Kurze Scheibe mit einem Vocalrun und einem dissonanten Neuerfindung durch eine Trompete.\n\nEllingtons Verwendung der Stimme, um eine Dimension von Farbton zu diesem Stück hinzuzufügen, ist ein Beispiel für eine stilistische Eigenschaft, die in seinem Werk einprägt.\nIn Hot and Bothered, aufgenommen ein Jahr später, kombiniert Ellington seine Fähigkeit, komplexe Orchesterstücke zu komponieren, mit seinem Gespür für Farbton. Ein Ruf- und Antwort-Phrasen zwischen \"Bubber\" Miley auf getönter Trompete und Baby Cox' scat-Singen verwendet die vokalen Elemente von Miley's Spiel und die instrumentalen Aspekte von Cox' Stimme, um ein reiches und bereicherndes Klangbild zu schaffen. In It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) verlängert Ellington diese Ideen, indem er Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, einen festeren Bestandteil in Ellington's Bigband, mit großem Erfolg verwendet, um die Melodie auf getönter Trompete einzuführen.\n\nNow I will translate the German text back to English:\n\n[REWRITE] \nDuke Ellington's legacy in jazz stems significantly from his longevity and, indeed, his creative skills to shape his orchestra.

    "transformed": "Duke Ellington's legacy in jazz stems significantly from his longevity and, indeed, his creative skills to shape his orchestra. Ellington's presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer, he excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual talents of band members. Ellington designed the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, as well as writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called upon the unique style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing so, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington's mastery of the individual players' sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, allowed him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington's sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using his voice \"as a jazz instrument\" throughout his career. This is an early example of Ellington's use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics.

    "original": "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",

Als die Gläubiger diese Kredite nicht bedienten, befanden sich die Banken aufgrund von unzureichenden Kapitalreserven in einer chaotischen Lage und übertrugen diese Unsicherheit auf die umformten Hypotheken, die sie verkauft hatten, und auf den Rest der Wirtschaft.\n\nDie finanzielle Krise hatte ihre Wurzeln im Jahr 1999 in der Ära Clinton, als der Präsident nach einer zweiten Amtszeit strebte. Er suchte nach einer Erhöhung seiner Popularität. Um dies zu erreichen, lockerte die regierende Clinton-Administration die Kreditbeschränkungen, was den schlimmen Vorboten für die Subprime-Krise sieben Jahre später half. Steven Holmes von der New York Times berichtete im Jahr 1999: \"Fannie Mae, der größte Hypothekenunterzeichner des Landes, wurde von der Clinton-Administration unter zunehmendem Druck gesetzt, Hypotheken unter anderem für Menschen mit niedrigem und mittlerem Einkommen zu vergeben und fühlte sich von den Aktionären zu dem Druck gezwungen, seine beeindruckende Wachstumsrate in den Gewinnen beizubehalten.\" Holmes prognostiizierte dann richtig die Konsequenzen dieser Maßnahmen: \"Aber die von der Regierung subventionierte Firma könnte in einer Wirtschaftskrise Schwierigkeiten haben und könnte eine Regierungsrückendeckung nach dem Vorbild der Spar- und Darlehenskassenkrise in den 1980er Jahren nach sich ziehen.\" Wie im Vorwort detailliert dargelegt, und wie Holmes vorhergesehen hatte, würden unbedachte Kreditvergabe und -vergabe unweigerlich zu der Panikmache in der Wirtschaft führen.\n\nViele Faktoren trugen dazu bei, dass die Wirtschaft in eine Abwärtsspirale rutschte, einer davon war die neue und komplexe Struktur von Hypotheken. Verträge mit variablen Zinsen, Hypotheken-Securities und Kollateralisierte Schuldverschreibungen (CDOs) wurden in den Jahren vor der Krise weit verbreitet und dienten nur dazu, noch mehr Sektoren der Wirtschaft in den Immobilienmarkt zu verweben. Dies führte dazu, dass U.S.-Haushalte und Finanzmärkte im Allgemeinen sich in dem Immobilienmarkt überlasteten, was sie extrem anfällig für kleine Änderungen der Preise machte. \n\nTatsächlich brach der Immobilienblasen, und die Finanzinstitute, die diese Hypotheken-Securities gekauft hatten, wurden geächtet. Die fünf größten U.S.-Investitionsbanken meldden zusammen $4,1 Billionen Dollar an Hypotheken-Schulden in 2007, was etwa 30 % des USA-GDP ausmachte. Im Endeffekt wurden Bear Sterns und Merrill Lynch sehr günstig verkauft, Lehman Brothers wurde zerrissen, und Goldman Sachs und Morgan Stanley wurden gezwungen, zu kommerziellen Banken zu werden, die unter intensiver Regulierung standen. Fannie und Freddie hatten $5 Billionen Dollar an Hypotheken-Schulden und wurden im September 2008 unter Regierungs-Kontrolle gestellt.\n\n**Translation back to English:**\n\n[REWRITE] In 2007, the United States of America plunged into a severe financial crisis. Unemployment rose, the housing market crashed, and many of America's largest and most important corporations were left in a state of ruin. This recession persists to this day, so we must ask the question: How did this crisis come about, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was caused by selfish and naive political decision-making that forced banks and companies into issuing subprime loans into an already weak and insufficient financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were forced to undervalue and repackage these mortgages into CDOs and CDS. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks found themselves in a chaotic situation due to inadequate capital reserves and transferred this uncertainty onto the repackaged mortgages they had sold and onto the rest of the economy.\n\nThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 in the Clinton era, when the president aimed for a second term in office. He sought to increase his popularity. To achieve this, the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped lay the grim stage for the subprime crisis seven years later. Steven Holmes of The New York Times reported in 1999: \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton administration to expand mortgage loans among low- and moderate-income people and felt pressure from shareholders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\" Holmes went on to correctly predict the consequences of these actions: \"But the government-subsidized corporation may face trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes predicted, ill-advised lending would inevitably lead to the collapse of the economy.\n\nMany factors combined to throw the economy into a tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy with the housing market. This led to U.S. households and financial markets in general to overextend themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price.\n\nIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were devastated. The top five U.S. investment banks together reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA's GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at a bargain price, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subject to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n\n[/REWRITE]",

Das ist der Teil in deiner Geschichte, an dem du deine kleinen Schreibflügel ausbreitest und in die Luft fliegst, damit du mit deiner magnetischen, nein, magischen Prosa alle beeindruckst.  Oder es ist die Stelle, an der deine Leser einschläfern und/oder die \"Zurück\"-Taste drücken, während sie deinen Namen fluchen.  Dr. Merlin ist bekannt dafür, dass sie an ihrem Monitor schreit, wenn sie sich in der Mitte von Zu Viel Information befindet, und es ist nicht einmal von der lustigen Art.\n\nExposition ist nicht dein Freund.\n\nDeine liebe Leserschaft kennt den grundlegenden Schreib-Tipp \"Zeige, erzähle nicht\", aber Dr. Merlin stürzt immer noch in lange Passagen von Text, an denen nichts passiert, oder schlimmer noch, zu viel.  Exposition ist der kleine Teufel, der auf deiner Schulter sitzt und sagt, dass du die Geschichte hinterwegs aus dem Weg räumen solltest, um zu den guten Dingen zu kommen (nicht zu verwechseln mit dem Teufel, der auf der anderen Schulter sitzt und die Autorin auffordert, ihrer Leser jeden einzelnen Detail von der Kindheit jeder Figur zu erzählen).\n\nExposition bedeutet, dem Publikum mitzuteilen, was passiert ist, typischerweise in einfachen Prosa.  In Filmen passiert die Exposition, wenn ein Charakter einem anderen eine Informations-Dumping sagt, wie \"Der Rätselhafte Mariner\".  In der Fiktion ist der Autor der Erzähler.\n\nEin Beispiel ist angebracht.  Wenn du eine Geschichte liest, wirst du erzählt, dass die Heldin ihren geliebten an einem bestimmten Ort und zu einem bestimmten Zeitpunkt traf, dass sie in einer Gala-Feier geheiratet hat und dass ihr Ehemann vor ihren Augen getötet wurde.  Du würdest nicht erwarten, dass diese gesamte Sequenz zwei Seiten dauert, während der Ehemann und die Heldin jeweils nur zwei Zeilen Sprechwerk haben.  Du würdest erwarten, dass der Autor eine Zeit mit der Einführung der Charaktere verbringt, indem er durch ihren Sprach und Manieren zeigt, wie sehr er seine Frau liebt, und du würdest genauso erwarten, dass die Heldin durch große und kleine Wege zeigt, wie sehr seine Anwesenheit in ihrem Leben sie verändert und bereichert hat (besonders wenn das Erzählwerk dir später flach und direkt sagt, dass dies der Fall ist).  Eine ordentliche Einführung der Charaktere würde dir ermöglichen, mit seinem Schicksal verbunden zu sein und dir Einblicke in die Heldin selbst zu geben: was sie in ihm sah, wie tief ihre Bindung war, Hinweise auf ihre Gedanken und Überzeugungen und Träume, die durch das Prisma seiner Augen reflektiert werden, usw.  Du würdest mit ihm trauern und wirst dadurch noch enger mit der Heldin selbst verbunden.\n\nZusammengefasst, du würdest erwarten, dass du Fleisch auf dem einfachen Knochen der Storylinie \"Sie trafen sich, sie heirateten, er starb\" erhältst.\n\nAls Autor musst du das Fleisch liefern.  (*sieht auf Metapher, seufzt, geht voran*)  Manchmal ist es verlockend, gewisse Dinge zu übergehen.  Vielleicht introduces du einen neuen Charakter und weißt, dass er in der Luftwaffe war, er ist nun Nachtmanager in einer Tankstelle, er war zweimal verheiratet, keine Kinder, mag Fischen am Wochenende, heimliche Träume von der Eigentümerschaft der Tankstelle zu haben und hat Eier Benedikt für Frühstück gegessen.\n\nHier ist die Rückübersetzung ins Englisch:\n\n[REWRITE] Ah, exposition.

He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime.

They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin.

Die Hauptgeschichte handelte von einem Mann aus Ashley, Ohio, der seine Frau erstochen hatte. Sein Name war Shad Hostettler, aber die Frau wurde nicht namentlich erwähnt. Sie zeigten seinen Mundspiegel und er sah aus wie pure Bosheit. Sie widmeten nur etwa zwei Minuten dieser Geschichte, da es sich um ein laufendes Ereignis handelte. Die einzigen Details, die sie lieferten, waren, dass er sie mehrmals erstochen und verhaftet hatte. Ich denke, sie haben eine angemessene Zeit für diese Geschichte verwendet.\n\nDie zweite Geschichte handelte von einem frühen Morgen-Schusswaffeneinsatz von Travis Buyers, 18. Er wurde im Sharon-Woods-Gebiet angeschossen und war kritisch verletzt; es wurden keine Verhaftungen vorgenommen oder Verdächtige identifiziert. Die SWAT-Einheit untersuchte die Tat. Diese Geschichte schien kurz zu sein, und ich glaube, das möglicherweise lag daran, dass dies ein \"schwarzer\" Mann oder ein schwarzes Viertel war. Ich habe bemerkt (und habe es seit Jahren bemerkt) dass Minderheiten übergangen werden, wenn sie Opfer eines Verbrechens sind. Wenn man sagt, ein \"weißer\" Kind oder Erwachsener entführt oder verschwindet oder Opfer eines Verbrechens wird, geht die Medien außer sich; aber wenn ein Minderheitlerglückt es, wenn es überhaupt erwähnt wird.\n\nDie nächste Geschichte handelte von einem Schmauchloch im Med-Flight-Hubschrauber. Details wurden genannt, wo sie dachten, dass das Ereignis stattgefunden hatte. Es wurde festgestellt, dass es sich um eine .22-Kaliberpatrone von einem Gewehr handelte, die den Hubschrauber getroffen hatte. Crime-Stoppers bieten einen fünftausend-Dollar-Lotterpreis für Hinweise, die zu der Festnahme des Schützen führen.\n\nDie nächste Geschichte handelte von einem Diebstahl eines UDF in Clime Road in Columbus. Sie sagten, es sei ein dunkelhäutiger Schwarzer gewesen, der das Geschäft ausgeraubt hatte; er trug ein Sweatshirt im Stil eines Hoodie. Sie sagten, er sei etwa 1,80 Meter groß und wiege etwa 68 Kilo. Ich fand es ungewöhnlich, dass sie so viel Zeit darauf verwendeten, wie dunkel er war und dass er schwarz war.\n\nEine weitere Geschichte handelte von Rene Rodriguez, einem verurteilten texanischen Drogenbaronen. Er war wegen des Versuchs, marihuana in großen Mengen von Texas nach Ohio zu schmuggeln, verurteilt worden. Eine merkwürdige Beobachtung war, dass sie anstatt zu sagen, er sei zu 25 Jahren in Haft verurteilt worden, sagten \"300\" Monate. Ich bin nicht sicher, warum sie das dachten, ob sie dachten, das klingt härter oder was.

    "original": "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant.

In dieser Bindung liegen viele Gefühle: Liebe, Stolz, Eifersucht und Grausamkeit, um nur einige zu nennen. Brüder verstehen einander, viel besser als jeder andere mit einer solchen Bindung, und sie sehen nur sich selbst, wenn sie ihren Bruder ansiehen. Es ist, wenn eine Situation am schlimmsten ist, wenn die wahre Natur dieser Bindung zum Vorschein kommt, sei es gut oder böse. Wenn diese Gefühle klar werden, ziehen sie mit sich eine große Kosten nach sich. Ein Teil des Verständnisses der Gefühle, die aus dieser brüderlichen Verbindung entstehen, ist es, sich mit den Konsequenzen auseinanderzusetzen, die sie mit sich bringen. Wenn man jemandem in die Augen schauen kann und in dieser Person ihren eigenen Reflex sehen kann, sieht man sich selbst nicht, wie andere sie sehen, sondern wie man wirklich ist. In ihren Handlungen und den Konsequenzen dieser Handlungen liegt ihr wahres Wesen. In \"Der rote Ibis\" untersuchen zwei Brüder dieses Thema und alle die tobenden Emotionen, die es begleiten. Durch einen dichten, lebendig beschriebenen Landschaft, machen diese zwei Jungen eine sinnlose Reise. Bittere Enttäuschung klafft mit intensivem Stolz im klimaktischen Moment, und nur einer der Brüder entkommt mit seinem Leben. Das Thema wird durch direkte Charakterisierung des Protagonisten, Doodle, und ihrer Interaktionen miteinander, sowie durch die Betrachtung des Erzählers, die die komplexen Gefühle des Protagonisten und seine Sicht der Welt um ihn herum mitteilt, die beide stark auf seine Handlungen Einfluss haben.\n\nDie Handlungen des Protagonisten lassen sich alle auf eine Schlüsselgefühle zusammenfassen: Stolz. Von dem Moment an, als er und sein kleiner Bruder, Doodle, gemeinsam ausgehen, bis zu ihrem letzten, fatalen Ausflug, fühlt er Neid gegenüber Doodle. Er wollte einen Bruder, den er alle seine weltlichen Fähigkeiten beibringen konnte, wie \"...Atem anhalten, laufen, springen oder die Reben in der alten Frauensumpf erklimmen...\" Er wollte einen Bruder, der die Rolle eines ...\"Jemanden, der nach Horsehead Landing rennt und jemanden, der sich mit ihm auf den Baumstamm in der Topf des großen Pinus hinter dem Stall setzt...\" offensichtlich sind diese Dinge unmöglich, gegeben Doodles Zustand. Doodle wurde mit einem extrem schwachen Herz geboren, was es unwahrscheinlich machte, dass er überleben würde. Auch dann war es fast unmöglich, dass er jemals an körperlich anstrengenden Aktivitäten teilnehmen würde. Was für ein Schlag für den jungen Protagonisten, sein Kopf voller wilder Phantasien, wenn alle diese Träume in einen Augenblick zusammenkrachten. Tatsächlich zeigt man ihm sogar ein Verhältnis von Wut gegenüber dem kleinen Kind, da er sich daran erinnert, zu beginnen, über den Gedanken des Erstickens durch einen Kissen nachzudenken. Was für ein Kind würde überhaupt die Anwesenheit von Vernunft haben, sich des Mordes an einem Kind zu überlegen? Doch sein Herz schmilzt, wenn das kleine Kind ihn schmunzelt. Ein so einfaches Handeln gab dem Protagonisten so viel Hoffnung! Dies zeigt, dass seine Überzeugung wahrscheinlich nicht sehr stark war. Im Hintergrund seines Kopfes hatte er eine instinktive Liebe zu seinem Bruder.\n\nEnglish translation:\n[REWRITE] There is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within this bond lies many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, to name just a few. Brothers understand one another, far better than anyone else with such a bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its worst when the true nature of this bond is revealed, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they bring a great cost with them. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions lies their true character. In \"The Scarlet Ibis\", two brothers explore this theme and all the raging emotions that accompany it. Through a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys embark on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic moment, and only one brother manages to escape with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator's point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which heavily influence his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the moment he and his younger brother, Doodle, set out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He wanted a brother whom he could teach all his worldly skills, like \"holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp.\" He wanted a brother who could fill the role of \"someone to race to Horsehead Landing and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn.\" Obviously, these things were impossible, given Doodle's condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making it unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was almost impossible that he would ever participate in physically demanding activities. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head full of wild fantasies, to have all those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope!

Mit der fortschreitenden Technologie von primitiv zu modern, haben sich auch die verwendeten Metaphern zur Beschreibung des Gehirns weiterentwickelt. Zunächst wurde es mit einer Wachstafel verglichen, dann mit einem Blatt Papyrus, dann mit einem Buch und schließlich mit einem Computer. Wenn Sie über das Gehirn lernen, sollten Sie sich daran erinnern, dass die Nutzbarkeit dieser Metaphern begrenzt ist und zu falschen Schlussfolgerungen führen kann.\nDie Informationsverarbeitung beginnt mit Eingaben von den Sinnesorganen, die physische Reize wie Berührung, Hitze, Schallwellen oder Photonen aus Licht in Elektrochemissignale umwandeln. Die sensorische Information wird durch die Algorithmen des Gehirns in beide Richtungen der Verarbeitung wiederholt transformiert. Zum Beispiel, wenn man ein Bild eines schwarzen Kartons auf einem weißen Hintergrund betrachtet, setzen die bottom-up-Verarbeitung sehr einfache Information wie Farbe, Orientierung und wo die Grenzen des Objekts sind zusammen – wo die Farbe sich im kurzen Bereich signifikant ändert –, um zu entscheiden, dass man einen Karton sieht. Die top-down-Verarbeitung nutzt die Entscheidungen, die in einigen Schritten des bottom-up-Prozesses getroffen wurden, um die Anerkennung des Kartons zu beschleunigen. Die top-down-Verarbeitung könnte in diesem Beispiel Sie helfen, das Objekt als schwarzen Karton anstelle eines kartonsförmigen Loches im weißen Hintergrund zu identifizieren.\nSobald die Information zu einem gewissen Grad verarbeitet ist, entscheidet ein Aufmerksamkeitsfilter, wie wichtig der Signal ist und welche kognitiven Prozesse ihm zur Verfügung stehen sollen. Zum Beispiel verarbeiten Ihr Gehirn, wenn Sie auf Ihre Schuhe hinabblicken, jeden einzelnen Grashalm, aber ein gesunder Aufmerksamkeitsfilter verhindert, dass Sie sie individuell erkennen. Im Gegensatz dazu könnten Sie Ihr Namen erkennen, selbst wenn er in einem lauten Raum ausgesprochen wird. Es gibt viele Verarbeitungsstufen, und die Ergebnisse der Verarbeitung werden mehrfach durch Aufmerksamkeit moduliert.\nUm das Gehirn Informationen verarbeiten zu lassen, muss es zuerst gespeichert werden. Es gibt mehrere Arten von Gedächtnis, einschließlich sensorischem, arbeitsfähigem und langfristigem. Zuerst wird die Information kodiert. Es gibt Arten der Kodierung, die spezifisch für jeden Arten der sensorischen Reize sind. Zum Beispiel kann verballerter Eingang struktural kodiert werden, sich auf das Aussehen der gedruckten Wörter beziehend, phonemisch kodiert werden, sich auf das Klangbild der Wörter beziehend, oder semantisch kodiert werden, sich auf das Bedeutung des Worts beziehend. Sobald die Information gespeichert ist, muss sie aufrechterhalten werden. Einige Tierstudien deuten darauf hin, dass das Arbeitsgedächtnis, das Informationen für etwa 20 Sekunden speichert, durch einen elektrischen Signalstrom für einen kurzen Zeitraum durch eine bestimmte Serie von Neuronen aufrechterhalten wird. Die Informationen im langfristigen Gedächtnis werden vermutet, in der Struktur bestimmter Arten von Proteinen aufrechterhalten zu werden.\nEs gibt zahlreiche Modelle, die darlegen, wie das Wissen im Gehirn organisiert ist, einige basierend auf der Art und Weise, wie sich Menschen an Erinnerungen erinnern, andere basierend auf Computerwissenschaft und andere basierend auf Neurophysiologie. Das semantische Netzwerkmodell besagt, dass es Knoten gibt, die Konzepte darstellen und dass die Knoten auf ihrer Verwandtschaft basierend vernetzt sind. Zum Beispiel könnte ein semantisches Netzwerk \"Schreibtisch\" mit \"Tisch\" vernetzt sein, das wiederum mit \"holzern\" vernetzt sein kann und so weiter.\n\nEnglish translation back to English:\n\n[REWRITE] The human brain is a complex, creative information-processing system.

    "raw_output": "Die Übersetzung des Textes in Deutsch:\n\nAlbus Huxley kritisiert die drohende Bedrohung durch die Technologie und die kapitalistische Struktur, die durch sie gestärkt wird, durch die Erstellung einer Dystopie in der Novelle Brave New World. Die Menschen werten die Gemeinschaft über den Einzelnen und werden von Anfang an konditioniert, um sofortige Glückseligkeit über alles zu verfolgen. Die Bürger werden als Schachfiguren in einem umfassenderen Spiel enthüllt, die in einer größeren Ideologie gefangen sind, wie sie vom Weltkontroller diktiert wird. Durch die Untersuchung der Arbeit unter dem Mikroskop der marxistischen Theologie merkt man die unterliegenden Verdächtigungen des Autors hinsichtlich der Entwicklung der genannten Systeme. Häufig verwendete Begriffe im Marxismus, wie Homogenität und Reifikation, unterstreichen die Idee, dass Huxleys Roman eine Kritik an den Mängeln der sich entwickelnden Wirtschaft aus seiner Zeit ist.\n\nDer Kapitalismus wird durch die Verwendung der marxistischen These des falschen Bewusstseins satirisiert. Im Wesentlichen wird dem gewöhnlichen Bürgertum die wahre Beziehung zu anderen Klassen in wirtschaftlichen Begriffen vorenthalten, da sie sich hauptsächlich um ihren eigenen Gewinn kümmern. Es wird gesagt, dass dies das Ergebnis ideologischer Kontrolle der Proletarier und der allgemeinen Arbeiter ist, etwas, das durch die Konditionierung der Menschen in Brave New World offensichtlich ist. Die unteren Klassen, Delta, Gamma, usw., haben keinen wahren Willen von sich selbst; durch Hypnopaedia wird der Wunsch, zu konsumieren, zu verbrauchen, sich zu entfalten, über alles else gestärkt. Dies wird, wie bereits erwähnt, durch den Weltkontroller manipuliert. Hegemonie, im Wesentlichen die Idee, dass Gruppen sozialer Klassen von einer separaten Gruppe von Individuen in ihrer Gesamtheit beherrscht werden, wird offensichtlich in diesem Fall verwendet. Die unteren Klassen wissen weder davon, dass sie manipuliert werden, noch haben sie sich überhaupt misstrauisch gezeigt; sie kauften buchstäblich \"in eine Ideologie ein, die diese Struktur unterstützt\" (d.h. Kapitalismus und Konsumismus). Die Oberen Klassen werden geboren, um sich dessen bewusst zu sein, tun jedoch nichts; nur wenige Alphas oder Betas, wie Bernard, tun mehr als es zu akzeptieren, wo sie stehen. Tatsächlich sind die Interaktionen der sozialen Klassen, wie im weiteren Verlauf besprochen wird, bedeutende Hinweise auf die wahrgenommene Unterdrückung des Kapitalismus.\nZwischen den verschiedenen Individuen gibt es in Brave New World keine Beziehungen. Der Roman scheint die Charaktere voneinander zu trennen, selbst bei den Hauptcharakteren fehlt es ihnen an Tiefe. Vielleicht will Huxley andeuten, dass der Aufstieg der Technologie und des Kapitalismus zusammen mitleidenschaftlich Herr über die Freiheit und den Ausdruck des Menschen macht. Liebe existiert nicht, noch gibt es extreme Formen von Emotionen; vielmehr werden die Interaktionen oberflächlich gehalten, dargestellt durch die Bemerkungen der Männer über Frauen hauptsächlich über ihre körperliche Erscheinung (i.e. ihre Pneumatische Qualität), und die unbeschämt kommentierenden Aussagen der Frauen über ihre Begegnungen, sozusagen. Außerdem zeigen jeder sozialer Klassen Komplizenschaft mit ihrem Status in der Hierarchie die sozioökonomische Wirkung des Kapitalismus. Ihre absolute Unterwerfung unter ihre Rolle in der Gemeinschaft ist ein Hinweis auf das marxistische Gedankengut über den Proletariat, die sich falsch versichert fühlen, über alles andere zu herrschen, solange sie fortfahren, zu konsumieren, zu gehorchen, sich mit der Rest der Gesellschaft zu arrangieren.\n\n[REWRITE] \nHowever, Aldous Huxley criticizes the impending threat of both technology and the capitalist structure reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World.

In fact, the interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals do not exist in Brave New World. The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through the males remarks about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’ unashamed comments about their encounters, so to speak. Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy indicate the socioeconomic effect of capitalism. Their absolute obedience to their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely assured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.",

For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center.

Für viele, einschließlich mich selbst, kann die Bewegung auf dem Campus ein Problem darstellen. Während meinem ersten Studienjahr wurde ich in einem Zimmer in den East Halls untergebracht; fast deckungsgleich mit dem östlichsten Punkt des Campus, wenn man die Sportanlagen und das Bryce Jordan Center nicht mitzählt. Die Fahrt von meinem Zuhause in Stuart Hall zu Kursen in solch abgelegenen Gebieten wie dem Willard-Gebäude, in der Nähe des Campuszentrums, kann bis zu 25 Minuten zu Fuß dauern, besonders, wenn das Wetter schlecht ist, wie es oft in State College der Fall ist. Wenn ich mit einem Alum sprach, der nicht viel älter war als ich, erfuhr ich, dass nicht lange Zeit her die East Halls-Schlafsäle von der restlichen Schule durch riesige unbebaute Flächen abgetrennt waren. Heute hat dieser leere Raum mit Sportfeldern, neuen Gebäuden, darunter dem neuen Creamery und neuen Gesundheitsdienstgebäude, und mit Wohnungen umgeben worden. Da sich unser Campus weiter vergrößert, wird die Bewegung von einem Ort zu einem anderen immer schwieriger. Was wäre die beste Lösung für das Mobilitätsproblem? Auf einem College-Campus ist das Fahrrad die beste Lösung. Aber das Fahrrad allein wird kein Problem lösen. Die Studenten müssen darauf fahren, und der Campus muss sich an die Bedürfnisse der Fahrradfahrer anpassen. \n\nIch sprach mit einem Freund von mir, der kürzlich sein Fahrradfahren nach mehreren Jahren Pause wieder aufgenommen hat. Er meinte, er wundere sich, warum er überhaupt aufgehört war. „Fahrräder sind großartig“, sagte er, „für ein paar Jahre war es nicht cool, ein Fahrrad zu fahren, aber es ist der einzige Weg, um sich zu bewegen.“ Neben der guten körperlichen Verfassung ist Fahrradfahren auch die effizienteste Art, sich zu bewegen. Ein Schälchen Haferflocken und ein bisschen körperliche Anstrengung werden einen Weg von 30 Meilen oder mehr zurücklegen. Wie viele Studenten, habe ich jetzt außerhalb des Campus wohnen; genauso weit von der Mitte des Campus, wie einige Schlafsaalgebäude. Die beste Entscheidung, die ich dieses Jahr getroffen habe, war es, ein Fahrrad zu kaufen. Jeden Tag habe ich Kurse in Thomas Gebäude, leicht ein 25-minütiger Spaziergang von meinem Zuhause. Mit Fahrrad kann ich die Zeit auf 5 Minuten reduzieren, wenn ich schnell genug pedaliere. Das einzige Problem ist, dass Pollock Road der direkteste Weg zu Thomas Gebäude von meinem Haus ist, und es ist nicht immer eine einfache Straße, egal ob ich zu Fuß oder mit Fahrrad fahre. Es gibt Dinge zu sagen für das Gehen, aber persönlich bin ich einfach zu beschäftigt, um zu gehen. Würde ich mein Fahrrad nicht haben, ginge ich zu Fuß, aber das wäre meine einzige verlässliche Option, um zur Klasse zu kommen. Fußgänger zu Thomas jeden Tag zu erreichen würde mir zusätzliche 30-40 Minuten pro Tag abnehmen. Das ist über zwei und eine halbe Stunden pro Woche. Dazu kommt die Zeit, die ich für andere Kurse, Termine und dergleichen hätte verbringen müssen, wenn ich zu Fuß gegangen wäre. Das ist mehr Zeit, als ich mir leisten kann.\n\nEnglish translation:\n[REWRITE]I have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters.
