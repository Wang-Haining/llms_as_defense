    "raw_output": "Kultur spielt eine bedeutende Rolle in jeder Verhandlung. Kultur kann ebenso sehr dadurch definiert werden, was sie nicht ist, wie durch das, was sie tatsächlich ist und was sie bedeutet. Kultur ist weder homogen noch eine spezifische Sache. Sie ist auch nicht singular oder einheitlich. Aussagen wie „alle Russen sind stur“ oder „alle Japaner sind entgegenkommend“ sind von Natur aus allgemein und zu simpel. Während das Verständnis der Verallgemeinerungen einer Kultur angebracht ist, ist es für einen Verhandlungsführer viel produktiver, die Bedeutung einer Kultur für die jeweilige Angelegenheit und die Auswirkungen der Einstellung dieser Kultur auf die Verhandlungen zu verstehen. Wenn man sich einer fremden Kultur nähert, erlebt man sie auf eine Weise, die für die eigene Kultur nachvollziehbar ist, und Vergleiche entstehen zwangsläufig.\n\nDer Versuch, eine fremde Kultur oder Denkweise zu verstehen, kann alles umfassen, von der Erforschung ihrer Geschichte bis hin zum Erkennen ihrer Vorurteile. Anstatt eine Kultur zu bewerten oder zu versuchen, sie zu ändern, muss man sie einfach so akzeptieren, wie sie ist, und innerhalb ihrer Grenzen arbeiten, insbesondere im Rahmen von Verhandlungen und besonders dann, wenn man mit einer schwächeren Verhandlungsposition an den Tisch kommt. Ebenso kann Respekt vor Traditionen und Überzeugungen, wenn ein Verhandlungsführer sich auf „fremdem“ Territorium befindet, nur helfen, kulturelle Barrieren zu überwinden und die Verhandlung voranzutreiben.\n\nEs ist wichtig zu beachten, dass sich Kultur nicht unbedingt auf eine nationale/internationale Dichotomie beschränkt. Die meisten Unternehmen innerhalb eines bestimmten Landes etablieren ihre eigene Unternehmenskultur. Beispielsweise könnte eine Unternehmenskultur lange Bürozeiten oder einen entspannteren Zeitplan betonen. Hinweise auf eine Unternehmenskultur können in den Kleiderordnungen der Mitarbeiter, im Kommunikationsstil (direkte vs. indirekte Kommunikation, Aufgabenverteilung) und in den Einstellungspraktiken zu sehen sein. Einige Unternehmen ermutigen zu Philanthropie auf jeder Ebene von Mitarbeitern, andere beschränken sie auf „vom Unternehmen genehmigte“ Wohltätigkeitsorganisationen oder Fundraiser. Man muss sich nur die Unterschiede in der amerikanischen Unternehmenskultur von Unternehmen zu Unternehmen ansehen (und tatsächlich gibt es sogar innerhalb eines Unternehmens von Region zu Region, städtischen zu vorstädtischen Umgebungen eingeschlossen, Vielfalt), um die Vielfalt des Denkens zu schätzen, die innerhalb einer bestimmten gesellschaftlichen Kultur vorhanden sein kann. Bestimmte Kulturen sind bei weitem nicht so stratifiziert wie die amerikanische Kultur und mögen einem Außenstehenden einheitlicher erscheinen, aber ein ähnliches Äußeres ist einfach ein Zeichen dafür, tiefer zu graben.\n\nEs ist noch wichtiger, Werte zu verstehen, da sie den Grund für eine Kultur liefern. Wenn das Bewahren des Gesichts oder die Gemeinschaftsharmonie innerhalb einer Kultur von Bedeutung sind, wird ein Verhandlungsführer sicher nicht öffentlich seine Firma oder seinen Vorgesetzten beschämen, um am Verhandlungstisch erfolgreich zu sein. Ebenso wird ein Verhandlungsführer aus einer Kultur, die einem harten Verhandeln mehr Gewicht beimisst, nicht notwendigerweise dazu getrieben sein, sich so früh wie möglich zu einigen. Diese Verallgemeinerungen in Betracht zu ziehen, ist wichtig, bevor man an den Verhandlungstisch kommt. Dennoch ist es für einen Verhandlungsführer von Vorteil, etwas Persönliches über seinen Gegner zu erfahren, um die Verhandlung effektiv zu gestalten.\n\n[REWRITE]  \nCulture plays a crucial role in any negotiation.

Diese Überzeugung scheint auch von dem anderen Autor, den wir besprechen werden, Thomas von Aquin, geteilt zu werden. Da jeder ihrer Argumente dasselbe Konzept verteidigt und unsere Herausforderung darin besteht zu bestimmen, welches das bessere der beiden ist, müssen wir aus Gründen der Kürze mit der Annahme beginnen, dass beide in ihrem Glauben an die Existenz Gottes, speziell des Gottes der Bibel, korrekt sind. Einen Gott anzunehmen, der nicht dem entspricht, an den unsere beiden Autoren glauben, würde uns nicht erlauben, ihre beiden Argumente angemessen zu vergleichen, da sie im Wesentlichen ein bestimmtes Konzept von Gott verteidigen. Das gesagt, würde ich vorschlagen, dass, obwohl jeder von ihnen gültige Punkte vorbringt, keiner wirklich eine ganzheitliche Grundlage für den Glauben an Gott bietet. Um diesen Punkt zu veranschaulichen, werden wir zuerst das grundlegende Argument von St. Anselm untersuchen. Anselms Passage spiegelt einen Weg wider, durch Glauben Verständnis zu gewinnen, indem man in sich selbst nach Beweisen für Gott sucht. Er erklärt, dass wir, da Gott in unserem Verständnis existiert, seine Nichtexistenz nicht effektiv begreifen können. Während dieses Konzept, wenn es in seiner Terminologie erklärt wird, etwas mühsam und manchmal unklar ist, ist der wesentliche Kern, dass der Beweis für Gott im eigenen Geist liegt. St. Anselm schlägt uns vor, dass wir nicht über die Grenzen unserer eigenen Seele hinausgehen müssen, um die Wahrheit über Gott zu finden, sondern dass die Existenz dieses Wesens einfach dadurch als wahr erachtet wird, dass wir das untersuchen, was wir in unseren eigenen Köpfen von Natur aus als wahr wissen. Fremde Beweise sind vermutlich unnötig. Dieses Konzept, das anzunehmen, wofür es keinen unwiderlegbaren empirischen Beweis gibt, wird oft in christlichen Texten als Glaube bezeichnet. Diese Idee unterscheidet sich stark von der von St. Thomas von Aquin. Aquin schlägt stattdessen vor, dass die Existenz Gottes vollständig durch Vernunft und empirische Beweise bewiesen werden kann, ohne dass irgendeine Form von Glauben erforderlich ist. Eine solche Idee wäre im Evangelismus, einem wichtigen Element des Christentums, vorteilhaft, da es die Gewinnung neuer Konvertiten ermöglichen würde, ohne dass ihre Bereitschaft erforderlich wäre, etwas zu akzeptieren, das nicht bewiesen werden kann. Sie könnten stattdessen allein durch Logik überzeugt werden. St. Thomas erläutert fünf verschiedene logische Argumente, die die Existenz Gottes unterstützen: Veränderung, Verursachung, Kontingenz, Grade der Exzellenz und Harmonie. In jedem zeigt er im Wesentlichen, dass der Beweis für Gott in der logischen Notwendigkeit für Gott liegt. Wenn Ihnen gesagt wird, dass Ihnen ein Puzzleteil fehlt und Sie den Rest des Puzzles zusammensetzen, diktiert die Logik, dass Sie die Merkmale und die Existenz des fehlenden Teils kennen können, ohne es sehen zu müssen.\n\n[REWRITE] \"The fool says in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This quote first appears in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and is at the beginning of St. Anselm's argument about God's existence.

Since both arguments defend the same concept, and our task is to determine which is superior, we must, for the sake of brevity, assume they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. Assuming a God-type figure different from the one in which our two authors believe would not allow us to adequately compare their arguments, as they essentially defend a specific concept of God.

In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects.

Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

Einige dieser Techniken sind wirkungsvoller als andere. F. Scott Fitzgerald nutzt viele dieser unterschiedlichen Techniken in seinem Roman Der große Gatsby. Manchmal kombiniert Fitzgerald ein Adjektiv und ein Substantiv, die normalerweise nicht zusammenpassen, um den Lesern eine bestimmte Aura um ein Thema zu geben. Andere Male verleiht er einem Symbol eine Bedeutung und verwendet es dann für denselben Zweck. Fitzgerald nutzt diese letzte Technik mit vielen Farben, darunter Gold, Grün, Weiß/Grau und Rot/Rosa. In seinem Roman Der große Gatsby baut F. Scott Fitzgerald Bedeutungen für Farben auf, insbesondere Weiß/Grau und Rot/Rosa, und verwendet diese Bedeutungen später, um den Lesern eine bestimmte Erinnerung an ein Gefühl um ein wichtiges Objekt zu geben.\n\nDie Bedeutung, die Fitzgerald für Weiß/Grau entwickelt und verwendet, ist Einheitlichkeit, wobei Weiß etwas schöner und höherklassig ist und Grau älter und verblasster wirkt. Fitzgerald legt diese Bedeutung zu Beginn des Romans mit dem ständigen Gebrauch beider Farben fest. Daisy und Jordan sind ständig „in Weiß“ – tatsächlich trägt jeder immer Weiß: Nick trägt „weiße Flanellhosen“ auf Gatsbys Party, Tom trägt ein „weißes Hemd“, wenn er Myrtle trifft, und Catherine ist „milchig weiß gepudert“. Tatsächlich tragen die Menschen nur dann kein Weiß, wenn Nick seine Eindrücke von Gatsbys Party bekommt: „die Flure... sind prunkvoll mit Primärfarben“. Fitzgerald definiert diese beiden Farben weiter, indem er viele gewöhnliche, unwichtige Themen in diesen Farben darstellt: Wenn Nick zur Arbeit geht, geht er „abwärts durch die weißen Schluchten von Lower New York“, die Namen der Menschen auf Gatsbys Partys sind auf Nicks Zeitplan „graue Namen“, Catherines Wohnung ist „ein Stück in einem langen weißen Kuchen von Wohnhäusern“ – Einheitlichkeit. Er beschreibt auch einfache oder alltägliche Menschen oder Orte als weiß oder grau: Jordan und Daisy hatten gemeinsam eine „weiße Mädchenzeit“, es gibt „graue Autos“ und „graues Land“ im Tal der Asche, das „italienische Kind“ in der Eisenbahn ist „grau“ und der Hundeverkäufer ist „ein grauer alter Mann“.\n\nNachdem Fitzgerald genug Bedeutung in Weiß/Grau hineingesteckt hat, verwendet er sie, um Unwichtigkeit oder Einheitlichkeit in Bezug auf bestimmte Themen zu signalisieren. Diese Verwendung von Farben, um den Lesern etwas zu zeigen, beginnt zunächst mit Daisy. Nach langer Zeit ohne nennenswerte Verwendung einer dieser Farben beschreibt Fitzgerald Daisy als „in Weiß gekleidet“ in einem „kleinen weißen Roadster“; die Leser beginnen, Daisy weniger als Charakter zu sehen, mehr wie eine einheitliche Ergänzung, etwas, das Gatsby will und begehrt. Fitzgerald verwendet mehr von dieser Technik um Daisy herum, um den Eindruck zu erwecken, dass Daisy eine einheitlichere Ergänzung ist, zum Beispiel gibt es einen „grauen Schleier von Daisys Pelzkragen“, und sie ist wieder in einem „weißen“ Kleid vor der Begegnung zwischen Tom und Gatsby.\n\n[REWRITE]Many authors employ different methods to convey a certain feeling or attitude towards important subjects to their readers.

He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and Daisy had a \"white girlhood\" together, there are \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" in the valley of ashes, the \"Italian child\" on the railroad is \"gray,\" and the dog-seller is \"a gray old man.\"\n\nAfter Fitzgerald has imbued white/gray with enough meaning, he uses them to signify unimportance or uniformity in certain subjects. This use of colors to show something to readers first starts with Daisy. After a long period without significant use of either color, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster\"; readers begin to see Daisy less as a character, more like a uniform addition, something that Gatsby desires and longs for. Fitzgerald employs more of this technique around Daisy to give the impression of her being a more uniform addition, for instance, there is a \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar,\" and she is again in a \"white\" dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",

Häufige Anbauprodukte sind: Tomaten, Zitrusfrüchte, Blattgemüse, Kürbis, Brokkoli, Kräuter, Baumfrüchte wie Pfirsiche und Zitronen, Beeren, Honig und Paprika. Es gibt einen beträchtlichen Markt für Lebensmittel aus ökologischer, gemeinschaftlich unterstützter Landwirtschaft in der Gegend von San Diego, wobei viele lokale Organisationen lange Wartelisten haben. Auch Bio-Eier und Milch sind beliebt. Viele Bio-Bauernhöfe bieten zudem Führungen durch ihre landwirtschaftlichen Betriebe sowie Zugang zum Wandern, zur Vogelbeobachtung und zu anderen Freizeitaktivitäten an. Diese Art von Betrieb würde es dem Landbesitzer ermöglichen, die Vorteile von Regierungsprogrammen zu nutzen, während er den Lebensraum verbessert, was den Freizeitgebrauch erlaubt und eine Gelegenheit für Bauernhofführungen und andere Programme zur Einnahmenerzielung oder zu Bildungszwecken schafft.\n\nNeben der Erfüllung eines potenziell lukrativen Nischenmarktes umfassen die Vorteile des ökologischen Landbaus oft eine größere Artenvielfalt bei Pflanzen und Tieren in der Region, dank eines Mangels an Chemikalien im Boden und Wasser. Ökologischer Landbau hat jedoch in gewisser Hinsicht höhere Kosten als konventionelle Landwirtschaft. Es erfordert mehr intensive Arbeit und Management, um Schädlinge und Unkraut zu entfernen und den Boden ohne Chemikalien zu düngen, und die Verluste sind oft größer als bei konventionellen Methoden, während ein kleiner Bio-Bauernhof auch die Effizienz von Großbetrieben vermisst. Praktiken, die nicht mit dem ökologischen Landbau zusammenhängen, aber für die Tierwelt vorteilhaft sind, können ebenfalls höhere Arbeitskosten verursachen, einschließlich des Anpflanzens von Zwischenfrüchten, strategischer Weidewechsel, der Entfernung invasiver Arten und des aktiven Managements des Pflanzenwachstums, um spezifische Bedingungen wie Randhabitate oder offene Flächen zu schaffen. Daher gibt es viele Gründe, warum der Landbesitzer in diesem Beispiel finanzielle Hilfe oder Fachwissen suchen könnte, um sowohl den Gewinn als auch die Qualität des Lebensraums zu maximieren.\n\nDas für dieses Szenario gewählte Landstück liegt neben der Stadt Potrero im nicht eingemeindeten San Diego County, Kalifornien. Es umfasst 160 Morgen Chaparral, nicht einheimisches mediterranes Grasland und Eichenwald neben dem Cleveland National Forest. Es liegt in der Ökoregion der südlichen Vorgebirge des East County des San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. Der Plan wird noch geprüft, berücksichtigt derzeit jedoch über hundert Pflanzen- und Tierarten. Viele davon sind gefährdet, wie der Stephens-Kängururatte, der Berggelbfußfrosch, mehrere Schmetterlingsarten und der kalifornische Gnatcatcher; andere sind im Rückgang begriffen und könnten bald auf die Liste gesetzt werden, wie die Grabeneulen.\n\nDieses Gebiet war über unzählige Jahrhunderte von Ureinwohnern besiedelt und wurde dann im späten 19. Jahrhundert von Viehzüchtern und Brennholzverkäufern besiedelt. Dieses Stück Land war Teil eines ursprünglichen Siedlungspatents und wurde wahrscheinlich für die Beweidung und/oder Holzproduktion über viele der dazwischenliegenden Jahrzehnte genutzt.\n\nIch wählte ein Grundstück aus einer Immobilien-Website und erforschte verfügbare Regierungsprogramme, um zu sehen, welche Optionen ein kleiner Landwirt realistisch haben könnte, um Kosten zu mindern und wildtierfreundliche Betriebe zu erhalten.

In diesem Band liegen viele Emotionen: Liebe, Stolz, Eifersucht und Grausamkeit, um nur einige zu nennen. Brüder verstehen einander, weit mehr als jeder andere mit dieser Art von Verbindung, und sie können sich nur selbst sehen, wenn sie ihren Bruder anschauen. In der kritischsten Situation offenbart sich die wahre Natur dieses Bandes, sei es gut oder böse. Wenn diese Emotionen klar werden, tragen sie einen hohen Preis mit sich. Ein Teil des Verständnisses der Emotionen, die aus dieser brüderlichen Verbindung entstehen, besteht darin, mit den Konsequenzen umzugehen, die sie mit sich bringen. Wenn jemand einem Bruder in die Augen schauen kann und in dieser Person das eigene Spiegelbild sieht, sehen sie sich nicht so, wie andere sie sehen, sondern wie sie wirklich sind. In ihren Handlungen und den daraus resultierenden Konsequenzen liegt ihr wahrer Charakter. In „The Scarlet Ibis“ erkunden zwei Brüder dieses Thema und all die tobenden Emotionen, die es begleiten. Durch eine üppige, lebendig beschriebene Landschaft unternehmen diese beiden Jungen eine vergebliche Reise. Bittere Enttäuschung trifft in der dramatischen Szene auf intensiven Stolz, und nur ein Bruder entkommt mit seinem Leben. Das Thema wird durch die direkte Charakterisierung des Protagonisten, Doodle, und ihre Interaktionen miteinander ausgedrückt, sowie durch den Blickwinkel des Erzählers, der die komplexen Gefühle des Protagonisten und seine Sicht auf die Welt um ihn herum vermittelt, die beide einen starken Einfluss auf seine Handlungen haben.\nDie Handlungen des Protagonisten lassen sich alle durch ein Schlüsselgefühl zusammenfassen: Stolz. Von dem Moment an, als er und sein kleiner Bruder Doodle zum ersten Mal zusammen losziehen, bis zu ihrem letzten, schicksalhaften Ausflug, empfindet der Protagonist Groll gegenüber Doodle. Er wollte einen Bruder, dem er all seine weltlichen Fähigkeiten beibringen konnte, wie „...den Atem anhalten, laufen, springen oder die Ranken im Old Woman Swamp erklimmen...“ Er wollte einen Bruder, der die Rolle ausfüllen konnte von „...jemandem, mit dem man zum Horsehead Landing rennen kann... und jemandem, mit dem man auf der höchsten Astgabel der großen Kiefer hinter der Scheune sitzen kann...“ Offensichtlich sind diese Dinge aufgrund von Doodles Zustand unmöglich. Doodle wurde mit einem extrem schwachen Herzen geboren, was es unwahrscheinlich machte, dass er überhaupt überleben würde. Selbst dann war es nahezu unmöglich, dass er jemals an intensiver körperlicher Aktivität teilnehmen würde. Was für ein Schlag für den jungen Protagonisten, dessen Kopf mit wilden Fantasien gefüllt war, all diese Träume in einem Augenblick zerschlagen zu sehen. Tatsächlich wird gezeigt, dass er sogar etwas Wut auf das kleine Kind hegte, als er sich daran erinnerte, darüber nachzudenken, ihn zu töten, indem er ihn mit einem Kissen erstickte. Was für ein Kind hätte die Geistesgegenwart, über Kindstötung nachzudenken? Doch sein Herz schmilzt, als das kleine Kind ihn anlächelt. Ein solch einfacher Akt gab dem Protagonisten so viel Hoffnung! Dies zeigt, dass seine Überzeugung wahrscheinlich nicht sehr stark war.

Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology.

Mit dem Fortschritt der Technologie von primitiven zu modernen Zeiten, entwickelten sich auch die Metaphern, die verwendet wurden, um das Gehirn zu beschreiben. Zunächst wurde es mit einer Wachstafel verglichen, dann mit einem Papyrusblatt, dann mit einem Buch und zuletzt mit einem Computer. Während Sie über das Gehirn lernen, sollten Sie beachten, dass der Nutzen dieser Metaphern begrenzt ist und zu falschen Schlussfolgerungen führen kann.\n\nDie Informationsverarbeitung beginnt mit dem Input von den Sinnesorganen, die physische Reize wie Berührung, Hitze, Schallwellen oder Lichtphotonen in elektrochemische Signale umwandeln. Die sensorischen Informationen werden von den Algorithmen des Gehirns sowohl in der bottom-up als auch in der top-down Verarbeitung wiederholt transformiert. Zum Beispiel, wenn man ein Bild einer schwarzen Box auf weißem Hintergrund betrachtet, setzt die bottom-up Verarbeitung sehr einfache Informationen wie Farbe, Orientierung und wo die Grenzen des Objekts sind – wo sich die Farbe über einen kurzen Raum signifikant ändert – zusammen, um zu entscheiden, dass man eine Box sieht. Die top-down Verarbeitung nutzt die Entscheidungen, die bei einigen Schritten des bottom-up Prozesses getroffen werden, um Ihre Erkennung der Box zu beschleunigen. In diesem Beispiel könnte die top-down Verarbeitung Ihnen helfen, das Objekt als eine schwarze Box statt als ein kastenförmiges Loch im weißen Hintergrund zu identifizieren.\n\nSobald die Informationen bis zu einem gewissen Grad verarbeitet sind, entscheidet ein Aufmerksamkeitsfilter, wie wichtig das Signal ist und welchen kognitiven Prozessen es zugänglich gemacht werden sollte. Zum Beispiel, obwohl Ihr Gehirn jedes Grashalm verarbeitet, wenn Sie auf Ihre Schuhe schauen, verhindert ein gesunder Aufmerksamkeitsfilter, dass Sie sie einzeln bemerken. Im Gegensatz dazu könnten Sie Ihren Namen heraushören, selbst wenn er in einem lauten Raum gesprochen wird. Es gibt viele Verarbeitungsstufen, und die Ergebnisse der Verarbeitung werden durch Aufmerksamkeit immer wieder moduliert.\n\nDamit das Gehirn Informationen verarbeiten kann, müssen diese zuerst gespeichert werden. Es gibt verschiedene Arten von Gedächtnis, einschließlich sensorischem, Arbeits- und Langzeitgedächtnis. Zuerst wird die Information kodiert. Es gibt Arten der Kodierung, die spezifisch für jeden Typ von sensorischem Reiz sind. Zum Beispiel kann verbaler Input strukturell kodiert werden, was sich darauf bezieht, wie das gedruckte Wort aussieht, phonemisch, was sich darauf bezieht, wie das Wort klingt, oder semantisch, was sich darauf bezieht, was das Wort bedeutet. Sobald die Informationen gespeichert sind, müssen sie aufrechterhalten werden. Einige Tierstudien legen nahe, dass das Arbeitsgedächtnis, das Informationen für etwa 20 Sekunden speichert, durch ein elektrisches Signal aufrechterhalten wird, das für einen kurzen Zeitraum durch eine bestimmte Serie von Neuronen schleift. Informationen im Langzeitgedächtnis werden vermutlich in der Struktur bestimmter Proteinarten aufrechterhalten.\n\nEs gibt zahlreiche Modelle, wie Wissen im Gehirn organisiert ist, einige basieren darauf, wie menschliche Probanden Erinnerungen abrufen, andere basieren auf der Informatik und wieder andere auf der Neurophysiologie. Das semantische Netzwerkmodell besagt, dass es Knoten gibt, die Konzepte repräsentieren, und dass die Knoten basierend auf ihrer Verwandtschaft verknüpft sind. Zum Beispiel könnte in einem semantischen Netzwerk „Stuhl“ mit „Tisch“ verknüpft sein, das wiederum mit „hölzern“ verknüpft sein kann, und so weiter.\n\n[REWRITE]  \nThe human brain is a complex and creative system for processing information.

For example, when looking at an image of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing assembles basic information like color, orientation, and the object’s borders—where the color changes significantly over a short distance—to determine that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses decisions made during some steps of bottom-up processing to speed up the recognition of the box. In this example, top-down processing might help identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\n\nOnce information is processed to a certain extent, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and to which cognitive processes it should be made available. For instance, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results are repeatedly modulated by attention.\n\nFor the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are different types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimulus. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to the appearance of the printed word, phonemically, referring to how the word sounds, or semantically, referring to the meaning of the word. Once stored, the information must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for about 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a specific series of neurons for a short time. Long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\n\nThere are numerous models of how knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on how human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and these nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For instance, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",

Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",

    "raw_output": "In 2007 gerieten die Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika in eine erdrückende Finanzkrise. Die Arbeitslosigkeit stieg, der Immobilienmarkt brach zusammen, und viele der größten und wichtigsten Unternehmen Amerikas lagen in Trümmern. Diese Rezession hält bis heute an, daher müssen wir uns fragen: Wie kam es zu dieser Krise und wie können wir sie stoppen? Kurz gesagt, die Finanzkrise wurde durch egoistische und naive politische Entscheidungen verursacht, die Banken und Unternehmen dazu drängten, Subprime-Kredite in eine bereits unreife und unzureichende finanzielle Infrastruktur zu vergeben. Unterdessen wurden Fannie Mae (FNMA) und Freddie Mac (FHLMC) unter Druck gesetzt, diese Hypotheken zu übernehmen und in CDOs und CDSs umzupacken. Als Kreditnehmer mit diesen Darlehen in Verzug gerieten, fehlte den Banken das Kapital, und sie übertrugen dieses Chaos auf die umverpackten Hypotheken, die sie verkauft hatten, und auf den Rest der Wirtschaft.\n\nDie Finanzkrise hatte ihre Wurzeln im Jahr 1999 während der Clinton-Ära, als der Präsident eine zweite Amtszeit anstrebte. Er wollte seine Amtszeit verlängern, indem er seine Popularität steigerte. Um dies zu erreichen, lockerte die Clinton-Administration die Kreditvergaberestriktionen, was half, die düstere Bühne für die Subprime-Krise sieben Jahre später zu bereiten. Steven Holmes von der New York Times berichtete 1999: „Fannie Mae, der größte Hypothekenversicherer des Landes, steht unter zunehmendem Druck der Clinton-Administration, Hypothekendarlehen unter Menschen mit niedrigem und mittlerem Einkommen auszuweiten und fühlte sich von den Aktionären unter Druck gesetzt, sein phänomenales Wachstum bei den Gewinnen aufrechtzuerhalten.“ Holmes würde die Konsequenzen dieser Maßnahmen korrekt voraussehen: „Aber das vom Staat subventionierte Unternehmen könnte in wirtschaftlichen Abschwüngen in Schwierigkeiten geraten, was zu einer staatlichen Rettung ähnlich der Spar- und Darlehensindustrie in den 1980er Jahren führen könnte.“ Wie in der Einleitung ausführlich beschrieben und wie Holmes voraussah, würde eine unüberlegte Kreditvergabe sicherlich zum Zusammenbruch der Wirtschaft führen.\n\nViele Faktoren kombinierten sich, um die Wirtschaft in einen Sturzflug zu versetzen, einer davon war die neue und komplexe Struktur der Hypotheken. Hypotheken mit variablem Zinssatz, hypothekenbesicherte Wertpapiere und besicherte Schuldverschreibungen (CDOs) wurden in den Jahren vor der Krise umfassend genutzt und dienten nur dazu, mehr Sektoren der Wirtschaft in den Immobilienmarkt zu verflechten. Dies führte dazu, dass sich US-Haushalte und Finanzmärkte im Allgemeinen im Immobilienmarkt übermäßig verschuldeten und extrem anfällig für selbst kleine Preisänderungen wurden.\n\nTatsächlich platzte die Immobilienblase, und die Finanzinstitute, die diese hypothekenbesicherten Wertpapiere gekauft hatten, wurden bestraft. Die fünf größten US-Investmentbanken meldeten 2007 zusammen 4,1 Billionen Dollar an Hypothekenschulden, was etwa 30 % des BIP der USA ausmachte. Am Ende wurden Bear Sterns und Merrill Lynch außergewöhnlich günstig verkauft, Lehman Brothers wurde aufgelöst, und Goldman Sachs und Morgan Stanley wurden gezwungen, Geschäftsbanken zu werden, die intensiven Regulierungen unterlagen. Fannie und Freddie hatten 5 Billionen Dollar an Hypothekenschulden und wurden im September 2008 unter staatliche Kontrolle gestellt.\n\n[REWRITE]In 2007, the United States of America was engulfed in a severe financial crisis. Unemployment rose, the housing market collapsed, and many of America's largest and most vital companies were left in ruins. This recession persists today, prompting the question: how did this crisis arise, and how can we prevent it? In essence, the financial crisis was triggered by selfish and naive political decisions that pressured banks and firms into issuing subprime loans into an already immature and inadequate financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were urged to underwrite and repackage these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks lacked capital reserves and transferred this turmoil onto the repackaged mortgages they had sold, impacting the entire economy.\n\nThe financial crisis traces its roots back to 1999 during the Clinton era, as the President sought a second term in office. He aimed to extend his presidency by boosting his popularity. To achieve this, the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, setting the stage for the subprime crisis seven years later.

Der Teil in Ihrer Geschichte, in dem Sie Ihre kleinen Schriftstellerflügel ausbreiten und fliegen, alle mit Ihrem magnetischen, ja magischen Prosa verblüffen. Oder der Teil, in dem Ihre Leser einschlafen und/oder auf die \"Zurück\"-Taste drücken, während sie Ihren Namen verfluchen. Dr. Merlin ist dafür bekannt, ihren Monitor anzuschreien, wenn sie sich mitten in zu vielen Informationen befindet, und das nicht einmal auf die lustige Art.\n\nExposition ist nicht Ihr Freund.\n\nMeine sanften Leser kennen bereits den grundlegenden Schreibtipp \"Zeigen, nicht erzählen\", aber Dr. Merlin stolpert immer noch in lange Textpassagen, in denen nichts passiert, oder schlimmer noch, zu viel. Die Exposition ist der kleine Teufel, der auf Ihrer Schulter sitzt und sagt, dass Sie die Geschichte aus dem Weg räumen sollen, um zu den guten Teilen zu gelangen (nicht zu verwechseln mit dem Teufel, der auf der anderen Schulter sitzt und den Autor dazu drängt, ihrem Publikum jedes einzelne Detail der Kindheit jeder Figur zu erzählen).\n\nExposition bedeutet, dem Publikum zu erzählen, was passiert ist, typischerweise in einfacher Prosa. Im Film passiert die Exposition, wenn ein Charakter einem anderen einen Kern-Dump von Informationen erzählt, à la \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\". In der Fiktion erzählt der Autor.\n\nEin Beispiel ist angebracht. Während Sie eine Geschichte lesen, wird Ihnen gesagt, dass die Heldin ihren Geliebten an einem bestimmten Ort und zu einer bestimmten Zeit traf, dass sie in großem Stil heirateten und dass ihr Ehemann vor ihren Augen ermordet wurde. Sie würden nicht erwarten, dass diese gesamte Sequenz zwei Seiten einnimmt, während derer sowohl er als auch sie nur zwei Zeilen Dialog erhalten. Sie würden erwarten, dass der Autor etwas Zeit mit dem Charakter des Ehemanns verbringt und durch seine Rede und sein Verhalten beweist, wie tief er seine Frau liebt, und Sie würden gleichermaßen erwarten, dass die Heldin in großen und kleinen Wegen zeigt, wie sehr seine Anwesenheit ihr Leben verändert und bereichert hat (besonders wenn die Geschichte Ihnen später direkt sagt, dass dies der Fall war). Eine ordentliche Einführung in den Charakter des Ehemanns würde es Ihnen ermöglichen, emotional in sein Schicksal involviert zu sein und Ihnen Einblick in den Charakter der Heldin zu geben: was sie in ihm sah, wie tief ihre Bindung war, Hinweise auf ihre Gedanken, Überzeugungen und Träume, die durch das Prisma seiner Augen reflektiert werden, und so weiter. Sie würden mit ihr um seinen Tod trauern und sich so mehr mit der Heldin selbst verbunden fühlen.\n\nKurz gesagt, Sie würden Fleisch an den einfachen Knochen der Handlung erwarten: \"Sie trafen sich, sie heirateten, er starb.\"\n\nAls Schriftsteller müssen Sie dieses Fleisch liefern. (*schaut das Gleichnis an, seufzt, stürzt sich voran*) Manchmal ist es verlockend, an bestimmten Dingen vorbeizueilen. Vielleicht stellen Sie eine neue Figur vor und Sie wissen, dass er früher bei der Luftwaffe war, jetzt der Nachtmanager einer Tankstelle ist, zweimal verheiratet war, keine Kinder hat, gerne am Wochenende angeln geht, heimlich davon träumt, die Tankstelle eines Tages zu besitzen und Eggs Benedict zum Frühstück hatte.\n\n**English Translation:**\n\nAh, exposition.

He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and was critically injured; there were no arrests or suspects at the time. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed short, and I believe that might have been because he was a \"black\" man or it was a black neighborhood. I have noticed (for years) that minorities are often overlooked when they are victims of a crime. If, for example, a \"white\" child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime, the media goes into a frenzy, but if it’s a minority, it’s lucky if it’s even mentioned.\n\nThe next story was about a gunshot hole found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident occurred. It was determined that a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips leading to the arrest of the shooter.\n\nThe following story concerned the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The segment was a bit short, but they wanted to use it as a \"teaser\" to keep viewers tuned in.\n\nThey also ran a story about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was a dark-skinned black man who robbed the store, wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They described him as about six feet tall and weighing around one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they spent an unusual amount of time emphasizing that he was black and how dark-skinned he was.\n\nAnother story was about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute large amounts of marijuana to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted was that instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison, they said \"300\" months. I am not sure what the angle was, whether they thought it sounded harsher or what. They also mentioned he was Hispanic; I don’t believe that was really relevant to the story.[/REWRITE]",

Ein ETF bietet Ihnen die Diversifikation eines Indexfonds und die Vorteile des Besitzes einzelner Aktien, wie die Möglichkeit, leerzuverkaufen, auf Marge zu kaufen und so wenige wie eine Aktie in jeder Transaktion zu erwerben. Obwohl diese Vorteile äußerst attraktiv sind, sind die Kostenquoten von ETFs deutlich niedriger als die eines durchschnittlichen Investmentfonds. Leider gibt es auch einige Nachteile, wie die Notwendigkeit, bei jedem Handel mit ETFs eine Kommission zu zahlen, wie Sie es auch bei einem Aktienauftrag tun würden. Ein weiterer Vorteil von ETFs ist die große Auswahl an verfügbaren Fonds. Obwohl diese Vorteile klar angegeben sind, ist es immer eine gute Übung für den klugen Finanzinvestor zu prüfen, ob die angegebenen Vorteile, wie Diversifikation, tatsächlich existieren und in welchem Maße sie vorhanden sind. Im Rahmen dieses Unterfangens werden wir den ETF IHF untersuchen und ihn mit den zehn größten Positionen vergleichen, die den ETF ausmachen, um festzustellen, ob die Vorteile des Besitzes eines einzelnen ETFs den Vorteilen eines diversifizierten Portfolios der zehn Aktien nahekommen und auch, ob es bessere Konfigurationen derselben Aktien gibt, die ein optimaleres Sharpe-Verhältnis oder eine bessere Rendite bieten würden.\n\nUm den ETF zu bewerten, wäre es recht unhandlich, jede Position einzubeziehen. Daher haben wir beschlossen, nur die zehn größten Positionen einzubeziehen, die 63,58% aller Vermögenswerte im ETF ausmachen. Unten sind die zehn größten Positionen und der Prozentsatz der Gesamtvermögenswerte aufgeführt.\n\nUm eine Schätzung darüber zu erhalten, wie gut diese zehn Aktien den ETF IHF als Ganzes repräsentieren, können wir den aktuellen Prozentsatz der Vermögenswerte, normalisiert auf 100%, verwenden, um die Beiträge jeder Aktie zu Beta und Rendite eines Portfolios zu berechnen, wenn das Portfolio vollständig aus diesen zehn Aktien in dem Verhältnis bestehen würde, das der ETF durch seine Bestände festgelegt hat. Die Berechnungen von Beta und Rendite sind in der untenstehenden Tabelle enthalten.\n\nAus der obigen Tabelle geht hervor, dass die Rendite eines Portfolios, das nur die zehn größten Positionen enthält, um 6,11% höher ist als die des ETF, was einem Anstieg der Renditen um 16% entspricht. Es ist auch ersichtlich, dass das Beta der zehn größten Positionen um 0,12 niedriger ist als das des gesamten ETF. Aus den bisher abgeschlossenen Ergebnissen scheint ein Portfolio, das nur aus den zehn größten Positionen besteht, eine höhere Rendite bei einem niedrigeren Beta bieten zu können. Es besteht jedoch die Möglichkeit, dass die Mittel dieser beiden Portfolios statistisch nicht voneinander abweichen.\n\nUm zu bewerten, ob diese Portfolios statistisch unterschiedlich sind oder nicht, wird die Standardabweichung jeder der zehn größten Aktien bestimmt und auf 100% normalisiert, um ihre kumulierte Standardabweichung mit der des ETF IHF zu vergleichen.\n\n[REWRITE]An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a security designed to track an index, a commodity, or a basket of assets like an index fund, but it is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.

That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars.

We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores.

Das war etwas enttäuschend und es ist schwer zu sagen, warum das passiert sein könnte. Mit dem Einbruch des Winters an einem Campus in Neuengland gibt es eindeutig einen Rückgang der Menschen, die entweder mit dem Fahrrad oder zu Fuß pendeln, was einen Teil des Rückgangs erklären könnte. Der Dezember markiert auch das Ende des Herbstsemesters, wenn alle sehr damit beschäftigt sind, Schulaufgaben zu beenden, Noten zu bearbeiten und so weiter. Für viele Menschen könnte das Ausfüllen des Pendlerprotokolls einfach von der Bildfläche verschwunden sein. Außerdem bringt der Dezember den Beginn der hektischen Feiertagssaison und die daraus resultierende einmonatige Pause für Studenten und Dozenten, während der viele überhaupt nicht auf den Campus kommen müssen. Der Unterricht wird dann Ende Januar für das Frühlingssemester wieder aufgenommen, was vielleicht auch ein Hinweis auf die geringe Anzahl von Protokollen für diesen Monat ist. Aber nichts davon erklärt wirklich die geringe Anzahl an Einreichungen für Februar. Man könnte auch vermuten, dass jedes Projekt dieser Art zu Beginn einen anfänglichen Energieschub und Enthusiasmus hat, der dann natürlich nachlassen könnte. Um diesem Trend entgegenzuwirken, haben wir die Carpool Challenge Week ins Leben gerufen, eine spezielle Blitzkampagne im März, um die Initiative wiederzubeleben, was zu einem Anstieg der Protokolleinreichungen für diesen Monat führte. Eine der Herausforderungen, die wir erlebten, war also, wie man das Projekt am Laufen hält angesichts eines natürlichen Rückgangs des Engagements, aber auch speziell des Problems von Feiertags- und Semesterpausen, die im Hochschulbereich auftreten. Eine weitere Herausforderung für dieses Projekt (oder jedes alternative Pendlerprojekt) ist die einfache Tatsache, dass Menschen die Freiheit, Unabhängigkeit und Flexibilität genießen, ihre Autos zu fahren. Dies ist tief in unserer Kultur verwurzelt. Daher ist es wichtig, Anreize für die Nutzung alternativer Pendelmethoden zu schaffen. Wir gaben viele Preise in Form von Geschenkgutscheinen für lokale Restaurants, Cafés, Massagetherapeuten, den lokalen unabhängigen Buchladen und sogar einige größere nationale Kettenläden aus. Es wäre jedoch interessant gewesen zu sehen, wie sich einige noch größere Preise auf die Teilnahme ausgewirkt hätten – etwa durch das Verschenken eines schönen Fahrrads, Hybridautos oder Elektroautos. Dies hätte auch dazu beitragen können, das Engagement zu steigern, das das Projekt erlebte. Die Art der Preise änderte sich im Verlauf des Projekts nicht wirklich. Wenn die Preise jedoch im Laufe des Projekts an Wert zugenommen hätten, hätte das vielleicht geholfen.

    "original": "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",

    "raw_output": "Ich habe beschlossen, alle der fünfzehn Trickfilme, die von 1895 bis 1901 produziert wurden, in der Bibliothek der frühen Edison-Filme der Library of Congress anzusehen. Diese Filme nutzen im Allgemeinen kreatives Schneiden, um Illusionen zu erzeugen. Meine Filmanalyse konzentrierte sich darauf, die Poetik der meisten Trickfilme zu beschreiben und die evolutionären Besonderheiten in einigen der späteren Filme zu untersuchen. Hauptsächlich ist der Trickfilm um die Jahrhundertwende an ein festes Set gebunden, vor einem frontalen Proszenium komponiert, zeigt keine Kamerabewegung, verwendet lange und mittlere Aufnahmen und hält sich an die strikte Methode, dass ein Shot gleich einem Film ist. Dennoch gibt es einige Filme aus dem frühen zwanzigsten Jahrhundert, die es wagen, diese Richtlinien zu brechen, indem sie Elemente wie mehrere Aufnahmen einführen.\n\nEines der auffälligsten Merkmale, die die Trickfilme gemeinsam haben, ist, dass sie in einem Innenraum vor einem frontalen Proszenium gedreht wurden. Die Kamera bewegt sich nicht von ihrer Position im Proszenium, um Figuren oder Objekte zu verfolgen. Diese Komposition war in frühen Filmen sehr verbreitet und hat ihre Wurzeln im Theater und, bei Trickfilmen, im Vaudeville und in Zaubershows. Eine der Einschränkungen der Bühnennutzung ist, dass Figuren in Trickfilmen generell nur seitlich bewegt werden und nicht auf die Kamera zu oder von ihr weggehen. Nehmen wir zum Beispiel die Handlung im Film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). Die Schauspieler treten von der rechten Seite ein und bewegen sich entlang der horizontalen Achse hin und her. Selbst wenn sie aus dem Bild gehen, folgt die Kamera ihnen nicht.\n\nDer frontale Proszeniumstil der Komposition bedeutet auch, dass die Aufnahmen eher lange Aufnahmen und, seltener, mittlere Aufnahmen sind. Nahaufnahmen werden in keinem der Trickfilme aus dem Edison-Katalog verwendet. Dies ist eine Anlehnung an die Theater- und Vaudeville-Tradition, bei der das Publikum die gesamte Aufführung gleichzeitig sieht, eingerahmt durch die Ränder der Bühne. Wie in den meisten frühen Filmen bewegen sich die Schauspieler nicht aus dem Mittelgrund zur Kamera hin, sodass Nahaufnahmen nie vorkommen.\n\nIm Allgemeinen folgen die meisten frühen Trickfilme dem Muster, dass ein konzeptioneller Shot einem Film entspricht. Dies begrenzt die Länge der meisten Trickfilme auf etwa eine Minute oder weniger, je nach verwendeter Bildrate. Es begrenzt auch die dramatische oder erzählerische Nutzung der Trickfilme; die meisten konzentrieren sich auf kurze, vaudevilleartige Tricks, wie Magie, Verschwinden und Wechselakte mit wenig Geschichte. Beachten Sie jedoch, dass in einem Trickfilm ein konzeptioneller Shot in den Augen des Betrachters nicht tatsächlich einem physischen Shot entspricht. Ein einzelner „Shot“ kann tatsächlich mehrere zusammengefügte Shots sein, um die Illusion des Erscheinens oder Verschwindens zu erzeugen. Sehen Sie sich genau The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895) an, einen der früheren Trickfilme. Eine genauere Untersuchung zeigt den Moment, in dem der physische Shot mit Marys abgetrenntem „Kopf“ beginnt, obwohl der gesamte Film im Konzept nur ein Shot für den Betrachter ist.\n\n[REWRITE]I decided to watch all fifteen trick films produced between 1895 and 1901 in the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films.

    "transformed": "I decided to watch all fifteen trick films produced between 1895 and 1901 in the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films. These films typically use creative editing to create illusions. My film analysis focused on describing the poetics of most trick films and examining the unique evolutionary features found in a few of the later films. Primarily, the trick films at the turn of the century are bound to a set, composed in front of a frontal proscenium, show no camera movement, use long and medium shots, and adhere to the strict method of one shot equaling one film. However, some films from the early twentieth century dare to break these guidelines by introducing elements like multiple shots.\n\nOne of the most striking features shared by the trick films is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films and has roots in theater and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One limitation of using the stage is that figures in trick films generally move only side-to-side and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even when they go out of frame, the camera does not follow them.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that the shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-ups are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This is borrowed from the theater and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the edges of the stage.

The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",

Der Begriff Lieferkettenmanagement wurde 1982 von Keith Oliver, einem Berater, erfunden. Keith Oliver beschrieb den gesamten Prozess der Planung, Implementierung und Kontrolle dessen, was in der Lieferkette geschieht, um die Bedürfnisse der Kunden schnell und effizient zu erfüllen. Es gibt sechs Schlüsselelemente einer Lieferkette: Produktion, Versorgung, Inventar, Standort, Transport und Information. Geschäftsleiter nutzen diese sechs Schlüsselelemente, um den bestmöglichen Kundenservice zu bieten.\n\nProduktion ist der erste Schritt im Lieferkettenprozess. Produktion ist die Grundlage für den gesamten Lieferkettenprozess. Die Produktionsphase legt fest, wann, warum, wo und wie alles produziert wird. Manager müssen wissen, was die Kunden wollen. Damit Manager wissen, was die Kunden wollen, können sie den Markt betrachten. Der Markt ist der größte Indikator, um zu entscheiden, welche Kundenanforderungen bestehen. Sobald Manager den Markt analysiert und die Nachfrage der Kunden verstanden haben, sind sie bereit zu entscheiden, welche Produkte produziert werden sollen und wie viele dieser Produkte produziert werden sollen. Nachdem das Management entschieden hat, was produziert wird und wie viel, sind sie bereit zu entscheiden, wo die Produkte produziert werden sollen und welches Werk am besten für Volumen und Qualität der Güter geeignet ist, wobei der Kundennachfrage und der Kundenzufriedenheit Rechnung getragen werden muss. Nachdem der Standort für die Produktion der Produkte festgelegt wurde, konzentrieren sich die Manager im nächsten Schritt auf die Planung der Arbeitsbelastungen und die Wartung der Ausrüstung. Produktion ist ein sehr wichtiger Schritt im Lieferkettenprozess. Jedes Detail ist während des gesamten Prozesses entscheidend. Wenn jedes Detail nicht entsprechend geplant wird, kann es das Unternehmen auf lange Sicht viel Zeit und Geld kosten. Zum Beispiel habe ich in den Einzelhandelsgeschäften von Wal-Mart und Target gearbeitet. Beide Unternehmen haben ein Design, ein Handbuch und einen Prozess für jede Einheit des Geschäfts. Es gibt ein gestaltetes Layout, wie die Uniform eines Mitarbeiters aussehen sollte, um den Versand von Lastwagen zu empfangen. Vorgeschriebene Prozesse ermöglichen es einem Unternehmen, reibungslos zu arbeiten, ohne Verwirrung über Richtung und Erwartungen.\n\nDas zweite Schlüsselelement im Lieferkettenmanagement ist die Versorgung. Versorgung wird als die strategischen Entscheidungen definiert, die getroffen werden sollten, um die Kernfähigkeiten einer Einrichtung zu bestimmen, und Outsourcing-Partnerschaften sollten aus diesen Entscheidungen hervorgehen. Ein Unternehmen kann viele verschiedene Produktionsabteilungen für ein einzelnes Produkt haben. Alle Abteilungen bestehen aus unterschiedlicher Ausrüstung, Arbeitern und Spezialitäten. Der Manager muss entscheiden, welche Abteilung am besten für die verschiedenen Prozesse des Produkts geeignet ist. Das Management kann auch entscheiden, die Arbeit an andere Unternehmen auszulagern. Der Hauptgrund, warum ein Manager die Arbeit an Unternehmen auslagern würde, ist, Geschwindigkeit zu schaffen. Geschwindigkeit ist die Fähigkeit, Qualität und Flexibilität zu bieten und gleichzeitig Kosten zu senken oder niedrige Kostenniveaus beizubehalten.\n\n**Back to English:**\n\nSupply chain management is the flow of processes that moves goods from the customer order through the raw material stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer.

Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react.

    "raw_output": "Victorianische Romane zeichnen sich durch ihre überwältigende Detailgenauigkeit und ihren Fokus auf den Adel der Zeit aus. Zwei Romane, die als viktorianisch gelten, aber von dieser Tradition abweichen, sind Oliver Twist und Wuthering Heights. Beide Romane verwenden ein Element des Geheimnisses und eine Vorliebe für das Bizarre, was für die Romane der Zeit untypisch ist, und die Charaktere in jedem Werk stärkt; sie bieten Einblicke, die ihre Motive und Emotionen näher erläutern.\n\n„Und nun drängten sich Scharen von verwirrenden und verwirrenden Ideen in seinen Geist. Er schien immer noch zwischen Sikes und Crackit zu gehen, die sich wütend stritten: denn die Worte, die sie sagten, klangen in seinen Ohren; und als er seine eigene Aufmerksamkeit erregte, … stellte er fest, dass er mit ihnen sprach…. Plötzlich fuhr er erschrocken zurück bei dem Bericht von Schusswaffen; und es erhoben sich laute Schreie und Rufe in die Luft; Lichter blitzten vor seinen Augen auf und alles war Lärm und Tumult, als ihn eine unsichtbare Hand hastig wegtrug. Durch all diese schnellen Visionen zog sich ein undefiniertes, unruhiges Bewusstsein von Schmerz, das ihn unaufhörlich zermürbte und quälte.“ (Dickens, 220)\n\nDie beiden Romane nutzen dieses Geheimnis oft durch Traumsequenzen oder traumähnliche Zustände, obwohl der Inhalt und die Funktion in jedem spezifischen Fall variieren. In Oliver Twist enthüllen diese seltsamen Ereignisse oft Einblicke in Olivers innere Schichten, was ihn schmerzt und sein Bewusstsein über die wahre Natur der Dinge, die um ihn herum geschehen. Als das Schießen auf Oliver schließlich in Kapitel 28 erneut besucht wird, erlebt Oliver das Schießen lebhaft, als ob in einem Traum, während er um Hilfe kämpft. Die Passage betont den Mangel an Kontrolle, den Oliver über die sich entfaltenden Ereignisse hatte, ebenso wie die ernste Lage, in der sich seine Gesundheit befand, was stark durch Olivers Halluzinationen von Sikes und Crackit gegenwärtig war. Das Schießen selbst überwältigt ihn, alle seine Sinne sind betäubt, da er die „unsichtbare Hand“ nicht bemerkt, die ihn wegträgt; er erlebt seine Verzweiflung erneut, entfernt vom Schock des Schmerzes, da der Schmerz jetzt konstant ist und mit Angst statt Überraschung verbunden ist. Mit Olivers Überwältigung stellt sich die Frage, wessen Wille sein Unglück herbeiführte, da es sicherlich nicht sein eigener war. Dieses Schießen verstärkt die Vorstellung, dass Oliver wenig Kontrolle über irgendetwas hat, da er sich nicht einmal dazu bringen kann, zu versuchen, die Kontrolle über den Ausgang eines Ereignisses zu gewinnen, selbst wenn sein Leben in Gefahr ist. Ein wachsendes Gefühl der Niederlage in Oliver wird auch durch diese Auswahl impliziert, als ob der alte Fagin begonnen hätte, ihn zu brechen, ihn in die Akzeptanz dieser Verzweiflung zu zwingen und seine Fähigkeit zu beeinflussen, zu reagieren. Denn ansonsten kann angenommen werden, dass Oliver zumindest aus eigenem Interesse einige Anstrengungen unternommen hätte.\n\n„Der Tag verging – Tag! Es gab keinen Tag; er war verschwunden, sobald er gekommen war – und die Nacht brach wieder herein; Nacht so lang und doch so kurz; lang in ihrem schrecklichen Schweigen und kurz in ihren flüchtigen Stunden.“\n\n[REWRITE]  \nVictorian novels are known for their rich detail and focus on the aristocracy of the era.

    "transformed": "Victorian novels are known for their rich detail and focus on the aristocracy of the era. However, two novels that are considered Victorian but diverge from this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. Both employ elements of mystery and a flair for the bizarre, which is atypical for novels of that period, thereby strengthening the characters in each work, offering insights that elaborate on their motives and emotions.\n\n\"And now, a host of bewildering and confusing ideas crowded his mind. He seemed to still be walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily arguing, as their very words echoed in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, he realized he was speaking to them... Suddenly, he recoiled at the sound of gunfire; loud cries and shouts rose into the air; lights flashed before his eyes, and everything was noise and tumult, as an unseen hand hurriedly carried him away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy awareness of pain, which wearied and tormented him incessantly.\" (Dickens, 220)\n\nThe two novels often utilize mystery through dream sequences or dreamlike states, although the content and function vary in each specific case. In Oliver Twist, these strange events often reveal insights into Oliver's inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is revisited in chapter 28, he vividly relives the event as if in a dream while struggling to find help. The passage emphasizes the lack of control Oliver had over the unfolding events, as well as the dire condition of his health, which was strongly present through his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the \"unseen hand\" that bears him away; he experiences his despair anew, detached from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed, the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything, as he cannot bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even when his life is in danger.

Ich tat mein Bestes, um ihnen in jedem Fach zu helfen, in dem sie Schwierigkeiten hatten, aber meine Stärken lagen in Englisch und Lesen. Einer der Lehrer bat mich, einem kleinen Jungen namens Adrian zu helfen (ich glaube, er war in der dritten oder vierten Klasse), der große Probleme beim Lesen hatte. Es fiel mir auf, dass etwas nicht stimmte; er hatte die seltsamsten Probleme. Einige Buchstaben konnte er perfekt aussprechen, andere gar nicht, es war das merkwürdigste. Wissen Sie, er war lateinamerikanischer Herkunft, dessen war ich mir sicher, aber der Junge sprach perfektes Englisch. Wir kämpften weiter, bis zu dem Tag, an dem ich seine Mutter traf. Ich half beim Babysitten (mangels eines besseren Begriffs) ein paar Nachzügler, während der Rest der Nachmittagsgruppe auf einem Ausflug war, als seine Mutter hereinkam. Seine Mutter sprach kein Wort Englisch, nur Spanisch. Mit meinem sehr schlechten Spanisch (ich lernte gerade erst), schafften wir es zu kommunizieren. Aber dann wurde mir klar wie ein Schlag mit einem Sack Ziegelsteine: Adrian konnte gut lesen, er kannte nur das englische Alphabet nicht sehr gut. Ich weiß nicht, ob diese Erkenntnis ihm je sehr geholfen hat, aber ich hoffe, dass es ihm jetzt besser geht.\n\nIch erzähle diese Geschichte, um das Problem der Sprachbarriere in den Schulen, insbesondere hier in Kalifornien, anzusprechen. Ich erzähle sie auch, um zu beweisen, dass es nicht immer so offensichtlich ist, wie wir denken. Selbst für ein Kind, das perfekt Englisch spricht, kann das Lesen immer noch ein großes Hindernis sein. Ich denke, jeder kann zustimmen, dass dieses Problem existiert, also was tun wir? In Adrians Fall war die Lösung ziemlich einfach: Englisch-Lesetutorien, insbesondere das Alphabet und die Aussprache. Aber für die vielen Kinder, die kaum Englisch sprechen, ist die Lösung viel komplexer. Es gibt keine einzige Antwort. Das zweisprachige System, reguläre Integration, private Nachhilfelehrer, ESL-Klassen, keine dieser Dinge allein wird dieses Problem lösen. Der Schlüssel liegt darin, all dies zu kombinieren!\n\nZuerst einmal ist das zweisprachige System eine großartige Idee. Nicht nur für Kinder, deren Muttersprache Spanisch ist, sondern für alle Kinder. „Kinder in zweisprachigen Bildungsprogrammen übertreffen ihre Mitschüler akademisch.“ Es gibt viele Ängste um diese Idee, dass es eine Verschwendung von Ressourcen ist und dass die Mehrheit der Kinder in den Schulen keinen Nutzen davon hat. Aber das ist falsch. Wenn wir solche Programme als Regel und nicht als Ausnahme im Klassenzimmer anwenden würden, würden alle Kinder davon profitieren. Wie gehen wir das an? Müssen wir alle Lehrer dazu verpflichten, zweisprachig zu sein? Nein. Das wäre unvernünftig und etwas unrealistisch. Ich denke jedoch, dass es keinen Grund gibt, warum wir nicht spezielle Hilfskräfte, Tutoren oder wie auch immer Sie sie nennen möchten, haben können, die zweisprachig sind.\n\nEnglish Translation:\n[REWRITE]\nA few years back, I worked in an after-school program tutoring elementary-aged students.

Wir saßen auf der Veranda unseres Hauses, hörten den Regen auf das Blechdach über uns prasseln, während wir zusammen unsere Zigaretten rauchten. Die Dachrinnen leiteten den Regen hinunter und ertränkten die Pflanzen am Rand der Veranda. Er schaute in den Regen hinaus, eine Art Blick, der halb suchend, halb erinnernd schien. In den letzten Monaten war er dünner geworden, und seine Kleidung hing leblos von seinem Körper herab. Sein Haar war schütterer geworden, spärlicher als ich es in Erinnerung hatte. Er starrte weiterhin in den Regen, vermied den Augenkontakt. Ich fühlte mich allein, ängstlich und unfähig, mit meinem Vater darüber zu sprechen, wie sehr ich ihn vermissen würde, weil das Reden darüber es für uns beide nur realer machen würde.

Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",

    "raw_output": "Sure, here is the translation and re-translation of the text:\n\nGerman translation:\nJohn Taylor von Caroline war ein früher und leidenschaftlicher Befürworter des Republikanismus. Obwohl er hauptsächlich Landwirt war, schuf dieser Beruf zusammen mit seiner kurzen politischen Karriere einen Mann, der für seine Hingabe und Offenheit in Fragen der persönlichen Freiheit und der Regierung bekannt war. Seine Hingabe an ein agrarisches System bildete die Grundlage für fast alle seine Meinungen über die Regierung. Es war sein Versuch, das, was er für den überlegensten aller Berufe hielt, zu bewahren und zu fördern, der seine Argumente über Souveränität, Verfassungsmäßigkeit und sogar das Justizsystem prägte.\n\nJohn Taylor glaubte, dass die Vereinigten Staaten eine großartige Gelegenheit hatten, ein ideales System zu schaffen, weil es keine einheimische Tradition gab, die die Schöpfer der Regierung behinderte, was die Errichtung eines Systems der Selbstregierung ermöglichte. Er glaubte fest an die natürlichen Rechte des Menschen und daran, dass sie alle voneinander abhängen – das bedeutet, dass, wenn eines verweigert wird, alle scheitern und der Wert der verbleibenden verringert wird. Diese Rechte sollten daher außerhalb der Reichweite der Regierung liegen. Er behauptete, dass das, was manche als den „Naturzustand“ bezeichneten, bedeutete, dass diejenigen mit körperlicher Stärke und bösartiger Intelligenz die waren, die profitierten, aber dass dies in einer Zivilisation nicht der Fall sein dürfe.\n\nUm diese ideale Gesellschaft zu schaffen, glaubte Taylor, dass eine Regierung geschaffen werden muss, die das inhärente Gute und Böse im Menschen berücksichtigt. Taylor war sehr streng in seinen Ansichten über eine dualistische Moral. Er behauptete, dass „da die Regierung von Menschen ausgeübt wird, alle ihre Tugenden und Laster menschlich sein müssen“ (ebd., S. 167). Er definierte gute Prinzipien als solche, die Privateigentum schützen, die Landwirtschaft verbessern und den Kapitalismus entmutigen, und glaubte, dass eine Regierung, die auf guten Prinzipien gegründet ist, gerecht funktionieren würde, unabhängig von ihrer Verwaltung, die unweigerlich von Habgier und Eigeninteresse geleitet würde. Eigeninteresse, so glaubte er, sei die Motivation des Menschen in allen Dingen, aber dass das Merkmal nur dann als böse angesehen werde, wenn es über die Schaffung einer auf das öffentliche Wohl basierenden Gesellschaft hinaus zu Untergesellschaften führe, die auf Kosten anderer lebten. Eine gute Regierung war notwendig, um das natürliche Böse des Menschen zurückzuhalten, und selbst dann müsse sie unter sorgfältiger Beobachtung stehen, um die Hinzufügung schlechter Prinzipien zu vermeiden.\n\nTaylor, wie viele andere überzeugte Republikaner seiner Zeit, forderte eine strikte Auslegung der Verfassung. Er wollte eine extrem begrenzte Bundesregierung, der nicht mehr Rechte oder Befugnisse eingeräumt werden sollten, als ausdrücklich in der Verfassung festgelegt waren. Er wusste, dass eine umfangreiche Bundesregierung teuer war und daher wahrscheinlich despotisch. Er glaubte jedoch, dass eine einfache, wörtliche Auslegung gefährlich sei und dass eine solche Methode ohne Bezug auf die Absicht der Verfasser leicht korrupt werden könne. Noch mehr betrachtete er die Unabhängigkeitserklärung als die wahre Charta der Vereinigten Staaten, weil sie das Land expliziter als eine Gruppe souveräner Staaten und nicht als eine Nation beschreibt.\n\nEnglish re-translation:\nJohn Taylor of Caroline was an early and passionate advocate of Republicanism.

He claimed that what some called the \"state of nature\" meant that those with physical strength and malevolent intelligence were the ones who profited, but that this should not be the case in a civilization.\n\nTo create this ideal society, Taylor believed that a government must be created that accounted for the inherent good and evil in humans. Taylor was very strict in his views on dualistic morality. He claimed that \"as government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (ibid., p. 167). He defined good principles as those that protect private property, improve agriculture, and discourage capitalism, and believed that a government founded on good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be led by greed and self-interest. He believed self-interest was man's motivation in all things, but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others. A good government was necessary to restrain man's natural evil, and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n\nTaylor, like many other staunch Republicans of his time, called for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He wanted an extremely limited Federal government, with no more rights or powers granted to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution. He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive and therefore likely to be despotic. However, he believed that a simple, literal interpretation was dangerous and that without reference to the intent of the writers, such a method could easily become corrupt. Even more, he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.\n\n[REWRITE] John Taylor of Caroline was an early and passionate supporter of Republicanism. Though primarily a farmer, his career, along with a brief stint in politics, made him known for his dedication and candidness on issues of personal freedom and governance. His commitment to an agrarian system was foundational to almost all his governmental views. His efforts to preserve and promote what he deemed the superior profession colored his arguments on sovereignty, constitutionality, and even the judicial system.\n\nTaylor believed the United States had a unique chance to create an ideal system, free from native tradition that could hinder government creators, thus enabling self-government. He was firm in his belief in the natural rights of man, viewing them as interconnected—if one right is denied, all fail, diminishing the value of those that remain. These rights should thus be out of governmental reach.

A good government was essential to restrain man's natural evil, requiring careful oversight to prevent adding bad principles.\n\nTaylor, like many staunch Republicans of his era, advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He desired a highly limited Federal government, with no more rights or powers than explicitly stated in the Constitution. He recognized that a large Federal government was costly and likely despotic.

Unemotional, still, mit einer geübten Aufmerksamkeit, die studierte, aber sich weigerte, das Studienobjekt mit einem abstrakten Verständnis zu verbinden, analysierte mein Geist das Bild vor meinen Augen. Gedanken kamen in meinen Kopf und verschwanden wieder fast schneller, als sie erschienen. So reibungslos und sauber arbeitete mein Bewusstsein, dass es schien, als hätte ich keine eigenen Gedanken, nur eine aktive und flüssige Erfahrung dessen, was ich betrachtete. \nEinmal, auf Anraten eines Künstlers, mit dem ich arbeitete, kaufte ich ein Kunstlehrbuch namens \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\". Ich wollte schon seit ich sechs Jahre alt war zeichnen lernen und dieses Buch lehrt alles, von der Bedeutung eines Bleistifts bis zu den Prozessen, die das Gehirn verwendet, um Linien zu interpretieren. Eine Technik, die das Buch lehrt, ist, einen quadratischen Rahmen um jedes Bild zu platzieren, das der Künstler studieren möchte. So wird ein überwältigend detailliertes Bild, zum Beispiel eine Schale mit Obst auf einem Tisch in einer Küche, die mit einem Esszimmer verbunden ist, in ein leicht erfassbares Bild verwandelt, diese Schale mit Obst auf einer einfachen Ebene. \nIn diesem Moment, als ich auf die Schale vor mir starrte, konnte ich den Rahmen des Künstlers mental nicht projizieren. Ich war so überwältigt, so erstaunt, dass ich nur stehen und in Ehrfurcht blicken konnte. Picasso durchlief seine blaue Phase, Monet liebte das Grün, italienische Renaissance-Meister zeigten ein Regenbogen aus Farben. Wenn ich irgendwelche Ansprüche hatte, meine Perspektive als künstlerisch wertvoll darzustellen, dann lagen vor mir die Anfänge meines Bildes, der Beginn meiner Geschichte, Arbeit in Braun. \nFingerkuppen berührten mein gewähltes Kunstwerkzeug, Muskeln spannten sich an und entspannten sich, während meine Hand durch den Raum ging, der Wille meines Geistes wurde in Form gebracht, was der kreativste Moment meines Lebens hätte sein können. Wasser wirbelte, ruhig und glatt, kristallklar und sauber. Materieflocken lösten sich vom Ganzen und wurden ins Nichts getragen. Muskeln spannten sich an, zuckten und krampften ein wenig schneller und ängstlicher beim zweiten Mal, meine Hand schlug wieder auf den Toilettengriff. Das anstößige braune Paket weigerte sich zu bewegen, klebte wie eine Schnecke am Boden der Toilette. \nDen Wischmopp locker in der Hand, die Füße einen Fuß auseinander, die grüne Krawatte unbequem um meinen Hals geknotet, runzelte ich leicht die Stirn, als ich das unhöfliche Bündel aus verarbeitetem Tier- und Pflanzenmaterial anstarrte, das jemand als Botschaft für die Deppen hinterlassen hatte, die bei Rite Aid die Toiletten reinigten.

Die National Institutes of Health erklären, dass ein Aspekt des Problems darin besteht, dass das Gehirn von Teenagern buchstäblich nicht bereit ist für die Gefahren des Fahrens. Auch die einfache Unerfahrenheit liegt im Kern des Problems. Diese Unerfahrenheit verursacht nicht nur mehr tödliche Unfälle, sondern auch eine höhere Rate von Fahrzeugüberschlägen, Geschwindigkeitsüberschreitungen und Abkommen von der Straße. Teens schneiden auch viel schlechter ab, wenn sie mit Gleichaltrigen reisen – was jeder mit einem Funken Verstand weiß, dass sie regelmäßig tun. Das Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center führte eine Studie durch, die folgende Korrelation zeigte: zwischen dem Alter des Passagiers und der Anzahl der Verkehrsunfälle, die auftreten. Kalifornien und andere Staaten haben versucht, die Sicherheit von jugendlichen Fahrern zu erhöhen, indem sie vorläufige Führerscheine verlangen, die die Stunden begrenzen, in denen Jugendliche fahren dürfen, und andere Minderjährige als Passagiere verbieten. Aber vorläufige Führerscheine sind meiner Meinung nach nur Notlösungen. Das eigentliche Problem ist, dass die jüngsten Fahrer als Gruppe nach allen statistischen Merkmalen einfach nicht in der Lage sind, die Risiken und Verantwortlichkeiten angemessen zu bewältigen. Psychologe Marvin Zuckerman glaubt, dass sogar 18 Jahre zu jung für einen regulären Führerschein ist. USA Today berichtet, dass Zuckerman Forschung betrieben hat, die darauf hindeutet, dass unter 19-20-Jährige oft das Bedürfnis haben, Risiken einzugehen, einfach um den Nervenkitzel zu erleben. Es wäre daher sinnvoll, das Fahren zumindest so lange zu verzögern, bis die Neigung, Nervenkitzel zu suchen, nachlässt. Solange wir weiterhin Führerscheine an junge Teenager ausgeben, werden wir nicht nur weiterhin tödliche Unfälle sehen, sondern die Zahl der Todesopfer dürfte in den nächsten Jahren erschreckende Ausmaße erreichen. Bis 2010 werden die Babys der Babyboomer berechtigt sein, zu fahren, und Millionen neuer jugendlicher Fahrer werden bereit sein, auf die Straße zu gehen. Gesetzgebung, die sich mit diesem Problem befasst, wäre vernünftig und einfach. Schulen könnten weiterhin Fahrausbildungskurse anbieten, um den Lernprozess für zukünftige Fahrer zu beginnen, aber niemand unter 18 Jahren dürfte ein Kraftfahrzeug bedienen. Eine vorläufige Genehmigung könnte weiterhin erteilt werden, bevor ein vollständiger Führerschein ausgestellt wird, und eine bestimmte Anzahl praktischer Fahrstunden wäre ebenfalls erforderlich. Die spezifische Anzahl der erforderlichen Stunden könnte auf der Anzahl der Stunden basieren, die bereits in den meisten Staaten erforderlich sind (in Kalifornien sind es zum Beispiel derzeit 6 Stunden Fahrunterricht und 50 Stunden Übung mit einem Erwachsenen). Da die tödlichen Statistiken für jugendliche Fahrer aus einem Querschnitt aller Staaten stammen, wäre eine einheitliche, nationale Gesetzgebung in dieser Angelegenheit ein vernünftiges – und meiner Meinung nach wirksames – Mittel, um Teenager im ganzen Land zu schützen.

    "original": "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",

Anschließend wird die Diagnose mit häufigen Merkmalen oder „Warnsignalen“ erklärt. Schließlich schließt das Papier mit Möglichkeiten ab, wie ein Lehrer in einem integrativen Klassenumfeld einem Schüler mit CAPD helfen kann.\n\nDie zentrale auditorische Verarbeitungsstörung (CAPD) oder auditive Verarbeitungsstörung (APD) „bezieht sich auf die Effizienz und Effektivität, mit der das zentrale Nervensystem (ZNS) auditive Informationen nutzt. Eng definiert bezieht sich (C)AP auf die wahrnehmungsverarbeitung auditorischer Informationen im ZNS und die neurobiologische Aktivität, die dieser Verarbeitung zugrunde liegt und zu elektrophysiologischen auditiven Potenzialen führt“ (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), was bedeutet, dass es sich um eine Störung handelt, bei der das zentrale Nervensystem (d.h. das Gehirn) die gehörten Dinge nicht richtig verarbeiten kann. Menschen mit CAPD können normal hören und gelten daher nicht als „hörgeschädigt“; vielmehr funktioniert der Bereich des Gehirns, der das Gehörte übersetzt, Worte trennt oder Gespräche von Hintergrundgeräuschen unterscheidet, nicht so, wie es normalerweise der Fall sein sollte.\n\nDie früheste Erwähnung der Störung, die zu CAPD wurde, stammt aus den Mitte der 1950er Jahre und wurde als „auditorische Unwahrnehmung“ bezeichnet (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), als Forscher Kinder mit Kommunikationsstörungen untersuchten. Das italienische Forscherteam von Bocca, Calearo und Cassinari begann 1954 mit der Entwicklung von Tests für diese Kinder; 1961 führte Kimura „dichotisches Testen ein und formulierte ein Modell, um die Physiologie des ZANS zu erklären, die der dichotischen Wahrnehmung zugrunde liegt“ (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Eine nationale Konferenz, die 1977 stattfand, stimulierte die Forschung an Kindern mit CAPD.\n\nCAPD manifestiert sich auf verschiedene Weise: Die betroffene Person kann möglicherweise nicht lokalisieren oder Geräusche im Raum hören; sie kann Schwierigkeiten haben, zwischen zwei oder mehr „akustischen Ereignissen“ (Geräuschvorkommen) zu unterscheiden; sie kann möglicherweise keine Klangmuster erkennen; sie kann möglicherweise Änderungen in der Sprache nicht unterscheiden (wie z.B. Sarkasmus anhand einer Stimmänderung erkennen); ein Geräusch kann durch ein nachfolgendes Geräusch blockiert werden; sie kann möglicherweise nicht die Fähigkeit haben, Klanghinweise zu synthetisieren (d.h. sie auf eine sinnvolle Weise zu interpretieren, auf die sie dann reagieren kann); und sie kann möglicherweise nicht die Reihenfolge bestimmen, in der auditive Informationen präsentiert werden (Ferre).\n\nUm CAPD zu diagnostizieren, muss der Patient mit einer „systematischen Beobachtung des Hörverhaltens und/oder der Leistung bei Tests der auditorischen Funktion“ untersucht werden, die von „Audiologen, SLPs, Psychologen und anderen mit einer Vielzahl von Maßnahmen, die auditiv-bezogene Fähigkeiten bewerten“ durchgeführt werden können (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Dies kann Fragebögen und Umfragen sowie die Beobachtung auditorischer Verhaltensweisen umfassen, einschließlich der Reaktion des Patienten auf bestimmte Reize. Derzeit gibt es kein einheitliches Werkzeug oder Test, das/die durchgehend mit hoher diagnostischer Erfolgsquote verwendet wird, und es gibt keine bekannte Ursache für die Störung. Viele der verwendeten Tests präsentieren dem Patienten mehrere gleichzeitige auditive Reize und fordern ihn dann auf, bestimmte Elemente wie eine Reihe von Wörtern oder Zahlen zu unterscheiden. Fortschrittlichere Tests beinhalten das Aufzeichnen akustischer Signale im Ohr und das Messen der Antworten auf die Signale.\n\n[REWRITE]This article addresses three aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, it provides a brief definition of the disorder. Then, the diagnosis is explained, along with common traits or \"red flags.\" Finally, the article concludes with ways a teacher in an inclusive classroom setting can support a student with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), refers to the efficiency with which the central nervous system (CNS) processes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiological activity supporting that processing, leading to electrophysiological auditory potentials (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This means it is a disorder where the central nervous system (i.e., the brain) cannot correctly process what is heard. People with CAPD can hear normally and are thus not considered \"hearing impaired\"; instead, the brain area responsible for translating what we hear, separating words, or distinguishing conversations from background noise does not function as it typically should.\n\nThe earliest mention of the disorder, which became known as CAPD, dates back to the mid-1950s, referred to as \"auditory imperception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), when researchers were studying children with communication disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura introduced \"dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference held in 1977 stimulated research on children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD manifests in various ways: the affected person may not be able to localize or hear sounds in space; may struggle to discriminate between two or more \"acoustic events\" (sound occurrences); may not recognize sound patterns; may not differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm from a change in voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may lack the ability to synthesize sound cues (that is, interpret them in a meaningful way to act upon); and may not determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, the patient must undergo \"systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function,\" which may be conducted by \"audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using various measures that evaluate auditory-related skills\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, as well as observing auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. Currently, no single tool or test is consistently used with a high diagnostic success rate, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests present the patient with multiple simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask them to differentiate certain elements, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring responses to these signals.[/REWRITE]",

Diese Kernwerte sind nicht nur für Sozialarbeiter wichtig; sie sind mir persönlich wichtig.\n\nIch wollte schon immer anderen helfen, war mir aber unsicher über den Karriereweg, den ich einschlagen wollte. Während meiner Jahre in der High School und im College sah ich viele Menschen, die ihre Probleme leugneten und einige, die weniger ideale Bewältigungsmechanismen verwendeten. Aufgrund der Situationen, die ich miterlebt habe, entschied ich mich, einen Bachelor-Abschluss in Psychologie zu verfolgen. Immer noch unsicher über einen Karriereweg, beschloss ich, eine Pause einzulegen, nachdem ich 2009 das Piedmont College abgeschlossen hatte. Eines Tages im Sommer besuchte ich eine Freundin, die mich einem sechzehnjährigen Jungen vorstellte, der nervös auf ihrem Sofa saß. Sie erklärte mir, warum er zu Besuch war: um seinen missbräuchlichen Eltern zu entkommen. Am nächsten Tag erfuhr ich, dass er die Polizei zu seinen Eltern gerufen hatte. Um zu sehen, ob ich irgendwie helfen könnte, fuhr ich zu seinem Elternhaus. Dort angekommen, erklärte ich der Polizei privat meine Bedenken und sagte ihnen, dass ich gerade meinen Abschluss in Psychologie am Piedmont College gemacht hatte. Die Polizei bat mich, mit den Eltern zu sprechen, da das Gesetz für den Teenager nichts tun konnte. Als ich die Eltern zu der Situation befragte, wirkten sie nervös und nutzten Ausreden, um das „manipulative“ Verhalten ihres Sohnes zu beschreiben, der externe Quellen einbezogen hatte, um „einfache“ Streitigkeiten zu lösen. Nach dieser besonderen Erfahrung begann ich ernsthaft, eine Karriere in der Sozialarbeit in Betracht zu ziehen, um Kindern bei „einfachen“ Streitigkeiten unter Familienmitgliedern zu helfen.\n\nEin weiterer Wert, der für das Feld der Sozialarbeit wichtig ist, ist soziale Gerechtigkeit. Als Gesellschaft behaupten wir, dass das Individuum wichtig ist, und wir trauern um diejenigen, die wir verloren haben. Das Konzept des „Individuums“, das die Gesellschaft hält, ist mehr ein Anhänger archaischer Traditionen als tatsächliche Einzigartigkeit. Wenn die Gesellschaft also um verlorene Individuen trauert, warum streben wir dann danach, „jedem anderen“ ähnlich zu sein? Ich bin ein Individuum und genieße es nicht, mich selbst zu begrenzen, um anderen ähnlich zu sein. Während meiner Jahre in der High School und im College protestierte ich, wann immer ich konnte, gegen soziale Ungerechtigkeit: färbte mein Haar in unnatürlichen Farben, trug Kleidung, die zu meiner Persönlichkeit passte, durchstach meine Ohren über das traditionelle Maß hinaus, erklärte meine Beteiligung an der GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), kämpfte gegen Rassismus und Diskriminierung, wann immer ich es sah, usw.

The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified.

    "original": "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",

Für viele, mich eingeschlossen, kann es ein Problem sein, sich auf dem Campus zurechtzufinden. In meinem ersten Jahr wurde ich in einem Wohnheim in den East Halls untergebracht, was praktisch die östlichste Grenze des Campus ist, den man abgesehen vom Stadion und dem Bryce Jordan Center erreichen kann. Der Weg von meinem Zuhause in Stuart Hall zu den Klassen in so weit entfernten Orten wie dem Willard-Gebäude, nahe dem Zentrum des Campus, konnte zu Fuß bis zu 25 Minuten dauern, besonders wenn das Wetter schlecht war, was in State College oft der Fall ist. Beim Gespräch mit einem nicht viel älteren Absolventen erfuhr ich, dass vor nicht allzu langer Zeit die East Halls Wohnheime durch große ungenutzte Landflächen vom Rest der Schule getrennt waren. Heute ist dieser leere Raum mit Sportfeldern gefüllt, großen neuen Gebäuden, einschließlich der neuen Creamery und des neuen Gesundheitsdienst-Gebäudes, und von Wohnungen umgeben. Da unser Campus weiter wächst, wird es immer schwieriger, von einem Ort zum anderen zu gelangen. Was ist die beste Lösung für das Mobilitätsproblem? Auf einem College-Campus ist es das Fahrrad. Aber das Fahrrad allein wird keine Probleme lösen. Studenten müssen sie benutzen, und der Campus muss so gebaut sein, dass er den Bedürfnissen der Radfahrer entspricht.\n\nIch sprach mit einem Freund von mir, der vor kurzem nach einer mehrjährigen Pause wieder mit dem Radfahren begonnen hat. Er erwähnte, dass er sich fragte, warum er jemals aufgehört hatte. „Fahrräder sind großartig“, sagte er, „ein paar Jahre lang war es nicht cool, Fahrrad zu fahren, aber es ist der einzige Weg, um sich fortzubewegen.“ Neben dem Vorteil für den Körper ist Radfahren der effizienteste Weg zu reisen. Eine Schüssel Haferflocken und ein wenig körperliche Anstrengung bringen dich 30 Meilen oder mehr weit. Wie viele Studenten wohne ich jetzt außerhalb des Campus; genauso weit vom Zentrum entfernt wie einige Wohnheime. Die klügste Entscheidung, die ich dieses Jahr getroffen habe, war, ein Fahrrad zu kaufen. Jeden Tag habe ich Unterricht im Thomas-Gebäude, was leicht ein 25-minütiger Spaziergang von meinem Zuhause ist. Mit dem Fahrrad kann ich diese Zeit auf 5 Minuten verkürzen, wenn ich schnell genug fahre. Das einzige Problem ist, dass Pollock Road der direkteste Weg zum Thomas-Gebäude von meinem Haus ist, und es ist nicht immer einfach, diese Straße zu befahren, egal ob mit oder ohne Fahrrad. Es gibt auch Argumente für das Gehen, aber persönlich bin ich zu beschäftigt, um zu Fuß zu gehen. Wenn ich kein Fahrrad hätte, wäre Gehen meine einzige verlässliche Option, um zur Klasse zu kommen. Jeden Tag zu Fuß nach Thomas zu gehen, würde täglich 30-40 Minuten mehr in Anspruch nehmen. Das sind über zweieinhalb Stunden jede Woche. Dazu kommt die ganze andere Zeit, die ich mit dem Gehen zu und von anderen Klassen, Terminen usw. verbringen müsste. Das ist mehr Zeit, als ich entbehren kann.\n\n[REWRITE]I have been a student at University Park for approximately two and a half years, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, navigating the campus can be an issue. During my freshman year, I lived in a dorm room in East Halls, which is practically the furthest eastern point of the campus, excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in far-off places like the Willard Building, near the campus center, could take up to 25 minutes on foot, especially when the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. In a conversation with an alum close to my age, I learned that not too long ago, the East Halls dorms were separated from the rest of the school by large areas of unused land. Today, that empty space is filled with sports fields, large new buildings, including the new Creamery and health services building, and surrounded by apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes increasingly difficult. What is the best solution to the mobility problem? On a college campus, it's the bicycle. But a bike alone won't solve any problems. Students need to use them, and the campus should be designed to meet the needs of cyclists.\n\nI was talking to a friend who recently resumed cycling after several years. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. \"Bikes are great,\" he said, \"for a few years it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" Besides being good for your health, cycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and some physical effort can take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off-campus; just as far from the center as some dorms. The smartest decision I made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have classes in the Thomas Building, which is easily a 25-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can reduce that time to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest path to the Thomas Building from my house, and it's not always easy to travel on, with or without a bike. Walking has its benefits too, but personally, I'm too busy to walk. If I didn't have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option to get to class. Walking to Thomas every day would add an extra 30-40 minutes to my day. That's over two and a half hours each week. Add to that all the other time I'd spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, etc. That's more time than I can spare.[/REWRITE]",

    "raw_output": "Aldous Huxley kritisiert in seinem Roman \"Brave New World\" die bevorstehende Bedrohung durch Technologie und die kapitalistische Struktur, die durch die Schaffung einer Dystopie verstärkt wird. Die Menschen schätzen die Gemeinschaft über das Individuum und werden von Anfang an darauf konditioniert, das unmittelbare Glück über alles andere zu stellen. Die Bürger werden als Spielfiguren in einem größeren Spiel entlarvt, die auf eine Ideologie beschränkt sind, wie sie vom Weltkontrolleur diktiert wird. Betrachtet man das Werk durch die Linse des marxistischen Theismus, erkennt man die zugrunde liegenden Verdächtigungen des Autors in Bezug auf die Entwicklung der genannten Systeme. Häufige Terminologien im Marxismus, wie Homogenität und Verdinglichung, unterstreichen die Idee, dass Huxleys Roman eine Kritik an den Fehlern der aufstrebenden Wirtschaft seiner Zeit ist. Der Kapitalismus wird durch die Verwendung der marxistischen These der falschen Bewusstseins satirisiert. Im Wesentlichen wird der einfachen Bevölkerung der wahre Zusammenhang zu anderen Klassen in wirtschaftlichen Begriffen vorenthalten, da sie in erster Linie an ihrem eigenen Gewinn interessiert sind. Es wird gesagt, dass dies das Ergebnis der ideologischen Kontrolle des Proletariats und der normalen Arbeiter ist, was durch die Konditionierung der Menschen in \"Brave New World\" ziemlich offensichtlich wird. Die gewöhnlichen Klassen, Delta, Gamma usw., haben keinen eigenen Willen; durch Hypnopädie wird der Drang zu konsumieren, zu kaufen und zu genießen über alles andere gestärkt. Dies wird, wie bereits erwähnt, vom Weltkontrolleur manipuliert. Hegemonie, also die Idee, dass Gruppen sozialer Klassen von einer separaten Gruppe von Individuen in ihrer Gesamtheit dominiert werden, wird in diesem Fall offensichtlich genutzt. Die unteren Klassen sind sich der Manipulation völlig unbewusst und „kaufen buchstäblich in eine Ideologie ein, die diese Struktur unterstützt“ (d.h. Kapitalismus und Konsumismus). Die oberen Klassen sind mit der Fähigkeit geboren, sich dessen bewusst zu sein, tun aber nichts; nur wenige Alphas oder Betas, abgesehen von Charakteren wie Bernard, tun mehr als einfach ihren Platz zu akzeptieren. Tatsächlich sind die Interaktionen der sozialen Klassen, wie ausführlicher besprochen wird, bedeutende Hinweise auf die wahrgenommene Unterdrückung des Kapitalismus. Beziehungen zwischen verschiedenen Individuen existieren in \"Brave New World\" nicht. Der Roman scheint sich zu weigern, die Charaktere zu unterscheiden - sie sind, selbst unter den Hauptfiguren, ohne Tiefe. Vielleicht suggeriert Huxley, dass der Aufstieg von Technologie und Kapitalismus zusammen den Menschen seiner freien Willen und Ausdrucksweise beraubt. Liebe existiert nicht, noch existieren die Extreme einer Emotion; vielmehr sind die Interaktionen oberflächlich gehalten, was sich deutlich in den Bemerkungen der Männer über Frauen, hauptsächlich über ihr Aussehen (z.B. pneumatische Qualität), und den unverschämten Kommentaren der Frauen über ihre Begegnungen zeigt, sozusagen. Darüber hinaus zeigt die Zufriedenheit jeder gesellschaftlichen Klasse mit ihrem Status in der Hierarchie die sozioökonomischen Auswirkungen des Kapitalismus. Ihr absolutes Gehorsam in ihrer Rolle in der Gemeinschaft ist ein Hinweis auf das marxistische Denken über das Proletariat, das fälschlicherweise von seiner eigenen Überlegenheit über alles andere überzeugt wird, solange es weiter konsumiert, gehorcht und sich mit dem Rest seiner Mitmenschen in Einklang bringt.\n\n[REWRITE]Aldous Huxley criticizes the looming threat of technology and the capitalist structure, which is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in his novel \"Brave New World.\" The people value the community over the individual and are conditioned from the start to prioritize immediate happiness above all else.

Eines der Hauptthemen der hitzigen Diskussion im Kurs war, ob der Islam eine feindliche Religion ist oder nicht. Ich glaube, dass diese Frage heute relevanter ist als je zuvor. Rückblickend auf die Ereignisse seit dem 11. September habe ich persönlich beobachtet, wie die Massenmedien von einer feindlichen Sichtweise des Islam und der Extremisten zu einer extremen Form der Toleranz gegenüber dem Islam in Amerika übergegangen sind. Ich denke, im Jahr 2001 hätten wir niemals einen Präsidentschaftskandidaten mit dem Namen Barack Obama haben können, der offensichtliche muslimische Wurzeln in seiner Familie hat.\nDie Biografie des Propheten ist für mich faszinierend, denn nach dem, was ich über die Geschichte von Muhammad weiß, widerspricht die Biografie der Persönlichkeit Muhammads. Aus dem, was ich weiß und in der Vergangenheit gelernt habe, dachte ich, dass Muhammad Bekehrte zum Islam zwang. Er würde Stämme erobern und übernehmen und sie dann zwingen, den Islam anzunehmen. Aber laut der Biografie wurde Muhammad als eine Art Märtyrer dargestellt, der missverstanden wurde und sich sogar vor anderen demütigte. Danach kamen die Menschen nacheinander, um die „Wahrheit“ in seiner Lehre zu sehen und suchten ihn auf.\nEs gibt auch einige unheimliche Ähnlichkeiten zwischen dem Wirken Jesu und den „Wundern“ von Muhammad. Das offensichtlichste ist, als er Hammelfleisch und Milch nahm und es vervielfachte, sodass es mehr als genug für vierzig Männer gab. Dieser Schreibstil lässt mich glauben, dass die Autoren wollten, dass Muhammad als der demütige Prophet wahrgenommen wird, der nichts beweisen musste, sondern einfach in Wahrheit und Wundern lebte. Diese Art von Trugschluss ist die schlimmste, weil sie das Wunder und das Leben von Jesus Christus herabsetzt. Für mich ist es, als ob sie stehlen und versuchen, sich das Leben und die Persönlichkeit Jesu durch Muhammad anzueignen.\nEs gibt auch viele Geschichten in der Biografie, die es so aussehen lassen, als sei es Teil ihrer Agenda, Beweise für „Zeugenschaft“ oder dafür zu liefern, wie Menschen „aus eigenem Antrieb“ zum Islam konvertierten. Aber das Problem ist, dass viele der Geschichten zumindest aus einer Perspektive von Dritten stammen. In der Geschichte zeigt der Autor, dass er von jemandem gehört hat, der es von jemand anderem gehört hat usw. Das gefiel mir nicht besonders, denn obwohl ihre Idee war, dass es Beweise für die Wahrheit der Geschichten lieferte, dachte ich, dass es die Geschichten herabsetzte und sie umso verdächtiger erscheinen ließ.\nIch glaube, das, was mich an diesem Werk am meisten stört, ist, dass sie versuchen, Muhammad als einen gottesfürchtigen Mann darzustellen, der demütig, liebenswert, weise und sanftmütig war. Aber die Geschichte widerspricht der Vorstellung, dass Muhammad ein sanfter und demütiger Mann war, und ich kann nicht umhin zu denken, ob Muslime heute die wahre Geschichte hinter Muhammads Aufstieg zur Macht kennen.\n\nEnglish Translation:\nAlmost four years ago, I took a course on Islam at CBC.

    "original": "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",

Unter Christen wird in den kommenden Jahren ein historisches Bewusstsein immens wachsen. Ein Verlangen wird sich verbreiten, die Lehren zu unterscheiden, die im Laufe der Zeit in das Christentum aufgenommen wurden, von der eigentlichen Absicht des Namensgebers der Religion. Es könnte Jahrzehnte oder sogar Jahrhunderte dauern, aber das Ergebnis wird unvermeidlich sein: Es wird eine große Umkehr im Trend der christlichen Geschichte geben. Es wird eine Rückkehr zu seiner ursprünglichen Form geben. Eine Bewegung wird in der Zahl wachsen, die Schicht um Schicht von Lehren entfernen wird, als ob die Uhr rückwärts laufen würde, bis nichts mehr übrig bleibt außer einer Vorstellung dessen, was Jesus im Namen Gottes der Menschheit eingeführt hat, bevor andere Denker solche Ansprüche stellten. Wenn dieser Trend durch die Vereinigten Staaten und Europa fegt und Massen in seinem Gefolge beeinflusst, zu verehren, als ob wir zur Zeit von Jesus lebten und nur seinen Ideen folgten, wird die Kirche als Institution stark bleiben, um den Weg zu führen. Da jedoch die theologische Uhr rückwärts gelaufen sein wird, wird die extreme Vielfalt in der Christenheit in immer mehr Einheitlichkeit des Glaubens und der Praxis umschlagen. Zwischen Regionen, zwischen Konfessionen, zwischen Trennungen jeder Art werden wir anstelle von Unterschieden zunehmende Ähnlichkeiten sehen. Die Menschheitsgeschichte ist voller großer Umkehrungen. Ein Beispiel ist, wie Christen einst vom Römischen Reich verfolgt, gemieden und getötet wurden. Aber später wurde dieses Reich eine christliche Institution. Unser Land ist von der Sklaverei afroamerikanischer Menschen zur afroamerikanischen Führung übergegangen. Die große Umkehr, die in unserer Zukunft kommt, wird sich im Bereich der christlichen Religion abspielen, indem sie die Geschichte auf der Suche nach der Quelle rückgängig macht und dabei die Vielfalt rückgängig macht. Es ist entscheidend zu beachten, dass ein Teil dessen, was diesen Prozess möglich machen wird, eine Methode sein wird, Jesu Worte metaphorisch und nicht als wörtliche Aussagen zu lesen. Was ist also seit der Lebenszeit Jesu passiert? Wenn wir weit genug in die Geschichte zurückblicken, finden wir nur das Judentum, den theologischen Anfang der christlichen Religion. Monotheismus, die Wahrnehmung einer göttlich offenbarten Religion und die Autorität der hebräischen Schriften standen im Kern der Religion, als die Römer 63 v. Chr. die Kontrolle über Jerusalem übernahmen. Die jüdische Bevölkerung teilte nicht einen Geist. Sie teilten sich in Sadduzäer, Pharisäer, Essener, Zeloten und eine Mehrheit von gewöhnlichen Menschen auf.\n\n**Back Translation into English:**\n\n[REWRITE]  \nThe teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were quickly set aside in the development of Christian thought that advanced after his life. If we look at this history broadly, we notice a trend of Christianity drifting further and further from its origins. Today's world seems to show an increasing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency. While traditional people remain and resist any kind of thinking beyond what they were taught, this portion of the population may not be influential enough to affect the whole. Among Christians, historical awareness will grow significantly in the coming years. A desire will spread to differentiate the doctrines added over time to Christianity from the actual intent of the religion's namesake. It might take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable: There will be a major reversal in the trend of Christian history. There will be a progression back to its original form. A movement will grow numerically, removing layers of doctrine as if the clock were turning backward, until nothing remains except a concept of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God before any other thinkers made such claims. When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if living in the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way. However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme diversity in Christendom will turn into increasing uniformity of belief and practice. Between regions, denominations, and divisions of all kinds, we will see increasing similarities instead of differences. Human history is filled with great reversions. One example is how Christians were once persecuted, shunned, and killed by the Roman Empire, but later that empire became a Christian institution. Our nation has moved from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The great reversion coming in our future will play out in the realm of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source and undoing diversity in the process. It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus' words metaphorically, not as literal statements. So, what has happened since Jesus' lifetime? If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning of the Christian religion. Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish population did not share one spirit. They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of common people.  \n[/REWRITE]",

They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich.

There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",

In „Dream-Land“ verwendet Poe den Begriff „Thule“ in den Zeilen 6 und 56, den Mabbott auf Vergil zurückführt. Vergil verwendete den Begriff in Bezug auf eine Insel nördlich von Großbritannien, die die Griechen als den Rand der bekannten Welt betrachteten. Es ist sicher, dass Vergil den Begriff verwendet hat, jedoch gibt es eine aktuellere Quelle, der einige Anerkennung gebührt. Poe war sehr an deutschen Autoren interessiert. Dieses Zitat ist wichtig, da es Poes Vertrautheit mit Gothe’s Schriften zeigt. Karl J. Arndt kommentiert in seinem Buch Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon die Ähnlichkeit ihrer beiden Gedichte und zieht den Schluss, dass Poe Goethe nachahmte. Der Oxford Companion to English Literature sagt über Goethe, dass er ein gefeierter Schriftsteller des poetischen Dramas Faust war, das in zwei Teilen veröffentlicht wurde, der erste 1808 und der zweite im Jahr von Goethes Tod 1832. Im poetischen Vers des zweiten Teils von Faust befindet sich ein kurzes Gedicht mit dem Titel „Der König von Thule“. Das Gedicht handelt von einem König, dessen Frau stirbt, nachdem sie ihm den Becher geschenkt hat. Nach dem Tod seiner Frau beginnt er stark zu trinken und weint aus der Erinnerung an seine tote Königin. Dann beschließt er, dass es seine Zeit ist zu sterben, und überlässt seinen Kindern seinen Besitz, bis auf den Becher. Dann geht er zu einer Klippe, wirft den Becher ins Meer, schließt die Augen und stirbt. Das Verhalten des Königs von Thule und die Beschreibung des Königs in Dream-Land sind sehr ähnlich, vielleicht ein dunkler Doppelgänger von Poes Verlust und Stütze des Trinkens. Faust wurde 1842 auch von H P Grattan in ein romantisches Drama umgewandelt, weniger als ein Jahr bevor Poe den Begriff Thule in „The Pit and the Pendulum“ verwendete. Poe erwähnt Thule zweimal in seinen gesammelten Schriften. Einmal erwähnt Poe „ultma Thule“ in The Pit and the Pendulum, aber er verwendet diesen Ausdruck in „Dream-Land“ zweimal, als Buchstützen für das Gedicht. „Der König von Thule“ und „Dream-Land“ können als Begleitstücke gelesen werden. In „Dream-Land“ sagt der Sprecher. Dann beschreibt er die Landschaft von Thule und wie sie dunkel und einsam ist, er wird von toten Freunden heimgesucht und sieht eine schattige Welt ohne Farbe. All diese Szenen würden in „Der König von Thule“ von Goethe hineingelesen werden, da er gerade seine Frau verloren hat, einsam ist und seinen Willen zu herrschen oder sogar zu leben verloren hat. Das gesamte Gedicht ist eine Beschreibung, als ob der Sprecher in Goethes Gedicht eingetreten wäre. Goethe war ein bedeutender Autor, den Poe gekannt hätte, wenn nicht aus einem anderen Grund, dann aus Respekt vor Tennyson. Poe sagte Folgendes, als er gefragt wurde, ob er Tennyson bewundere. Abgesehen von der Verbindung zu Tennyson wäre Poe in den vielen Reproduktionen, die nach der ursprünglichen Veröffentlichung stattfanden, Goethes Werk ausgesetzt gewesen.\n\nEnglish Translation:\nDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems.

To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009.

    "raw_output": "Unter kalifornischem Recht könnte ein Kunde, der verletzt wurde, nachdem er auf einem Apfelmus-Fleck in einem Lebensmittelgeschäft ausgerutscht und gefallen ist, Strafschadensersatz erhalten, indem er nachweist, dass der Filialleiter böswillig handelte, weil er zweimal über den Fleck informiert wurde und es eine halbe Stunde lang versäumte, ihn zu reinigen, weil er zu Abend aß? Ein Richter wird Jennifers Palmers Anspruch auf Strafschadensersatz wahrscheinlich nicht ohne Weiteres abweisen. Um einen Anspruch auf Strafschadensersatz zu begründen, muss der Kläger Beweise dafür vorlegen, dass die Handlungen des Beklagten mit vorsätzlicher und bewusster Missachtung des wahrscheinlichen Schadens begangen wurden, der sich aus dem Verhalten ergeben würde, sowie zeigen, dass das Verhalten verwerflich war. Palmer kann argumentieren, dass Martin den wahrscheinlichen Schaden hätte erkennen müssen, wenn ein Fleck nicht gereinigt wird, da mehrere Kunden von D&D in den Monaten vor Palmers Unfall durch Ausrutschen verletzt wurden; und trotz dieses Wissens versäumte er es immer noch, den Fleck reinigen zu lassen. Palmers Argument, dass Martins Handlungen verwerflich waren, ist weniger überzeugend, aber dennoch vernünftig, angesichts der Tatsache, dass im Jahr 2009 sechs Ausrutsch- und Sturzvorfälle aufgetreten waren und Martin immer noch keine geeigneten Maßnahmen ergriff, um die Sicherheit seines Geschäfts zu gewährleisten. Am 13. Oktober 2009 um 17:00 Uhr informierte Rich Wayne, ein Mitarbeiter von D&D Markets, seinen Manager Paul Martin, dass es in einem Gang einen Apfelmus-Fleck gab. Martin sagte Wayne, dass er in der Mittagspause sei und \"keine Zeit habe, sich um Kundenbeschwerden zu kümmern.\" Um 17:15 Uhr informierte eine andere Mitarbeiterin, Mary J. Haddigan, Herrn Martin ebenfalls über den Fleck, und Martin antwortete auf die gleiche Weise. Um 17:30 Uhr am dreizehnten rutschte die Klägerin Jennifer Palmer auf dem Fleck aus und erlitt eine schwere Rückenverletzung. Vor Palmers Unfall waren im Jahr 2009 fünf verschiedene Ausrutsch- und Sturzvorfälle bei D&D gemeldet worden. Palmer verklagt nun D&D auf Schadensersatz und Strafschadensersatz im Zusammenhang mit ihrer Verletzung, und wir prüfen, ob wir einen Antrag auf teilweises Urteil gegen den Strafschadensersatzanspruch stellen sollen. In Kalifornien kann ein Kläger Strafschadensersatz für die Verletzung einer Verpflichtung erhalten, die nicht aus einem Vertrag resultiert, wenn der Beklagte mit „Unterdrückung, Betrug oder Böswilligkeit“ gehandelt hat. Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). Das Gesetz definiert Böswilligkeit als Verhalten, das darauf abzielt, Schaden zu verursachen, oder bei fehlender Absicht muss das Verhalten „verwerflich“ sein und mit „vorsätzlicher und bewusster Missachtung der Rechte oder Sicherheit anderer“ begangen werden. id. bei § (c)(1). Gerichte haben Verhalten als böswillig charakterisiert, wenn es mit bewusster Missachtung der Rechte des Klägers begangen wurde, wenn der Beklagte „sich der wahrscheinlichen gefährlichen Folgen seines Verhaltens bewusst war und diese bewusst und absichtlich vermieden hat.“ Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).\n\n[REWRITE]Under California law, a customer injured after slipping on an applesauce spill in a grocery store could potentially be awarded punitive damages by showing that the store manager acted with malice. This could be argued if the manager had been informed twice of the spill and neglected to clean it for half an hour because he was having dinner. A judge is unlikely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages. To justify such a claim, the plaintiff must provide evidence that the defendant's actions were carried out with a willful and conscious disregard for the likely harm resulting from the conduct, and also show that the conduct was despicable. Palmer can argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning up a spill, as several D&D customers had been injured from slipping in the months before Palmer’s incident; despite this knowledge, he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer's argument that Martin's actions were despicable is less convincing, but still reasonable given that six slip-and-fall incidents occurred in 2009, yet Martin did not take appropriate actions to ensure the safety of his store. On October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne, an employee of D&D Markets, informed his manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne he was on a dinner break and \"didn't have time to deal with customer complaints.\" At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also informed Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded in the same way. At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, slipped on the spill and sustained a serious back injury.

After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",

Burma, auch bekannt als Myanmar, ist ein südostasiatisches Land, das von einer tyrannischen militärischen Junta regiert wird, die 1962 durch einen Putsch an die Macht kam. 2007 fanden eine Reihe von Straßenprotesten statt, die ersten öffentlichen Proteste seit einem Jahrzehnt. Diese Proteste, angeführt von einer großen Anzahl burmesischer Mönche, erhielten den Namen „Die Safran-Revolution“, benannt nach der Farbe der Roben, die die Mönche trugen. Nach den ersten Aufständen begann die breite Öffentlichkeit Interesse an den Protesten zu zeigen, und während die burmesische Regierung zunächst widerwillig zuließ, dass die Mönche sich an friedlichen Versammlungen beteiligten, eskalierte die Gewalt bald in das, was einige als offenen Krieg zwischen den Mönchen und der Militärjunta betrachteten, wobei das Militär aktiv Klöster im ganzen Land überfiel und plünderte. Ausländische Journalisten wurden zusammengetrieben und vor Ort inhaftiert, wobei ein japanischer Fotojournalist namens Kenji Nagai am 27. September 2007 getötet wurde, nur weil er bei einem Straßenprotest anwesend war. Während die offizielle Zahl der Todesopfer bei 13 Getöteten liegt, wird Oberst Hla Win, der einige Tage vor dem offiziellen Bericht aus der Armee übergelaufen ist, mit den Worten zitiert: „In den letzten Tagen sind viel mehr Menschen getötet worden, als Sie gehört haben. Die Leichen können in mehreren Tausend gezählt werden.“\n\nDas ist nichts Neues. Während dies einige der jüngsten Beispiele für Gräueltaten in unserer Welt sind, gibt es den Wunsch einer Regierung, abweichende Meinungen zu unterdrücken und die vollständige Herrschaft über ihre Bürger zu behalten, so lange wie die Zivilisation selbst. Frühe römische Kaiser erklärten sich von den Göttern auserwählt, um die vollständige exekutive Herrschaft über jeden Aspekt ihrer Gesellschaft zu haben. Es wird angenommen, dass japanische Kaiser tatsächlich Götter sind, die in unsere Welt gesandt wurden, um ihr Volk durch die Erfindung von Motorola-Handys und Harakiri zum Wohlstand zu führen, und unser derzeitiger Präsident, George W. Bush, führt wöchentliche Konferenzgespräche mit Ted Haggard, dem Leiter von Stupid People Worldwide, einer Tochtergruppe der Republikaner.\n\nEinige der bekanntesten Beispiele für solche Handlungen sind Vorfälle wie der Protest am 4. Juni 1989 auf dem Tiananmen-Platz, bei dem sich Intellektuelle, Arbeitsaktivisten und Studenten versammelten, um gegen die autoritäre Herrschaft der Regierung zu protestieren. Die Zahl der Todesopfer in diesem speziellen Fall variiert stark, mit offiziellen Berichten der chinesischen Regierung, die 200-300 Tote angeben, bis hin zu Berichten des chinesischen Roten Kreuzes, die zwischen 2.000-3.000 Tote erklären. Ein anderes Beispiel ist der Völkermord in Ruanda in den 1990er Jahren, bei dem Hutu-Milizen, unterstützt von der ruandischen Regierung, mit der systematischen Tötung aller Tutsis sowie politisch moderaten Menschen, unabhängig von ihrer ethnischen Herkunft, begannen. Hitlers ‚Drittes Reich‘, eine Periode, die sich über mehrere Jahre und mehrere Länder erstreckte, in der jeder mit jüdischem Hintergrund zusammengetrieben und getötet wurde, ist ein weiteres extremes Beispiel.\n\n[REWRITE]Hitler is alive in Burma, the sign reads.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner holding a piece of cardboard above her head, with the unsettling message scrawled onto her sign with a Sharpie.

Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

Ellingtons Präsenz am Klavier ist in vielen der für diese Aufgabe ausgewählten Kompositionen subtil, aber als Komponist glänzte Ellington darin, reichhaltige und komplexe Stücke zu schaffen, die die individuellen Fähigkeiten der Bandmitglieder zur Geltung brachten. Ellington entwarf den Rahmen, in dem ein Solist frei improvisieren konnte, zusätzlich zu streng orchestrierten Stücken und Phrasen, die den besonderen Stil der Bandmitglieder nutzten, um musikalische Ideen hervorzuheben. Dabei betonte er auch allgemein den Ton des Orchesters und schuf kohärente und originelle Klänge, die zu jedem Stück passten. Ellingtons Beherrschung des individuellen Klangs der Spieler sowie deren Zusammenspiel in einem wachsenden Ensemble ermöglichte es ihm, einige der innovativsten und brillantesten Stücke in der Jazzgeschichte zu schreiben.\n\nDas Grove Music Dictionary erwähnt in der Diskussion über Ellingtons Klang und Innovation Creole Love Call als Beispiel für die Verwendung der Stimme „als Jazzinstrument“ während seiner gesamten Karriere. Dies ist ein frühes Beispiel für Ellingtons Einsatz von Stimme, um Textur und Farbe hinzuzufügen, ohne durch Texte eingeschränkt zu werden. Creole Love Call zeigt auch Ellingtons Fähigkeit, den Stil seiner Solisten zu ergänzen, etwas, das sich durch seine ganze Karriere zieht. Dieses langsame, bedächtige Zwölf-Takt-Blues-Stück enthält sechs Chöre, wie folgt:\nChorus 1: Ruf und Antwort zwischen Stimme und Holzbläsern, wobei die Stimme sanft und melodisch beginnt und am Ende in einen raueren Klang übergeht.\nChorus 2: Gedämpftes Trompetensolo, das die Grundmelodie ausarbeitet und mehrere erweiterte Blautöne betont.\nChorus 3: Schwungvolles Klarinettensolo in hoher Lage, unterstützt von einer subtilen, synkopierten Klavierphrase.\nChorus 4: Die gesamte Band wiederholt den ersten Chorus mit Ruf und Antwort von Blech- und Holzbläsern.\nChorus 5: Der Höhepunkt des Stücks, da die Holzbläser nun den Ruf und die Antwort in hoher Lage beginnen, unterstützt von synkopiertem Stop-Time von Blech- und Rhythmussektion.\nChorus 6: Eine Rückkehr zur Struktur des ersten Chorus, mit Ruf und Antwort zwischen Stimme und Holzbläsern. In diesem Chorus nimmt die Stimme den Klang der „Growl“-Technik an und soliert als Instrument.\nTag: Kurzer Tag mit einem vokalen Lauf und einem dissonanten Neuheitsschluss durch eine Posaune.\nEllingtons Einsatz der Stimme, um diesem Stück eine zusätzliche Klangfarbe zu verleihen, ist ein Beispiel für ein stilistisches Merkmal, das sein Werk durchdringt.\n\nIn Hot and Bothered, aufgenommen ein Jahr später, verbindet Ellington seine Fähigkeit zur engen Orchestrierung mit seinem Gehör für Klangfarbe. Eine Ruf-und-Antwort-Phrase zwischen „Bubber“ Miley auf gedämpfter Trompete und Baby Cox’ Scat-Gesang nutzt die vokalen Elemente von Mileys Spiel und die instrumentalen Aspekte von Cox’ Stimme, um einen reichhaltigen und komplementären Klang zu erzeugen. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) erweitert diese Ideen, da Ellington Joe „Tricky Sam“ Nanton, ein fester Bestandteil von Ellingtons Orchester, mit großem Effekt einsetzt, um die Melodie auf gedämpfter Posaune einzuführen.\n\n[REWRITE]  \nDuke Ellington's impact on jazz largely comes from his long career and his creative ability to mold his orchestra.

Obwohl D'Arcy Thompson 1917 sagte, dass \"selbst jetzt der Zoologe kaum begonnen hat, die einfachsten organischen Formen in mathematischer Sprache zu definieren\", kann das Gleiche auch heute gesagt werden. In jüngerer Zeit wurde mathematische Modellierung auf allgemeine Aspekte der Molluskenskelettogenese sowohl durch Ontogenese als auch Phylogenie angewendet (z.B. Raup und Stanley, 1981). Unsere Studie untersucht, wie mathematische Modellierung von ontogenetischem und phylogenetischem Wandel in Prunum, in Kombination mit experimentellen Studien, verwendet werden kann, um die Mechanismen zu beleuchten, die an der Richtung und dem Ausmaß des evolutionär-entwicklungsbiologischen Wandels beteiligt sind. Wir verwendeten Röntgenbilder von Prunum-Arten, um quantitative Parameter zu bestimmen, die wiederum verwendet werden konnten, um hypothetische und tatsächliche Skelettmorphologien zu modellieren. Diese Parameter wurden in das Softwareprogramm CerioShell (Stone, 1995) eingegeben. Wir modellierten hypothetische Schalengeometrien, die verwendet werden könnten, um die Grenzen möglicher morphologischer Veränderungen in Prunum zu interpretieren.

Diese Achse verläuft durch die zentrale Säule der Schale und ist als Columella bekannt. Die Geschwindigkeit, mit der sich die Windungen vergrößern, kann variieren, und eine kontinuierliche Linie trennt jede Windung und wird als Naht bezeichnet. In den meisten Schalen ist die größte Windung einer Schale die letzte Windung (Körperwindung). Der Turm wird als alle Windungen außer der letzten betrachtet. Der Apex ist die Spitze des Turms und das gegenüberliegende Ende wird als Basis bezeichnet. Das Tier streckt sich durch eine Öffnung namens Apertur aus seiner Schale heraus.\n\nSchalen können in apikaler, basaler, aperturaler und abaperturaler Ansicht betrachtet werden.

Zuerst sollte die Schale aus der apikalen Ansicht betrachtet werden und dann sollte bestimmt werden, wo die erste Naht beginnt.

Windungen werden von dieser Linie aus gezählt und auf ein Viertel einer Windung geschätzt.\n\nEine Schale kann als eine Serie von Öffnungen betrachtet werden, die durch Raum und Zeit reisen, während das Tier seine Schale aufbaut. Es ist möglich, den Weg der Öffnung über die Koordinaten des Zentrums jeder Windungsöffnung sowie den horizontalen und vertikalen Radius der Öffnung zu verfolgen.\n\nDieser Verlauf kann grafisch und mathematisch dargestellt werden.

We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could interpret the boundaries of possible morphological changes in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be considered as a structure that is a tube traveling over time through 360 degrees of space. These turns or coils of a spiraled shell are called whorls, which are seen as spiraling around an imaginary central axis. This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary, and a continuous line separates each whorl, known as a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl is the last whorl (body whorl). The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire, and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views. (The \"usual\" orientation of a shell is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upwards.)\n\nA method for counting whorls is described below. First, the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins. A line can then be drawn dividing the shell into two parts. Whorls are counted from this line and estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of apertures traveling through space and time as the animal builds its shell. It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via the coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented. Once a mathematical formulation is established, it is possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",

Während das Land auf dem Weg ist, viele der Millennium-Entwicklungsziele zu erreichen, wie zum Beispiel die Ziele für Wasser und sanitäre Einrichtungen, sind die Fortschritte im Bereich der Kinder- und Müttergesundheit bedauerlicherweise weit von den erforderlichen Verbesserungen entfernt, um die Zielvorgaben bis 2015 zu erreichen. Die vielfältigen Gründe für diese Mängel werden unten erörtert und weisen darauf hin, dass es notwendig ist, das Gesundheitssystem zu stärken, anstatt sich auf programmatische Interventionen zu konzentrieren.\n\nIndonesien hat Fortschritte bei der Anzahl der Geburten gemacht, bei denen eine qualifizierte Gesundheitskraft anwesend ist, wobei jetzt 72 % der Geburten dieses Ziel erreichen. Dennoch umfasst diese Kategorie immer noch traditionelle Arbeitskräfte wie Hebammen, die im Falle von Komplikationen bei der Schwangerschaft keine medizinischen Eingriffe vornehmen können (daher der hohe Prozentsatz an Müttersterblichkeit durch Blutungen). Mit anderen Worten, die in diesem speziellen Indikator erzielten Verbesserungen sind etwas irreführend und es bleibt noch viel zu tun. Darüber hinaus gab es einen Rückgang des Prozentsatzes der Durchfallerkrankungen bei Kindern unter fünf Jahren, die von einem Gesundheitsfachmann behandelt werden. Obwohl die Daten zur postnatalen Betreuung unvollständig sind, ist klar, dass auch dieser Bereich besorgniserregend ist, mit niedrigen Raten im ganzen Land.\n\nDie Kaiserschnittraten sind immer noch niedriger als erwartet, etwa 4 %. Die Kaiserschnittraten weisen zudem auf ein weiteres besorgniserregendes Problem hin. Während die Kaiserschnittrate in städtischen Gebieten 7 % beträgt, liegt sie in ländlichen Gegenden nur bei 2 %. Dies weist auf das Problem der Gleichheit der Versorgung im ganzen Land hin. Offensichtlich konzentriert sich der Zugang zu Gesundheitsdiensten auf städtische Gebiete. Ein weiteres Zugangsproblem betrifft die vertikale Gerechtigkeit. Es gibt eine 27%ige Lücke in der Nutzung der Dienste zwischen den ärmsten und reichsten Quintilen. Offensichtlich haben die Armen viel mehr Schwierigkeiten, Gesundheitsdienste in Anspruch zu nehmen, wahrscheinlich aufgrund von Kosten, die sie selbst tragen müssen.\n\nBei der Diskussion der nächsten Schritte zur Verbesserung der Indikatoren für Neugeborenen- und Müttergesundheit stellt sich die grundlegende Frage, wie das Fehlen von Diensten am effektivsten angegangen werden kann. Insbesondere sollte Indonesien programmspezifische Ansätze entwickeln oder das gesamte Gesundheitssystem stärken, ohne sich auf die Betreuung der Mutter und des Kindes vor und nach der Schwangerschaft zu konzentrieren. Es besteht kein Zweifel, dass programmatische Ansätze zur Lösung der oben genannten Probleme attraktiv sind. „Vertikale Ansätze“, die sich auf einen Verbesserungssektor konzentrieren, haben nicht nur viel gezieltere und überschaubarere Ziele, sondern führen in der Regel auch schneller zu Ergebnissen. Es gibt jedoch einige Nachteile zu beachten. Ein wesentlicher Nachteil besteht darin, dass eine starke Investition in Programme für einen bestimmten Bereich des Gesundheitssektors oft bedeutet, dass die Finanzierung anderer Bereiche leidet und sich die personellen Ressourcen auf den Bereich konzentrieren, der mehr Ressourcen hat (ein Beispiel ist die Wirkung internationaler Finanzierung auf HIV/AIDS und seine Auswirkungen auf den Sektor der Familienplanung). Darüber hinaus führt der Betrieb mehrerer paralleler Programme für einen Bereich zu einer Duplizierung von Diensten, die auch zwischen den Programmen unkoordiniert sind. Dies führt zu einem Anstieg von Formularen und Papierkram für Materialien und Finanzierungen.\n\n[REWRITE]The rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia has remained relatively stable over the past decade.

    "original": "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",

    "raw_output": "Einige Jahrzehnte bevor die Surrealisten begannen, ihre traumhaften Werke zu malen, formte der Künstler Henri Rousseau sorgfältig seine eigenen Träume, sowohl im wörtlichen als auch im übertragenen Sinn. Das Gemälde Der Traum aus dem Jahr 1910 des bekannten Post-Impressionisten stellt nicht nur eine Frau dar, die von den Wundern des Landes, das sie in einem Traum besucht, fasziniert ist, sondern auch Rousseaus persönliche Träume und Ziele als Maler. Seit er mit seiner Arbeit begann, träumte er von Anerkennung, Akzeptanz und Lob durch andere Künstler und Kunstliebhaber und stellte fest, dass er vor einem schwierigen inneren Dilemma stand, um diesen Wunsch zu verwirklichen. Der Traum ist Rousseaus Werk, das seinen lebenslangen inneren Kampf am besten widerspiegelt: Entweder sich bestimmten Malstilen anzupassen oder sie nachzuahmen, um von der kritischen Kunstwelt, die er so bewunderte, akzeptiert zu werden, oder sich die Freiheit kreativer Unabhängigkeit und Einzigartigkeit zu erlauben, indem er seinen eigenen Weg ging.\n\nUm Der Traum aus dieser Perspektive analysieren zu können, muss man zunächst mit Rousseaus biographischer Geschichte vertraut sein. Henri Rousseau wurde am 21. Mai 1844 in der Stadt Laval im Nordwesten Frankreichs geboren. Sein Vater war ein Klempner und Eisenwarenhändler, der „bürgerlichen Wohlstand genoss“ (Shattuck 47). Er erhielt keine formale Ausbildung in den Künsten; stattdessen war er bis zum Alter von vierzig Jahren als Gabelou, ein Angestellter des städtischen Mautdienstes, beschäftigt, obwohl er den irreführenden Spitznamen Douanier, ein Zollinspektor, erhielt (Shattuck 46). Der Tod seiner ersten Frau Clémence, der den Tod von acht Säuglingen folgte, hinterließ Rousseau mit nur einem Kind, einer Tochter namens Julia, und immensem Kummer (Shattuck 49). Deshalb hoffte er, in einem neuen Leben Zuflucht zu finden, und widmete sich der Malerei, um Trost und Neuanfänge zu finden. Anders als zeitgenössische Kollegen, die den Bauern in der Malerei sentimentalisierten und romantisierten, war Rousseau im Wesentlichen ein Volksmaler und hatte die Hoffnungen und Träume des durchschnittlichen Mitglieds seiner Klasse.\n\nRousseaus Besessenheit, von der Kunstwelt akzeptiert zu werden, ist in gewissem Maße verständlich, wenn man den Kontext betrachtet: Wie bereits erwähnt, war er nicht nur in der formalen Malerei ungebildet und begann seine Karriere in einem viel höheren Alter, sondern er schuf seine Werke zur gleichen Zeit wie viele andere talentierte und bekanntere moderne Künstler. Obwohl er schon viele Jahre arbeitete, begann Rousseau erst dann, angemessene Anerkennung für seine Kunst zu erhalten, als Matisse begann, sich als Künstler einen Namen zu machen. Im Buch Moderne französische Maler behauptet der Autor Jan Gordon, dass die beiden, obwohl sie technisch Konkurrenten in der Kunstarena waren, sich nicht nur in Stil und Themen unterschieden, sondern auch in ihren Gründen, überhaupt zu malen: „Matisse war ein Maler, der eine Angst davor hatte, auf banale Weise zu malen, während Rousseaus Wunsch darin bestand, ein Bild so konventionell zu malen, dass er in den Artiste Français aufgenommen würde“ (92).\n\n[REWRITE]A few decades before Surrealist artists started creating their dreamlike paintings, Henri Rousseau was meticulously shaping his own dreams, both literally and metaphorically. His 1910 painting, The Dream, by the renowned Post-Impressionist artist, depicts not only a woman marveling at the wonders of a land she visits in a dream but also reflects Rousseau's personal dreams and ambitions as a painter. From the start of his career, he longed for recognition, acceptance, and praise from fellow artists and art enthusiasts, yet he found himself facing a challenging internal dilemma to realize this aspiration. The Dream is Rousseau's work that best encapsulates his lifelong inner struggle: whether to adopt or imitate certain painting styles to gain acceptance from the critical art world he so admired, or to grant himself the freedom to be creatively independent and unique, forging his own path.\n\nTo analyze The Dream from this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau's life story.

Unlike his contemporaries who sentimentalized and romanticized the peasant in their paintings, Rousseau was essentially a folk artist with the hopes and dreams of an average member of his class.\n\nRousseau's obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, not only was he untrained in formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was also creating works alongside many other talented and more well-known modern artists. Although he had been working for many years, Rousseau only started to gain proper recognition for his art around the same time Matisse was establishing his reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that while technically competitors in the art scene, the two differed not only in style and subject but also in their reasons for painting: \"Matisse was a painter who feared painting in a trite way, whereas Rousseau's desire was to create a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français\" (92).",

However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe.

A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art.

Ich glaube, dass es auf fundamentaler Ebene einen Grund dafür gibt. Wie John Keats in „Ode auf eine griechische Urne“ sagt: „Schönheit ist Wahrheit, Wahrheit Schönheit – das ist alles, was ihr auf Erden wisst, und alles, was ihr wissen müsst.“ Vieles von dem, was wir im Leben wissen, lernen wir durch Bildung oder Erfahrung. Doch scheinen wir, wie Keats andeutet, Ethik und Ästhetik zu schätzen, ohne auf die erwarteten Weisen unterrichtet zu werden. Sowohl Ethik als auch Ästhetik sind eher ein Versuch, zu beschreiben als vorzuschreiben. Unsere Studien über Moral und Schönheit sind größtenteils Versuche, zu erklären, warum ein Kunstwerk oder ein literarisches Werk schön ist oder warum eine Handlung moralisch ist, anstatt eine Reihe von Regeln aufzustellen, um gute Kunst oder moralisches Verhalten zu beurteilen oder zu schaffen.\n\nKritik an Kunst oder Moral kann nie das Wesen dessen, was gut oder schön ist, vollständig erfassen. Eine Diskussion über den Wert von da Vincis Mona Lisa könnte sich um Konzepte wie Vordergrund, Hintergrund, Kontrast oder kulturellen Kontext drehen, aber letztlich beschreiben diese nicht, warum es gute Kunst ist. Vielmehr hört man oft einen Satz wie „Da ist einfach etwas“ als Einleitung zu einer komplexeren oder kritischeren Erklärung, wenn jemand nach einem Lieblingskunstwerk oder -literatur gefragt wird. Ich glaube, dass weder Kunst noch Moral völlig auf eine Beschreibung ihrer Eigenschaften reduziert werden können. Wie Flannery O'Connor sagt: „Eine Geschichte ist eine Möglichkeit, etwas zu sagen, das auf keine andere Weise gesagt werden kann ... man erzählt eine Geschichte, weil eine Aussage unzureichend wäre.“ Egal wie vollständig wir die Eigenschaften eines literarischen Werks beschreiben, es bleibt etwas Transzendentes zurück. Ich glaube, dass Ethik dieselbe Eigenschaft besitzt. Wie Wittgenstein sagt: „Es ist klar, dass sich Ethik nicht ausdrücken lässt. / Ethik ist transzendental.“ Ich schlage vor, dass es dieses „Etwas“, dieses je ne sais quoi ist, das die stärkste Eigenschaft von Kunst und Moral darstellt und dass diese transzendentale Natur von Ethik und Ästhetik eine Verbindung zwischen ihnen schafft.\n\nIch glaube, dass Moral und Kunst so eng miteinander verbunden sind, weil wir beide am stärksten auf einer noumenalen Ebene erleben, um einen kantianischen Begriff zu verwenden. Sie beeinflussen uns auf einer Ebene, die erfahren, aber nicht vollständig erklärt werden kann. Diese Verbindung ist noch stärker, wenn es um die Kunst der Literatur geht. Wie McKean sagt: „Was die Literatur am meisten von den anderen Künsten unterscheidet, was in Wahrheit einzigartig an der Kunst ist, ist ihre moralische Qualität. Es mag sein, dass moralische Maßstäbe für andere Künste, zum Beispiel Musik, unangebracht sind, aber sie scheinen für die Literatur ebenso relevant zu sein wie für das Leben selbst. Leben beinhaltet notwendigerweise Werte. . . . Literatur ist uns wichtig, gerade wegen der Werte, die wir dort finden.“\n\n[REWRITE]Many great thinkers have suggested a close link between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty.

Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses.

Die gleiche Kultur ist spürbar von Köln am Rhein, durch das Zentrum Deutschlands bis zur sächsischen Stadt Dresden an der Elbe. Mit einer solch einzigartigen Kultur sollte es nicht überraschen, dass Deutschland, wie wir es heute kennen, aus mehreren verschiedenen Quellen und Stämmen stammt.\n\nGermania ist das Stammland der Deutschen. Die Ursprünge des Namens sind unter Gelehrten und Historikern hoch umstritten. Tacitus behauptete, dass der Name von einem germanischen Stamm stamme, der damals als Tungrier bekannt war, und dass sie zuvor als Deutsche bekannt waren, bevor sie den Rhein überquerten und gegen die gallischen Kräfte kämpften (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar verwendete erstmals das Wort \"Germanus\" in seinem Kommentar zu den Gallischen Kriegen, wo er die Gallier niederschlug und mit germanischen Stämmen kämpfte, die oft unter zweifelhaften Vorwänden den Rhein überquerten. Er entlehnte dieses Wort von den Galliern selbst und verwendete es, um zwischen denen, die er erobert hatte (die Gallier), und denen, die er nicht erobert hatte, zu unterscheiden. Während der Ursprung unsicher ist, glauben einige, dass es sich auf einen Nachbarn in der gallischen Sprache bezog. Im ersten Kapitel seines ersten Buches über diese Kriege stellt Julius Caesar fest: „Die Deutschen, die jenseits des Rheins wohnen, mit denen sie (die Gallier) ständig Krieg führen.....Sie kämpfen fast täglich in Schlachten mit den Deutschen.“ (Julius Caesar, 50-40 v. Chr.) Andere behaupten, die Bedeutung stamme von dem Speer, den sie im Krieg einsetzten, bekannt als Ger (O.E.D, 2010), oder vielleicht vom altirischen Wort garim, was „schreien“ bedeutet, was darauf hindeutete, dass die Deutschen laut oder lärmend waren. (Namen von Deutschland)\n\nDer frühe römische Historiker Tacitus verzeichnete in seinen Schriften aus dem Jahr AD 98 „De Origine et situ Germanorum“, das von den Ursprüngen der Deutschen erzählte, dass „ich (die Deutschen) als Ureinwohner betrachten würde, die überhaupt nicht durch Einwanderung oder Verkehr mit anderen Rassen vermischt sind. Denn in früheren Zeiten war es nicht zu Land, sondern auf dem Schiff, dass diejenigen, die auswandern wollten, ankamen.......Wer würde Asien oder Afrika für Italien für Deutschland verlassen, mit seinem wilden Land, seinen unfreundlichen Himmeln, seinen mürrischen Manieren und Aspekten, es sei denn, es wäre tatsächlich seine Heimat?(SIC)“ (Tacitus, 98)\n\nUnd wer würde Rom für Germania verlassen? Sicherlich nicht die Römer, zumindest noch nicht. Sie würden ihre Eroberungen in die Länder von Germania aussenden, um Waren zu beschaffen, und gelegentlich einen Landfeldzug führen, aber am Ende kehrten sie meistens in ihr weitläufiges Reich zurück. So begannen die germanischen Stämme, die Mitte des ersten Jahrhunderts auftauchten, an den Grenzen des Römischen Reiches zu leben und handelten mit ihren aus dem Land gewonnenen Waren und ihren Fähigkeiten, indem sie in den Reihen der römischen Armee dienten, (Ozment, 2005 S. 17).\n\n[REWRITE]Modern Germany is seen as a powerful force, a nation united by its unique cultural blend that stretches from the shadows of the Alps in Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel.

For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women?

Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support.

(Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

Der Höhepunkt dieser Rivalität war der Mexikanisch-Amerikanische Krieg von 1846-1848, in dem die Vereinigten Staaten Mexiko angriffen und besiegten und sich Texas und den amerikanischen Südwesten als neues Territorium sicherten. Viele weitere Konflikte traten zwischen den beiden Nationen auf und ließen schließlich kurz vor dem Ersten Weltkrieg nach. Die Rivalität begann, als Amerikaner und Mexikaner in zentralen Fragen wie Religion, Kultur und Tradition aneinandergerieten und es zu einem großen Konflikt materieller Interessen kam (Schmitt 1974 S. 30-31).\n\nDies ist nicht unähnlich zu vielen anderen Nationen, die eine anhaltende Rivalität mit einem Nachbarn haben. Nationen, die eine gemeinsame Grenze teilen, neigen dazu, Interessenkonflikte zu haben, die zur Schaffung rivalisierender Positionen zwischen den Nationen führen. Die Vereinigten Staaten und Mexiko sind nicht unähnlich vielen anderen anhaltenden Rivalitäten zwischen Nationen mit einer gemeinsamen Grenze. David M. Pletcher (1977) stellt fest, dass „nur in Mexiko und Kuba langanhaltende übergreifende amerikanische diplomatische Probleme zu finden sind“ (S. 41). Tatsächlich sind beide dieser Nationen geografisch nahe an den Vereinigten Staaten und waren Rivalen der Vereinigten Staaten, während andere Nationen in Lateinamerika gute Beziehungen zu den Vereinigten Staaten genießen und genossen haben.\n\nReligiöse Fragen schufen eine Kluft zwischen den beiden Nationen, ein Problem, das viele Nationen durch die Geschichte betroffen hat. Sally Frahm (2001) erklärt, dass „wenn im zwanzigsten Jahrhundert die Amerikaner gegen Faschismus und Kommunismus waren, sie im achtzehnten und neunzehnten gegen Katholizismus und Monarchie waren“ (S. 86). Ähnlich der Rivalität des Kalten Krieges zwischen den Vereinigten Staaten und der Sowjetunion war es teils ein ideologischer Kampf und teils ein Wettbewerb um Interessen, die jede Nation als lebenswichtig betrachtete. In diesem Fall basierten die ideologischen Kämpfe jedoch nicht auf der politischen Struktur, sondern auf den religiösen Präferenzen der Vereinigten Staaten und Mexikos. Dieses Misstrauen wuchs aus dem Misstrauen zwischen den Engländern und Spaniern. Diese Gefühle des Misstrauens von ihren ehemaligen Kolonialherren zu erben, war ein großes Hindernis für den Aufbau freundlicher Außenbeziehungen zwischen den Vereinigten Staaten und Mexiko.\n\nDiehl und Goerts (2000) zählen 17 Streitigkeiten zwischen Mexiko und den Vereinigten Staaten in der 57-jährigen Rivalitätsperiode auf. Die Mehrheit der Streitigkeiten in der von Diehl und Goerts beschriebenen Rivalitätsperiode sind territoriale Fragen, die sich auf Grenzüberfälle vom mexikanischen Territorium nach Mexiko und andere Grenzprobleme beziehen. Grenzüberfälle von Banditen und Gesetzlosen aus amerikanischen Grenzstädten waren ein großes Problem, das blieb, bis sowohl die Vereinigten Staaten als auch Mexiko militärische Gewalt an ihren Grenzen ausübten (Schmitt 1974 S. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) erklärt, dass die Rivalität zwischen den beiden Nationen zu schwinden begann, als „Mexiko eindeutig in erheblicher Weise von den Vereinigten Staaten abhängig wurde“ (S. 109) und schließlich endete, als die amerikanischen Ambitionen „sich vom territorialen Expansionismus zur wirtschaftlichen Intervention in Mexiko änderten“ (S. 110) im späteren Teil des 19. Jahrhunderts.\n\n[REWRITE]The United States of America and Mexico serve as an example of two nations that were once entangled in a lasting rivalry lasting 57 years, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).

Ich hatte meinen Beruf aus einem tief verwurzelten Bedürfnis nach der Sicherheit und Geborgenheit gewählt, die ich als Kind nicht hatte. \"Du wirst immer Arbeit finden können; Menschen werden immer krank werden.\" war das Mantra, das ich immer wieder hörte, als ich die Pubertät erreichte und darüber hinaus. Also, obwohl mein Traum war, Wissenschaftlerin oder Journalistin zu werden - vorzugsweise eine Mischung aus beidem - entschied ich mich für die Krankenpflege. \n\nDennoch, da war ich: 46 Jahre alt und alleinstehend, ohne nennenswertes Geld auf der Bank und arbeitsunfähig. Bis heute bin ich behindert, und nach 15 Jahren, in denen ich von der Sozialversicherungsbehinderung gelebt habe, bleibt mir buchstäblich nichts mehr, was ich \"mein\" nennen kann. Ich komme zurecht, aber jeder Tag ist ein Kampf und ein Angriff auf meine Sicherheit, Geborgenheit und mein Selbstwertgefühl.

Doch ich würde viel lieber sehen, dass Amerikaner wieder lernen, einander zu vertrauen - lernen, sich gegenseitig zu helfen und um Hilfe zu bitten, anstatt dass jeder von uns einzeln in den Hinterhof geht, um Bunker zu bauen. \n\nDie Konservativen in den USA sprechen von dem \"robusten Individualismus\", der dieses Land aufgebaut hat; aber in Wahrheit war es nicht der robuste Individualismus, der unsere Vorfahren in schweren Zeiten am Leben hielt, sondern Mitgefühl, gegenseitiger Respekt und das Teilen von Ressourcen.

It's a great idea, as is a wood stove, as long as you do not live in an apartment.\n\nBut while you're at it, get to know your neighbors.",

Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",

    "raw_output": "Sure, here is the translation from English to German and back to English:\n\nEnglish to German:\nIrgendwann im fünften oder sechsten Jahrhundert v. Chr. wurde ein Prinz geboren, der eines Tages Buddha genannt werden würde. Im Laufe seines Lebens entsagte er der Welt und wurde erleuchtet, und seine Lehren führten zur Entstehung des Buddhismus, von dem die orthodoxeste Sekte als Theravada-Buddhismus bekannt ist. Die Religion ist etwa zweitausendfünfhundert Jahre alt; sie sieht heute anders aus als zu Buddhas Lebzeiten. Dies ist überall zu sehen, zum Beispiel in der Theravada-Nation Sri Lanka, wo die jährliche Wasserzeremonie beobachtet wird. Mönche und Laien nehmen gleichermaßen an dieser Zeremonie teil, und sie hat eine gewisse religiöse Bedeutung, obwohl Buddha nie über ein solches Fest lehrte. Diese Unterschiede erstrecken sich von den oberflächlichen Traditionen bis zum soteriologischen Kern der Religion. Die Theravada-Gemeinschaft, sowohl aus der klösterlichen Perspektive als auch aus der Laienperspektive, musste im Laufe der Zeit ihre doktrinären Prinzipien ändern. Dies kann auf sowohl äußere als auch innere, sowohl feindliche als auch wohlwollende Kräfte zurückgeführt werden.\nEs gibt eine Reihe von qualifizierenden Begriffen, die in dieser Diskussion häufig verwendet werden. Es gibt das Konzept von intern versus extern. Hier wird eine interne Kraft als eine Kraft definiert, die von Mitgliedern der Buddhasasana ausgeht, unabhängig von ihrem klösterlichen Status. Eine externe Kraft ist jede Kraft von Nicht-Buddhisten. Eine feindliche Kraft ist jede Kraft, die der buddhistischen Gemeinschaft schadet oder beabsichtigt, ihr zu schaden—eine Kraft, die aus einer negativen Wahrnehmung des Buddhismus entsteht. Eine wohlwollende Kraft ist eine Kraft, die der buddhistischen Gemeinschaft weder schaden noch helfen will—obwohl sie als Nebenprodukt das eine oder andere tun kann. Diese Begriffe werden in dieser Diskussion wiederholt auftauchen.\nZuerst ist es wichtig, die Grundlagen der Religion zu untersuchen—die Lehren, die im Kern des Theravada-Buddhismus liegen. Buddhisten suchen Zuflucht im dreifachen Juwel des Buddha, des Dhamma und der Sangha. Das Dhamma besteht im Wesentlichen aus dem Tripitaka—den drei Körben—buddhistischer Texte. Der Sutta Pitaka enthält alle Suttas, der Vinaya Pitaka enthält die disziplinarischen Regeln, und der Abhidhamma Pitaka enthält die metaphysischen Komponenten des Buddhismus. Die metaphysischen Vorstellungen bestehen aus Dingen wie Anatta—keine Seele, Dukkha—innewohnendes Leiden im Leben, und Anicca—Vergänglichkeit von allem. Nur durch das Erkennen dieser Konzepte kann man Sansara, den Kreislauf von Tod und Wiedergeburt, der ständig passiert, beenden. Zusammen mit Sansara werden lobha—Begierde, dosa—Hass, und moha—Täuschung enden, wenn man erleuchtet wird. Im Vinaya Pitaka sind Regeln für das Leben festgelegt. Für Laien gibt es fünf Gebote (ich soll nicht töten, ich soll nicht lügen, ich soll nicht stehlen, ich soll mich nicht sexuell falsch verhalten und ich soll keine berauschenden Substanzen nehmen). Für Mönche gibt es viel mehr disziplinarische Regeln zu befolgen. Der grundlegendste doktrinäre Begriff im Buddhismus ist der Begriff der vier edlen Wahrheiten. Erstens, Dukkha; die Wahrheit, dass das Leben Leiden ist. Zweitens, dass Anhaftung Leiden verursacht. Drittens, dass das Leiden überwunden werden kann.\n\nGerman to English:\nSomewhere in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince was born who would one day be known as Buddha.
