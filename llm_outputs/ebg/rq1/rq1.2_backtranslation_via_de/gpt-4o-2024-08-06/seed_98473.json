While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks.

Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule.

    "raw_output": "Kultur spielt eine bedeutende Rolle in jeder Verhandlung. Kultur kann ebenso sehr durch das definiert werden, was sie nicht ist, wie durch das, was sie tatsächlich ist und was sie bedeutet. Kultur ist weder homogen noch eine bestimmte Sache. Sie ist auch nicht einheitlich oder uniform. Aussagen wie „alle Russen sind stur“ oder „alle Japaner sind entgegenkommend“ sind von Natur aus weit gefasst und zu simpel. Während das Verständnis von Verallgemeinerungen einer Kultur angemessen ist, ist es für einen Verhandlungsführer viel produktiver, die Bedeutung einer Kultur für die aktuelle Angelegenheit zu verstehen und wie die Einstellung dieser Kultur die Verhandlungen beeinflussen kann und wird. Wenn man sich einer fremden Kultur nähert, erlebt man sie auf eine Weise, die mit der eigenen Kultur vergleichbar ist, und es entstehen notwendigerweise Vergleiche.\n\nDer Versuch, eine fremde Kultur oder Denkweise zu verstehen, kann alles umfassen, von der Erforschung ihrer Geschichte bis zur Erkenntnis ihrer Vorurteile. Anstatt eine Kultur zu beurteilen oder zu versuchen, sie zu ändern, muss man sie einfach so akzeptieren, wie sie ist, und innerhalb ihrer Grenzen arbeiten, besonders im Rahmen von Verhandlungen, und ganz besonders, wenn man mit einer schwächeren Verhandlungsposition an den Tisch kommt. Ebenso kann Respekt vor Traditionen und Überzeugungen einem Verhandlungsführer, der sich auf „fremdem“ Boden befindet, nur helfen, kulturelle Barrieren zu überwinden und die Verhandlung voranzutreiben.\n\nEs ist wichtig zu beachten, dass sich Kultur nicht unbedingt auf eine nationale/internationale Dichotomie beschränkt. Die meisten Unternehmen in einem bestimmten Land etablieren ihre eigene Unternehmenskultur. Zum Beispiel könnte eine Unternehmenskultur lange Arbeitszeiten im Büro oder einen entspannteren Zeitplan betonen. Belege für eine Unternehmenskultur lassen sich in der Kleiderordnung der Mitarbeiter, im Kommunikationsstil (direkte vs. indirekte Kommunikation, Delegation von Aufgaben) und in den Einstellungspraktiken erkennen. Einige Unternehmen ermutigen auf jeder Ebene zur Philanthropie von Mitarbeitern, andere beschränken sie auf „vom Unternehmen genehmigte“ Wohltätigkeitsorganisationen oder Spendenaktionen. Man braucht sich nur die Unterschiede in der amerikanischen Unternehmenskultur von Unternehmen zu Unternehmen anzusehen (und in der Tat gibt es selbst innerhalb eines Unternehmens von Region zu Region, von städtischen zu vorstädtischen Umgebungen, Diversität), um die Vielfalt der Gedanken zu schätzen, die innerhalb einer bestimmten gesellschaftlichen Kultur existieren kann. Bestimmte Kulturen sind nicht annähernd so stark geschichtet wie die amerikanische Kultur und können für einen Außenstehenden einheitlicher erscheinen, aber ein ähnliches Äußeres ist einfach ein Zeichen dafür, tiefer zu graben.\n\nWerte sind noch wichtiger zu verstehen, weil sie das „Warum“ einer Kultur liefern. Wenn das Bewahren des Gesichts oder die gemeinschaftliche Harmonie innerhalb einer Kultur geschätzt wird, wird ein Verhandlungsführer sicherlich nicht öffentlich sein Unternehmen oder seinen Vorgesetzten beschämen, um am Verhandlungstisch erfolgreich zu sein. Ebenso wird ein Verhandlungsführer aus einer Kultur, die einer harten Verhandlung großen Wert beimisst, nicht unbedingt dazu getrieben sein, bei der ersten Gelegenheit einen Kompromiss zu schließen. Diese Verallgemeinerungen vor einer Verhandlung zu berücksichtigen, ist wichtig. Ein Verhandlungsführer ist jedoch gut beraten, etwas über seinen Gegner auf persönlicher Ebene zu lernen, um die Verhandlungen effektiv zu gestalten.\n\n[REWRITE]  \nCulture has a crucial role in any negotiation.

This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",

    "raw_output": "Sure, let's begin with the translation to German:\n\n„Der Narr spricht in seinem Herzen: ‚Es gibt keinen Gott.‘“ Das obige Zitat findet sich zunächst in Psalm 14 der christlichen Bibel und steht am Anfang von St. Anselms Argument über die Existenz Gottes. Dieser Glaube scheint auch von dem anderen Autor vertreten zu werden, den wir diskutieren werden, Thomas von Aquin. Da jedes ihrer Argumente zur Verteidigung des gleichen Konzepts vorgebracht wird und unsere Herausforderung darin besteht, festzustellen, welches das bessere der beiden ist, müssen wir aus Gründen der Kürze mit der Annahme beginnen, dass beide in ihrem Glauben an die Existenz Gottes, speziell des Gottes der Bibel, richtig liegen. Ein Gott-Typ, der nicht dem entspricht, an den unsere beiden Autoren glauben, würde es uns nicht erlauben, ihre beiden Argumente angemessen zu vergleichen, da sie im Wesentlichen zur Verteidigung eines spezifischen Konzeptes von Gott stehen. Das gesagt, möchte ich vorschlagen, dass obwohl jeder von ihnen gültige Punkte anführt, keiner wirklich eine ganzheitliche Grundlage für den Glauben an Gott bietet.\nUm diesen Punkt zu veranschaulichen, werden wir zunächst das grundlegende Argument von St. Anselm untersuchen. Anselms Text spiegelt einen Weg wider, Verständnis durch Glauben zu erlangen, indem man in sich selbst nach Beweisen für Gott sucht. Er erklärt, dass wir, weil Gott in unserem Verständnis existiert, seine Nichtexistenz nicht effektiv begreifen können. Während dieses Konzept, wenn es in seiner Terminologie dargelegt wird, etwas mühsam und manchmal unklar ist, ist der grundlegende Kern, dass der Beweis für Gott im eigenen Geist liegt. St. Anselm schlägt uns vor, dass wir nicht über die Grenzen unserer eigenen Seele hinausgehen müssen, um die Wahrheit über Gott zu finden, sondern dass die Existenz dieses Wesens einfach dadurch als wahr erkannt wird, dass wir das untersuchen, was wir inhärent als wahr in unseren eigenen Gedanken wissen. Fremde Beweise sind vermutlich unnötig. Dieses Konzept, das zu akzeptieren, für das es keinen unwiderlegbaren empirischen Beweis gibt, wird oft in christlichen Texten als Glaube bezeichnet.\nDiese Idee unterscheidet sich stark von derjenigen, die von St. Thomas von Aquin vertreten wird. Aquin schlägt stattdessen vor, dass die Existenz Gottes vollständig durch Vernunft und empirische Beweise bewiesen werden kann, ohne dass irgendeine Art von Glauben erforderlich ist. Eine solche Idee wäre im Evangelium von Vorteil, einem wichtigen Element des Christentums, da sie es ermöglichen würde, neue Konvertiten zu gewinnen, ohne dass sie bereit sein müssen, etwas zu akzeptieren, das nicht bewiesen werden kann. Sie könnten stattdessen nur durch Logik überzeugt werden. St. Thomas erläutert fünf verschiedene logische Argumente, die die Existenz Gottes unterstützen: Veränderung, Verursachung, Kontingenz, Grade der Exzellenz und Harmonie. In jedem zeigt er im Wesentlichen, dass der Beweis für Gott in der logischen Notwendigkeit für Gott liegt. Wenn Ihnen gesagt wird, dass ein Puzzlestück fehlt und Sie den Rest des Puzzles zusammensetzen, diktiert die Logik, dass Sie die Merkmale und die Existenz des fehlenden Stücks kennen können, ohne es sehen zu müssen.\n\nNow, let's translate this back to English:\n\n[REWRITE] \"The fool says in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This quotation first appears in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and marks the beginning of St. Anselm's argument about the existence of God.

    "raw_output": "**Translation to German:**\n\nViele Autoren verwenden unterschiedliche Methoden, um ihren Lesern ein bestimmtes Gefühl oder eine bestimmte Haltung gegenüber wichtigen Themen zu vermitteln. Einige dieser Techniken sind effektiver als andere. F. Scott Fitzgerald verwendet viele dieser verschiedenen Techniken in seinem Roman Der große Gatsby. Manchmal kombiniert Fitzgerald ein Adjektiv und ein Substantiv, die normalerweise nicht zusammenpassen, um den Lesern eine bestimmte Aura um ein Thema zu geben. Andere Male verleiht er einem Symbol eine Bedeutung und verwendet es dann zu diesem Zweck. Fitzgerald nutzt diese letzte Technik mit vielen Farben, darunter Gold, Grün, Weiß/Grau und Rot/Rosa. In seinem Roman Der große Gatsby baut F. Scott Fitzgerald Bedeutungen für Farben auf, insbesondere Weiß/Grau und Rot/Rosa, und nutzt diese Bedeutung später, um den Lesern eine bestimmte Erinnerung an ein Gefühl um ein wichtiges Objekt zu geben. Die Bedeutung, die Fitzgerald für Weiß/Grau aufbaut und verwendet, ist Gleichförmigkeit, wobei Weiß etwas schöner und gehobener ist und Grau älter und verblasster wirkt. Fitzgerald setzt diese Bedeutung zu Beginn des Romans mit ständigem Gebrauch beider Farben um. Daisy und Jordan sind ständig „in Weiß“ – tatsächlich trägt jeder immer Weiß: Nick trägt „weiße Flanellhosen“ zu Gatsbys Party, Tom trägt ein „weißes Hemd“, als er Myrtle trifft, und Catherine ist „milchig weiß gepudert“. Tatsächlich tragen die Leute nur dann kein Weiß, wenn Nick seine Eindrücke von Gatsbys Party bekommt: „die Flure... sind prunkvoll mit Primärfarben“. Fitzgerald definiert diese beiden Farben weiter, indem er viele gewöhnliche, unwichtige Themen in diesen Farben darstellt: Wenn Nick zur Arbeit geht, geht er „hinunter die weißen Schluchten von New York“, die Namen der Leute auf Gatsbys Partys sind jetzt „graue Namen“ auf Nicks Zeitplan, Catherines Wohnung ist „ein Stück in einem langen weißen Kuchen aus Apartmenthäusern“ – Gleichförmigkeit. Er beschreibt auch einfache oder gewöhnliche Menschen oder Orte als weiß oder grau: Jordan und Daisy hatten zusammen eine „weiße Mädchenzeit“, es gibt „graue Autos“ und „graues Land“ im Aschetal, das „italienische Kind“ in der Eisenbahn ist „grau“, und der Hundeverkäufer ist „ein grauer alter Mann“. Nachdem Fitzgerald genug Bedeutung zu Weiß/Grau hinzugefügt hat, verwendet er sie, um Unwichtigkeit oder Gleichförmigkeit bei bestimmten Themen zu signalisieren. Diese Verwendung von Farben, um den Lesern etwas zu zeigen, beginnt zuerst mit Daisy. Nach langer Zeit ohne signifikante Verwendung einer dieser Farben beschreibt Fitzgerald Daisy als „in Weiß gekleidet“ in einem „kleinen weißen Roadster“; die Leser beginnen Daisy weniger als Charakter zu sehen, mehr als nur eine gleichförmige Ergänzung, etwas, das Gatsby will und sich wünscht. Fitzgerald verwendet mehr von dieser Technik um Daisy herum, um diesen Eindruck von Daisy als eine gleichförmigere Ergänzung zu vermitteln, zum Beispiel gibt es einen „grauen Schleier von Daisys Pelzkragen“, und sie ist wieder in einem „weißen“ Kleid vor der Begegnung mit Tom und Gatsby.\n\n**Translation back to English:**\n\nMany authors use different methods to convey a certain feeling or attitude toward important themes to their readers.

Daisy and Jordan are constantly \"in white\"—in fact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears \"white flannels\" to Gatsby's party, Tom wears a \"white shirt\" when meeting Myrtle, and Catherine is \"powdered milky white.\" People are only not wearing white when Nick is observing Gatsby's party: \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors.\" Fitzgerald further defines these two colors by depicting many ordinary, unimportant subjects in them: as Nick goes to work, he goes \"down the white chasms of lower New York,\" the names of people at Gatsby's parties are now \"gray names\" on Nick's timetable, Catherine's apartment is \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\"—uniformity. He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and Daisy had a \"white girlhood\" together, there are \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" in the valley of ashes, the \"Italian child\" in the railroad is \"gray,\" and the dog-seller is \"a gray old man.\" After Fitzgerald has added enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or uniformity regarding certain subjects. This use of colors to convey something to readers first starts with Daisy. After a long period without significant use of either color, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster\"; readers begin to perceive Daisy as less of a character, more as a uniform addition, something that Gatsby desires and longs for. Fitzgerald employs more of this technique around Daisy to convey this impression of her as a more uniform addition, for example, there is a \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar,\" and she is once again in a \"white\" dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",

Zu den häufig angebauten Pflanzen gehören Tomaten, Zitrusfrüchte, Blattgemüse, Kürbis, Brokkoli, Kräuter, Baumfrüchte wie Pfirsiche und Zitronen, Beeren, Honig und Paprika. Es gibt einen beträchtlichen Markt für biologisch unterstützte Landwirtschaft in der Region San Diego, mit vielen lokalen Organisationen, die lange Wartelisten haben. Biologische Eier und Milch sind ebenfalls beliebt. Viele Bio-Bauernhöfe bieten auch Führungen durch ihre landwirtschaftlichen Betriebe sowie Zugang zum Wandern, zur Vogelbeobachtung und zu anderen Freizeitaktivitäten an. Dieser Typ von Betrieb würde es dem Landbesitzer ermöglichen, die Vorteile von Regierungsprogrammen zu nutzen, während er den Lebensraum verbessert, was wiederum Freizeitnutzung und die Möglichkeit für Hofbesichtigungen und andere Programme zur Geldverdienung oder zu Bildungszwecken schafft.\nNeben der Besetzung einer potenziell lukrativen Nischenmarktlücke umfassen die Vorteile der ökologischen Landwirtschaft oft eine größere Artenvielfalt bei Pflanzen und Tieren in der Region, dank des Fehlens von Chemikalien im Boden und Wasser. Allerdings hat die ökologische Landwirtschaft in mancher Hinsicht höhere Kosten als die konventionelle Landwirtschaft. Sie erfordert intensivere Arbeit und Verwaltung, um Schädlinge und Unkraut zu entfernen und den Boden ohne Chemikalien zu düngen, und die Verluste sind oft größer als bei herkömmlichen Methoden, während ein kleiner Bio-Bauernhof auch nicht die Effizienz im Maßstab großer Betriebe hat. Praktiken, die nicht mit der ökologischen Landwirtschaft, aber vorteilhaft für die Tierwelt sind, können ebenfalls höhere Arbeitskosten verursachen, darunter das Pflanzen von Deckfrüchten, rotierende Weidewirtschaft, das Entfernen invasiver Arten und das aktive Management des Pflanzenwachstums, um spezifische Bedingungen wie Randlebensräume oder offene Flächen zu schaffen. Daher gibt es viele Gründe, warum der Landbesitzer in diesem Beispiel finanzielle Hilfe oder Fachwissen in Anspruch nehmen könnte, um sowohl den Gewinn als auch die Qualität des Lebensraums zu maximieren.\nDas für dieses Szenario gewählte Landstück liegt neben der Stadt Potrero im nicht eingemeindeten San Diego County, Kalifornien. Es umfasst 160 Hektar Chaparral, nicht heimisches mediterranes Grasland und Eichenwald neben dem Cleveland National Forest. Es liegt in der Ökoregion East County Southern Foothills des San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. Der Plan wird noch überprüft, berücksichtigt aber derzeit über hundert Pflanzen- und Tierarten. Viele sind bedroht, wie der Stephens-Kängururatte, der Berggelbfrosch, mehrere Schmetterlingsarten und der Kalifornien-Gimpel; andere sind im Rückgang begriffen und könnten bald gelistet werden, wie z.B. Erdbuhlenkäuze.\nDieses Gebiet wurde über unzählige Jahrhunderte von amerikanischen Ureinwohnern bewohnt und wurde dann Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts von Viehzüchtern und Holzverkäufern besiedelt. Dieses Stück Land war Teil eines ursprünglichen Siedlungspatents und wurde wahrscheinlich für Weidewirtschaft und/oder Holzproduktion in vielen der dazwischenliegenden Jahrzehnte genutzt.\nIch habe ein Grundstück von einer Immobilien-Website ausgewählt und verfügbare Regierungsprogramme recherchiert, um zu sehen, welche Optionen ein Kleinbauer realistischerweise haben könnte, um Kosten zu mindern und wildtierfreundliche Betriebe zu erhalten. Als Modell dafür, was jemand, der dieses Land bewirtschaftet, zu erreichen versuchen könnte, habe ich einen Bio-Bauernhof in derselben Gegend gefunden.\n\n[REWRITE]  \nSan Diego County is highly agriculturally productive due to its mild, sunny climate.

Innerhalb dieser Verbindung liegen viele Emotionen: Liebe, Stolz, Eifersucht und Grausamkeit, um nur einige zu nennen. Brüder verstehen einander, weit mehr als jeder andere mit einer solchen Verbindung, und sie können nur sich selbst sehen, wenn sie ihren Bruder ansehen. Es ist in den kritischsten Situationen, dass die wahre Natur dieser Verbindung sichtbar wird, sei es gut oder böse. Wenn diese Emotionen klar werden, tragen sie einen hohen Preis mit sich. Ein Teil des Verständnisses der aus dieser brüderlichen Verbindung geborenen Emotionen besteht darin, mit den Konsequenzen umzugehen, die sie mit sich bringen. Wenn man einem Bruder in die Augen sehen kann und in dieser Person sein eigenes Spiegelbild sieht, erkennt man sich selbst nicht, wie andere einen sehen, sondern wie man wirklich ist. In ihren Handlungen und den Konsequenzen dieser Handlungen liegt ihr wahrer Charakter. In „The Scarlet Ibis“ erkunden zwei Brüder dieses Thema und all die tobenden Emotionen, die damit einhergehen. Durch eine üppige, lebhaft beschriebene Landschaft begeben sich diese beiden Jungen auf eine sinnlose Reise. Bittere Enttäuschung prallt auf intensiven Stolz in der klimatischen Szene, und nur ein Bruder entkommt mit dem Leben. Das Thema wird durch die direkte Charakterisierung des Protagonisten, Doodle, und ihre Interaktionen miteinander ausgedrückt, sowie durch den Standpunkt des Erzählers, der die komplexen Gefühle des Protagonisten und seine Sicht auf die Welt um ihn herum vermittelt, die beide einen starken Einfluss auf seine Handlungen haben. \nDie Handlungen des Protagonisten lassen sich alle durch eine Schlüssel-Emotion zusammenfassen: Stolz. Von der Zeit an, als er und sein kleiner Bruder, Doodle, das erste Mal zusammen ausgehen, bis zu ihrem letzten, schicksalhaften Ausflug, empfindet der Protagonist Groll gegenüber Doodle. Er wollte einen Bruder, dem er all seine weltlichen Fähigkeiten beibringen konnte, wie „...die Luft anhalten, laufen, springen oder die Ranken im Old Woman Swamp erklimmen...“ Er wollte einen Bruder, der die Rolle von „...jemandem, mit dem man zum Horsehead Landing rennen kann...und jemandem, mit dem man auf der obersten Gabel des großen Kiefernbaums hinter der Scheune sitzen kann...“ ausfüllen konnte. Offensichtlich sind diese Dinge angesichts Doodles Zustand unmöglich. Doodle wurde mit einem extrem schwachen Herzen geboren, was es unwahrscheinlich machte, dass er überhaupt überleben würde. Selbst dann war es fast unmöglich, dass er jemals an anstrengenden körperlichen Aktivitäten teilnehmen würde. Was für ein Schlag für den jungen Protagonisten, dessen Kopf mit wilden Fantasien gefüllt war, als all diese Träume in einem Augenblick zerplatzten. Tatsächlich wird gezeigt, dass er sogar etwas Wut gegenüber dem kleinen Kind hegt, da er sich daran erinnert, dass er begonnen hatte, darüber nachzudenken, ihn durch Ersticken mit einem Kissen zu töten. Was für ein Kind hätte die Geistesgegenwart, Kindermord in Betracht zu ziehen? Doch sein Herz schmilzt, als das kleine Kind ihn anlächelt. Eine so einfache Handlung gab dem Protagonisten solche Hoffnung! Dies zeigt, dass seine Überzeugung wahrscheinlich nicht sehr stark war. Im Hinterkopf hatte er eine instinktive Liebe zu seinem Bruder.\n\n**Translation back to English:**\n\n[REWRITE]\nThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond.

Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to.

In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results are repeatedly influenced by attention.\n\nTo process information, the brain must first store it. There are various types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. Initially, information is encoded. Each type of sensory input has specific encoding methods. For instance, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to the appearance of the printed word; phonemically, referring to the sound of the word; or semantically, referring to the meaning of the word. Once stored, information must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which holds information for about 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a specific series of neurons for a brief period. Information in long-term memory is thought to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\n\nThere are numerous models of how knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on how human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others on neurophysiology. The semantic network model suggests that there are nodes representing concepts, and these nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so forth.",

Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",

Der Teil Ihrer Geschichte, in dem Sie Ihre kleinen Schriftstellerflügel ausbreiten und abheben, alle mit Ihrer magnetischen, ja magischen Prosa verblüffen. Oder der Teil, in dem Ihre Leser einschlafen und/oder die \"Zurück\"-Taste drücken, während sie Ihren Namen verfluchen. Dr. Merlin ist bekannt dafür, ihren Monitor anzuschreien, wenn sie sich mitten in zu vielen Informationen wiederfindet, und das nicht einmal auf lustige Weise.\n\nExposition ist nicht Ihr Freund.\n\nMeine sanften Leser kennen bereits den grundlegenden Schreibtipp \"Zeigen, nicht erzählen\", aber Dr. Merlin stolpert immer noch in lange Textpassagen, in denen nichts passiert oder schlimmer noch, zu viel. Exposition ist der kleine Teufel, der auf Ihrer Schulter sitzt und sagt, man solle die Geschichte aus dem Weg räumen, um zu den guten Teilen zu gelangen (nicht zu verwechseln mit dem Teufel auf der anderen Schulter, der den Autor dazu drängt, ihrem Publikum jedes Detail der Kindheiten jedes Charakters zu erzählen).\n\nExposition bedeutet, dem Publikum zu erzählen, was passiert ist, typischerweise in einfacher Prosa. Im Film geschieht die Exposition, wenn ein Charakter einem anderen einen Informationskern wie \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" erzählt. In der Fiktion ist es der Autor, der erzählt.\n\nEin Beispiel ist angebracht. Während Sie eine Geschichte lesen, wird Ihnen gesagt, dass die Heldin ihren Geliebten an einem bestimmten Ort und zu einer bestimmten Zeit traf, dass sie in festlicher Weise heirateten und dass ihr Mann vor ihren Augen ermordet wurde. Sie würden nicht erwarten, dass dieser gesamte Ablauf zwei Seiten dauert, in denen sowohl er als auch sie jeweils nur zwei Zeilen Dialog bekommen. Sie würden erwarten, dass der Autor etwas Zeit auf den Charakter des Ehemanns verwendet, indem er durch seine Sprache und sein Verhalten zeigt, wie tief er seine Frau liebt, und Sie würden ebenso erwarten, dass die Heldin auf große und kleine Weise zeigt, wie sehr seine Präsenz ihr Leben verändert und bereichert hat (besonders wenn die Geschichte Ihnen später direkt sagt, dass dies der Fall war). Eine ordnungsgemäße Einführung in den Charakter des Ehemanns würde es Ihnen ermöglichen, sich emotional mit seinem Schicksal zu verbinden und Ihnen Einblick in den Charakter der Heldin zu geben: was sie in ihm sah, wie tief ihre Bindung war, Hinweise auf ihre Gedanken und Überzeugungen und Träume, die durch das Prisma seiner Augen reflektiert werden, und so weiter. Sie würden mit ihr um seinen Tod trauern und sich so stärker mit der Heldin selbst verbunden fühlen.\n\nKurz gesagt, Sie würden Fleisch auf dem einfachen Knochen der Geschichte erwarten: \"Sie trafen sich, sie heirateten, er starb.\"\n\nAls Schriftsteller müssen Sie dieses Fleisch liefern. (*sieht sich die Metapher an, seufzt, stürzt sich weiter*) Manchmal ist es verlockend, an bestimmten Dingen vorbeizueilen. Vielleicht führen Sie einen neuen Charakter ein und Sie wissen, dass er früher in der Luftwaffe war, jetzt der Nachtmanager einer Tankstelle ist, zweimal verheiratet war, keine Kinder hat, gerne am Wochenende angeln geht, heimlich davon träumt, eines Tages die Tankstelle zu besitzen und Eggs Benedict zum Frühstück hatte.\n\nBack to English:\n\nAh, exposition.

Or the part where your readers doze off and/or press the \"Back\" button while cursing your name. Dr. Merlin is known to yell at her monitor when she finds herself buried in too much information, and not even in a fun way.\n\nExposition is not your ally.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing advice, \"Show, don't tell,\" yet Dr. Merlin still stumbles into lengthy passages where nothing occurs or, worse, too much. Exposition is that little devil on your shoulder telling you to get the backstory out of the way to reach the good parts (not to be confused with the devil on the other shoulder urging the author to tell the audience every single detail of each character's childhood).\n\nExposition means narrating to the audience what transpired, usually in straightforward prose. In film, exposition occurs when one character dumps a load of information onto another, akin to \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, it's the author doing the telling.\n\nAn example is fitting. As you read a story, you're informed the heroine met her beloved at a certain place and time, they married in a grand fashion, and her husband was murdered before her eyes. You wouldn't expect this whole sequence to span two pages, during which both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each. You'd anticipate the author spending time on the husband's character, illustrating through his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you'd likewise expect the heroine to show, in both big and small ways, how much his presence transformed and enriched her life (especially if the story later outright states this was the case). A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally engaged with his fate and provide insights into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, the depth of their bond, clues about her thoughts, beliefs, and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so forth. You would grieve his death with her, thus becoming more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you'd expect substance on the simple storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to supply that substance. (*looks at metaphor, sighs, and continues*) Sometimes it's tempting to rush past certain details. Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, is now the night manager of a gas station, was married twice, has no kids, likes fishing on weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.\n\n[REWRITE]Ah, exposition.

    "transformed": "I watched two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first one, which was \"live,\" was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The main story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio, who had stabbed his wife. Her name wasn't mentioned, but his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot, and he looked quite sinister. They only spent about two minutes on this story as it was still unfolding. The only details they provided were that he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they devoted an appropriate amount of time to this story.\n\nThe second story was about the early morning shooting of 18-year-old Travis Buyers. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and was critically injured; there had been no arrests or suspects at the time. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed brief, and I think it might have been because he was a \"black\" man or it happened in a black neighborhood. I have noticed (for years now) that minorities are often overlooked when they are victims of crime. If a \"white\" child or adult is kidnapped, missing, or a victim of a crime, the media goes wild; but if it's a minority person, it's lucky if it even gets mentioned.\n\nThe next story was about a bullet hole found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were provided about where they thought the incident occurred. It was determined that a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter.\n\nThe next story was about the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The segment was a bit short, but they wanted to use it as a \"teaser\" to keep viewers tuned in.\n\nThey also covered a story about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus.

Ein ETF bietet Ihnen die Diversifikation eines Indexfonds und die Vorteile des Besitzes einzelner Aktien, wie die Möglichkeit, leer zu verkaufen, auf Marge zu kaufen und so wenig wie eine einzige Aktie in einer Transaktion zu erwerben. Obwohl diese Vorteile äußerst attraktiv sind, sind die Kostenquoten von ETFs weitaus niedriger als die eines durchschnittlichen Investmentfonds. Leider gibt es einige Nachteile, wie die Notwendigkeit, eine Provision für jeden Handel mit ETFs zu zahlen, genau wie bei einem Aktienauftrag. Ein weiterer Vorteil von ETFs ist die große Vielfalt an verfügbaren Fonds. Obwohl diese Vorteile klar dargelegt sind, ist es immer eine gute Übung für den klugen Finanzinvestor zu überprüfen, ob die angegebenen Vorteile, wie Diversifikation, tatsächlich existieren und in welchem Umfang sie vorhanden sind. Für diese Bemühung werden wir den ETF IHF untersuchen und ihn mit den zehn größten Positionen vergleichen, die den ETF ausmachen, um festzustellen, ob die Vorteile des Besitzes eines einzelnen ETFs den Vorteilen des Besitzes eines diversifizierten Portfolios der zehn Aktien nahekommen und ob es bessere Konfigurationen derselben Aktien gibt, die ein optimaleres Sharp-Verhältnis oder eine bessere Rendite bieten würden.\n\nUm den ETF zu bewerten, wäre es ziemlich unhandlich, jede Position einzubeziehen, daher haben wir beschlossen, nur die zehn größten Positionen einzubeziehen, die 63,58% aller Vermögenswerte im ETF ausmachen. Nachfolgend sind die zehn größten Positionen und der Prozentsatz der Gesamtvermögenswerte aufgeführt.\n\nUm eine Schätzung zu erhalten, wie gut diese zehn Aktien den ETF IHF insgesamt repräsentieren, können wir den aktuellen Prozentsatz der Vermögenswerte verwenden, normalisiert auf 100%, um die Beiträge jeder Aktie zu einem Portfolio-Beta und der Rendite zu berechnen, wenn das Portfolio vollständig aus diesen 10 Aktien im Verhältnis besteht, das der ETF durch seine Bestände festgelegt hat. Die Berechnungen von Beta und Rendite sind in der unten stehenden Tabelle enthalten.\n\nAus der obigen Tabelle geht hervor, dass die Rendite eines Portfolios, das nur die zehn größten Positionen enthält, um 6,11% höher ist als die des ETFs, was einer Steigerung der Renditen um 16% entspricht. Es ist auch ersichtlich, dass das Beta der zehn größten Positionen um 0,12 niedriger ist als das des gesamten ETFs. Aus den bisher erzielten Ergebnissen scheint es, dass ein Portfolio, das nur aus den zehn größten Positionen besteht, eine höhere Rendite mit einem niedrigeren Beta bieten könnte. Es besteht jedoch die Möglichkeit, dass die Mittel dieser beiden Portfolios statistisch nicht voneinander abweichen.\n\nUm zu bewerten, ob diese Portfolios statistisch unterschiedlich sind, wird die Standardabweichung jeder der zehn größten Aktien bestimmt und auf 100% normalisiert, um ihre akkumulierte Standardabweichung mit der des ETF IHF zu vergleichen.\n\n[REWRITE]An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a security designed to track an index, a commodity, or a basket of assets like an index fund but offers more flexibility and trades like a stock on an exchange.

That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car.

Das war etwas entmutigend, und es ist schwer zu sagen, warum das passiert sein könnte. Mit dem Beginn des Winters auf einem Campus in Neuengland gibt es eindeutig einen Rückgang der Personen, die entweder mit dem Fahrrad oder zu Fuß pendeln, was einen Teil des Rückgangs erklären könnte. Der Dezember markiert auch das Ende des Herbstsemesters, wenn alle sehr beschäftigt sind, ihre Schulaufgaben zu beenden, Noten zu verarbeiten und so weiter. Das Ausfüllen des Pendlerprotokolls könnte bei vielen einfach aus dem Blickfeld geraten sein. Außerdem bringt der Dezember die geschäftige Weihnachtszeit und die daraus resultierende einmonatige Pause für Studenten und Dozenten, während der viele überhaupt nicht auf den Campus kommen müssen. Die Kurse werden dann Ende Januar für das Frühjahrssemester wieder aufgenommen, was vielleicht auch ein Hinweis auf die geringe Anzahl von Protokollen in diesem Monat ist. Aber nichts davon erklärt wirklich die niedrige Anzahl der Einreichungen im Februar. Man könnte auch vermuten, dass jedes Projekt dieser Art anfangs einen Energieschub und Begeisterung hat, die dann auf natürliche Weise nachlassen könnten. Um diesem Trend entgegenzuwirken, haben wir die Carpool Challenge Week ins Leben gerufen, eine spezielle Blitzkampagne im März, um die Initiative wiederzubeleben, was zu einem Anstieg der Protokolleinreichungen in diesem Monat führte. Eine der Herausforderungen, die wir erlebten, war also, wie man das Projekt in Schwung hält, angesichts sowohl eines natürlichen Rückgangs des Engagements als auch speziell der Probleme mit Feiertags- und Semesterpausen, die in der Hochschulbildung auftreten. Eine weitere Herausforderung für dieses Projekt (oder jedes alternative Pendlerprojekt) ist die einfache Tatsache, dass Menschen die Freiheit, Unabhängigkeit und Flexibilität des Autofahrens genießen. Dies ist tief in unserer Kultur verwurzelt. Es ist daher unerlässlich, Anreize für die Nutzung alternativer Pendelmethoden zu bieten. Wir haben viele Preise in Form von Geschenkgutscheinen für lokale Restaurants, Cafés, Massagetherapeuten, die lokale unabhängige Buchhandlung und sogar einige größere nationale Kettenläden verteilt. Es wäre jedoch interessant gewesen zu sehen, wie sich einige noch größere Preise auf die Teilnahme ausgewirkt hätten – wie zum Beispiel die Verlosung eines schönen Fahrrads, Hybridautos oder Elektroautos. Dies hätte auch dazu beitragen können, den Rückgang des Engagements zu bekämpfen, den das Projekt erlebte. Die Art der Preise änderte sich im Verlauf des Projekts nicht wirklich. Wenn die Preise jedoch im Laufe des Projekts im Wert gestiegen wären, hätte das vielleicht geholfen. Die Geschenkkarten schienen zu Beginn des Projekts mehr als ausreichend zu sein, aber wenn wir im Dezember die Hinzufügung von ein paar Fahrrädern und dann im Januar die Hinzufügung eines Hybrid- oder Elektroautos angekündigt hätten, kann man nur vermuten, dass die Teilnahme und das Engagement gestiegen wären, anstatt abzunehmen.\n\n[REWRITE]Referring to Figure 17, there was a sharp decline in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project.

Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis.

It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story.

    "raw_output": "In der Bibliothek der frühen Edison-Filme der Library of Congress entschied ich mich, alle Trickfilme anzusehen, von denen es fünfzehn von 1895 bis 1901 gab. Diese Filme nutzen im Allgemeinen kreative Bearbeitung, um Illusionen zu erzeugen. Meine Filmstudie konzentrierte sich im Wesentlichen darauf, die Poetik der meisten Trickfilme zu beschreiben und die evolutionären Besonderheiten in einigen der späteren Filme zu untersuchen. Größtenteils ist der Trickfilm um die Jahrhundertwende bühnengebunden, innerhalb eines frontalen Proszeniums komponiert, zeigt keine Kamerabewegung, verwendet lange und mittlere Aufnahmen und hält sich an die strikte Methode ein Schuss = ein Film. Es gibt jedoch einige Filme zu Beginn des zwanzigsten Jahrhunderts, die es wagen, diese Richtlinien zu brechen, indem sie Aspekte wie mehrere Aufnahmen einführen.\n\nEines der auffälligsten Merkmale, die die Trickfilme gemeinsam haben, ist ihre Aufnahme in einem Innenraum innerhalb des Rahmens eines frontalen Proszeniums. Die Kamera bewegt sich nicht aus ihrer Proszeniumsposition, um Figuren oder Objekte zu folgen. Diese Komposition war in frühen Filmen sehr verbreitet und stammt aus dem Theater und, bei Trickfilmen, aus Vaudeville- und Zauberaufführungen. Eine der Einschränkungen bei der Verwendung der Bühne ist, dass sich Figuren in Trickfilmen im Allgemeinen nur seitwärts bewegen und nicht auf die Kamera zu oder von ihr weg gehen. Nehmen Sie zum Beispiel die Aktion im Film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). Die Schauspieler treten von der rechten Seite ein und bewegen sich entlang der horizontalen Achse hin und her. Selbst wenn sie aus dem Bild gehen, folgt die Kamera ihnen nicht.\n\nDer frontale Proszeniumstil der Komposition bedeutet auch, dass Aufnahmen dazu neigen, lange Aufnahmen zu sein und seltener mittlere Aufnahmen. Nahaufnahmen werden in keinem der Trickfilme aus dem Edison-Katalog verwendet. Dies entlehnt sich der Theater- und Vaudeville-Tradition, bei der das Publikum die gesamte Aufführung zu jeder Zeit sehen würde, eingerahmt durch die Grenzen der Bühne. Wie in den meisten frühen Filmen bewegen sich die Schauspieler nicht vom Mittelgrund zur Kamera, sodass Nahaufnahmen nie vorkommen.\n\nIm Allgemeinen folgen die meisten frühen Trickfilme dem Muster, dass eine konzeptionelle Aufnahme einem Film entspricht. Dies begrenzt die Länge der meisten Trickfilme auf etwa eine Minute oder weniger, je nach verwendeten Bildern pro Sekunde. Es begrenzt auch die dramatische oder narrative Nutzung der Trickfilme; die meisten konzentrieren sich auf kurze, vaudevilleartige Tricks wie Magie, Verschwinden und Wechselakte mit wenig Geschichte. Beachten Sie jedoch, dass in einem Trickfilm eine konzeptionelle Aufnahme in den Augen des Betrachters nicht wirklich einer physischen Aufnahme entspricht. Ein einzelner „Schuss“ kann tatsächlich mehrere sein, die zusammengefügt werden, um die Illusion des Erscheinens oder Verschwindens zu erzeugen. Schauen Sie genau auf The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), einen der früheren Trickfilme. Eine gründlichere Inspektion zeigt den Moment, in dem die physische Aufnahme mit Marys abgetrenntem „Kopf“ beginnt, obwohl der gesamte Film konzeptionell eine Aufnahme für den Betrachter ist.\n\n[REWRITE]While exploring the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I chose to watch all the trick films, which numbered fifteen from 1895 to 1901.

Generally, the trick film at the turn of the century is stage-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, shows no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film method. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these rules by introducing elements like multiple shots.\n\nOne of the most noticeable features that trick films share is their shooting in an interior setting within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films and has its roots in theater, and for trick films, in vaudeville and magic acts. One limitation inherent in using the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side and do not walk toward or away from the camera. Consider, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even when they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-ups are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This is borrowed from theater and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the stage's borders. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\n\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative use of the trick films; most focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. However, note that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer's eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single \"shot\" may actually consist of several joined together to create the illusion of appearing or disappearing. Look closely at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary's severed \"head\" begins, even though the entire film is conceptually one shot to the viewer.",

He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society.

    "original": "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",

Der Begriff Supply-Chain-Management wurde 1982 von Keith Oliver, einem Berater, geprägt. Keith Oliver beschrieb den gesamten Prozess der Planung, Implementierung und Steuerung dessen, was in der Lieferkette geschieht, um die Bedürfnisse der Kunden schnell und effizient zu erfüllen. Es gibt sechs Schlüsselelemente in einer Lieferkette: Produktion, Versorgung, Inventar, Standort, Transport und Information. Geschäftsmanager nutzen diese sechs Schlüsselelemente, um den besten Kundenservice zu bieten.\n\nProduktion ist der erste Schritt im Lieferkettenprozess. Produktion bildet die Grundlage für den gesamten Lieferkettenprozess. Die Produktionsstufe umreißt, wann, warum, wo und wie alles produziert wird. Manager müssen wissen, was Kunden wollen. Damit Manager wissen, was Kunden wollen, können sie den Markt beobachten. Der Markt ist der größte Indikator, um zu entscheiden, was die Kundenanforderungen sind. Sobald Manager den Markt analysiert und die Kundennachfrage verstanden haben, sind sie bereit zu entscheiden, welche Produkte produziert werden sollen und wie viele dieser Produkte hergestellt werden sollten. Nachdem das Management entschieden hat, was produziert wird und wie viel, sind sie bereit zu entscheiden, wo die Produkte produziert werden sollen und welches Werk am besten für Volumen und Qualität der Ware geeignet ist, wobei die Kundennachfrage und Zufriedenheit berücksichtigt werden müssen. Nachdem der Produktionsstandort der Produkte festgelegt wurde, liegt der nächste Schwerpunkt der Manager auf der Planung der Arbeitsbelastung und der Wartung der Ausrüstung. Produktion ist ein sehr wichtiger Schritt im Lieferkettenprozess. Jedes Detail ist während des gesamten Prozesses entscheidend. Wenn nicht jedes Detail entsprechend geplant wird, kann dies das Unternehmen auf lange Sicht viel Zeit und Geld kosten. Zum Beispiel habe ich früher bei Wal-Mart und Target Einzelhandelsgeschäften gearbeitet. Beide Unternehmen haben ein Design, ein Heft und einen Prozess für jedes Geschäftselement. Es gibt ein gestaltetes Layout, wie die Uniform eines Mitarbeiters aussehen sollte, bis hin zum Empfang von Sendungen von Lastwagen. Klar umrissene Prozesse ermöglichen es einem Unternehmen, reibungslos zu arbeiten, ohne Verwirrung über Richtung und Erwartungen.\n\nDas zweite Schlüsselelement im Supply-Chain-Management ist die Versorgung. Versorgung wird definiert als die strategischen Entscheidungen, die getroffen werden sollten, um die Kernfähigkeiten einer Einrichtung zu bestimmen, und Outsourcing-Partnerschaften sollten aus diesen Entscheidungen hervorgehen. Ein Unternehmen kann viele verschiedene Produktionsabteilungen für ein einzelnes Produkt haben. Alle Abteilungen bestehen aus unterschiedlicher Ausrüstung, Arbeitern und Spezialitäten. Der Manager muss entscheiden, welche Abteilung am besten für die verschiedenen Prozesse des Produkts geeignet ist. Das Management kann auch entscheiden, die Arbeit an andere Unternehmen auszulagern. Der Hauptgrund, warum ein Manager die Arbeit an Unternehmen auslagern würde, besteht darin, Geschwindigkeit zu schaffen. Geschwindigkeit ist die Fähigkeit, Qualität und Flexibilität bereitzustellen und gleichzeitig die Kosten zu senken oder auf niedrigem Niveau zu halten.\n\n[REWRITE]Supply chain management encompasses the flow of processes to move goods from the customer order through raw materials, supply, production, and distribution to the customer.

Zwei Romane, die als viktorianisch gelten, aber von dieser Tradition abweichen, sind \"Oliver Twist\" und \"Wuthering Heights\". Beide Romane verwenden ein Element des Geheimnisses und eine Vorliebe für das Bizarre, was für Romane dieser Epoche untypisch ist, und stärken dadurch die Figuren in jedem Werk, indem sie Einblicke in ihre Motive und Emotionen geben.\n\n„Und nun drängten sich Scharen verwirrender und verwirrender Gedanken in seinen Geist. Er schien immer noch zwischen Sikes und Crackit zu gehen, die sich wütend stritten: denn die Worte, die sie sagten, klangen in seinen Ohren; und als er seine eigene Aufmerksamkeit ergriff, … fand er heraus, dass er mit ihnen sprach…. Plötzlich schreckte er bei dem Knall von Feuerwaffen zurück; und laute Schreie und Rufe erhoben sich in die Luft; Lichter funkelten vor seinen Augen, und alles war Lärm und Tumult, als ihn eine unsichtbare Hand hastig forttrug. Durch all diese schnellen Visionen zog sich ein undefiniertes, unruhiges Bewusstsein von Schmerz, das ihn unaufhörlich ermüdete und quälte.“ (Dickens, 220)\n\nDie beiden Romane nutzen dieses Geheimnis oft durch Traumsequenzen oder traumähnliche Zustände, obwohl der Inhalt und die Funktion in jedem speziellen Fall variieren. In \"Oliver Twist\" offenbaren diese seltsamen Ereignisse oft Einblicke in Olivers innere Schichten, was ihm Schmerzen bereitet und sein Bewusstsein über die wahre Natur der Dinge, die um ihn herum geschehen. Als das Schießen auf Oliver schließlich in Kapitel 28 erneut betrachtet wird, erlebt er das Schießen lebhaft nach, als ob in einem Traum, während er um Hilfe ringt. Die Passage betont den Mangel an Kontrolle, den Oliver über die ablaufenden Ereignisse hatte, sowie die schlimme Lage, in der sich seine Gesundheit befand, was durch Olivers Halluzinationen von Sikes und Crackit stark präsent war. Das Schießen selbst überwältigt ihn, alle seine Sinne sind betäubt, da er die „unsichtbare Hand“, die ihn fortträgt, nicht bemerkt; er erlebt seine Verzweiflung erneut, entfernt vom Schock des Schmerzes, da der Schmerz nun konstant ist und eher mit Angst als mit Überraschung verbunden ist. Da Oliver überwältigt ist, stellt sich die Frage, wessen Wille sein Unglück herbeigeführt hat, da es sicherlich nicht sein eigener war. Dieses Schießen verstärkt die Vorstellung, dass Oliver kaum Kontrolle über irgendetwas hat, da er sich nicht einmal dazu bringen kann, zu versuchen, die Kontrolle über den Ausgang eines Ereignisses zu erlangen, selbst wenn sein Leben in Gefahr ist. Ein wachsendes Gefühl der Niederlage in Oliver wird durch diese Auswahl ebenfalls angedeutet, als hätte der alte Fagin begonnen, ihn zu brechen und ihn dazu zu zwingen, diese Verzweiflung zu akzeptieren, was seine Fähigkeit zu reagieren beeinflusst. Denn ansonsten kann angenommen werden, dass Oliver zumindest einen gewissen Versuch unternommen hätte, allein schon um seiner selbst willen.\n\n„Der Tag verging – Tag!

    "raw_output": "Sure, here is the German translation and back to English:\n\nGerman Translation:\nVor ein paar Jahren arbeitete ich in einem Nachmittagsprogramm, in dem ich Grundschüler betreute. Ich tat mein Bestes, um ihnen in den Fächern zu helfen, in denen sie Schwierigkeiten hatten, aber meine Stärken lagen in Englisch und Lesen. Einer der Lehrer bat mich, einem kleinen Jungen namens Adrian zu helfen (ich glaube, er war in der dritten oder vierten Klasse), der große Probleme beim Lesen hatte. Mir wurde klar, dass etwas nicht stimmte; er hatte die seltsamsten Probleme. Einige Buchstaben konnte er perfekt aussprechen, andere überhaupt nicht, es war das merkwürdigste. Er war lateinamerikanischer Abstammung, dessen war ich mir sicher, aber der Junge sprach perfektes Englisch. Wir kämpften weiter, bis ich eines Tages seine Mutter traf. Ich half, ein paar Kinder zu betreuen (aus Mangel an einem besseren Wort), während der Rest der Nachmittagsgruppe auf einem Ausflug war, als seine Mutter hereinkam. Seine Mutter sprach kein Wort Englisch, nur Spanisch. Mit meinem sehr schlechten Spanisch (ich lernte es gerade erst), schafften wir es, zu kommunizieren. Aber dann traf es mich wie ein Schlag: Adrian konnte gut lesen, er kannte nur das englische Alphabet nicht sehr gut. Ich weiß nicht, ob diese Erkenntnis ihm jemals viel geholfen hat, aber ich hoffe, dass es ihm jetzt besser geht.\n\nIch erzähle diese Geschichte, um das Problem der Sprachbarriere in Schulen anzusprechen, besonders hier in Kalifornien. Ich erzähle sie auch, um zu beweisen, dass es nicht immer so offensichtlich ist, wie wir denken. Selbst für ein Kind, das perfekt Englisch spricht, kann das Lesen immer noch ein großes Hindernis sein. Ich denke, jeder kann zustimmen, dass dieses Problem existiert, also was tun wir? In Adrians Fall war die Lösung ziemlich einfach: Nachhilfe im englischen Lesen, besonders im Alphabet und der Aussprache. Aber für die vielen Kinder, die kaum Englisch sprechen, ist die Lösung viel komplexer. Es gibt keine einzige Antwort. Das zweisprachige System, das Eintauchen in den Hauptstrom, private Nachhilfelehrer, ESL-Klassen, keines dieser Dinge allein wird dieses Problem beheben. Der Schlüssel liegt darin, all dies zu kombinieren!\n\nZunächst einmal ist das zweisprachige System eine großartige Idee. Nicht nur für Kinder, deren Muttersprache Spanisch ist, sondern für alle Kinder. „Kinder in zweisprachigen Bildungsprogrammen übertreffen ihre Altersgenossen akademisch.“ Es gibt viel Angst um diese Idee, dass es eine Verschwendung von Ressourcen ist und dass die Mehrheit der Kinder in den Schulen keinen Nutzen daraus ziehen wird. Aber das ist falsch. Wenn wir solche Programme als Regel und nicht als Ausnahme im Klassenzimmer anwenden würden, würden alle Kinder davon profitieren. Wie gehen wir das jedoch an? Müssen wir verlangen, dass alle Lehrer zweisprachig sind? Nein. Das wäre unvernünftig und etwas unrealistisch. Ich denke jedoch, dass es keinen Grund gibt, warum wir nicht spezielle Hilfskräfte, Tutoren oder wie auch immer man sie nennen möchte, haben können, die zweisprachig sind.\n\nBack to English Translation:\nA few years ago, I worked in an after-school program tutoring elementary students.

Here is the translation of the text to German, and then back to English:\n\nGerman Translation:\n\nVon der Zeit an, in der wir Kinder sind, wird den meisten von uns gesagt, dass es da draußen etwas gibt, das größer ist als wir, größer als wir begreifen können. Einige von uns werden in die Sonntagsschule geschickt, um darüber zu lernen, während andere in den Tempel gehen oder in sich selbst nach Antworten suchen. Viele von uns akzeptieren bereitwillig die Religionen, die uns von unseren Eltern überliefert wurden. Doch einige von uns lehnen sie rundweg ab und leugnen, dass es nichts über das Wissen in unserem eigenen persönlichen egozentrischen Universum hinaus geben kann. Wir mögen eine Wertstruktur übernehmen, um später unsere Meinung zu ändern und eine andere an ihre Stelle zu setzen. Welchen Weg wir auch wählen, wir reisen, um einen Teil von uns selbst durch unsere eigenen einzigartigen Perspektiven der Spiritualität zu definieren. Wir suchen nach einem Licht im Dunkeln, das uns aus den Schatten hinaus ins Sonnenlicht führt.\n\n\"Ein Kardinal\", sagte mein Vater, als ich ihn fragte, welche Vogelart seine Lieblingsvogelart sei. Wir saßen auf der Veranda unseres Hauses, hörten zu, wie der Regen auf das Blechdach über uns prasselte, während wir zusammen unsere Zigaretten rauchten. Die Regenrinnen leiteten das Wasser ab, das die Pflanzen am Rand der Veranda ertränkte. Er schaute hinaus in den Regen, ein Blick, der halb suchend, halb erinnernd schien. Er war in den letzten Monaten dünner geworden, und seine Kleidung hing schlaff von seinem Körper. Sein Haar war spärlicher geworden, als ich es in Erinnerung hatte. Er starrte immer noch hinaus in den Regen und vermied Augenkontakt. Ich fühlte mich allein, ängstlich und unfähig, mit meinem Vater darüber zu sprechen, wie sehr ich ihn vermissen würde, weil das Gespräch darüber es für uns beide nur realer machen würde. Ich umarmte ihn, setzte mich wieder hin, rückte meinen Stuhl ein wenig näher an seinen und schaute gemeinsam mit ihm in den fallenden Regen des Junidämmerung.\n\nMein Vater verstarb im Dezember desselben Jahres, fünf Tage nach meinem zweiundzwanzigsten Geburtstag. Die Chemo und Bestrahlung hatten das Leiden meines Vaters nicht gelindert, sondern ihn ein paar Monate über die Projektionen der Ärzte hinaus am Leben gehalten; welchen Wert es hatte, wenn er nur länger litt, konnte ich nicht definieren. Was für ein Gott würde so etwas tun, dachte ich bei mir. Allein in der Nacht sprach ich keine Gebete. Wenn Gott existierte, dachte ich, hatte er aufgehört, mir zuzuhören.\n\nIch hatte nicht zusehen wollen, wie er von diesem Leben in ein anderes überging. Also tat ich es nicht. Ich konnte nicht zusehen, wie das Leben, das mich erschaffen hatte, endete. Ich wollte meinen Vater so in Erinnerung behalten, wie er lebte, und nicht, wie er starb. Außerdem, ich kannte meinen Vater besser als sie, besser als seine Familie, und wusste, Dad würde nicht wollen, dass sein einziges Kind bei seinem Tod zusieht.

    "original": "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",

    "raw_output": "**Translation to German:**\n\nJohn Taylor von Caroline war ein früher und leidenschaftlicher Befürworter des Republikanismus. Obwohl er in erster Linie Landwirt war, machte gerade dieser Beruf zusammen mit seiner kurzen politischen Karriere ihn bekannt für sein Engagement und seine Offenheit in Fragen der persönlichen Freiheit und der Regierung. Seine Hingabe an ein agrarisches System bildete die Grundlage für fast alle seine Ansichten über die Regierung. Es war sein Versuch, das, was er als die höchste aller Karrieren ansah, zu bewahren und zu fördern, der seine Argumente über Souveränität, Verfassungsmäßigkeit und sogar das Justizsystem prägte.\n\nJohn Taylor glaubte, dass die Vereinigten Staaten eine großartige Gelegenheit hatten, ein ideales System zu schaffen, weil es keine einheimische Tradition gab, die die Schöpfer der Regierung behindern könnte, was die Etablierung eines Systems der Selbstregierung ermöglichte. Er glaubte fest an die natürlichen Rechte des Menschen und daran, dass sie alle voneinander abhängig sind – was bedeutet, dass, wenn eines verweigert wird, sie alle scheitern werden und der Wert der verbleibenden verringert wird. Diese Rechte sollten daher außerhalb der Reichweite der Regierung liegen. Er behauptete, dass das, was einige den \"Naturzustand\" nannten, bedeutete, dass diejenigen mit körperlicher Stärke und bösartiger Intelligenz profitierten, aber dass dies in einer Zivilisation nicht der Fall sein dürfe.\n\nUm diese ideale Gesellschaft zu schaffen, glaubte Taylor, dass eine Regierung geschaffen werden müsse, die das inhärente Gute und Böse im Menschen berücksichtigt. Taylor war in seinen Meinungen über eine dualistische Moral sehr streng. Er behauptete, dass „da die Regierung von Menschen ausgeübt wird, alle ihre Tugenden und Laster menschlich sein müssen“ (Ibid., S. 167). Er definierte gute Prinzipien als diejenigen, die Privateigentum schützen, die Landwirtschaft verbessern und den Kapitalismus entmutigen, und glaubte, dass eine Regierung, die auf guten Prinzipien gegründet ist, gerecht funktionieren würde, unabhängig von ihrer Verwaltung, die zwangsläufig von Gier und Eigennutz geleitet würde. Eigennutz, so glaubte er, sei des Menschen Motivation in allen Dingen, aber diese Eigenschaft werde nur als böse angesehen, wenn sie über die Schaffung einer Gesellschaft hinausführte, die auf dem Gemeinwohl basiert, hin zu Untersubgesellschaften, die auf Kosten anderer lebten. Eine gute Regierung war notwendig, um das natürliche Böse des Menschen zu bändigen, und selbst dann musste sie unter sorgfältiger Beobachtung stehen, um die Hinzufügung schlechter Prinzipien zu vermeiden.\n\nTaylor rief, wie viele andere strikte Republikaner seiner Zeit, zu einer strikten Auslegung der Verfassung auf. Er wollte eine äußerst begrenzte Bundesregierung, der nicht mehr Rechte oder Befugnisse zugestanden werden sollten, als ausdrücklich in der Verfassung angegeben waren. Er wusste, dass eine umfangreiche Bundesregierung teuer war und daher wahrscheinlich despotisch sein würde. Er glaubte jedoch, dass eine einfache, wörtliche Interpretation gefährlich sei und dass eine solche Methode ohne Bezug auf die Absicht der Verfasser leicht korrumpiert werden könnte. Noch mehr betrachtete er die Unabhängigkeitserklärung als die wahre Charta der Vereinigten Staaten, weil sie das Land expliziter als eine Gruppe souveräner Staaten beschreibt und nicht als eine Nation.\n\n**Translation back to English:**\n\n[REWRITE]\nJohn Taylor of Caroline was an early and passionate advocate of Republicanism.

Die National Institutes of Health erklären, dass ein Aspekt des Problems darin besteht, dass das Gehirn von Teenagern buchstäblich nicht bereit ist für die Gefahren des Fahrens. Auch die einfache Unerfahrenheit liegt im Kern des Problems. Diese Unerfahrenheit verursacht nicht nur mehr tödliche Unfälle, sondern auch eine höhere Rate an Fahrzeugüberschlägen, Geschwindigkeitsübertretungen und Abkommen von der Straße.  \nTeenager schneiden auch deutlich schlechter ab, wenn sie mit Gleichaltrigen reisen - was jeder mit einem Funken Verstand weiß, dass sie regelmäßig tun. Das Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center führte eine Studie durch, die die folgende Korrelation zeigte: zwischen dem Alter des Passagiers und der Anzahl der Verkehrsunfälle.  \nKalifornien und andere Staaten haben versucht, die Sicherheit von jugendlichen Fahrern zu erhöhen, indem sie vorübergehende vorläufige Lizenzen verlangen, die die Stunden begrenzen, in denen Teenager fahren dürfen, und andere Minderjährige als Passagiere verbieten.  \nAber vorläufige Führerscheine sind meiner Meinung nach nur Notlösungen. Das eigentliche Problem ist, dass die jüngsten Fahrer als Gruppe einfach nicht in der Lage sind, die Risiken und Verantwortungen angemessen zu bewältigen, wie alle statistischen Marker zeigen. Der Psychologe Marvin Zuckerman glaubt, dass sogar 18 Jahre zu jung für einen normalen Führerschein sind. USA Today berichtet, dass Zuckerman Forschungen durchgeführt hat, die darauf hindeuten, dass es unter 19- bis 20-Jährigen ein gemeinsames Verlangen gibt, Risiken allein für den Nervenkitzel einzugehen. Es macht also Sinn, das Fahren zumindest so lange zu verzögern, bis die Tendenz, Nervenkitzel zu suchen, nachlässt. Wenn wir weiterhin jungen Teenagern Führerscheine ausstellen, werden wir nicht nur weiterhin tödliche Unfälle erleben, sondern die Zahl der Todesopfer wird in den nächsten Jahren wahrscheinlich erschreckende Ausmaße erreichen. Bis 2010 werden die Babys der Babyboomer berechtigt sein, zu fahren, und Millionen neuer jugendlicher Fahrer werden bereit sein, auf die Straße zu gehen.  \nDie Gesetzgebung zu diesem Thema wäre relativ einfach. Schulen könnten weiterhin Fahrunterrichtsklassen anbieten, um den Lernprozess für zukünftige Fahrer zu beginnen, aber niemand unter 18 Jahren dürfte ein Kraftfahrzeug führen. Eine vorläufige Erlaubnis könnte weiterhin erteilt werden, bevor eine vollständige Fahrerlaubnis gewährt wird, und eine bestimmte Anzahl praktischer Fahrstunden wäre weiterhin erforderlich. Die spezifische Anzahl erforderlicher Stunden könnte auf der Anzahl der Stunden basieren, die bereits in den meisten Staaten erforderlich sind (in Kalifornien beispielsweise sind es derzeit 6 Stunden praktisches Fahrtraining und 50 Stunden Übung mit einem Erwachsenen). Da die tödlichen Statistiken für jugendliche Fahrer aus einem Querschnitt aller Staaten stammen, wäre eine einheitliche, nationale Gesetzgebung zu diesem Thema ein vernünftiges und meiner Meinung nach wirksames Mittel, um Jugendliche im ganzen Land zu schützen.  \nDie von mir vorgeschlagene Gesetzgebung ist keineswegs eine neue Idee.\n\n[REWRITE]Teenagers are dying behind the wheel.

    "original": "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",

Anschließend wird die Diagnose erklärt, einschließlich typischer Merkmale oder \"Warnsignale\". Schließlich schließt der Artikel mit Möglichkeiten ab, wie ein Lehrer in einem integrierten Klassenzimmer einem Schüler mit CAPD helfen kann.\n\nZentrale auditive Verarbeitungsstörung (CAPD) oder auditive Verarbeitungsstörung (APD) \"bezieht sich auf die Effizienz und Effektivität, mit der das zentrale Nervensystem (ZNS) auditive Informationen nutzt. Eng definiert bezieht sich (C)AP auf die Wahrnehmungsverarbeitung von auditiven Informationen im ZNS und die neurobiologische Aktivität, die dieser Verarbeitung zugrunde liegt und elektrophysiologische auditive Potenziale hervorruft\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), was bedeutet, dass es sich um eine Störung handelt, bei der das zentrale Nervensystem (d.h. das Gehirn) Gehörtes nicht richtig verarbeiten kann. Menschen mit CAPD können normal hören und gelten daher nicht als \"hörgeschädigt\"; vielmehr funktioniert der Bereich des Gehirns, der das Gehörte übersetzt, Wörter trennt oder Gespräche von Hintergrundgeräuschen unterscheidet, nicht so, wie er normalerweise sollte.\n\nDie früheste Erwähnung der Störung, die zu CAPD wurde, stammt aus den Mitte der 1950er Jahre, damals \"auditive Imperzeption\" genannt (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), als Forscher Kinder mit kommunikativen Störungen untersuchten. Das italienische Forscherteam Bocca, Calearo und Cassinari begann 1954, Tests für diese Kinder zu entwickeln; 1961 führte Kimura \"dichotische Tests ein und formulierte ein Modell zur Erklärung der Physiologie des CANS, das der dichotischen Wahrnehmung zugrunde liegt\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Eine nationale Konferenz fand 1977 statt, die die Forschung zu Kindern mit CAPD stimulierte.\n\nCAPD zeigt sich auf verschiedene Weise: Die betroffene Person kann möglicherweise nicht lokalisieren oder hören, woher ein Geräusch kommt; sie hat möglicherweise Schwierigkeiten, zwischen zwei oder mehr \"akustischen Ereignissen\" (Geräuschvorkommnissen) zu unterscheiden; sie kann möglicherweise keine Klangmuster erkennen; sie kann Veränderungen in der Sprache (wie Sarkasmus durch Tonveränderung) nicht wahrnehmen; ein Geräusch kann durch ein nachfolgendes Geräusch blockiert werden; sie hat möglicherweise nicht die Fähigkeit, Klanghinweise zu synthetisieren (das heißt, sie in einer bedeutungsvollen Weise zu interpretieren, auf die sie dann reagieren kann); und sie kann möglicherweise nicht die Reihenfolge bestimmen, in der auditive Informationen präsentiert werden (Ferre).\n\nUm CAPD zu diagnostizieren, muss der Patient mit einer \"systematischen Beobachtung des Hörverhaltens und/oder der Leistung bei Tests der auditiven Funktion\" untersucht werden, was von \"Audiologen, SLPs, Psychologen und anderen unter Verwendung einer Vielzahl von Maßnahmen, die auditive Fähigkeiten bewerten\", durchgeführt werden kann (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Dies kann Fragebögen und Umfragen, die Beobachtung von auditiven Verhaltensweisen, einschließlich der Reaktion des Patienten auf bestimmte Reize, umfassen. Derzeit gibt es kein Werkzeug oder Test, der konsequent mit einer hohen Erfolgsrate zur Diagnose verwendet wird, und es ist keine Ursache für die Störung bekannt. Viele der verwendeten Tests konfrontieren den Patienten mit mehreren gleichzeitigen auditiven Reizen und fordern ihn dann auf, bestimmte Elemente wie eine Reihe von Wörtern oder Zahlen zu unterscheiden. Fortgeschrittenere Tests beinhalten die Aufzeichnung akustischer Signale im Ohr und die Messung der Reaktionen auf diese Signale.\n\n[REWRITE]This article explores three aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). It begins with a brief definition of the disorder. Then, it explains the diagnosis process, highlighting typical characteristics or \"red flags.\" Finally, the article discusses how a teacher in an inclusive classroom can support a student with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), refers to how efficiently and effectively the central nervous system (CNS) processes auditory information.

Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009.

Werte, die ich in das Feld der Sozialarbeit einbringen kann, umfassen Folgendes: Dienst, Respekt, ethische Natur, das Engagement, Beziehungen zwischen anderen zu verbessern und mich beruflich weiterzuentwickeln, um in meinem Bereich kompetent zu bleiben. Diese Kernwerte sind nicht nur für Sozialarbeiter wichtig; sie sind mir persönlich wichtig.\n\nIch wollte immer anderen helfen, aber ich war unsicher über den Karriereweg, den ich einschlagen wollte. Während meiner Jahre in der Highschool und im College sah ich viele Menschen, die ihre Probleme in der Verleugnung flohen, und einige benutzten Bewältigungsmechanismen, die weniger ideal waren. Aufgrund der Situationen, die ich erlebt habe, entschied ich mich, ein Bachelor-Studium in Psychologie zu verfolgen. Noch unsicher über einen Karriereweg, entschied ich mich, nach meinem Abschluss am Piedmont College im Jahr 2009 eine Pause einzulegen. Eines Tages in diesem Sommer besuchte ich eine Freundin, die mir einen sechzehnjährigen Jungen vorstellte, der nervös auf ihrem Sofa saß. Sie erklärte mir, warum er zu Besuch war: um seinen missbrauchenden Eltern zu entkommen. Am nächsten Tag erfuhr ich, dass er die Polizei zur Wohnung seiner Eltern gerufen hatte. Um zu sehen, ob ich in irgendeiner Weise helfen konnte, fuhr ich zu seinem Elternhaus. Dort angekommen, erklärte ich der Polizei privat meine Bedenken und sagte ihnen, dass ich gerade mit einem Abschluss in Psychologie vom Piedmont College graduiert hatte. Die Polizei bat mich, mit den Eltern zu sprechen, da das Gesetz für den Teenager nichts tun konnte. Als ich die Eltern nach der Situation befragte, schienen sie nervös und benutzten Ausreden, um das \"manipulative\" Verhalten ihres Sohnes zu beschreiben, weil er externe Quellen einbezog, um \"einfache\" Streitigkeiten zu lösen. Nach dieser besonderen Erfahrung begann ich ernsthaft, eine Karriere in der Sozialarbeit in Betracht zu ziehen, um Kindern bei \"einfachen\" Streitigkeiten unter Familienmitgliedern zu helfen.\n\nEin weiterer Wert, der für das Gebiet der Sozialarbeit wichtig ist, ist soziale Gerechtigkeit. Als Gesellschaft behaupten wir, dass das Individuum wichtig ist, und wir betrauern diejenigen, die wir verloren haben. Das Konzept des \"Individuums\", das die Gesellschaft hält, ist mehr ein Anhänger archaischer Traditionen als tatsächliche Einzigartigkeit. Wenn die Gesellschaft also verlorene Individuen betrauert, warum streben wir dann danach, ähnlich wie \"alle anderen\" zu sein? Ich bin ein Individuum und genieße es nicht, mich selbst einzuschränken, um anderen ähnlich zu sein. Während meiner Jahre in der Highschool und im College protestierte ich, wann immer ich konnte, gegen soziale Ungerechtigkeit: indem ich meine Haare in unnatürlichen Farben färbte, Kleidung trug, die meiner Persönlichkeit entsprach, meine Ohren über das traditionelle Maß hinaus durchbohrte, meine Beteiligung an der GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance) erklärte, gegen Rassismus und Diskriminierung kämpfte, wann immer ich es sah, usw.

The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",

Die folgende Überprüfung der Insomnie untersucht diese Modelle und erklärt jedes ausgewählte Forschungselement, um die Modelle besser zu verstehen und zu erklären. Die Erläuterungen der Forschung und ihrer Ergebnisse werden dann kritisch analysiert, um ihre spezifischen Stärken und Schwächen zu benennen.\n\nEine Schlafstörung kann als primäre Schlafstörung, als Schlafstörung im Zusammenhang mit einer anderen psychischen Störung oder als Schlafstörung im Zusammenhang mit anderen Problemen charakterisiert werden. Die primären Schlafstörungen sind Dyssomnien oder Parasomnien, während Schlafstörungen im Zusammenhang mit einer anderen psychischen Störung mit einer Achse-I- oder Achse-II-Störung zusammenhängen. Andere Kategorien von Schlafstörungen können aufgrund medizinischer Komplikationen oder der Einnahme einer Substanz auftreten. Die Dyssomnien sind: Primäre Insomnie, Primäre Hypersomnie, Narkolepsie, Atembezogene Schlafstörung, Schlafstörung des zirkadianen Rhythmus und nicht näher bezeichnete Dyssomnie (NOS). Während die primäre Insomnie eine Komplikation bei ausreichendem oder anhaltendem Schlaf darstellt, ist die primäre Hypersomnie eine Schwierigkeit, wach zu bleiben, beide zumindest über einen Zeitraum von einem Monat. Narkolepsie beinhaltet Kataplexie und/oder automatisches REM. Während sich Dyssomnien auf das Einschlafen und Durchschlafen konzentrieren, sind Parasomnien Schlafstörungen, die mit Verhaltensauffälligkeiten und/oder physiologischen Vorkommnissen verbunden sind.

Neuronen im Hypothalamus, die Orexin enthalten, sind für die Regulierung von Schlaf und Wachheit verantwortlich.

Die Aktivierung des GABAA-Rezeptors induziert Reaktionen, die den Schlaf fördern. Wenn das Feuern gehemmt wird, kann dies die Angst verringern und den Schlaf fördern. Der GABAB-Agonist (Baclofen) erhöhte die Schlafzeit (Matsuki et al., 2009). Solche Ergebnisse deuten darauf hin, dass die Tiermodelle von Mäusen auf Studien am Menschen verallgemeinert werden können. Dies zeigt, dass es eine genetische und umweltbedingte Grundlage für den physischen GABAB-Rezeptor beim Menschen gibt. Ein Problem oder Fehlen dieses Rezeptors könnte die Fähigkeit einer Person, ohne Medikamente ausreichend zu schlafen, beeinträchtigen. Die soziokulturelle Implikation dieser Studie ist, dass, wenn der Phänotyp vererbt wurde, dies den Schlaf regulieren könnte und eine Veränderung des Rezeptors den Schlaf eines Individuums natürlich stören würde.

For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",

An alum just a bit older than me told me that not long ago, East Halls dorms were separated from the rest of the campus by large areas of unused land. Today, that space has been filled with sports fields, large new buildings like the new Creamery and health services building, and surrounded by apartments. As our campus keeps expanding, moving from place to place becomes more challenging. What’s the best solution to this mobility issue? On a college campus, it’s the bicycle.

A bowl of oatmeal and a bit of physical effort can take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus, just as far from the campus center as some dorms. The smartest choice I made this year was buying a bike. Every day, I have classes in the Thomas building, which is easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal quickly. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the most direct route to Thomas from my house, and it’s not always easy to travel on, whether by bike or not. There are benefits to walking too, but I’m too busy to walk. Without my bike, walking would be my only dependable way to get to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an additional 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours each week.

By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems.

It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case.

Die Menschen in dieser Welt schätzen die Gemeinschaft über das Individuum und werden von Anfang an darauf konditioniert, sofortiges Glück über alles andere zu suchen. Die Bürger werden als Figuren in einem größeren Spiel entlarvt, die sich einer Ideologie unterwerfen, die vom Weltkontrolleur vorgegeben wird. Betrachtet man das Werk durch die Linse des marxistischen Theismus, erkennt man die zugrunde liegenden Bedenken des Autors bezüglich der Entwicklung der genannten Systeme. Häufige Begriffe des Marxismus, wie Homogenität und Verdinglichung, unterstreichen die Idee, dass Huxleys Roman ein Kommentar zu den Mängeln der aufkommenden Wirtschaft seiner Zeit ist.\n\nDer Kapitalismus wird durch den Einsatz der marxistischen These des falschen Bewusstseins satirisiert. Im Wesentlichen wird der gewöhnlichen Bürgerschaft verwehrt, die wahren wirtschaftlichen Beziehungen zu anderen Klassen zu erkennen, da sie in erster Linie an ihrem eigenen Vorteil interessiert sind. Dies wird als Ergebnis der ideologischen Kontrolle des Proletariats und der einfachen Arbeiter angesehen, was durch die Konditionierung der Menschen in \"Schöne neue Welt\" deutlich wird. Die gewöhnlichen Klassen, Delta, Gamma usw., haben keinen eigenen Willen; durch Hypnopaedie wird das Verlangen zu konsumieren, auszugeben, zu schwelgen, über alles andere gestärkt. Dies wird, wie bereits erwähnt, vom Weltkontrolleur manipuliert. Hegemonie, im Wesentlichen die Idee, dass soziale Klassen von einer separaten Gruppe von Individuen vollständig dominiert werden, wird in diesem Fall offensichtlich genutzt. Die unteren Klassen sind sich der Manipulation nicht bewusst und 'kaufen' im wahrsten Sinne des Wortes eine Ideologie, die diese Struktur unterstützt (d. h. Kapitalismus und Konsumismus). Die oberen Klassen sind zwar mit der Fähigkeit geboren, sich dessen bewusst zu sein, tun aber nichts; nur wenige Alphas oder Betas, abgesehen von Charakteren wie Bernard, tun mehr als ihre Position zu akzeptieren. Tatsächlich sind die Interaktionen der sozialen Klassen, wie ausführlicher diskutiert wird, bedeutende Hinweise auf die wahrgenommene Unterdrückung durch den Kapitalismus.\n\nBeziehungen zwischen verschiedenen Individuen existieren in \"Schöne neue Welt\" nicht. Der Roman weigert sich scheinbar, die Charaktere zu unterscheiden - sie sind, auch unter den Hauptcharakteren, ohne Tiefe. Vielleicht schlägt Huxley vor, dass der Aufstieg von Technologie und Kapitalismus zusammen den Menschen ihres freien Willens und Ausdrucks berauben. Liebe existiert nicht, ebenso wenig wie die Extreme einer Emotion; vielmehr bleiben die Interaktionen oberflächlich, was deutlich durch die Bemerkungen der Männer über Frauen, hauptsächlich über ihr äußeres Erscheinungsbild (d. h. pneumatische Qualität), und die ungenierten Kommentare der Frauen über ihre Begegnungen dargestellt wird. Darüber hinaus deutet die Selbstzufriedenheit jeder gesellschaftlichen Klasse mit ihrem Status in der Hierarchie auf den sozioökonomischen Effekt des Kapitalismus hin. Ihr absolutes Gehorsam gegenüber ihrer Rolle in der Gemeinschaft ist ein Hinweis auf die marxistische Sichtweise des Proletariats, dem fälschlicherweise versichert wird, dass sie über allem anderen überlegen sind, solange sie weiterhin konsumieren, gehorchen und sich mit dem Rest ihrer Altersgenossen im Einklang befinden.\n\n[REWRITE]Aldous Huxley, in his novel \"Brave New World,\" critiques the looming threat of technology and the capitalist structure that is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia.

Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.

That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.

Eines der Hauptthemen der hitzigen Diskussionen im Kurs war, ob der Islam eine feindliche Religion ist oder nicht. Ich glaube, dass diese Frage heute relevanter ist als je zuvor. Rückblickend auf die Ereignisse seit dem 11. September habe ich persönlich beobachtet, wie die Massenmedien von einer feindlichen Sichtweise des Islam und der Extremisten zu einer extremen Form der Toleranz gegenüber dem Islam in Amerika übergegangen sind. Ich glaube nicht, dass wir 2001 jemals einen Präsidentschaftskandidaten mit dem Namen Borac Obama hätten haben können, der offensichtlich muslimische Wurzeln in seiner Familie hat.\n\nDie Biographie des Propheten ist für mich faszinierend, weil sie, soweit ich die Geschichte von Muhammad kenne, seinem Charakter widerspricht. Nach dem, was ich in der Vergangenheit wusste und gelernt hatte, dachte ich, dass Muhammad Menschen zwang, zum Islam zu konvertieren. Er würde Stämme erobern und sie dann zwingen, die Religion des Islam anzunehmen. Aber gemäß der Biographie wurde Muhammad als eine Art Märtyrer beschrieben, der missverstanden wurde und sich sogar anderen gegenüber demütigte. Danach kamen die Menschen nach und nach, um die „Wahrheit“ in seiner Lehre zu sehen und suchten ihn auf.\n\nEs gibt auch einige verblüffende Ähnlichkeiten zwischen dem Wirken von Jesus und den „Wundern“ von Muhammad. Das offensichtlichste ist, als er Hammelfleisch und Milch nahm und sie so vervielfältigte, dass es für vierzig Männer mehr als genug war. Diese Art des Schreibens lässt mich glauben, dass die Autoren wollten, dass Muhammad als der bescheidene Prophet wahrgenommen wird, der nichts beweisen musste, sondern einfach in Wahrheit und Wundern lebte. Diese Art von Trugschluss ist die schlimmste, weil sie das Wunder und das Leben von Jesus Christus herabsetzt. Für mich ist es, als würden sie stehlen und versuchen, sich das Leben und die Persönlichkeit von Jesus durch Muhammad anzueignen.\n\nEs gibt auch viele Geschichten in der Biographie, die es so erscheinen lassen, als sei ein Teil ihrer Absicht, Beweise für „Zeugen“ oder dafür zu liefern, wie Menschen „aus eigenem Antrieb“ zum Islam konvertierten. Das Problem ist jedoch, dass viele Geschichten mindestens aus dritter Hand stammen. Der Autor illustriert in der Geschichte, dass er von jemandem gehört hat, der von jemand anderem gehört hat usw. Das gefiel mir nicht, weil, obwohl ihre Idee war, dass es den Wahrheitsgehalt der Geschichten beweist, ich dachte, es minderte die Geschichten und machte sie umso verdächtiger erscheinen.\n\nIch denke, was mich an diesem Werk am meisten stört, ist, dass sie versuchen, Muhammad als einen göttlichen Mann zu erheben, der demütig, liebenswert, weise und sanft war. Aber die Geschichte widerspricht der Vorstellung, dass Muhammad ein sanfter und demütiger Mann war, und ich kann nicht anders, als zu überlegen, ob die Muslime heute die wahre Geschichte hinter Muhammads Aufstieg zur Macht kennen.\n\n[REWRITE]  \nAlmost four years ago, I took a course on Islam at CBC.

If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",

Betrachtet man diese Geschichte in groben Zügen, sieht man eine Tendenz, dass sich das Christentum immer weiter von seinem Ursprung entfernt. Es scheint, dass die heutige Welt ein wachsendes Bewusstsein und eine beispiellose progressive Tendenz zeigt. Während traditionelle Menschen bleiben und jegliches Denken über das hinaus, was ihnen beigebracht wurde, ablehnen werden, ist dieser Teil der Bevölkerung möglicherweise nicht einflussreich genug, um das Ganze zu beeinflussen. Unter Christen wird in den kommenden Jahren ein historisches Bewusstsein immens wachsen. Ein Verlangen wird sich ausbreiten, die Lehren, die im Laufe der Zeit in das Christentum eingeführt wurden, von der eigentlichen Absicht des Namensgebers der Religion zu unterscheiden. Es kann Jahrzehnte oder sogar Jahrhunderte dauern, aber das Ergebnis wird unvermeidlich sein: Es wird eine große Umkehrung im Trend der christlichen Geschichte geben. Es wird eine Rückkehr zu seiner ursprünglichen Form geben. Eine Bewegung wird an Zahl zunehmen, die Schichten von Lehren nacheinander entfernen wird, als ob die Uhr rückwärts zu laufen begann, bis nichts mehr übrig ist, außer einer Vorstellung dessen, was Jesus der Menschheit im Namen Gottes vorstellte, bevor andere Denker solche Ansprüche erhoben. Wenn dieser Trend die Vereinigten Staaten und Europa erfasst und Massen beeinflusst, die in seinem Gefolge so anbeten, als lebten wir zur Zeit Jesu und folgten nur seinen Ideen, wird die Kirche als Institution stark bleiben, um den Weg zu weisen. Da die theologische Uhr jedoch rückwärts gegangen ist, wird sich die extreme Vielfalt in der Christenheit in eine immer größere Einheitlichkeit des Glaubens und der Praxis umkehren. Zwischen Regionen, zwischen Konfessionen, zwischen allen Arten von Abteilungen werden wir anstelle von Unterschieden zunehmende Ähnlichkeiten sehen. Die Menschheitsgeschichte ist voller großer Umkehrungen. Ein Beispiel ist, wie Christen einst vom Römischen Reich verfolgt, gemieden und getötet wurden. Aber später wurde dieses Reich zu einer christlichen Institution. Unser Land hat sich von der Sklaverei der Afroamerikaner zur afroamerikanischen Führung entwickelt. Die große Umkehrung, die in unserer Zukunft bevorsteht, wird sich im Bereich der christlichen Religion abspielen, die Geschichte auf der Suche nach der Quelle rückgängig machen und dabei die Vielfalt auflösen. Es ist entscheidend zu beachten, dass ein Teil dessen, was diesen Prozess möglich machen wird, eine Methode ist, die Worte Jesu als metaphorisch und nicht als wörtliche Aussagen zu lesen. Was ist also seit Jesu Lebzeiten passiert? Wenn wir weit genug in die Geschichte zurückblicken, finden wir nur das Judentum, den theologischen Anfang der christlichen Religion. Monotheismus, die Wahrnehmung einer göttlich offenbarten Religion und die Autorität der hebräischen Schriften standen im Kern der Religion, als die Römer 63 v. Chr. die Kontrolle über Jerusalem übernahmen. Die jüdische Bevölkerung teilte nicht einen Geist. Sie teilten sich in Sadduzäer, Pharisäer, Essener, Zeloten und eine Mehrheit von gewöhnlichen Menschen.\n\n[REWRITE]The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were quickly left behind as Christian thought evolved after his life.

    "transformed": "The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were quickly left behind as Christian thought evolved after his life. Looking at this history broadly, we see a trend of Christianity moving further away from its origins. Today's world seems to display a growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency. While traditionalists remain and may resist any thinking beyond what they were taught, this segment of the population may not be influential enough to affect the whole. Among Christians, historical awareness will grow significantly in the coming years. A desire will spread to separate the doctrines added to Christianity over time from the true intent of its namesake. It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable: a significant reversal in the trend of Christian history. There will be a return to its original form. A movement will grow that will strip away layers of doctrine, one by one, as if the clock were turning back, until only the conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God remains, before any other thinkers made such claims. When this trend spreads through the United States and Europe, influencing masses to worship as if we lived in the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way. However, as the theological clock moves backward, the extreme diversity within Christendom will reverse into more uniformity of belief and practice. Between regions, denominations, and divisions of all kinds, we will see increasing similarities instead of differences. Human history is full of great reversions. One example is how Christians were once persecuted, shunned, and killed by the Roman Empire, which later became a Christian institution. Our country has moved from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The great reversion coming in our future will play out in the sphere of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source and unraveling diversity in the process.

Sie wollen nur für sich selbst sorgen und ihr Leben so gut wie möglich gestalten, aber kümmern sich nie um jemanden, der unter ihnen steht. Der Dschungel zeigt dies auf viele Arten. Der offensichtlichste Bereich sind die Besitzer und Manager der großen Fabriken. Alles, was sie wollen, ist, ihre Unternehmen und Fabriken so groß und großartig wie möglich zu machen. Sie kümmern sich nicht um irgendjemanden oder irgendetwas, das ihnen im Weg steht oder das durch ihren Fortschritt verletzt wird. Laut Upton Sinclairs Werk: \"Die Linie der Gebäude stand scharf umrissen und schwarz gegen den Himmel; hier und da erhoben sich große Schornsteine aus der Masse, mit dem Strom von Rauch, der bis ans Ende der Welt zog.\" Sinclair versucht, ein Bild von dem großen Schaden zu zeichnen, den diese Verschmutzung verursacht. Er zeigt, dass die Besitzer keine Rücksicht auf irgendeine Person oder ein Tier nehmen, das verletzt werden könnte. Sie kümmern sich nicht um die großen Rauchschwaden, die aus den Fabriken quellen, oder um den Abfluss von Tierkot und Urin aus den Tausenden von Ställen in Packingtown. Die Besitzer und Manager kümmerten sich auch nicht um ihre Mitarbeiter, die sie reich machten. Sie würden alles tun, um einen zusätzlichen Dollar zu verdienen oder zu sparen: \"Von oben bis unten ist der Ort einfach ein brodelnder Kessel voller Eifersucht und Hass; es gibt keine Loyalität oder Anstand irgendwo darin, es gibt keinen Ort, an dem ein Mann gegen einen Dollar etwas wert ist.\" Sie zwingen ihre Mitarbeiter, schreckliche Stunden zu arbeiten, und ohne auch nur einen Tag Vorwarnung könnten sie eine Vielzahl von Menschen gleichzeitig entlassen, ohne Entschädigung oder Hilfe bei der Jobsuche. In der Zeit, in der \"Der Dschungel\" spielt, gab es nicht viele, wenn überhaupt, Gesetze oder Vorschriften zum Schutz der Sicherheit oder des Wohlbefindens der Arbeiter. Dies erlaubte es den Managern und Besitzern, sich wild auszutoben und ihre Mitarbeiter zu zwingen, den Fortschritt zu beschleunigen und unter schrecklichen Bedingungen zu arbeiten. Obwohl das Buch es nie direkt sagt, wurde von den Menschen, die in Packingtown lebten und sich zu Tode arbeiteten, einfach erwartet, dass sie mit den schrecklichen Bedingungen sowohl bei der Arbeit in den Fabriken als auch beim Leben in ihrer Umgebung zurechtkamen. Es gab keine Agenturen oder Organisationen, die Informationen oder Hilfe für die Arbeiter bereitstellten. Es gab Gewerkschaften, die gegründet wurden, aber diese richteten oft mehr Schaden an als Nutzen, da sie an den armen Arbeitern verdienten. Die Arbeiter wurden so schlecht behandelt und hatten keinen Ausweg aus dem System von Packingtown, dass sie als Sklaven beschrieben wurden: \"Hier ist eine Bevölkerung, niedrigklassig und meist fremd, die immer am Rande des Verhungerns hängt und von den Launen von Männern abhängt, die genauso brutal und skrupellos sind wie die ehemaligen Sklaventreiber; unter solchen Umständen ist Unmoral genauso unausweichlich und so weit verbreitet wie unter dem System der Sklaverei.\"\n\n**Translation back to English:**\n\nI believe that \"The Jungle\" demonstrates how people are naturally greedy and self-centered deep down.

Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking.

In „Dream-Land“ verwendet Poe in den Zeilen 6 und 56 den Begriff „Thule“, den Mabbott auf Vergil zurückführt. Vergil verwendete den Begriff in Bezug auf eine Insel nördlich von Britannien, die die Griechen als Rand der bekannten Welt betrachteten. Es ist sicher, dass Vergil den Begriff verwendete, jedoch gibt es eine aktuellere Quelle, der ebenfalls Anerkennung gebührt. Poe war sehr an deutschen Autoren interessiert. Dieses Zitat ist wichtig, da es zeigt, dass Poe mit dem Schreiben von Goethe vertraut war. Karl J. Arndt merkt in seinem Buch „Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon“ die Ähnlichkeit ihrer beiden Gedichte an und zieht den Schluss, dass Poe Goethe nachahmte. Der Oxford Companion to English Literature sagt, dass Goethe ein gefeierter Schriftsteller des poetischen Dramas Faust war, das in zwei Teilen veröffentlicht wurde: der erste 1808 und der zweite im Todesjahr Goethes 1832. Im poetischen Vers des zweiten Teils von Faust liegt ein kurzes Gedicht mit dem Titel „Der König von Thule“. Das Gedicht handelt von einem König, dessen Frau stirbt, nachdem sie ihm einen Kelch geschenkt hat. Nachdem seine Frau gestorben ist, beginnt er stark zu trinken und aus der Erinnerung an seine tote Königin zu weinen. Dann entscheidet er, dass es Zeit für ihn ist zu sterben, und gibt seinen Kindern seine Besitztümer, bis auf den Kelch. Er geht dann zu einer Klippe, wirft den Kelch ins Meer, schließt die Augen und stirbt. Das Wesen des Königs von Thule und die Beschreibung des Königs in Dream-Land sind sehr ähnlich, vielleicht ein düsterer Doppelgänger von Poes Verlust und seiner Trinkschwäche. Faust wurde 1842 auch von H. P. Grattan in ein romantisches Drama verwandelt, weniger als ein Jahr bevor Poe den Begriff Thule in „The Pit and the Pendulum“ verwendete. Poe erwähnt Thule zweimal in seinen gesammelten Schriften. Einmal bezieht sich Poe auf „ultima Thule“ in The Pit and the Pendulum, aber er verwendet diesen Ausdruck zweimal in „Dream-Land“ als Buchstützen für das Gedicht. „Der König von Thule“ und „Dream-Land“ können als Begleitstücke gelesen werden. In „Dream-Land“ sagt der Sprecher. Er beschreibt dann die Landschaft von Thule und wie sie dunkel und einsam ist, er wird von toten Freunden verfolgt und sieht eine schattierte Welt ohne Farbe. All diese Szenen würden in „Der König von Thule“ von Goethe gelesen werden, da er gerade seine Frau verloren hat, er einsam ist und seinen Willen zu herrschen oder sogar zu leben verloren hat. Das gesamte Gedicht ist eine Beschreibung, als wäre der Sprecher in Goethes Gedicht eingetreten. Goethe war ein bedeutender Autor, den Poe gekannt hätte, wenn nicht aus einem anderen Grund, dann wegen seines Respekts für Tennyson. Poe sagte dies, als er gefragt wurde, ob er Tennyson bewundere.

A judge is unlikely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages. To justify an award of punitive damages, a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant's actions were carried out with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result, as well as show that the conduct was despicable. Palmer could argue that Martin should have been aware of the probable harm of not cleaning a spill, as multiple D&D customers had been injured from slipping in the months before Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge, he still did not ensure the spill was cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable is less convincing but remains reasonable, given that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate measures to maintain the safety of his store. On October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne, an employee of D&D Markets, informed his manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne he was on a dinner break and \"didn't have time to deal with customer complaints.\" At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded in the same way. At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident, five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are considering whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damage claim.

Inzwischen hatte sie festgestellt, dass sie eher jemanden als etwas wollte. Doch hatte sie kein Interesse an Jungen. Einige hatten sich zu ihr hingezogen gefühlt und unbeholfene Versuche unternommen, das Unbeeindruckbare zu umwerben, aber niemand sprach sie an. Sie hinterfragte sich oft mit diesem seltsamen Gefühl und versuchte herauszufinden, was es sein könnte, das solch eine merkwürdige Sache bei einem Teenagermädchen verursachen könnte.

Also lebte sie ihr Leben weiter und hinterfragte ständig ihre Wünsche.\n\nEin Tag zu Hause war normalerweise eine friedliche Sache. Ihre Eltern waren gute und ruhige Menschen. Sie stritten nie miteinander und seltsamerweise waren Streitigkeiten mit ihrer Tochter sehr selten. Das Einzige, worüber sie jemals stritten, war, dass sie ihre Unabhängigkeit und freie Persönlichkeit behauptete. Sie war die Tochter eines sehr ruhigen Paares, aber sie konterte definitiv ihre Energien mit ihrer umfangreichen und spaßigen Persönlichkeit, was sie in Kombination mit der Tatsache, dass sie ein netter Mensch war, sehr sympathisch machte.\n\nHeute jedoch war kein ruhiger Tag.

Sie rannte in den Raum und begann in Panik zu geraten, während sie hektisch fragte: \"Mama?! Mama, was ist los?!\" Sie sah ihre Mutter auf dem Boden liegen, scheinbar vor Schmerzen, während sie immer wieder \"Aua\" in kurzen Atemzügen sagte. Die Tochter der Mutter rannte zu ihr und legte eine Hand auf sie, um Hilfe zu leisten. \"Autsch ... Süße, ich ... brauche dich, um mich ins Krankenhaus zu bringen.\" Die Worte waren gehetzt und gedrückt, und ihre Tochter konnte erkennen, dass sie große Schmerzen hatte. \"Okay Mama, sag mir nur, wo ich dich abholen kann.\" Ihre Mutter deutete mit den Händen, und in diesem Moment war die Heldin des Hauses sehr dankbar, dass sie Kurse belegt hatte, um sich zu stärken. Sie trug ihre Mutter zum Auto, legte sie auf dem Rücksitz hin und fuhr los.\n\nEin Besuch im Krankenhaus brachte den Geruch von Desinfektionsmitteln und Krankheit, durchzogen von Angst.

The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found.

Die aMed-Diät ist eine modifizierte Version der Med-Diät und zeichnet sich durch einen höheren Konsum von pflanzlichen Lebensmitteln, einschließlich pflanzlicher Proteine (ohne Kartoffeln, aber mit Früchten, Nüssen, Vollkornprodukten und Hülsenfrüchten), einfach ungesättigten Fettsäuren (im Vergleich zu gesättigten Fetten) und Fisch sowie einen geringeren Konsum von tierischen Produkten und gesättigten Fetten aus.

Mehr als 95 % der Krankenschwestern nahmen während des gesamten 20-jährigen Zeitraums weiterhin teil. FFQs wurden Validierungsstudien unterzogen. Berichte über CHD, tödliche CHD und Schlaganfall wurden durch Überprüfung von medizinischen oder Krankenhausakten, Autopsien oder Totenscheinen bestätigt.

Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",

Burma, auch bekannt als Myanmar, ist ein südostasiatisches Land, das von einer tyrannischen Militärjunta regiert wird, die 1962 durch einen Staatsstreich an die Macht kam. Im Jahr 2007 fanden eine Reihe von Straßenprotesten statt, die ersten öffentlichen Proteste seit einem Jahrzehnt. Diese Proteste, angeführt von einer großen Anzahl burmesischer Mönche, erhielten den Namen „Die Safran-Revolution“, benannt nach der Farbe der Roben, die die Mönche trugen. Nach den ersten Aufständen begann die breite Öffentlichkeit, sich für die Proteste zu interessieren, und während die burmesische Regierung den Mönchen zunächst widerwillig erlaubte, sich friedlich zu versammeln, eskalierte die Gewalt bald zu dem, was einige als regelrechten Krieg zwischen den Mönchen und der Militärjunta betrachteten, wobei das Militär aktiv Klöster im ganzen Land plünderte. Ausländische Journalisten wurden vor Ort zusammengetrieben und inhaftiert, wobei ein japanischer Fotojournalist namens Kenji Nagai am 27. September 2007 einfach deshalb getötet wurde, weil er an einem Straßenprotest teilnahm. Während die offizielle Zahl der Todesopfer bei 13 liegt, wird Oberst Hla Win, der einige Tage vor dem offiziellen Bericht aus der Armee übergelaufen war, mit den Worten zitiert: „In den letzten Tagen wurden viel mehr Menschen getötet, als Sie gehört haben. Die Leichen können auf mehrere Tausend geschätzt werden.“\n\nDas ist nichts Neues. Während dies einige der jüngsten Beispiele für Gräueltaten in unserer Welt sind, gibt es den Wunsch einer Regierung, Dissens zu unterdrücken und die vollständige Herrschaft über ihre Bürger zu behalten, solange es die Zivilisation gibt. Frühe römische Kaiser erklärten sich selbst als von den Göttern auserwählt, um über jeden Aspekt ihrer Gesellschaft die vollständige exekutive Herrschaft zu haben. Japanische Kaiser gelten tatsächlich als Götter, die in unsere Welt gesandt wurden, um ihr Volk durch die Erfindung von Motorola-Handys und Hara-Kiri zum Wohlstand zu führen, und unser derzeitiger Präsident, George W. Bush, hat wöchentliche Telefonkonferenzen mit Ted Haggard, dem Anführer der Stupid People Worldwide, einer Tochtergruppe der Republikanischen Partei.\n\nEinige der bekanntesten Beispiele für solche Handlungen sind Vorfälle wie der Protest am 4. Juni 1989 auf dem Tiananmen-Platz, bei dem sich Intellektuelle, Arbeitsaktivisten und Studenten versammelten, um gegen die autoritäre Herrschaft der Regierung zu protestieren. Die Zahl der Todesopfer in diesem speziellen Fall variiert stark, wobei offizielle Berichte der chinesischen Regierung 200-300 Tote angeben, während Berichte des chinesischen Roten Kreuzes zwischen 2.000-3.000 Tote erklären. Ein weiteres Beispiel ist der Völkermord in Ruanda in den 1990er Jahren, bei dem Hutu-Milizen, unterstützt von der ruandischen Regierung, systematisch alle Tutsi sowie politische Moderaten unabhängig von ihrem ethnischen Hintergrund töteten. Hitlers „Drittes Reich“, eine Periode, die sich über mehrere Jahre und mehrere Länder erstreckte, in der alle Personen jüdischen Hintergrunds zusammengetrieben und getötet wurden, ist ein weiteres extremes Beispiel.\n\n[REWRITE]Hitler is alive in Burma, the sign reads.\n\nEllen Page, the star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner holding a piece of cardboard above her head, the disturbing message written in Sharpie on her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian country governed by a tyrannical military junta that came to power in 1962 through a coup d'état. In 2007, a series of street protests took place, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests were dubbed \"The Saffron Revolution,\" named after the color of the robes the monks wore. After the initial uprisings, the general public began to take an interest in the protests, and while the Burmese government initially reluctantly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, the violence soon escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries across the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll stands at 13, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army a few days prior to the official report, is quoted as saying, \"Many more people have been killed in recent days than you've heard about. The bodies could be counted in several thousand.\"\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the latest examples of atrocities occurring in our world, a government's desire to suppress dissent and maintain complete control over its citizens has existed for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have full executive rule over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republican Party.\n\nSome of the most well-known examples of such actions include incidents like the June 4, 1989 protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular case varies widely, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead, while reports from the Chinese Red Cross claim between 2,000-3,000 dead. Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began systematically killing all Tutsis as well as political moderates, regardless of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler's 'Third Reich,' a period spanning several years and multiple countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example.[/REWRITE]",

    "raw_output": "Duke Ellingtons Vermächtnis im Jazz stammt zu einem großen Teil aus seiner Langlebigkeit und, in der Verlängerung, aus seinen kreativen Fähigkeiten, sein Orchester zu formen. Ellingtons Präsenz am Klavier ist in vielen der für diese Aufgabe ausgewählten Kompositionen subtil, aber als Komponist glänzte Ellington darin, reiche und komplexe Stücke zu schaffen, die die individuellen Fähigkeiten der Bandmitglieder zur Schau stellten. Ellington gestaltete den Rahmen, in dem ein Solist frei improvisieren konnte, und schrieb darüber hinaus straff orchestrierte Stücke und Phrasen, die den besonderen Stil der Bandmitglieder nutzten, um musikalische Ideen hervorzuheben. Dabei betonte er auch den Klang des Orchesters im Allgemeinen und schuf kohärente und originelle Klänge, die zu jedem Stück passten. Ellingtons Beherrschung des individuellen Klangs der Spieler und seiner Fähigkeit, sie in einem wachsenden Ensemble zusammenzuführen, ermöglichte es ihm, einige der innovativsten und brillantesten Stücke in der Jazzgeschichte zu schreiben.\n\nDas Grove Music Dictionary erwähnt im Zusammenhang mit Ellingtons Klang und Innovation Creole Love Call als Beispiel für die Verwendung der Stimme „als Jazzinstrument“ während seiner gesamten Karriere. Dies ist ein frühes Beispiel für Ellingtons Nutzung der Stimme, um Textur und Farbe hinzuzufügen, ohne durch Texte eingeschränkt zu sein. Creole Love Call demonstriert auch Ellingtons Fähigkeit, den Stil seiner Solisten zu ergänzen, was sich durch seine gesamte Karriere zieht. Dieses langsame, bedächtige Zwölf-Takt-Blues-Stück enthält sechs Chorusse, wie folgt:\n\nChor 1: Ruf und Antwort zwischen Stimme und Holzbläsern, wobei die Stimme glatt und melodisch beginnt und gegen Ende zu einem raueren Klang übergeht.  \nChor 2: Gedämpftes Trompetensolo, das die Grundmelodie elaboriert und mehrere erweiterte blaue Noten betont.  \nChor 3: Schwingendes Klarinettensolo in hoher Lage, begleitet von einer subtilen, synkopierten Klavierphrase.  \nChor 4: Die gesamte Band wiederholt den ersten Chor mit einem Ruf und Antwort zwischen Blech- und Holzbläsern.  \nChor 5: Der klimaktische Chor des Stücks, da die Holzbläser nun den Ruf und Antwort in hoher Lage beginnen, unterstützt durch synkopierte Stoppzeit von Blech und Rhythmussektion.  \nChor 6: Eine Rückkehr zur Struktur des ersten Chors, mit Ruf und Antwort zwischen Stimme und Holzbläsern. In diesem Chor nimmt die Stimme den Klang der „Growl“-Technik an und soliert als Instrument.  \nTag: Kurzer Tag mit einem vokalen Lauf und einem dissonanten, neuartigen Ende durch eine Posaune.\n\nEllingtons Nutzung der Stimme, um diesem Stück eine Dimension von Klangfarbe hinzuzufügen, ist ein Beispiel für ein stilistisches Merkmal, das sein Werk durchdringt. In Hot and Bothered, ein Jahr später aufgenommen, kombiniert Ellington seine Fähigkeit zur straffen Orchestrierung mit seinem Gespür für Klangfarbe. Eine Ruf- und Antwortphrase zwischen „Bubber“ Miley auf gedämpfter Trompete und Baby Cox’ Scat-Gesang nutzt die vokalen Elemente von Mileys Spiel und die instrumentalen Aspekte von Cox’ Stimme, um einen reichen und komplementären Klang zu schaffen. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) erweitert diese Ideen, indem Ellington Joe „Tricky Sam“ Nanton, ein fester Bestandteil von Ellingtons Orchester, effektiv einsetzt, um die Melodie auf gedämpfter Posaune einzuführen.\n\n[REWRITE]Duke Ellington's legacy in jazz is largely due to his longevity and his creative ability to shape his orchestra.

Obwohl D’Arcy Thompson 1917 sagte, dass „selbst jetzt der Zoologe kaum begonnen hat, die einfachsten organischen Formen in mathematischer Sprache zu definieren“, gilt dies auch heute. In jüngerer Zeit wurde mathematische Modellierung auf allgemeine Aspekte der Molluskenskelettgenese sowohl durch Ontogenese als auch Phylogenese angewendet (z. B. Raup und Stanley, 1981). Unsere Studie untersucht, wie mathematische Modellierung von ontogenetischen und phylogenetischen Veränderungen bei Prunum, in Kombination mit experimentellen Studien, verwendet werden kann, um die Mechanismen zu beleuchten, die an der Richtung und Größe von evolutionär-entwicklungsbiologischen Veränderungen beteiligt sind. Wir nutzten Röntgenbilder von Prunum-Arten, um quantitative Parameter zu bestimmen, die wiederum verwendet werden konnten, um hypothetische und tatsächliche Skelettmorphologien zu modellieren. Diese Parameter wurden in das Softwareprogramm CerioShell (Stone, 1995) eingegeben. Wir modellierten hypothetische Schalenmorphologien, die verwendet werden konnten, um die Grenzen möglicher morphologischer Veränderungen bei Prunum zu interpretieren.

Diese Achse verläuft durch die zentrale Säule der Schale und ist als Columella bekannt. Die Geschwindigkeit, mit der sich die Windungen vergrößern, kann variieren, und eine durchgehende Linie trennt jede Windung und wird als Naht bezeichnet. In den meisten Schalen ist die größte Windung einer Schale die letzte Windung (Körperwindung). Der Turm wird als alle Windungen außer der letzten betrachtet.

That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",

The various reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, highlighting the necessity to strengthen the health system rather than concentrating solely on programmatic interventions.\n\nIndonesia has seen improvements in the number of births attended by skilled health workers, with 72% of births now meeting this standard. However, this statistic includes traditional workers, like midwives, who are unable to provide medical interventions in complicated pregnancies (hence the high percentage of maternal deaths due to hemorrhage).

These rates also highlight another worrying issue. While the cesarean rate is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural areas. This reveals the problem of equitable coverage throughout the country, as access to healthcare services is primarily concentrated in urban areas. Another access issue pertains to vertical equity.

However, there are drawbacks to consider. A major drawback is that significant investment in one particular area of the health sector often means other areas suffer from a lack of funding, and human resources may gravitate towards the better-resourced areas (the impact of international funding for HIV/AIDS on the family planning sector is one example).

Various reasons for these deficiencies will be discussed, emphasizing the need to reinforce the health system rather than just focusing on program-specific interventions.\n\nIndonesia has improved in terms of births attended by skilled health workers, with 72% of births now meeting this criterion. Nevertheless, this figure includes traditional workers, like midwives, who cannot perform medical interventions during complicated pregnancies (hence the significant percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage). Thus, the improvements in this indicator can be misleading, and much work is still required. Furthermore, there has been a reduction in the percentage of diarrhea cases in children under five treated by health professionals. Despite incomplete data on postnatal care, it is clear this area also needs attention, with low rates nationwide.\n\nCesarean-section rates remain lower than expected at around 4%. These rates highlight another concerning issue. The cesarean rate is 7% in urban areas but only 2% in rural ones, pointing to unequal coverage nationwide. Access to healthcare services is mainly focused on urban areas. Another access issue involves vertical equity, with a 27% gap in service use between the poorest and richest quintiles, suggesting the poor have more difficulty accessing healthcare, likely due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nIn considering steps to improve neonatal and maternal care indicators, the crucial question is how best to tackle the lack of service. Should Indonesia focus on program-specific strategies or strengthen the overall health system without concentrating solely on pre and post-pregnancy care? Programmatic approaches are attractive as they offer targeted, manageable objectives and generally yield quicker results. Yet, there are drawbacks. Heavy investment in one health sector area often means other areas lack funding, and human resources may move towards better-funded sectors (for example, the effect of international funding for HIV/AIDS on family planning).

Erschwerend kommt hinzu, dass die meisten, wenn nicht alle Genres – Rap, Rock, Country, Jazz, Folk, um nur einige zu nennen – mehrere Sub- und Sub-Sub-Genres innerhalb ihres Bereichs hervorgebracht haben. Man könnte argumentieren, dass das Sub-Genre des Heavy Metal Rock in den letzten 40 Jahren zu einem der vielfältigsten und expressivsten Genres der gesamten Populärmusik geworden ist. Es ist ausdrucksstark, weil es ein breites Spektrum an Emotionen zeigt, obwohl sie dazu neigen, sich auf die dunklere Seite des Spektrums zu lehnen. Es ist vielfältig, da die Menschen ziemlich bald nach den Anfängen des Genres erkannten, dass es echte Flexibilität hatte, und begannen, es zu nutzen, um ihr eigenes Sub-Genre zu schaffen, dem dann Sub-Sub-Genres folgten, und die Kette geht bis heute weiter.\n\nHeute haben wir einen Punkt in der Heavy-Metal-Bewegung erreicht, an dem es so viele Nischen von Gruppen gibt, dass es schwer ist zu bestimmen, was genau Heavy Metal ist. Es hat sich entwickelt, um so viele Themen aus anderen Genres zu integrieren, aber wie alles andere stammt es von irgendwoher. Um die Metal-Musik, die heute überall existiert, richtig zu verstehen, muss man zuerst verstehen, was die Metal-Bewegung ist und warum es eine Bewegung und nicht nur ein Genre ist.\n\nMetal ist in vielerlei Hinsicht eine Bewegung, die von Dunkelheit geprägt ist. Metal kann als „Musik des Mehr“ betrachtet werden – mehr Bass, mehr Lautstärke, mehr Gewalt, mehr Theatralik. Weniger Primitivismus, mehr Können; Menschen in Metal-Bands wissen wirklich, wie man ihr Instrument spielt, und das zeigt sich in der Musik. Metal ist auch – obwohl es vielleicht nicht überraschend ist – eine Bewegung, die stark von Drogen beeinflusst ist. In den mittleren 70er Jahren gab es einen psychedelischen Drogenboom, der dazu führte, dass die Leute verrückter wurden, was sie dazu brachte, verrückte, andereweltliche Platten zu machen und die Drogen als Sündenbock für ihre Schöpfung zu nutzen. Es besitzt viele dunkle, viszerale Qualitäten, die in der Musikszene sehr neu waren, da eine große Menge populärer Musik Eigenschaften hatte, die nicht der dunkleren Seite des emotionalen Spektrums entsprachen. Auch spätere Generationen von Metal haben einige ihrer Einflüsse aus den dunklen, viszeralen Qualitäten genommen, die in der Romantik so präsent waren. Texte wie die folgenden drücken die Dunkelheit aus, die so ein Grundelement der Bewegung ist: (Byrne)\n\nDiese Texte aus Helter Skelter zeigen die dunklere Seite der Beatles. Es zeigt ein Auf und Ab, angeblich das der Drogen. Dieses Lied wird von einigen als eines der ersten Heavy-Metal-Lieder angesehen. Es war eine Antwort auf ein Rolling Stones-Lied, das ebenfalls auf der schwereren, dunkleren Seite war. Die Beatles wollten beweisen, dass sie genauso schwer wie die Stones sein konnten, also haben sie dieses Lied auf das Weiße Album gesetzt.\n\nAnd the translation back to English would be:\n\n[REWRITE]\nThe classification of popular music has expanded so much over the past 100 years that it is difficult to list them all definitively.

    "original": "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",

    "raw_output": "Einige Jahrzehnte bevor die surrealistischen Künstler ihre traumhaften Werke zu malen begannen, formte der Künstler Henri Rousseau sorgfältig seine eigenen Träume, sowohl im wörtlichen als auch im übertragenen Sinne. Das Gemälde Der Traum aus dem Jahr 1910 von dem berühmten postimpressionistischen Künstler zeigt nicht nur eine Frau, die von den Wundern des Landes, das sie in einem Traum besucht, fasziniert ist, sondern auch Rousseaus eigene persönlichen Träume und Ziele als Maler. Seit Beginn seiner Arbeit träumte er von Anerkennung, Akzeptanz und Lob durch andere Künstler und Kunstliebhaber und stellte fest, dass er mit einem schwierigen inneren Dilemma konfrontiert war, um dieses Ziel zu erreichen. Der Traum ist das Werk von Henri Rousseau, das seinen lebenslangen inneren Kampf am besten widerspiegelt: entweder bestimmten Malstilen zu entsprechen oder sie nachzuahmen, um von der kritischen Kunstwelt, die er so verehrte, akzeptiert zu werden, oder sich die kreative Freiheit zu erlauben, unabhängig und einzigartig zu sein, während er seinen eigenen Weg ging.\n\nBevor man Der Traum aus dieser Perspektive analysieren kann, muss man zunächst mit Rousseaus biografischer Geschichte einigermaßen vertraut sein. Henri Rousseau wurde am 21. Mai 1844 in der Stadt Laval im Nordwesten Frankreichs geboren. Sein Vater war ein Klempner und Eisenwarenhändler, der „bürgerlichen Wohlstand genoss“ (Shattuck 47). In seiner Jugend erhielt er keine formale Ausbildung in den Künsten; stattdessen war er bis zum Alter von vierzig Jahren als Gabelou, ein Angestellter des städtischen Zolldienstes, für Frankreich tätig, obwohl er fälschlicherweise den Spitznamen Douanier, ein Zollinspektor, erhielt (Shattuck 46). Der Tod seiner ersten Frau Clémence, der dem Tod von acht Säuglingskindern folgte, hinterließ Rousseau mit nur einem Kind, einer Tochter namens Julia, und enormer Trauer (Shattuck 49). Daher hoffte er, in einem neuen Leben Zuflucht zu finden, und widmete sich der Malerei, um ihm Trost und Neuanfänge zu bieten. Anders als zeitgenössische Kollegen von Rousseau, die den Bauern in der Malerei sentimentalisierten und romantisierten, ist er im Wesentlichen ein Volksmaler und hat die Hoffnungen und Träume des durchschnittlichen Mitglieds seiner Klasse.\n\nRousseaus Besessenheit, von der Kunstwelt akzeptiert zu werden, ist einigermaßen verständlich, wenn man sie im Kontext betrachtet: Wie besprochen, war er nicht nur ungebildet in den Wegen der formalen Malerei und begann seine Karriere in einem viel älteren Alter, sondern er produzierte Werke zur gleichen Zeit wie viele andere talentierte und bekanntere moderne Künstler. Obwohl er bereits viele Jahre arbeitete, begann Rousseau erst zur gleichen Zeit, als Matisse begann, sich einen Ruf als Künstler zu erarbeiten, angemessene Anerkennung für seine Kunst zu erhalten. In dem Buch Moderne französische Maler behauptet der Autor Jan Gordon, dass die beiden, obwohl sie technisch gesehen Konkurrenten in der Kunstarena waren, sich nicht nur im Stil und Thema, sondern auch in ihren Gründen für das Malen unterschieden: „Matisse war ein Maler, der eine Angst davor hatte, auf banale Weise zu malen, während Rousseaus Wunsch war, ein Bild so konventionell zu malen, dass er in die Artiste Français aufgenommen würde“ (92).\n\n[REWRITE]A few decades before the Surrealist artists started painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was meticulously crafting his own dreams, both literally and figuratively. \"The Dream,\" a painting from 1910 by the renowned Post-Impressionist artist, not only depicts a woman in awe of the wonders of the land she visits within a dream but also represents Rousseau's personal dreams and aspirations as a painter.

    "original": "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation.

    "raw_output": "Viele große Denker haben eine enge Verbindung zwischen Ethik und Ästhetik, zwischen Wahrheit und Schönheit postuliert. Ich glaube, dass es auf einer grundlegenden Ebene einen Grund dafür gibt. Wie John Keats in „Ode on a Grecian Urn“ sagt: „Schönheit ist Wahrheit, Wahrheit Schönheit – das ist alles / Was ihr auf Erden wisst, und alles, was ihr wissen müsst.“ Vieles von dem, was wir im Leben wissen, lernen wir durch Bildung oder Erfahrung. Trotzdem scheinen wir, wie Keats andeutet, Ethik und Ästhetik zu schätzen, ohne auf die erwarteten Weisen gelehrt zu werden. Sowohl Ethik als auch Ästhetik sind ein Versuch zu beschreiben, statt vorzuschreiben. Unsere Studien der Moral und der Schönheit sind größtenteils Versuche zu erklären, warum ein Kunst- oder Literaturwerk schön ist oder warum eine Handlung moralisch ist, statt eine Reihe von Regeln zu sein, um gute Kunst oder moralisches Verhalten zu beurteilen oder zu schaffen.\n\nMehr noch, Kritik an Kunst oder Moral kann niemals vollständig das Wesen dessen erfassen, was gut oder schön ist. Eine Diskussion über den Wert von da Vincis Mona Lisa kann sich beispielsweise um Konzepte wie Vordergrund, Hintergrund, Kontrast oder kulturellen Kontext drehen, aber letztlich beschreiben diese nicht, warum es gute Kunst ist. Vielmehr hört man oft, wenn jemand nach einem Lieblingskunstwerk oder -literatur gefragt wird, eine ähnliche Aussage wie „Da ist einfach etwas daran“, gefolgt von einer komplexeren oder kritischeren Erklärung. Ich glaube, dass sowohl Kunst als auch Moral nie vollständig auf eine Beschreibung ihrer Eigenschaften reduziert werden können. Wie Flannery O'Connor sagt: „Eine Geschichte ist eine Möglichkeit, etwas zu sagen, das auf keine andere Weise gesagt werden kann . . . man erzählt eine Geschichte, weil eine Aussage unzureichend wäre.“ Egal wie vollständig wir die Eigenschaften eines literarischen Werkes beschreiben, es bleibt etwas Transzendentes übrig. Ich glaube, dass die Ethik diese gleiche Eigenschaft hat. Wie Wittgenstein sagt: „Es ist klar, dass Ethik nicht ausgedrückt werden kann. / Ethik ist transzendental.“ Ich schlage vor, dass es dieses „Etwas“, dieses je ne sais quoi ist, das die stärkste Eigenschaft von Kunst und Moral darstellt und dass diese transzendentale Natur von sowohl Ethik als auch Ästhetik einen Verbindungspunkt zwischen ihnen bietet.\n\nIch glaube, dass Moral und Kunst so eng miteinander verwandt sind, weil wir beide am stärksten auf einem noumenalen Niveau erleben, um einen kantischen Begriff zu verwenden. Sie wirken auf uns auf eine Weise, die erfahren, aber nicht vollständig erklärt werden kann. Diese Verbindung ist noch stärker, wenn es um die Kunst der Literatur geht. Wie McKean sagt: „Was die Literatur am meisten von den anderen Künsten unterscheidet, was in Wahrheit einzigartig an der Kunst ist, ist ihre moralische Qualität. Es mag sein, dass moralische Standards für andere Künste, wie Musik, unangemessen sind, aber sie scheinen für die Literatur ebenso relevant zu sein wie für das Leben selbst. Leben beinhaltet notwendigerweise Werte. . . . Literatur ist uns gerade wegen der Werte wichtig, die wir dort finden.“\n\n[REWRITE]Many great thinkers have suggested an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, truth and beauty. I believe there is a fundamental reason for this. As John Keats says in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\": \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of what we know in life is learned through education or experience. Yet, as Keats implies, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics without being taught in the expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics attempt to describe rather than prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are mostly attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging or creating good art or moral behavior.\n\nMoreover, criticism of art or morals can never fully capture the essence of what is good or beautiful. A discussion about the value of da Vinci's Mona Lisa may revolve around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but ultimately, these do not explain why it is good art. Rather, when asked about a favorite work of art or literature, it is common to hear a phrase like \"There's just something about it\" before a more complex or critical explanation follows. I believe that both art and morals can never be entirely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how completely we describe the properties of a literary work, there remains something transcendent. I believe that ethics shares this property. As Wittgenstein says, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" I propose that this \"something,\" this je ne sais quoi, is the most powerful attribute of art and morality, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\nI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both most powerfully at a noumenal level, to use a Kantian term.

Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them.

Ein großes Problem beim Beenden einer Täuschung ist jedoch, dass man sich dabei entfremdet fühlen kann. Daher muss man letztendlich zwischen der eigenen Selbsterhaltung und der Erhaltung der Beziehungen zu den Menschen um sich herum entscheiden. Denn obwohl einige neutral darauf reagieren werden, zu entdecken, dass sie getäuscht wurden, werden andere die Täuschung nicht so leicht nehmen und sich wahrscheinlich durch die ganze Farce beleidigt fühlen.\nDas Thema der Täuschung bei der Umkehrung von Geschlechterrollen ist besonders problematisch, weil es viele Nebenfragen aufwirft, von denen vielleicht die wichtigste ist: Warum? Warum fühlt das Subjekt die Notwendigkeit, seine eigene Identität abzulegen und eine Verkleidung in Form des anderen Geschlechts anzunehmen? Im Fall von Viola ist es offensichtlich eine Form des Selbstschutzes: „Ich bringe dich zu einem Kapitän in dieser Stadt/ Wo meine Mädchenkleider liegen, durch dessen sanfte Hilfe/ Ich bewahrt wurde, um diesem edlen Grafen zu dienen…“ (5.1.247-249)\nNeu in einem fremden Land angekommen, empfindet Viola es als notwendig, sich als Mann auszugeben, um sich vor möglichen Angreifern zu schützen. Violas Plan funktioniert, aber er entfremdet sie auch von den Frauen um sie herum, schneidet sie von einem wichtigen Unterstützungssystem ab. Um die Sache noch schlimmer zu machen, ist sie offenbar so überzeugend darin, als Mann zu erscheinen, dass Olivia sie mit Sebastian verwechselt und sich in sie verliebt. „Wohin, mein Herr? Cesario, Ehemann, bleib.“ (5.1.138) Darüber hinaus muss sie auch mit unterdrückten romantischen Gefühlen zwischen ihr und Orsino umgehen: „Junge, du hast mir tausendmal gesagt/ Du solltest niemals eine Frau lieben wie mich.“ (5.1.260-261)\nObwohl dies eine etwas fortschrittliche Haltung sein mag, kann \"Was ihr wollt\" für den modernen Leser als Illustration dafür gesehen werden, wie Täuschung dazu beitragen kann, unterdrückte Emotionen zu enthüllen, insbesondere im Fall von Olivia und Orsino. Bestimmte Passagen scheinen anzudeuten, dass die genannten Charaktere unausgesprochene unterbewusste Wünsche haben könnten, mit denen das Erscheinen von Viola/Cesario sie konfrontiert. Zum Beispiel, ist Olivia zu Cesario hingezogen, weil Cesario wie ein Mann erscheint, oder hegt Olivia wirklich heimlich Gefühle für Frauen? Man könnte argumentieren, dass dies wahrscheinlich nicht der Fall ist, da Shakespeares Figur Olivia eher diejenigen Menschen seiner Zeit parodiert, die andere nur nach ihrem Aussehen beurteilen.\nDies wird durch die Leichtigkeit belegt, mit der Olivia ihre romantischen Neigungen von Cesario auf Sebastian wechselt und beginnt, Cesario/Viola eher als Familienmitglied denn als Liebesinteresse zu betrachten: „Eine Schwester, du bist sie.“ (5.1.315)\n\nEnglish Translation:\n[REWRITE]\nThe play \"Twelfth Night\" seems to suggest that while disguise is indeed useful in maintaining long-term deception, ultimately a person must reject this newly formed guise or risk losing themselves permanently in the process.

    "original": "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert.

    "raw_output": "Deutsche Kolonialherrschaft wurde von verschiedenen Beobachtern wegen ihrer Brutalität bemerkt, insbesondere im Hinblick auf den Völkermord an den Ovaherero und Nama in Deutsch-Südwestafrika. Natürlich kann ein so breites Thema wie ein gesamtes Kolonialreich nicht durch eine so einfache Beschreibung erfasst werden. Das deutsche Kolonialreich war in seinen Politiken und seinem Regierungsstil ebenso vielfältig wie in der Geographie. Das Bildungsangebot in den Kolonien war ebenfalls unterschiedlich. Als die Briten 1919 Deutsch-Ostafrika (Tanganjika) übernahmen, fanden sie eine große Bevölkerung gebildeter und literaturfähiger Afrikaner vor. Deutsche Bildungsbemühungen in Kamerun und anderen Kolonien wurden ebenfalls von zeitgenössischen Autoren gelobt. Die Situation in Südwestafrika (dem heutigen Namibia) stellte einen starken Kontrast dar. Anders als in Ostafrika, wo die Regierung staatliche Schulen errichtete und eine bedeutende Rolle in der Bildung der Einheimischen spielte, wurde in Südwestafrika die Aufgabe der einheimischen Bildung fast vollständig den Missionsgesellschaften überlassen, die nur begrenzte staatliche Unterstützung erhielten. Die Regierung investierte jedoch erhebliche Ressourcen in die Bildung der Europäer in der Kolonie, indem sie ein System staatlicher Schulen etablierte und die Missionsschulen stärker unterstützte und regulierte. Diese Bildungspolitiken hatten lang anhaltende Auswirkungen auf Südwestafrika, selbst nach der deutschen Herrschaft. Während andere deutsche Kolonien eine beträchtliche Anzahl von gebildeten und literaturfähigen Afrikanern aufwiesen, blieb in Südwestafrika „die überwältigende Mehrheit der Bevölkerung unberührt, ungebildet und analphabetisch.“ Verschiedene soziale, politische und wirtschaftliche Faktoren führten zu der unterschiedlichen Erfahrung Südwestafrikas. Diese Arbeit versucht, die Diskussion zu erweitern, indem sie diese Faktoren identifiziert und besonderes Augenmerk auf neue Forschungen zu den Einstellungen der Siedler und Kolonialbehörden gegenüber den einheimischen Afrikanern legt. Es gibt eine Fülle von Literatur, die sich spezifisch mit der Bildung im deutschen Kolonialreich befasst. Die meisten dieser Quellen sind in deutscher Sprache und wurden im frühen zwanzigsten Jahrhundert, während oder kurz nach der deutschen Kolonialherrschaft, verfasst. Das Ziel der frühen Werke war in erster Linie, die Merkmale der Bildungssysteme in diesen Kolonien zu beschreiben. Spätere Schriften in englischer Sprache erweiterten den Diskurs durch vergleichende Studien der Bildung in den verschiedenen deutschen Kolonien und detailliertere Analysen spezifischer Aspekte der Bildung. Diese Studien veranschaulichten signifikante Unterschiede in den Bildungssystemen der verschiedenen Kolonien. Das prominenteste Werk, das explizit das Thema dieses Papiers anspricht, ist Cohens Studie über die Bildung in Südwestafrika und Ostafrika. Cohen vergleicht die Bildungssysteme der beiden Kolonien und diskutiert die Faktoren, die die Unterschiede zwischen ihnen erklären. Laut Cohen erklärt die große Siedlerbevölkerung von Südwestafrika viele der charakteristischen Aspekte des Bildungssystems der Kolonie. Im Vergleich zu Deutschlands anderen kolonialen Besitztümern hatte Südwestafrika ein mäßig gemäßigtes Klima, obwohl ein Großteil des Territoriums von trockener Wüste bedeckt ist. Die europäische Bevölkerung von Südwestafrika spiegelte die relativ gastfreundlichen Bedingungen wider. Bis 1913 lebten fast 15.000 Weiße in Südwestafrika, während nur 5.336 in der Kolonie mit der nächstgrößten Siedlerbevölkerung, Ostafrika, lebten.\n\n[REWRITE]German colonial rule was noted for its brutality by various observers, especially in relation to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. However, an entire colonial empire cannot be captured by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as diverse in its policies and governing style as it was in its geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly varied. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they discovered a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Cameroon and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. The situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) was a stark contrast. Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a significant role in educating the natives, in South West Africa, the task of native education was almost entirely left to missionary societies with limited government support. However, the government did invest significant resources in the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing a system of state schools and providing more substantial support and regulation for missionary schools. These educational policies had long-lasting effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies had significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, \"the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper aims to broaden the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans. There is a wealth of literature specifically dealing with education in the German colonial empire. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies highlighted significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work explicitly addressing the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.

(Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

(Diehl und Goerts 2000, S. 145). Der Höhepunkt dieser Rivalität war der Mexikanisch-Amerikanische Krieg von 1846-1848, in dem die Vereinigten Staaten Mexiko angriffen und besiegten und sich Texas und den amerikanischen Südwesten als neues Gebiet sicherten. Viele weitere Auseinandersetzungen fanden zwischen den beiden Nationen statt und ließen schließlich kurz vor dem Ersten Weltkrieg nach. Die Rivalität begann, als Amerikaner und Mexikaner bei Schlüsselfragen wie Religion, Kultur und Tradition aufeinanderprallten und einen großen Konflikt materieller Interessen hatten (Schmitt 1974, S. 30-31).\n\nDies ist nicht unähnlich vielen anderen Nationen, die eine langanhaltende Rivalität mit einem Nachbarn haben. Nationen, die eine Grenze teilen, neigen dazu, Interessenkonflikte zu haben, die zur Schaffung rivalisierender Positionen zwischen den Nationen führen. Die Vereinigten Staaten und Mexiko unterscheiden sich nicht von vielen anderen anhaltenden Rivalitäten zwischen Nationen, die eine gemeinsame Grenze teilen. David M. Pletcher (1977) erklärt, dass „nur in Mexiko und Kuba langanhaltende, umfassende amerikanische diplomatische Probleme zu finden sind“ (S. 41). Tatsächlich sind beide dieser Nationen geografisch nahe an den Vereinigten Staaten und waren Rivalen der Vereinigten Staaten, während andere Nationen in Lateinamerika gute Beziehungen zu den Vereinigten Staaten genießen und genossen haben.\n\nReligiöse Fragen schufen einen Riss zwischen den beiden Nationen, ein Problem, das viele Nationen durch die Geschichte hindurch heimgesucht hat. Sally Frahm (2001) sagt, dass „wenn im zwanzigsten Jahrhundert die Amerikaner gegen Faschismus und Kommunismus waren, waren sie im achtzehnten und neunzehnten gegen Katholizismus und Monarchie“ (S. 86). Ähnlich wie die Rivalität des Kalten Krieges zwischen den Vereinigten Staaten und der Sowjetunion war ein Teil ideologischer Kampf und ein Teil ein Wettbewerb um Interessen, die jede Nation als lebenswichtig betrachtete. In diesem Fall jedoch waren die ideologischen Kämpfe nicht auf die politische Struktur, sondern auf die religiösen Präferenzen der Vereinigten Staaten und Mexikos begründet. Dieses Misstrauen wuchs aus dem Misstrauen zwischen den Engländern und Spaniern. Diese Gefühle des Misstrauens von ihren ehemaligen Kolonialherren zu erben, war ein großes Hindernis bei der Etablierung freundschaftlicher außenpolitischer Beziehungen zwischen den Vereinigten Staaten und Mexiko.\n\nDiehl und Goerts (2000) listen 17 Streitigkeiten zwischen Mexiko und den Vereinigten Staaten in der 57-jährigen Rivalitätsperiode auf. Die Mehrheit der in der Rivalitätsperiode von Diehl und Goerts beschriebenen Streitigkeiten sind territoriale Fragen, die sich auf Grenzüberfälle von mexikanischem Gebiet nach Mexiko und andere Grenzprobleme beziehen. Grenzüberfälle von Banditen und Gesetzlosen auf amerikanische Grenzstädte waren ein großes Problem, das bestehen blieb, bis sowohl die Vereinigten Staaten als auch Mexiko militärische Gewalt an ihren Grenzen ausübten (Schmitt 1974, S. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) erklärt, dass die Rivalität zwischen den beiden Nationen begann nachzulassen, als „Mexiko eindeutig in erheblichem Maße von den Vereinigten Staaten abhängig wurde“ (S. 109) und schließlich endete, als die amerikanischen Ambitionen „sich von territorialer Expansion zu wirtschaftlicher Intervention in Mexiko änderten“ (S. 110) im späteren Teil des 19. Jahrhunderts.\n\n[REWRITE]The United States of America and Mexico serve as an example of two nations that were once plagued by a long-standing rivalry, lasting 57 years from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145).

This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",

    "raw_output": "Sure, here is the translation and re-translation process:\n\nTranslation to German:\nIrgendwann im fünften oder sechsten Jahrhundert v. Chr. wurde ein Prinz geboren, der eines Tages Buddha genannt werden sollte. Im Laufe seines Lebens entsagte er der Welt und wurde erleuchtet, und seine Lehren führten zur Entstehung des Buddhismus – dessen orthodoxeste Sekte als Theravada-Buddhismus bekannt ist. Die Religion ist etwa zweieinhalbtausend Jahre alt; heute sieht sie anders aus als zu der Zeit, als Buddha lebte. Dies ist überall zu sehen, zum Beispiel in der Theravada-Nation Sri Lanka, wo die jährliche Wasserzeremonie beobachtet wird. Sowohl Mönche als auch Laien nehmen an dieser Zeremonie teil, und sie hat eine gewisse religiöse Bedeutung, obwohl Buddha nie über ein solches Fest lehrte. Diese Unterschiede reichen von den oberflächlichen Traditionen bis zum soteriologischen Kern der Religion. Die Theravada-Buddhistische Gemeinschaft musste ihre doktrinären Prinzipien im Laufe der Zeit ändern, sowohl aus der monastischen Perspektive als auch aus der Laienperspektive. Dies kann auf sowohl externe als auch interne Kräfte zurückgeführt werden, sowohl feindliche als auch gutartige.\nEs gibt eine Reihe von Qualifikationsbegriffen, die in dieser Diskussion häufig verwendet werden. Es gibt das Konzept von intern versus extern. Hier wird eine interne Kraft als eine Kraft definiert, die von Mitgliedern der Buddhasasana getragen wird, unabhängig vom monastischen Status. Eine externe Kraft ist jede Kraft von Nicht-Buddhisten. Eine feindliche Kraft ist jede Kraft, die die buddhistische Gemeinschaft schädigt oder zu schädigen beabsichtigt – eine Kraft, die aus einer negativen Wahrnehmung des Buddhismus stammt. Eine gutartige Kraft ist eine Kraft, die nicht beabsichtigt, die buddhistische Gemeinschaft zu schädigen oder zu unterstützen – obwohl sie letztendlich das eine oder andere als Nebenprodukt tun könnte. Diese Begriffe werden in dieser Diskussion immer wieder auftauchen.\nZuerst ist es wichtig, die Grundlagen der Religion zu untersuchen – die Lehren, die im Kern des Theravada-Buddhismus liegen. Buddhisten suchen Zuflucht im dreifachen Juwel von Buddha, dem Dhamma und der Sangha. Das Dhamma besteht im Wesentlichen aus dem Tripitaka – den drei Körben – des buddhistischen Textes. Das Sutta Pitaka enthält alle Suttas, das Vinaya Pitaka enthält die Disziplinarregeln, und das Abhidhamma Pitaka enthält die metaphysischen Komponenten des Buddhismus. Die metaphysischen Vorstellungen bestehen aus Dingen wie Anatta – keine Seele, Dukkha – inhärentes Leiden im Leben, und Anicca – Vergänglichkeit von allem. Nur durch das Erkennen dieser Konzepte kann man Sansara beenden, den Zyklus von Tod und Wiedergeburt, der kontinuierlich stattfindet. Mit Sansara enden lobha – Begierde, dosa – Hass und moha – Täuschung, wenn man erleuchtet wird. Im Vinaya Pitaka werden Regeln für das Leben festgelegt. Für Laien gibt es fünf Gebote (Ich soll nicht töten, ich soll nicht lügen, ich soll nicht stehlen, ich soll mich sexuell nicht fehlverhalten und ich soll keine berauschenden Substanzen nehmen). Für Mönche gibt es viele weitere Disziplinarregeln zu befolgen. Der grundlegendste doktrinäre Begriff im Buddhismus ist die Vorstellung der vier edlen Wahrheiten. Erstens, Dukkha; die Wahrheit, dass das Leben Leiden ist. Zweitens, dass Anhaftung Leiden verursacht. Drittens, dass Leiden überwunden werden kann.\n\nRe-translation to English:\n[REWRITE] \nSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince was born who would later be known as Buddha.
