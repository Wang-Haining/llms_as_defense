    "raw_output": "Kultur spielt eine bedeutende Rolle in jeder Verhandlung. Kultur kann ebenso sehr durch das definiert werden, was sie nicht ist, wie durch das, was sie tatsächlich ist und was sie bedeutet. Kultur ist weder homogen noch eine spezifische Sache. Sie ist auch nicht singulär oder einheitlich. Aussagen wie \"alle Russen sind stur\" oder \"alle Japaner sind entgegenkommend\" sind von Natur aus allgemein und zu einfach. Während das Verständnis von Verallgemeinerungen einer Kultur angemessen ist, ist es viel produktiver für einen Verhandler, die Bedeutung einer Kultur für die Angelegenheit zu verstehen und wie die Einstellung dieser Kultur die Verhandlungen beeinflussen kann und wird. Wenn man sich einer fremden Kultur nähert, erlebt man sie auf eine Weise, die seiner eigenen Kultur nachvollziehbar ist, und Vergleiche entstehen zwangsläufig.\n\nDer Versuch, eine fremde Kultur oder Denkweise zu verstehen, kann alles umfassen, von der Untersuchung ihrer Geschichte bis zur Erkenntnis ihrer Vorurteile. Anstatt eine Kultur zu beurteilen oder zu versuchen, sie zu ändern, muss man sie einfach so akzeptieren, wie sie ist, und innerhalb ihrer Grenzen arbeiten, besonders im Rahmen von Verhandlungen, und insbesondere, wenn man mit einer schwächeren Verhandlungsposition an den Tisch kommt. Ebenso kann Respekt vor Traditionen und Überzeugungen helfen, kulturelle Barrieren zu überwinden und die Verhandlung voranzutreiben, wenn sich ein Verhandler auf \"fremdem\" Terrain befindet.\n\nEs ist wichtig zu beachten, dass sich Kultur nicht unbedingt auf eine nationale/internationale Dichotomie beschränkt. Die meisten Unternehmen innerhalb eines bestimmten Landes schaffen ihre eigene Unternehmenskultur. Eine Unternehmenskultur könnte zum Beispiel lange Arbeitszeiten im Büro oder einen entspannteren Zeitplan betonen. Hinweise auf eine Unternehmenskultur lassen sich in Kleiderordnungen der Mitarbeiter, im Kommunikationsstil (direkte vs. indirekte Kommunikation, Aufgabenverteilung) und in Einstellungspraktiken erkennen. Einige Unternehmen ermutigen zu Wohltätigkeit auf jeder Ebene von Mitarbeitern, andere beschränken sie auf \"vom Unternehmen genehmigte\" Wohltätigkeitsorganisationen oder Spendenaktionen. Man muss nur die Unterschiede in der amerikanischen Unternehmenskultur von Unternehmen zu Unternehmen betrachten (und tatsächlich existiert auch eine interne Diversität, die von Region zu Region, städtischen zu vorstädtischen Umgebungen reicht), um die Vielfalt der Gedanken zu schätzen, die innerhalb einer bestimmten gesellschaftlichen Kultur existieren kann. Bestimmte Kulturen sind nicht annähernd so geschichtet wie die amerikanische Kultur und mögen einem Außenstehenden einheitlicher erscheinen, aber ein ähnliches Äußeres ist einfach ein Zeichen dafür, tiefer zu graben.\n\nWerte sind noch wichtiger zu verstehen, weil sie das Warum einer Kultur liefern. Wenn in einer Kultur das Bewahren des Gesichts oder die gemeinschaftliche Harmonie geschätzt wird, ist es sicher, dass ein Verhandler sein Unternehmen oder seinen Vorgesetzten nicht öffentlich beschämen wird, um am Verhandlungstisch erfolgreich zu sein. Ebenso wird ein Verhandler aus einer Kultur, die einem harten Geschäft mehr Gewicht beimisst, nicht unbedingt dazu angetrieben, sich bei der frühesten Gelegenheit zu einigen. Diese Verallgemeinerungen zu berücksichtigen, ist wichtig, bevor man an den Verhandlungstisch geht. Ein Verhandler ist jedoch gut beraten, etwas über seinen Gegner auf persönlicher Ebene zu lernen, um die Verhandlung effektiv zu gestalten.\n\n[REWRITE]  \nCulture plays an important role in any negotiation.

This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God.

    "raw_output": "Certainly! Here is the text translated to German and then back to English:\n\nGerman Translation:\n„Der Narr spricht in seinem Herzen: ‚Es gibt keinen Gott.‘“ Das vorstehende Zitat findet sich zuerst in Psalm 14 der christlichen Bibel und steht am Anfang von St. Anselms Argumentation über die Existenz Gottes. Diese Überzeugung scheint auch von dem anderen Autor geteilt zu werden, den wir besprechen werden, Thomas von Aquin. Da beide ihre Argumente zur Verteidigung desselben Konzepts vorbringen und unsere Herausforderung darin besteht, zu bestimmen, welches das bessere ist, müssen wir aus Gründen der Kürze mit der Annahme beginnen, dass beide in ihrem Glauben an die Existenz Gottes, speziell des Gottes der Bibel, richtig liegen. Würden wir eine Gott-ähnliche Figur zulassen, die möglicherweise nicht derjenige ist, an den unsere beiden Autoren glauben, könnten wir ihre beiden Argumente nicht angemessen vergleichen, da sie im Wesentlichen zur Verteidigung eines bestimmten Konzepts von Gott stehen. Das gesagt, schlage ich vor, dass, obwohl jeder von ihnen gültige Punkte anführt, keiner von ihnen wirklich eine ganzheitliche Grundlage für den Glauben an Gott bietet.\nUm diesen Punkt zu veranschaulichen, werden wir zuerst das grundlegende Argument von St. Anselm untersuchen. Anselms Passage spiegelt einen Weg wider, Verständnis durch Glauben zu erlangen und in sich selbst nach einem Beweis für Gott zu suchen. Er erklärt, dass wir, weil Gott in unserem Verständnis existiert, seine Nichtexistenz nicht effektiv begreifen können. Während dieses Konzept, wenn es in seiner Terminologie dargelegt wird, etwas langatmig und manchmal unklar ist, besteht der grundlegende Kern darin, dass der Beweis für Gott im eigenen Geist liegt. St. Anselm schlägt vor, dass wir die Grenzen unserer eigenen Seele nicht überschreiten müssen, um die Wahrheit über Gott zu finden, sondern dass die Existenz dieses Wesens einfach dadurch als wahr erkannt wird, dass wir das untersuchen, was wir inhärent als wahr in unseren eigenen Köpfen wissen. Fremde Beweise sind vermutlich unnötig. Dieses Konzept, das zu akzeptieren, wofür es keinen unwiderlegbaren empirischen Nachweis gibt, wird in christlichen Texten oft als Glaube bezeichnet.\nDiese Idee unterscheidet sich stark von der von St. Thomas von Aquin. Aquin schlägt stattdessen vor, dass die Existenz Gottes vollständig durch Vernunft und empirische Beweise bewiesen werden kann, ohne jegliche Notwendigkeit für Glauben. Eine solche Idee wäre im Evangelisieren, einem wichtigen Element des Christentums, von Vorteil, da sie es ermöglichen würde, neue Konvertiten zu gewinnen, ohne von ihrer Bereitschaft abhängig zu sein, etwas zu akzeptieren, das nicht bewiesen werden kann. Sie könnten stattdessen allein durch Logik überzeugt werden. St. Thomas erläutert fünf verschiedene logische Argumente, die die Existenz Gottes unterstützen: Veränderung, Verursachung, Kontingenz, Grade der Vollkommenheit und Harmonie. In jedem zeigt er im Wesentlichen, dass der Beweis für Gott in der logischen Notwendigkeit für Gott liegt. Wenn man gesagt bekommt, dass ein Puzzleteil fehlt, und den Rest des Puzzles zusammensetzt, diktiert die Logik, dass man die Merkmale und die Existenz des fehlenden Teils kennen kann, ohne es sehen zu müssen.\n\nEnglish Translation:\n[REWRITE] \"The fool says in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This quote first appears in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm's argument about the existence of God.

    "raw_output": "Translation to German:\n\nViele Autoren verwenden verschiedene Wege, um ihren Lesern ein bestimmtes Gefühl oder eine Einstellung gegenüber wichtigen Themen zu vermitteln. Einige dieser Techniken sind effektiver als andere. F. Scott Fitzgerald verwendet viele dieser verschiedenen Techniken in seinem Roman Der große Gatsby. Manchmal kombiniert Fitzgerald ein Adjektiv und ein Substantiv, die normalerweise nicht zusammenpassen, um den Lesern eine bestimmte Aura um ein Thema zu vermitteln. Andere Male verleiht er einem Symbol Bedeutung und nutzt es dann für denselben Zweck. Fitzgerald verwendet diese letzte Technik mit vielen Farben, darunter Gold, Grün, Weiß/Grau und Rot/Rosa. In seinem Roman Der große Gatsby baut F. Scott Fitzgerald Bedeutungen für Farben auf, insbesondere Weiß/Grau und Rot/Rosa, und nutzt diese Bedeutungen später, um den Lesern eine bestimmte Erinnerung an ein Gefühl um ein wichtiges Objekt zu geben. Die Bedeutung, die Fitzgerald für Weiß/Grau aufbaut, ist Einheitlichkeit, wobei Weiß etwas schöner und höherklassig ist und Grau älter und verblasst wirkt. Fitzgerald etabliert diese Bedeutung zu Beginn des Romans durch ständige Verwendung beider Farben. Daisy und Jordan sind ständig „in Weiß“—tatsächlich tragen alle immer Weiß: Nick trägt „weiße Flanellhosen“ zu Gatsbys Party, Tom trägt ein „weißes Hemd“, wenn er Myrtle trifft, und Catherine ist „milchig weiß gepudert“. Tatsächlich tragen die Menschen nur dann kein Weiß, wenn Nick seine Eindrücke von Gatsbys Party bekommt: „Die Flure... sind grell mit Primärfarben“. Fitzgerald definiert diese beiden Farben weiter, indem er viele gewöhnliche, unwichtige Themen in diesen Farben einfärbt: Wenn Nick zur Arbeit geht, geht er „durch die weißen Schluchten des unteren New Yorks“, die Namen der Leute auf Gatsbys Partys sind jetzt „graue Namen“ auf Nicks Zeitplan, Catherines Apartment ist „ein Stück in einem langen weißen Kuchen aus Wohnhäusern“—Einheitlichkeit. Er beschreibt auch schlichte oder gewöhnliche Menschen oder Orte als weiß oder grau: Jordan und Daisy hatten eine „weiße Mädchenzeit“ zusammen, es gibt „graue Autos“ und „graues Land“ im Tal der Asche, das „italienische Kind“ auf der Eisenbahn ist „grau“ und der Hundeverkäufer ist „ein grauer alter Mann“. Nachdem Fitzgerald Weiß/Grau genug Bedeutung verliehen hat, nutzt er sie, um Unwichtigkeit oder Einheitlichkeit bestimmter Themen zu signalisieren. Diese Verwendung von Farben, um den Lesern etwas zu zeigen, beginnt zuerst mit Daisy. Nach einer langen Zeit ohne nennenswerte Verwendung einer dieser Farben beschreibt Fitzgerald Daisy als „in Weiß gekleidet“ in „einem kleinen weißen Roadster“; die Leser beginnen, Daisy weniger als Figur zu sehen, mehr wie eine einheitliche Ergänzung, etwas, das Gatsby will und ersehnt. Fitzgerald verwendet mehr von dieser Technik um Daisy, um diesen Eindruck von Daisy als einheitlichere Ergänzung zu geben, zum Beispiel gibt es einen „grauen Schleier von Daisys Pelzkragen“ und sie ist wieder in einem „weißen“ Kleid vor der Begegnung zwischen Tom und Gatsby.\n\nTranslation back to English:\n\nMany authors use different methods to convey a certain feeling or attitude towards important topics to their readers.

Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white”—in fact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears a “white shirt” when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white.” In fact, the only time people aren't wearing white is when Nick gets his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the halls... are gaudy with primary colors.” Fitzgerald further defines these two colors by coloring many common, insignificant subjects in these hues: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white chasms of lower New York,” the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” on Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—uniformity. He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and Daisy had a “white girlhood” together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” in the valley of ashes, the “Italian child” on the railroad is “gray,” and the dog-seller is “a gray old man.” After Fitzgerald assigns enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or uniformity to certain subjects. This use of colors to convey something to readers first starts with Daisy. After a long time without any notable use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character and more like a uniform addition, something that Gatsby desires and longs for. Fitzgerald employs more of this technique around Daisy to give the impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition, for example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar,” and she is again in a “white” dress before Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.",

There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground.

Zu den gängigen Kulturen gehören Tomaten, Zitrusfrüchte, Blattgemüse, Kürbis, Brokkoli, Kräuter, Baumfrüchte wie Pfirsiche und Zitronen, Beeren, Honig und Paprika. Es gibt einen beträchtlichen Markt für Lebensmittel aus organischer, gemeinschaftlich unterstützter Landwirtschaft in der Gegend von San Diego, wobei viele lokale Organisationen lange Wartelisten haben. Biologische Eier und Milch sind ebenfalls beliebt. Viele Bio-Bauernhöfe bieten auch Führungen durch ihre landwirtschaftlichen Betriebe sowie Zugang zum Wandern, zur Vogelbeobachtung und zu anderen Freizeitaktivitäten an. Diese Art von Betrieb würde es dem Landbesitzer ermöglichen, die Vorteile von Regierungsprogrammen zu nutzen und gleichzeitig den Lebensraum zu verbessern, was die Nutzung zu Erholungszwecken und die Schaffung von Möglichkeiten für Farmtouren und andere Programme zur Einkommensgenerierung oder zu Bildungszwecken ermöglicht.\n\nNeben der Erfüllung eines potenziell lukrativen Nischenmarktes bieten der biologische Landbau oft den Vorteil einer größeren Artenvielfalt bei Pflanzen und Tieren in der Region, da keine Chemikalien im Boden und Wasser vorhanden sind. Der biologische Landbau hat jedoch in mancher Hinsicht höhere Kosten als die konventionelle Landwirtschaft. Es erfordert intensivere Arbeit und Management, um Schädlinge und Unkraut zu entfernen und den Boden ohne Chemikalien zu düngen, und Verluste sind oft größer als bei herkömmlichen Methoden, während einem kleinen Bio-Bauernhof auch die Effizienz großer Betriebe fehlt. Praktiken, die nicht mit dem biologischen Landbau zusammenhängen, aber für die Tierwelt vorteilhaft sind, können ebenfalls höhere Arbeitskosten verursachen, einschließlich der Pflanzung von Deckfrüchten, der strategischen Weiderotation, der Entfernung invasiver Arten und der aktiven Verwaltung des Pflanzenwachstums, um spezifische Bedingungen wie Randlebensräume oder offene Bodenflächen zu bieten. Daher gibt es viele Gründe, warum der Landbesitzer in diesem Beispiel möglicherweise finanzielle Hilfe oder Fachwissen sucht, um sowohl Gewinne als auch die Qualität des Lebensraums zu maximieren.\n\nDas für dieses Szenario ausgewählte Grundstück liegt neben der Stadt Potrero im nicht eingemeindeten San Diego County, Kalifornien. Es umfasst 160 Morgen Chaparral, nicht einheimisches mediterranes Grasland und Eichenwald neben dem Cleveland National Forest. Es liegt in der Ecoregion der südlichen Vorgebirge des East County des San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. Der Plan wird noch geprüft, berücksichtigt aber derzeit über hundert Arten von Pflanzen und Tieren. Viele sind gefährdet, wie die Stephens-Kängururatte, der Gebirgsfrosch mit gelben Beinen, mehrere Schmetterlingsarten und der Kalifornische Gnatcatcher; andere sind rückläufig und könnten bald aufgelistet werden, wie Erdbaukauze.\n\nDieses Gebiet wurde über Jahrhunderte von amerikanischen Ureinwohnern bewohnt und dann von Viehzüchtern und Holzverkäufern im späten 19. Jahrhundert besiedelt. Dieses Stück Land war Teil eines ursprünglichen Homestead-Patents und wurde wahrscheinlich für die Beweidung und/oder Holzproduktion in vielen der dazwischen liegenden Jahrzehnte genutzt.\n\nIch wählte ein Grundstück von einer Immobilienwebsite aus und recherchierte verfügbare Regierungsprogramme, um zu sehen, welche Optionen ein Kleinbauer realistisch hätte, um Kosten zu mindern und wildtierfreundliche Betriebe zu bewahren. Als Modell dafür, was jemand, der dieses Land bewirtschaftet, erreichen könnte, habe ich eine Bio-Farm in derselben Gegend gefunden.\n\n[REWRITE]San Diego County is highly productive in agriculture due to its mild, sunny climate.

    "raw_output": "**Translation to German:**\n\nEs gibt ein Band zwischen Brüdern; ein unzerbrechliches, unwiderrufliches Band. In diesem Band liegen viele Emotionen: Liebe, Stolz, Eifersucht und Grausamkeit, um nur einige zu nennen. Brüder verstehen einander weit mehr als jeder andere mit einer solchen Verbindung, und sie können sich nur selbst sehen, wenn sie ihren Bruder ansehen. Es ist in den verzweifeltesten Situationen, dass die wahre Natur dieses Bandes durchscheint, sei es gut oder böse. Wenn diese Emotionen klar werden, tragen sie große Kosten mit sich. Teil des Verstehens der Emotionen, die aus dieser brüderlichen Verbindung geboren werden, ist das Umgehen mit den Konsequenzen, die sie mit sich bringen. Wenn man einem Bruder in die Augen sehen kann und in dieser Person sein eigenes Spiegelbild sieht, erkennt man sich selbst, nicht wie andere einen sehen, sondern wie man wirklich ist. In ihren Handlungen und den Konsequenzen dieser Handlungen liegt ihr wahrer Charakter. In „Der scharlachrote Ibis“ erkunden zwei Brüder dieses Thema und all die tobenden Emotionen, die es begleiten. Durch eine üppige, lebendig beschriebene Landschaft begeben sich diese beiden Jungen auf eine aussichtslose Reise. Bittere Enttäuschung kollidiert mit intensivem Stolz in der Höhepunktszene, und nur ein Bruder entkommt mit seinem Leben. Das Thema wird durch die direkte Charakterisierung des Protagonisten, Doodle, und ihre Interaktionen miteinander ausgedrückt, sowie durch den Blickwinkel des Erzählers, der die komplexen Gefühle des Protagonisten und seine Sicht auf die Welt um ihn herum vermittelt, die beide großen Einfluss auf sein Handeln haben.\n\nDie Handlungen des Protagonisten lassen sich durch ein Schlüsselemotion zusammenfassen: Stolz. Von dem Moment an, als er und sein kleiner Bruder, Doodle, das erste Mal zusammen ausgehen, bis zu ihrem letzten, schicksalhaften Ausflug, empfindet der Protagonist Groll gegenüber Doodle. Er wollte einen Bruder, dem er all seine weltlichen Fähigkeiten beibringen konnte, wie „... die Luft anhalten, rennen, springen oder die Ranken im Old Woman Swamp erklimmen...“ Er wollte einen Bruder, der die Rolle von „...jemandem, mit dem man zum Horsehead Landing rennen und mit dem man auf der oberen Gabel des großen Pinies hinter der Scheune sitzen kann...“ füllen könnte. Diese Dinge sind offensichtlich unmöglich, angesichts von Doodles Zustand. Doodle wurde mit einem extrem schwachen Herzen geboren, was es unwahrscheinlich machte, dass er überhaupt überleben würde. Selbst dann war es fast unmöglich, dass er jemals an anstrengender körperlicher Aktivität teilnehmen könnte. Welch ein Schlag für den jungen Protagonisten, dessen Kopf voller wilder Fantasien war, all diese Träume in einem Augenblick zerschmettert zu sehen. Tatsächlich wird sogar gezeigt, dass er eine gewisse Wut auf das kleine Kind empfindet, als er sich daran erinnert, darüber nachzudenken, ihn zu töten, indem er ihn mit einem Kissen erstickt. Was für ein Kind hätte die Geistesgegenwart, Kindermord in Betracht zu ziehen? Doch sein Herz schmilzt, als das kleine Kind ihn anlächelt. So eine einfache Handlung gab dem Protagonisten solche Hoffnung! Dies zeigt, dass seine Überzeugung wahrscheinlich nicht sehr stark war. Im Hinterkopf hatte er eine instinktive Liebe zu seinem Bruder.\n\n**Translation back to English:**\n\nThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond.

As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually.

There are several types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimulus. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, related to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, related to what the word sounds like, or semantically, related to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which holds information for about 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short time. Long-term memory is thought to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\n\nThere are numerous models for how knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on how humans retrieve memories, others inspired by computer science, and others based on neurophysiology.

    "transformed": "The human brain is a complex and creative information-processing system. As technology evolved from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also evolved. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, then a sheet of papyrus, then a book, and more recently, a computer. When learning about the brain, remember that these metaphors have limitations and can lead to incorrect conclusions.\n\nInformation processing begins with input from the sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or light photons into electrochemical signals. The brain's algorithms repeatedly transform the sensory information in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when viewing a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing involves combining basic information such as color, orientation, and the borders of the object—where the color changes notably in a short space—to determine that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses decisions from some steps of the bottom-up process to expedite your recognition of the box. In this example, top-down processing might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\n\nOnce information is processed to a certain degree, an attention filter determines the importance of the signal and which cognitive processes it should be presented to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing each one individually. In contrast, you might notice your name, even when spoken in a noisy room.

Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",

Der Teil in Ihrer Geschichte, in dem Sie Ihre kleinen Schriftstellerflügel ausbreiten und abheben, alle mit Ihrem magnetischen, ja geradezu magischen Prosa in Erstaunen versetzen. Oder der Teil, bei dem Ihre Leser einschlafen und/oder auf die \"Zurück\"-Taste drücken, während sie Ihren Namen verfluchen. Dr. Merlin ist dafür bekannt, auf ihren Monitor zu schreien, wenn sie sich mitten in zu viel Information befindet, und das nicht einmal auf unterhaltsame Weise.\n\nDie Exposition ist nicht Ihr Freund.\n\nMeine sanften Leser kennen bereits den grundlegenden Schreibtipp: \"Zeigen, nicht erzählen\", aber Dr. Merlin stolpert dennoch in lange Textpassagen, in denen nichts passiert oder schlimmer noch, zu viel. Die Exposition ist der kleine Teufel, der auf Ihrer Schulter sitzt und sagt, dass Sie die Geschichte aus dem Weg räumen sollen, um zu den guten Teilen zu gelangen (nicht zu verwechseln mit dem Teufel auf der anderen Schulter, der den Autor dazu drängt, seinem Publikum jedes einzelne Detail der Kindheit jedes Charakters zu erzählen).\n\nExposition bedeutet, dem Publikum zu erzählen, was passiert ist, typischerweise in einfacher Prosa. Im Film passiert die Exposition, wenn ein Charakter einem anderen einen Informationsschub à la \"Die Ballade vom alten Seemann\" gibt. In der Fiktion ist der Autor derjenige, der erzählt.\n\nEin Beispiel ist angebracht. Wenn Sie eine Geschichte lesen, wird Ihnen gesagt, dass die Heldin ihren Geliebten an einem bestimmten Ort und zu einer bestimmten Zeit getroffen hat, dass sie in festlicher Weise geheiratet haben und dass ihr Mann vor ihren Augen ermordet wurde. Sie würden nicht erwarten, dass diese gesamte Sequenz zwei Seiten einnimmt, während derer sowohl er als auch sie jeweils nur zwei Dialogzeilen erhalten. Sie würden erwarten, dass der Autor etwas Zeit auf den Charakter des Ehemanns verwendet, um durch seine Rede und sein Verhalten zu zeigen, wie sehr er seine Frau liebt, und Sie würden ebenso erwarten, dass die Heldin durch große und kleine Gesten zeigt, wie sehr seine Anwesenheit in ihrem Leben sie verändert und bereichert hat (besonders wenn die Geschichte Ihnen später direkt sagen würde, dass dies der Fall war). Eine angemessene Einführung in den Charakter des Ehemanns würde es Ihnen ermöglichen, sich emotional mit seinem Schicksal zu verbinden und Ihnen Einblicke in den Charakter der Heldin zu geben: was sie in ihm sah, wie tief ihre Bindung war, Hinweise auf ihre Gedanken und Überzeugungen und Träume, wie sie durch das Prisma seiner Augen reflektiert wurden, und so weiter. Sie würden seinen Tod mit ihr betrauern und sich so stärker mit der Heldin selbst verbunden fühlen.\n\nKurz gesagt, Sie würden erwarten, dass Fleisch an dem einfachen Knochen der Handlung ist: \"Sie trafen sich, sie heirateten, er starb.\"\n\nAls Schriftsteller müssen Sie dieses Fleisch bereitstellen. (*schaut auf die Metapher, seufzt, macht weiter*) Manchmal ist es verlockend, an bestimmten Dingen vorbeizurasen. Vielleicht führen Sie einen neuen Charakter ein und wissen, dass er früher bei der Luftwaffe war, jetzt der Nachtmanager einer Tankstelle ist, zweimal verheiratet war, keine Kinder hat, gerne am Wochenende angeln geht, heimlich davon träumt, eines Tages die Tankstelle zu besitzen und Eggs Benedict zum Frühstück hatte.\n\n**Back to English Translation:**\n\nAh, exposition.

    "transformed": "I watched two newscasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first one, which was \"live,\" was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The main story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio, who had stabbed his wife; her name was not mentioned, but his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot, and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story, as it was still developing. The only details they provided were that he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story.\n\nThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and was critically injured; no arrests had been made at the time, nor were there any suspects. The SWAT team was investigating the crime. This story seemed short, and I believe that might have been because this was a \"black\" man or a black neighborhood. I've noticed (and have for years) that minorities are often overlooked when they are victims of crimes.

Ein ETF bietet die Diversifikation eines Indexfonds und die Vorteile des Besitzes einzelner Aktien, wie die Möglichkeit, leer zu verkaufen, auf Marge zu kaufen und in jeder Transaktion so wenige wie eine Aktie zu erwerben. Obwohl diese Vorteile äußerst attraktiv sind, sind die Kostenquoten von ETFs weit niedriger als die eines durchschnittlichen Investmentfonds. Leider gibt es einige Nachteile, wie die Notwendigkeit, bei jedem Handel mit ETFs eine Provision zu zahlen, genauso wie bei einer Aktienbestellung. Ein weiterer Vorteil von ETFs ist die große Vielfalt an verfügbaren Fonds. Obwohl diese Vorteile klar dargelegt sind, ist es für den klugen Finanzinvestor immer eine gute Übung zu bewerten, ob die angegebenen Vorteile, wie Diversifikation, tatsächlich existieren und in welchem Ausmaß sie vorhanden sind. Zu diesem Zweck werden wir den ETF IHF untersuchen und ihn mit den zehn wichtigsten Beständen vergleichen, die den ETF ausmachen, um festzustellen, ob die Vorteile des Besitzes eines einzelnen ETFs den Vorteilen eines diversifizierten Portfolios der zehn Aktien nahekommen und ob es bessere Konfigurationen derselben Aktien gibt, die ein optimaleres Sharpe-Verhältnis oder eine bessere Rendite bieten würden.\n\nUm den ETF zu bewerten, wäre es ziemlich unhandlich, jede Position einzubeziehen, daher haben wir beschlossen, nur die zehn wichtigsten Positionen einzubeziehen, die 63,58% aller Vermögenswerte im ETF ausmachen.

Die Berechnungen von Beta und Rendite sind in der untenstehenden Tabelle enthalten.\n\nAus der obigen Tabelle ist ersichtlich, dass die Rendite eines Portfolios, das nur die zehn wichtigsten Positionen enthält, um 6,11% höher ist als die des ETF, was einem Anstieg der Renditen um 16% entspricht. Es ist auch ersichtlich, dass das Beta der zehn wichtigsten Positionen um 0,12 niedriger ist als das des gesamten ETFs. Aus den bisher durchgeführten Ergebnissen scheint es, dass ein Portfolio, das nur aus den zehn wichtigsten Positionen besteht, eine höhere Rendite bei einem niedrigeren Beta bieten könnte. Es besteht jedoch die Möglichkeit, dass die Mittel dieser beiden Portfolios statistisch nicht voneinander abweichen.\n\nUm zu bewerten, ob diese Portfolios statistisch unterschiedlich sind, wird die Standardabweichung jeder der zehn wichtigsten Aktien bestimmt und auf 100% normiert, um ihre kumulierte Standardabweichung mit der des ETF IHF zu vergleichen.\n\n[REWRITE]An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a security designed to track an index, a commodity, or a basket of assets like an index fund, but it is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.

That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

Das war etwas entmutigend, und es ist schwer zu sagen, warum das passiert sein könnte. Mit dem Beginn des Winters auf einem Campus in Neuengland gibt es offensichtlich einen Rückgang der Menschen, die entweder mit dem Fahrrad oder zu Fuß pendeln, was einen Teil des Rückgangs erklären könnte. Der Dezember markiert auch das Ende des Herbstsemesters, wenn alle sehr beschäftigt sind, Schularbeiten zu beenden, Noten zu verarbeiten und so weiter. Das Ausfüllen des Pendlerprotokolls könnte für viele einfach aus dem Blickfeld geraten sein. Zudem bringt der Dezember den Beginn der geschäftigen Feiertagssaison und die daraus resultierende einmonatige Pause für Studenten und Dozenten, während der viele überhaupt nicht zum Campus kommen müssen. Die Kurse beginnen dann Ende Januar wieder für das Frühlingssemester, was vielleicht auch einen Hinweis auf die geringe Anzahl von Protokollen für diesen Monat gibt. Aber nichts davon erklärt wirklich die geringe Anzahl der Einreichungen für Februar. Man könnte auch vermuten, dass jedes Projekt dieser Art zu Beginn einen Energieschub und Aufregung hat, die dann natürlich nachlassen könnten. Um diesem Trend entgegenzuwirken, haben wir die Carpool Challenge Week ins Leben gerufen, eine spezielle Kampagne im März, um die Initiative wiederzubeleben, was zu einem Anstieg der Protokolleinreichungen für diesen Monat führte. Eine der Herausforderungen, die wir erlebten, war also, wie man das Projektschwung angesichts eines natürlichen Rückgangs des Engagements, aber auch speziell des Problems der Ferien- und Semesterpausen im Hochschulbereich aufrechterhalten kann.\n\nEine weitere Herausforderung für dieses Projekt (oder jedes alternative Pendlerprojekt) ist die einfache Tatsache, dass Menschen die Freiheit, Unabhängigkeit und Flexibilität genießen, ihr Auto zu fahren. Dies ist tief in unserer Kultur verwurzelt. Daher ist es wichtig, Anreize für die Nutzung alternativer Pendlerformen zu bieten. Wir haben viele Preise in Form von Geschenkgutscheinen für lokale Restaurants, Cafés, Massagetherapeuten, den lokalen unabhängigen Buchladen und sogar einige größere nationale Einzelhandelsketten verschenkt. Es wäre jedoch interessant gewesen zu sehen, wie einige noch größere Preise die Teilnahme hätten beeinflussen können – wie zum Beispiel die Verlosung eines schönen Fahrrads, Hybridautos oder Elektroautos. Dies hätte auch helfen können, das Engagement zu steigern, das im Projekt erlebt wurde. Die Art der Preise änderte sich während des Projekts nicht wirklich. Wenn die Preise jedoch im Laufe des Projekts an Wert zunehmen würden, hätte das helfen können. Die Geschenkkarten schienen zu Beginn des Projekts mehr als ausreichend zu sein, aber wenn wir im Dezember die Hinzufügung einiger Fahrräder und dann im Januar die Hinzufügung eines Hybrid- oder Elektroautos angekündigt hätten, kann man nur denken, dass die Teilnahme und das Engagement zugenommen hätten, anstatt abzunehmen.\n\n[REWRITE]Referring to Figure 17, there was a sharp decline in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project.

These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",

    "raw_output": "Beim Durchsehen der Sammlung früher Edison-Filme in der Bibliothek des Kongresses entschied ich mich, alle Trickfilme anzusehen, von denen es zwischen 1895 und 1901 fünfzehn gab. Diese Filme nutzen in der Regel kreatives Schneiden, um Illusionen zu erzeugen. Mein Filmstudium konzentrierte sich im Allgemeinen darauf, die Poetik der meisten Trickfilme zu beschreiben und die evolutionären Außenseitermerkmale in einigen der späteren Filme zu untersuchen. Im Großen und Ganzen ist der Trickfilm zur Jahrhundertwende bühnengebunden, innerhalb eines frontalen Proszeniums komponiert, weist keine Kamerabewegung auf, verwendet lange und mittlere Aufnahmen und hält sich an die strikte Methode ein Shot = ein Film. Es gibt jedoch einige Filme zu Beginn des zwanzigsten Jahrhunderts, die diese Richtlinien zu durchbrechen wagen, indem sie Aspekte wie mehrere Aufnahmen einführen.\n\nEines der auffälligsten Merkmale, die die Trickfilme gemeinsam haben, ist ihr Drehort in einem Innenraum innerhalb des Rahmens eines frontalen Proszeniums. Die Kamera bewegt sich nicht von ihrer Proszeniumsposition, um Figuren oder Objekte zu folgen. Diese Komposition war in frühen Filmen sehr verbreitet und entstammte dem Theater und, für Trickfilme, dem Vaudeville und Zauberdarbietungen. Eine der Einschränkungen, die mit der Verwendung der Bühne einhergehen, ist, dass sich Figuren in Trickfilmen im Allgemeinen nur seitwärts bewegen und nicht in Richtung oder von der Kamera weggehen. Nehmen Sie zum Beispiel die Aktion im Film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). Die Schauspieler treten von der rechten Seite ein und bewegen sich entlang der horizontalen Achse hin und her. Selbst wenn sie aus dem Bild gehen, folgt die Kamera ihnen nicht.\n\nDer frontale Proszeniumsstil der Komposition bedeutet auch, dass Aufnahmen tendenziell Weitwinkelaufnahmen und, seltener, mittlere Aufnahmen sind. Nahaufnahmen werden in keinem der Trickfilme aus dem Edison-Katalog verwendet. Dies entlehnt sich der Tradition des Theaters und Vaudevilles, wo das Publikum die gesamte Aufführung zu jeder Zeit innerhalb der Grenzen der Bühne sehen würde. Wie in den meisten frühen Filmen bewegen sich die Schauspieler nicht vom Mittelgrund zur Kamera, sodass keine Nahaufnahmen vorkommen.\n\nIm Allgemeinen folgen die meisten frühen Trickfilme dem Muster, dass eine konzeptionelle Aufnahme einen Film ergibt. Dies begrenzt die Länge der meisten Trickfilme auf etwa eine Minute oder weniger, abhängig von den verwendeten Bildern pro Sekunde. Es begrenzt auch die dramatische oder narrative Nutzung der Trickfilme; die meisten konzentrieren sich auf kurze Vaudeville-artige Tricks, wie Zauberei, Verschwinden und Wechselakte mit wenig Handlung. Beachten Sie jedoch, dass in einem Trickfilm eine konzeptionelle Aufnahme in den Augen des Betrachters nicht tatsächlich einer physischen Aufnahme entspricht. Ein einzelner „Shot“ kann tatsächlich mehrere zusammengefügte sein, um die Illusion einer Erscheinung oder eines Verschwindens zu erzeugen. Schauen Sie genau auf The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), einer der früheren Trickfilme. Eine gründlichere Untersuchung zeigt den Moment, in dem der physische Shot mit Marys abgetrenntem „Kopf“ beginnt, obwohl der gesamte Film für den Betrachter konzeptionell ein Shot ist.\n\n[REWRITE]While reviewing the Library of Congress’s collection of early Edison films, I chose to watch all the trick films, of which there were fifteen between 1895 and 1901.

    "transformed": "While reviewing the Library of Congress’s collection of early Edison films, I chose to watch all the trick films, of which there were fifteen between 1895 and 1901. These films typically utilize creative editing to create illusions. My film study primarily focused on describing the poetics of most trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier features in some of the later films. Generally, the trick film at the turn of the century is stage-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing elements such as multiple shots.\n\nOne of the most notable aspects the trick films share is their filming on an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films and has its roots in the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One limitation inherent in using the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side and do not walk toward or away from the camera. Consider, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even when they exit the frame, the camera does not follow them.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This draws from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at all times, framed by the stage's borders. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\n\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative use of the trick films; most focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to create the illusion of appearance or disappearance.

The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto.

Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic.

The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",

Der Begriff Lieferkettenmanagement wurde 1982 von Keith Oliver, einem Berater, geprägt. Keith Oliver beschrieb den gesamten Prozess der Planung, Umsetzung und Kontrolle dessen, was in der Lieferkette geschieht, um die Bedürfnisse der Kunden schnell und effizient zu erfüllen. Es gibt sechs Schlüsselelemente in einer Lieferkette: Produktion, Versorgung, Lagerbestand, Standort, Transport und Information. Geschäftsleiter nutzen diese sechs Schlüsselelemente, um den besten Kundenservice zu bieten.\n\nProduktion ist der erste Schritt im Lieferkettenprozess. Produktion ist die Grundlage für den gesamten Lieferkettenprozess. Die Produktionsphase wird darlegen, wann, warum, wo und wie alles produziert werden soll. Manager müssen wissen, was Kunden wollen. Damit Manager wissen, was Kunden wollen, können sie den Markt betrachten. Der Markt ist der größte Indikator, um zu entscheiden, was die Kundenanforderungen sind. Sobald Manager den Markt analysiert und die Kundennachfrage verstanden haben, sind sie bereit zu entscheiden, welche Produkte produziert werden sollen und wie viele dieser Produkte produziert werden sollen. Nachdem das Management entschieden hat, was produziert wird und wie viel, sind sie bereit zu entscheiden, wo die Produkte produziert werden sollen und welches Werk am besten für Volumen und Qualität der Ware ist, wobei die Kundennachfrage und Zufriedenheit erfüllt werden müssen. Nachdem der Standort für die Produktion der Produkte festgelegt wurde, konzentrieren sich die Manager auf die Planung von Arbeitsbelastungen und die Wartung der Ausrüstung. Produktion ist ein sehr wichtiger Schritt im Lieferkettenprozess. Jedes Detail ist während des gesamten Prozesses entscheidend. Wenn nicht jedes Detail entsprechend geplant wird, kann es das Unternehmen auf lange Sicht viel Zeit und Geld kosten. Zum Beispiel habe ich früher in Wal-Mart und Target Einzelhandelsgeschäften gearbeitet. Beide Unternehmen haben ein Design, ein Handbuch und einen Prozess für jede Einheit des Unternehmens. Es gibt ein gestaltetes Layout, wie die Uniform eines Mitarbeiters aussehen sollte, um den Empfang von Sendungen von Lastwagen zu erhalten. Vorgeschriebene Prozesse ermöglichen es einem Unternehmen, reibungslos zu arbeiten, ohne Verwirrung über Richtung und Erwartungen.\n\nDas zweite Schlüsselelement im Lieferkettenmanagement ist die Versorgung. Versorgung wird als die strategischen Entscheidungen definiert, die getroffen werden sollten, um die Kernfähigkeiten einer Einrichtung zu bestimmen, und Outsourcing-Partnerschaften sollten aus diesen Entscheidungen erwachsen. Ein Unternehmen kann viele verschiedene Produktionsabteilungen für ein einzelnes Produkt haben. Alle Abteilungen bestehen aus unterschiedlichem Gerät, Arbeitern und Spezialitäten. Der Manager muss entscheiden, welche Abteilung am besten für die verschiedenen Prozesse des Produkts geeignet ist. Das Management kann auch entscheiden, die Arbeit an andere Unternehmen auszulagern. Der Hauptgrund, warum ein Manager die Arbeit an Unternehmen auslagern würde, ist, Geschwindigkeit zu schaffen. Geschwindigkeit ist die Fähigkeit, Qualität und Flexibilität zu bieten und gleichzeitig die Kosten zu senken oder auf niedrigem Niveau zu halten.\n\nNow, let's translate it back to English:\n\nSupply chain management is the flow of processes that move goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution to the customer.

When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise.

Zwei Romane, die als viktorianisch gelten, aber von dieser Tradition abweichen, sind Oliver Twist und Wuthering Heights. Beide Romane verwenden ein Element des Geheimnisses und eine Vorliebe für das Bizarre, was untypisch für die Romane der Zeit ist, und stärken dadurch die Charaktere in jedem Werk. Dies bietet Einblicke, die ihre Motive und Emotionen näher beleuchten.\n\n„Und nun kamen Scharen von verwirrenden und verwirrenden Ideen in seinen Kopf. Er schien immer noch zwischen Sikes und Crackit zu gehen, die wütend stritten: denn die Worte, die sie sagten, klangen in seinen Ohren; und als er seine eigene Aufmerksamkeit erregte, … fand er heraus, dass er mit ihnen sprach…. Plötzlich zuckte er zurück bei dem Bericht über Feuerwaffen; und es erhoben sich laute Rufe und Schreie in die Luft; Lichter flammten vor seinen Augen auf, und alles war Lärm und Tumult, als ihn eine unsichtbare Hand hastig wegtrug. Durch all diese schnellen Visionen lief ein undefiniertes, unbehagliches Bewusstsein von Schmerz, das ihn unaufhörlich ermüdete und quälte.“ (Dickens, 220)\n\nDie beiden Romane nutzen dieses Geheimnis oft durch Traumsequenzen oder traumähnliche Zustände, auch wenn der Inhalt und die Funktion in jedem spezifischen Fall variieren. In Oliver Twist enthüllen diese seltsamen Ereignisse oft Einblicke in Olivers innere Schichten, was ihn schmerzt und sein Bewusstsein über die wahre Natur der Dinge, die um ihn herum geschehen. Als das Schießen auf Oliver schließlich in Kapitel 28 erneut aufgegriffen wird, erlebt Oliver das Schießen lebhaft, als wäre es ein Traum, während er darum kämpft, Hilfe zu finden. Der Abschnitt betont den Mangel an Kontrolle, den Oliver über die Geschehnisse hatte, sowie die schlimmen Zustände, die seine Gesundheit inzwischen erreicht hatte, was deutlich über Olivers Halluzinationen von Sikes und Crackit zum Ausdruck kommt. Das Schießen selbst überwältigt ihn, alle seine Sinne sind betäubt, da er die „unsichtbare Hand“ nicht bemerkt, die ihn wegträgt; er erlebt seine Verzweiflung aufs Neue, losgelöst vom Schock des Schmerzes, da der Schmerz nun konstant ist und eher mit Angst als mit Überraschung verbunden ist. Da Oliver überwältigt ist, stellt sich die Frage, wessen Wille sein Unglück herbeigeführt hat, denn es war sicherlich nicht sein eigener. Diese Schießerei bekräftigt die Vorstellung, dass Oliver kaum Kontrolle über irgendetwas hat, da er sich nicht einmal dazu bringen kann, zu versuchen, den Ausgang eines Ereignisses zu beeinflussen, selbst wenn sein Leben in Gefahr ist. Ein wachsendes Gefühl der Niederlage in Oliver wird auch durch diese Passage angedeutet, als hätte der alte Fagin begonnen, ihn zu brechen, indem er ihn dazu zwang, diese Verzweiflung zu akzeptieren und seine Fähigkeit zu reagieren zu beeinflussen. Denn andernfalls kann angenommen werden, dass Oliver zumindest im Interesse seines eigenen Lebens irgendeinen Versuch unternommen hätte.\n\n„Der Tag verging – Tag!

    "transformed": "Victorian novels are known for their meticulous attention to detail and their emphasis on the aristocracy of the era. Two novels considered Victorian but diverge from this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. Both novels incorporate elements of mystery and a penchant for the bizarre, which is atypical for works from the period, thereby strengthening the characters within each story. This provides insights that further explore their motives and emotions.\n\n\"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas crowded his mind. He seemed to still be walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily arguing, for the very words they spoke echoed in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, ... he found that he was talking to them... Suddenly, he recoiled at the report of firearms; loud cries and shouts rose into the air; lights flashed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult as some unseen hand hurriedly bore him away. Through all these rapid visions ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which wearied and tormented him incessantly.\" (Dickens, 220)\n\nThe two novels often use this mystery through dream sequences or dreamlike states, although the content and function vary in each specific case. In Oliver Twist, these strange events often reveal insights into Oliver's inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness of the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is revisited in chapter 28, Oliver vividly relives the shooting as if in a dream while he struggles to find help. The passage emphasizes Oliver's lack of control over the events, as well as the dire state his health had reached, clearly shown through Oliver's hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the \"unseen hand\" that carries him away; he experiences his despair anew, detached from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver overwhelmed, the question arises about whose will led to his misfortune, as it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything, as he cannot bring himself to even attempt to influence the outcome of an event, even when his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this passage, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. Otherwise, it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least for the sake of his own life.\n\n\"The day passed off—day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as it came—and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.",

Ich tat mein Bestes, um ihnen in den Fächern zu helfen, in denen sie Schwierigkeiten hatten, aber meine Stärken lagen in Englisch und Lesen. Einer der Lehrer bat mich, einem kleinen Jungen namens Adrian zu helfen (ich glaube, er war in der dritten oder vierten Klasse), der große Probleme beim Lesen hatte. Es dämmerte mir, dass etwas nicht stimmte; er hatte die seltsamsten Probleme. Einige Buchstaben wusste er perfekt auszusprechen, bei anderen lag er völlig daneben, es war das merkwürdigste Ding. Wissen Sie, er war lateinamerikanischer Abstammung, dessen war ich mir sicher, aber der Junge sprach perfektes Englisch. Wir kämpften weiter, bis zu dem Tag, an dem ich seine Mutter traf. Ich half bei der Betreuung (mangels eines besseren Begriffs) einiger Kinder, während der Rest der Nachmittagsgruppe auf einem Ausflug war, als seine Mutter hereinkam. Seine Mutter sprach kein Wort Englisch, nur Spanisch. Mit meinem sehr schlechten Spanischkenntnissen (ich lernte gerade erst), gelang es uns, zu kommunizieren. Aber da traf es mich wie ein Sack Ziegelsteine: Adrian konnte gut lesen, er kannte nur das englische Alphabet nicht sehr gut. Ich weiß nicht, ob diese Erkenntnis ihm viel geholfen hat, aber ich hoffe, dass es ihm jetzt besser geht.\n\nIch erzähle diese Geschichte, um das Problem der Sprachbarriere in Schulen zu thematisieren, besonders hier in Kalifornien. Ich erzähle sie auch, um zu beweisen, dass es nicht immer so offensichtlich ist, wie wir denken würden. Selbst für ein Kind, das perfekt Englisch spricht, kann das Lesen eine große Hürde sein. Ich denke, jeder kann zustimmen, dass dieses Problem existiert, also was tun wir? In Adrians Fall war die Lösung ziemlich einfach: Nachhilfe im englischen Lesen, insbesondere im Alphabet und in der Aussprache. Aber für die vielen Kinder, die kaum Englisch sprechen, ist die Lösung viel komplexer. Es gibt keine einzige Antwort. Das zweisprachige System, das Eintauchen in die Sprache, private Tutoren, ESL-Kurse, keine dieser Maßnahmen allein wird dieses Problem lösen. Der Schlüssel liegt darin, all diese Ansätze zu kombinieren!\n\nZuallererst ist das zweisprachige System eine großartige Idee. Nicht nur für Kinder, deren Muttersprache Spanisch ist, sondern für alle Kinder. „Kinder in zweisprachigen Bildungsprogrammen schneiden akademisch besser ab als ihre Altersgenossen.“ Viel Angst umgibt diese Idee, dass es eine Verschwendung von Ressourcen ist und dass die Mehrheit der Kinder in Schulen keinen Nutzen daraus ziehen wird. Aber das ist falsch. Wenn wir diese Art von Programmen als Regel und nicht als Ausnahme im Klassenzimmer anwenden würden, würden alle Kinder davon profitieren. Wie gehen wir aber vor? Verlangen wir, dass alle Lehrer zweisprachig sind? Nein. Das wäre unvernünftig und leicht unrealistisch. Ich denke jedoch, dass es keinen Grund gibt, warum wir nicht spezielle Hilfskräfte, Tutoren oder wie auch immer Sie sie nennen wollen, haben können, die zweisprachig sind.\n\n**Translation back to English:**\n\n[REWRITE]\nA few years ago, I worked in an after-school program tutoring elementary school students.

Einige von uns werden zur Sonntagsschule geschickt, um darüber zu lernen, während andere zum Tempel gehen oder in sich selbst nach Antworten suchen. Viele von uns akzeptieren bereitwillig die Religionen, die uns von unseren Eltern weitergegeben wurden. Einige von uns lehnen sie jedoch vollständig ab und leugnen, dass es in unserem eigenen persönlichen egozentrischen Universum nichts jenseits des Wissens geben kann. Wir könnten eine Wertestruktur übernehmen, nur um später unsere Meinung zu ändern und eine andere an ihre Stelle zu setzen. Welchen Weg wir auch wählen, wir reisen, um einen Teil von uns selbst durch unsere eigenen einzigartigen Perspektiven der Spiritualität zu definieren. Wir suchen nach einem Licht im Dunkeln, das uns aus den Schatten heraus und in die Sonne führt.\n\n„Ein Kardinal“, sagte mein Vater, als ich ihn fragte, welcher sein Lieblingstyp von Vogel sei. Wir saßen auf der Veranda unseres Hauses und hörten dem Regen zu, der auf das Blechdach über uns prasselte, während wir zusammen unsere Zigaretten rauchten. Die Regenrinnen leiteten den Regen ab und ertränkten die Pflanzen am Rand der Veranda. Er schaute in den Regen, eine Art Blick, der halb suchend, halb erinnernd zu sein scheint. In den letzten Monaten war er dünner geworden, und seine Kleidung hing lustlos von seinem Körper. Sein Haar war weniger geworden, spärlicher als ich es in Erinnerung hatte. Er starrte immer noch in den Regen, vermied den Augenkontakt. Ich fühlte mich allein, ängstlich und unfähig, mit meinem Vater darüber zu sprechen, wie sehr ich ihn vermissen würde, weil das Sprechen darüber es für uns beide nur realer machen würde. Ich umarmte ihn, setzte mich wieder hin, rückte meinen Stuhl etwas näher an seinen und schaute mit ihm in den fallenden Regen der Juni-Dämmerung.\n\nMein Vater starb im Dezember dieses Jahres, fünf Tage nach meinem zweiundzwanzigsten Geburtstag.

    "original": "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",

    "raw_output": "**German Translation:**\n\nJohn Taylor von Caroline war ein früher und leidenschaftlicher Befürworter des Republikanismus. Obwohl er in erster Linie Landwirt war, schuf dieser Beruf zusammen mit seiner kurzen politischen Karriere einen Mann, der für seine Hingabe und Offenheit in Fragen der persönlichen Freiheit und der Regierung bekannt war. Seine Hingabe an ein agrarisches System bildete die Grundlage für fast alle seine Meinungen zur Regierung. Es war sein Versuch, das zu bewahren und zu fördern, was er als die überlegene aller Karrieren betrachtete, der seine Argumente zur Souveränität, Verfassungsmäßigkeit und sogar zum Justizsystem prägte.\n\nJohn Taylor glaubte, dass die Vereinigten Staaten eine große Chance hätten, ein ideales System zu schaffen, da es keine einheimische Tradition gab, die die Schöpfer der Regierung behindern könnte, was die Etablierung eines Systems der Selbstverwaltung ermöglichte. Er glaubte fest an die natürlichen Rechte des Menschen und daran, dass sie alle voneinander abhängig sind – was bedeutet, dass, wenn eines verweigert wird, sie alle scheitern und der Wert der verbleibenden gemindert wird. Diese Rechte sollten daher außerhalb der Reichweite der Regierung liegen. Er behauptete, dass das, was einige den „Naturzustand“ nannten, bedeutete, dass diejenigen mit physischer Stärke und bösartiger Intelligenz diejenigen waren, die profitierten, aber dass dies in einer Zivilisation nicht der Fall sein dürfe.\n\nUm diese ideale Gesellschaft zu schaffen, glaubte Taylor, dass eine Regierung geschaffen werden müsse, die das inhärente Gute und Böse im Menschen berücksichtigt. Taylor war sehr streng in seinen Ansichten über eine dualistische Moral. Er behauptete, dass „da die Regierung von Menschen ausgeübt wird, alle ihre Tugenden und Laster menschlich sein müssen“ (Ibid., S. 167). Er definierte gute Prinzipien als solche, die Privateigentum schützen, die Landwirtschaft verbessern und den Kapitalismus entmutigen, und glaubte, dass eine Regierung, die auf guten Prinzipien gegründet ist, gerecht funktionieren würde, unabhängig von ihrer Verwaltung, die unweigerlich von Gier und Eigeninteresse geleitet würde. Eigeninteresse, so glaubte er, sei die Motivation des Menschen in allen Dingen, aber dieser Charakterzug werde nur dann als böse angesehen, wenn er über die Schaffung einer auf das Gemeinwohl ausgerichteten Gesellschaft hinaus zu Untersystemen führe, die auf Kosten anderer lebten. Eine gute Regierung sei notwendig, um das natürliche Böse des Menschen zu bewahren, und selbst dann müsse sie unter sorgfältiger Beobachtung stehen, um die Hinzufügung schlechter Prinzipien zu vermeiden.\n\nTaylor, wie viele andere standhafte Republikaner seiner Zeit, forderte eine strikte Auslegung der Verfassung. Er wollte eine äußerst begrenzte Bundesregierung, der nicht mehr Rechte oder Befugnisse zugestanden werden als im Verfassungstext ausdrücklich festgelegt. Er wusste, dass eine umfangreiche Bundesregierung teuer war und daher wahrscheinlich despotisch. Er glaubte jedoch, dass eine einfache, wörtliche Auslegung gefährlich sei und dass eine solche Methode ohne Bezugnahme auf die Absichten der Verfasser leicht korrupt werden könne. Darüber hinaus betrachtete er die Unabhängigkeitserklärung als die wahre Charta der Vereinigten Staaten, da sie das Land expliziter als Gruppe souveräner Staaten und nicht als eine Nation beschreibt.\n\n**English Translation:**\n\n[REWRITE]  \nJohn Taylor of Caroline was an early and passionate advocate of republicanism. Although primarily an agriculturist, his profession, alongside his brief political career, made him known for his dedication and outspokenness on matters of personal freedom and government. His commitment to an agrarian system was the foundation for nearly all his opinions on government. His attempts to preserve and promote what he considered the most superior of all careers shaped his arguments on sovereignty, constitutionality, and even the judicial system.\n\nJohn Taylor believed the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system because there was no native tradition to hinder the founders of the government, allowing for the establishment of self-governance. He firmly believed in the natural rights of man and that they are interdependent—meaning that if one is denied, they all fail, and the value of the remaining ones is diminished. Therefore, these rights should be beyond the reach of government. He argued that what some called the \"state of nature\" meant that those with physical prowess and malicious intelligence were the ones who profited, but in civilization, this must not be the case.\n\nTo create this ideal society, Taylor believed a government must be established that accounts for the inherent good and evil within man. Taylor was very strict in his views on a dualistic morality. He claimed that \"since government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). He defined good principles as those that protect private property, enhance agriculture, and discourage capitalism, believing that a government founded on good principles would function justly, regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be driven by greed and self-interest. He believed self-interest was man's motivation in all things, but this trait was only considered evil when it led beyond creating a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others. A good government was necessary to restrain man's natural evil, and even then, it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n\nTaylor, like many other staunch Republicans of his time, called for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He wanted an extremely limited federal government, with no more rights or powers granted than those explicitly stated in the Constitution. He knew that an extensive federal government was costly and therefore likely despotic. However, he believed that a simple, literal interpretation was dangerous and that without reference to the intent of the writers, such a method could easily become corrupt.

Unemotional, still, mit einem geübten Bewusstsein, das studierte, aber sich weigerte, das Studienobjekt mit einem abstrakten Verständnis zu verbinden, analysierte mein Geist das Bild vor meinen Augen. Gedanken schlüpften in meinen Kopf und wieder heraus, fast schneller als sie auftauchten. So reibungslos und sauber arbeitete mein Bewusstsein, dass es schien, als hätte ich keine eigenen Gedanken, nur eine aktive und flüssige Erfahrung dessen, was ich betrachtete. \nEinmal, auf Rat eines Künstlers, mit dem ich arbeitete, kaufte ich ein Kunstlehrbuch namens \"Das neue Zeichnen mit der rechten Gehirnhälfte\". Ich wollte zeichnen lernen, seit ich sechs Jahre alt war, und dieses Buch lehrt alles, von der Erkenntnis, was ein Bleistift ist, bis hin zu den Prozessen, die das Gehirn verwendet, um Linien zu interpretieren. Eine Technik, die das Buch lehrt, ist, einen quadratischen Rahmen um jedes Bild zu legen, das der Künstler studieren möchte. So wird ein überwältigend detailliertes Bild, zum Beispiel eine Schale mit Früchten auf einem Tisch in einer Küche, die mit einem Esszimmer verbunden ist, in ein leicht zu erfassendes Bild umgewandelt, diese Schale mit Früchten auf einer einfachen Ebene. \nDamals, als ich auf die Schale vor mir starrte, konnte ich diesen künstlerischen Rahmen nicht mental projizieren. Ich war so überwältigt, so beeindruckt, dass ich nur staunend stehen und schauen konnte. Picasso durchlief seine blaue Phase, Monet liebte Grünflächen, italienische Renaissance-Meister zeigten einen Regenbogen von Farben. Wenn ich irgendwelche Anmaßungen hatte, meine Perspektive als würdig des Titels Künstlerisch darzustellen, dann waren vor mir die Anfänge meines Bildes, der Anfang meiner Geschichte, Arbeit in Braun. \nFingerspitzen berührten mein gewähltes Kunstwerkzeug, Muskeln spannten und entspannten sich, als meine Hand durch den Raum glitt, der Wille meines Geistes nahm Gestalt und Form an, in dem, was der kreativste Moment meines Lebens hätte sein können. Wasser wirbelte, ruhig und glatt, kristallklar und sauber. Materieflocken brachen sich vom Ganzen ab und wurden ins Nichts getragen. Muskeln spannten sich, zuckten und krampften ein wenig schneller und aufgeregter beim zweiten Mal, meine Hand schlug erneut auf den Griff der Toilette.

A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)

Die National Institutes of Health erklären, dass ein Aspekt des Problems darin besteht, dass das Gehirn von Jugendlichen buchstäblich nicht bereit für die Gefahren des Fahrens ist. Einfache Unerfahrenheit liegt ebenfalls im Kern des Problems. Diese Unerfahrenheit führt nicht nur zu mehr tödlichen Unfällen, sondern auch zu einer höheren Rate von Fahrzeugüberschlägen, Geschwindigkeitsüberschreitungen und Abkommen von der Straße.  \nJugendliche schneiden auch viel schlechter ab, wenn sie mit Gleichaltrigen unterwegs sind – was jeder mit einem Funken Verstand weiß, dass sie regelmäßig tun. Das Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center führte eine Studie durch, die die folgende Korrelation zeigte: zwischen dem Alter des Passagiers und der Anzahl der Verkehrsunfälle.  \nKalifornien und andere Staaten haben versucht, die Sicherheit von jugendlichen Fahrern zu erhöhen, indem sie vorübergehende provisorische Führerscheine verlangen, die die Stunden begrenzen, in denen Teenager fahren dürfen, und andere Minderjährige als Passagiere verbieten.  \nAber provisorische Führerscheine sind meiner Meinung nach nur eine vorübergehende Lösung. Das eigentliche Problem ist, dass – als Gruppe – die jüngsten Fahrer, nach allen statistischen Indikatoren, einfach nicht in der Lage sind, die Risiken und Verantwortlichkeiten angemessen zu bewältigen. Psychologe Marvin Zuckerman glaubt, dass selbst 18 zu jung für einen regulären Führerschein ist. USA Today berichtet, dass Zuckerman Forschungen durchgeführt hat, die darauf hindeuten, dass unter 19- bis 20-Jährige ein gemeinsames Verlangen haben, Risiken einzugehen, nur um den Nervenkitzel zu spüren. Es macht also Sinn, das Fahren zumindest zu verzögern, bis die Neigung, Nervenkitzel zu suchen, beginnt, sich auszugleichen. Wenn wir weiterhin Führerscheine an junge Teenager ausgeben, werden wir nicht nur weiterhin tödliche Unfälle erleben, sondern die Zahl der Todesopfer wird in den nächsten Jahren wahrscheinlich erschreckende Ausmaße erreichen. Bis 2010 werden die Babys der Baby-Boomer berechtigt sein zu fahren, und Millionen neuer jugendlicher Fahrer werden bereit sein, auf die Straße zu gehen.  \nGesetzgebung, die sich mit diesem Problem befasst, wäre relativ unkompliziert. Schulen könnten weiterhin Fahrunterrichtskurse anbieten, um den Lernprozess für zukünftige Fahrer zu beginnen, aber niemand unter 18 Jahren dürfte ein Kraftfahrzeug betreiben. Ein vorläufiger Führerschein könnte weiterhin ausgestellt werden, bevor ein vollständiger Führerschein erteilt wird, und es wären auch weiterhin eine bestimmte Anzahl von praktischen Fahrstunden erforderlich. Die spezifische Anzahl der erforderlichen Stunden könnte auf der Anzahl der Stunden basieren, die bereits von der Mehrheit der Staaten gefordert werden (in Kalifornien sind es zum Beispiel derzeit 6 Stunden Fahrtraining und 50 Stunden Übung mit einem Erwachsenen). Da die tödlichen Statistiken für jugendliche Fahrer aus einem Querschnitt aller Staaten stammen, wäre eine einheitliche, nationale Gesetzgebung zu diesem Thema eine vernünftige – und ich glaube, wirksame – Methode, um Jugendliche im ganzen Land zu schützen.  \nDie von mir vorgeschlagene Gesetzgebung ist keineswegs eine neue Idee.\n\n[REWRITE]  \nTeenagers are losing their lives in car accidents.

    "original": "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",

Eng definiert bezieht sich (C)AP auf die Wahrnehmungsverarbeitung auditiver Informationen im ZNS und die neurobiologische Aktivität, die dieser Verarbeitung zugrunde liegt und zu elektrophysiologischen auditiven Potenzialen führt\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), was bedeutet, dass es sich um eine Störung handelt, bei der das zentrale Nervensystem (also das Gehirn) Gehörtes nicht richtig verarbeiten kann. Menschen mit CAPD können normal hören und gelten daher nicht als \"hörgeschädigt\"; vielmehr funktioniert der Bereich des Gehirns, der das Gehörte übersetzt, Wörter trennt oder Gespräche von Hintergrundgeräuschen unterscheidet, nicht so, wie er normalerweise sollte.\n\nDie früheste Erwähnung der Störung, die zu CAPD wurde, stammt aus den mittleren 1950er Jahren und wurde \"auditive Unwahrnehmung\" genannt (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), als Forscher Kinder mit Kommunikationsstörungen untersuchten. Das italienische Forscherteam Bocca, Calearo und Cassinari begann 1954, Tests für diese Kinder zu entwickeln; 1961 führte Kimura \"dichotische Tests ein und formulierte ein Modell zur Erklärung der Physiologie des CANS, die der dichotischen Wahrnehmung zugrunde liegt\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Eine nationale Konferenz im Jahr 1977 stimulierte die Forschung zu Kindern mit CAPD.\n\nCAPD äußert sich auf verschiedene Weise: Die betroffene Person kann möglicherweise nicht lokalisieren oder Schall im Raum hören; Schwierigkeiten haben, zwischen zwei oder mehr \"akustischen Ereignissen\" (Schallvorkommen) zu unterscheiden; nicht in der Lage sein, Klangmuster zu erkennen; Veränderungen in der Sprache nicht unterscheiden können (wie das Erkennen von Sarkasmus aufgrund von Stimmveränderungen); ein Geräusch kann durch ein nachfolgendes Geräusch blockiert werden; möglicherweise nicht in der Lage, Klanghinweise zu synthetisieren (das heißt, sie auf eine sinnvolle Weise zu interpretieren, auf die sie dann reagieren können); und möglicherweise nicht in der Lage, die Reihenfolge zu bestimmen, in der auditive Informationen präsentiert werden (Ferre).\n\nUm CAPD zu diagnostizieren, muss der Patient mit \"systematischer Beobachtung des Hörverhaltens und/oder Leistung in Tests der auditiven Funktion\" untersucht werden, die von \"Audiologen, SLPs, Psychologen und anderen unter Verwendung einer Vielzahl von Maßnahmen durchgeführt werden, die auf auditive Fähigkeiten abzielen\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Dies kann Fragebögen und Umfragen, Beobachtung von auditiven Verhaltensweisen, einschließlich der Reaktion des Patienten auf bestimmte Reize, umfassen. Derzeit gibt es kein einheitliches Werkzeug oder Test mit hoher diagnostischer Erfolgsrate, und es ist keine Ursache für die Störung bekannt. Viele der verwendeten Tests präsentieren dem Patienten mehrere gleichzeitige auditive Reize und fordern ihn dann auf, bestimmte Elemente zu unterscheiden, wie eine Reihe von Wörtern oder Zahlen. Fortgeschrittenere Tests beinhalten die Aufzeichnung akustischer Signale im Ohr und die Messung der Reaktionen auf diese Signale.\n\n[REWRITE]This article addresses three aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Then, the diagnosis is explained, along with common characteristics or \"red flags\". Finally, the article concludes with ways a teacher in a mainstream classroom can assist a student with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), \"refers to the efficiency and effectiveness with which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiological activity underlying that processing, leading to electrophysiological auditory potentials\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder where the central nervous system (i.e., the brain) cannot properly process what is heard. People with CAPD have normal hearing and are not considered \"hearing impaired\"; rather, the brain area that translates what we hear, separating words or distinguishing conversation from background noise, does not function as it typically should.\n\nThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, referred to as \"auditory imperception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were studying children with communication disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari started developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura introduced \"dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference in 1977 stimulated research on children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD can manifest in various ways: the affected person may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have trouble distinguishing between two or more \"acoustic events\" (sound occurrences); may not recognize sound patterns; may not differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on voice changes); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not synthesize sound cues (that is, interpret them meaningfully to act upon); and may not determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with \"systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function\", which may be conducted by \"audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using various measures that evaluate auditory-related skills\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This can include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. Currently, there is no single tool or test consistently used with a high rate of diagnostic success, and no known cause for the disorder. Many tests present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to these signals.[/REWRITE]",

The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",

Die soziokulturellen Modelle betrachten Umweltbeziehungen und deren Anwendungen auf Rasse, Ethnizität, Demografie und sozioökonomischen Status. Die folgende Insomnie-Übersicht untersucht diese Modelle und erklärt jede ausgewählte Forschung, um sie in Beziehung zu setzen und die Modelle besser zu erklären. Die Erklärungen der Forschung und deren Ergebnisse werden dann kritisch analysiert, um ihre spezifischen Stärken und Schwächen zu erwähnen.\n\nEine Schlafstörung kann als primäre Schlafstörung, als Schlafstörung im Zusammenhang mit einer anderen psychischen Störung oder als Schlafstörung im Zusammenhang mit anderen Problemen charakterisiert werden. Die primären Schlafstörungen sind Dyssomnien oder Parasomnien, während Schlafstörungen im Zusammenhang mit einer anderen psychischen Störung mit einer Achse-I- oder Achse-II-Störung in Verbindung stehen. Andere Kategorien von Schlafstörungen können auf medizinische Komplikationen oder die Einnahme einer Substanz zurückzuführen sein. Die Dyssomnien sind: Primäre Insomnie, Primäre Hypersomnie, Narkolepsie, Atmungsbedingte Schlafstörung, Schlafstörung im zirkadianen Rhythmus und Dyssomnie nicht anderweitig spezifiziert (NOS). Während die primäre Insomnie eine Komplikation beim ausreichenden oder aufrechterhaltenen Schlaf darstellt, ist die primäre Hypersomnie eine Schwierigkeit beim Wachbleiben, beide für mindestens einen Monat. Narkolepsie beinhaltet Kataplexie und/oder automatischen REM. Während die Dyssomnien sich darauf konzentrieren, einzuschlafen und schlafend zu bleiben, sind die Parasomnien Schlafstörungen, die mit Verhaltensauffälligkeiten und/oder physiologischen Vorkommnissen verbunden sind. Parasomnien sind Albtraumstörung, Schlafangststörung, Schlafwandelstörung und Parasomnien nicht anderweitig spezifiziert. Die Schlafstörungen im Zusammenhang mit einer anderen psychischen Störung beinhalten Schlafschwierigkeiten aufgrund von Achse I (Klinische Störungen) oder Achse II (Persönlichkeitsstörungen oder geistige Behinderung). Die folgende Übersicht konzentriert sich auf Insomnie und etwas auf primäre Schlafstörungen im Allgemeinen in Bezug auf die biologischen und soziokulturellen Modelle.\n\nDas biologische Modell von Schlafstörungen konzentriert sich auf Gene, erbliche Faktoren und physiologisch erworbene Aspekte von Schlafstörungen. Neuronen im Hypothalamus, die Orexin enthalten, sind verantwortlich für die Regulierung von Schlaf und Wachheit. Diese Studie experimentierte mit Mäusen und fand heraus, dass es phänotypische GABAB-Rezeptoren auf den Orexin-Neuronen gibt, die speziell für Schlaf-/Wachzustände verantwortlich sind. Die Aktivierung des GABAA-Rezeptors induziert Reaktionen, die den Schlaf fördern. Wenn es daran gehindert wird, zu feuern, kann dies die Angst reduzieren und den Schlaf fördern. Der GABAB-Agonist (Baclofen) erhöhte die Schlafzeit (Matsuki et al., 2009). Solche Ergebnisse implizieren, dass die Tiermodelle von Mäusen auf Studien beim Menschen verallgemeinert werden können. Dies zeigt, dass es eine genetische und umweltbedingte Grundlage für den physischen GABAB-Rezeptor beim Menschen gibt. Ein Problem oder Fehlen dieses Rezeptors könnte die Fähigkeit, ohne Medikamente ausreichend zu schlafen, verändern. Die soziokulturelle Implikation dieser Studie ist, dass, wenn der Phänotyp vererbt wurde, dies den Schlaf regulieren könnte, und eine Veränderung des Rezeptors würde den Schlaf eines Individuums natürlich stören. Dies würde sich negativ auf Lebensaspekte wie Schule, Karriere und alltägliche Ereignisse auswirken, die monotone Aufgaben und Konzentration erfordern.\n\n[REWRITE]  \nThe following paper discusses the biological and sociocultural models concerning the sleep disorder insomnia.

For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",

But the bike alone won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be designed to meet the needs of bicyclists.\n\nI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after several years away from it. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. \"Bikes are great,\" he said, \"for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.\" In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a bit of physical effort will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in the Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can reduce that time to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only issue is, Pollock Road is the straightest route to the Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally, I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare.\n\n[REWRITE]I have been a student at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, myself included, navigating the campus can be a challenge. During my freshman year, I was housed in an East Halls dorm, which is nearly the furthest point east on campus, apart from the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from my dorm in Stuart Hall to classes in distant locations like the Willard building, near the campus center, could take up to 25 minutes, especially in bad weather, which is common in State College. An alum, not much older than me, told me that not long ago, East Halls were separated from the rest of the school by large stretches of unused land. Nowadays, that space has been filled with sports fields and major new buildings like the new Creamery and health services, surrounded by apartments. As the campus continues to expand, moving from one place to another becomes increasingly difficult. What is the best solution for mobility issues? On a college campus, it's the bicycle. However, bicycles alone won't solve the problem. Students have to use them, and the campus needs to be designed to accommodate cyclists.\n\nI was speaking to a friend who recently started cycling again after several years. He remarked on why he ever stopped. \"Bikes are fantastic,\" he said, \"for a while, it wasn't trendy to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" Besides being good for your health, cycling is the most efficient way to travel.

Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",

Die Menschen dort schätzen die Gemeinschaft über das Individuum und sind von Anfang an darauf konditioniert, sofortiges Glück über alles zu suchen. Die Bürger werden als Figuren in einem größeren Spiel entlarvt, die an eine Ideologie gebunden sind, wie sie vom Weltkontrolleur vorgegeben wird. Bei der Untersuchung des Werks durch die Brille des marxistischen Theismus bemerkt man die zugrunde liegenden Bedenken des Autors in Bezug auf die Entwicklung der genannten Systeme. Häufige Begriffe im Marxismus, wie Homogenität und Verdinglichung, unterstreichen die Idee, dass Huxleys Roman ein Kommentar zu den Fehlern der aufkommenden Wirtschaft seiner Zeit ist. Der Kapitalismus wird durch die Verwendung der marxistischen These der falschen Bewusstseinsbildung satirisch dargestellt. Im Wesentlichen wird der gewöhnlichen Bürgerschaft verwehrt, die wahren Beziehungen zu anderen Klassen in wirtschaftlichen Begriffen zu erkennen, da sie in erster Linie an ihrem eigenen Gewinn interessiert sind. Es wird gesagt, dass dies das Ergebnis der ideologischen Kontrolle des Proletariats und der einfachen Arbeiter ist, was durch die Konditionierung der Menschen in \"Brave New World\" ziemlich offensichtlich ist. Die allgemeinen Klassen, Delta, Gamma usw., haben keinen wirklichen eigenen Willen; durch Hypnopädie wird der Drang zu konsumieren, auszugeben und zu genießen über alles andere verstärkt. Dies wird, wie bereits erwähnt, vom Weltkontrolleur manipuliert. Hegemonie, im Wesentlichen die Idee, dass Gruppen von sozialen Klassen von einer separaten Gruppe von Individuen in ihrer Gesamtheit dominiert werden, wird in diesem Fall offensichtlich verwendet. Die unteren Klassen sind sich der Manipulation nicht bewusst und ‚kaufen‘ im wahrsten Sinne des Wortes eine Ideologie, die diese Struktur unterstützt (d.h. Kapitalismus & Konsumismus). Die oberen Klassen sind mit der Fähigkeit geboren, sich dessen bewusst zu sein, tun aber nichts; nur wenige Alphas oder Betas, abgesehen von Charakteren wie Bernard, tun mehr, als ihren Platz zu akzeptieren. Tatsächlich sind die Interaktionen der sozialen Klassen, wie ausführlicher diskutiert werden wird, bedeutende Hinweise auf die wahrgenommene Unterdrückung durch den Kapitalismus. Beziehungen zwischen unterschiedlichen Individuen existieren in \"Brave New World\" nicht. Der Roman scheint sich zu weigern, die Charaktere zu unterscheiden - sogar unter den Hauptcharakteren fehlt es an Tiefe. Vielleicht deutet Huxley an, dass der Aufstieg von Technologie und Kapitalismus zusammen den Menschen ihres freien Willens und Ausdrucks beraubt. Liebe existiert nicht, noch gibt es die Extreme irgendeiner Emotion; vielmehr bleiben die Interaktionen oberflächlich, deutlich dargestellt durch die Bemerkungen der Männer über Frauen, die sich hauptsächlich auf ihr körperliches Erscheinungsbild beziehen (z.B. pneumatische Qualität), und die ungenierten Kommentare der Frauen über ihre Begegnungen, sozusagen. Darüber hinaus weist die Zufriedenheit jeder gesellschaftlichen Klasse mit ihrem Status in der Hierarchie auf die sozioökonomischen Auswirkungen des Kapitalismus hin. Ihr absolutes Gehorsam gegenüber ihrem Teil in der Gemeinschaft ist ein Hinweis auf die marxistische Vorstellung vom Proletariat, das fälschlicherweise in dem Glauben gelassen wird, seiner eigenen Überlegenheit über alles andere sicher zu sein, solange sie weiter konsumieren, gehorchen und mit dem Rest ihrer Kollegen in Einklang bleiben.\n\n[REWRITE]Aldous Huxley critiques the looming threat of technology and capitalism, which is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in his novel \"Brave New World.\" The society in the book values community over the individual and conditions its people from the start to seek immediate happiness above all else.

Eines der Hauptthemen der hitzigen Diskussion in der Klasse war, ob der Islam eine feindliche Religion ist oder nicht. Ich glaube, dass diese Frage heute relevanter ist als je zuvor. Rückblickend auf die Ereignisse seit dem 11. September habe ich persönlich beobachtet, wie sich die Massenmedien von einer feindlichen Sicht auf den Islam und Extremisten zu einer extremen Form der Toleranz gegenüber dem Islam in Amerika entwickelt haben. Ich denke nicht, dass wir im Jahr 2001 jemals einen Präsidentschaftskandidaten mit dem Namen Borac Obama hätten haben können, der offensichtlich einen muslimischen Hintergrund in seiner Familie hat.\n\nDie Biografie des Propheten fasziniert mich, weil sie, soweit ich die Geschichte Muhammads kenne, im Widerspruch zu seiner Persönlichkeit steht. Aus dem, was ich weiß und in der Vergangenheit gelernt habe, dachte ich, dass Muhammad Menschen zum Islam zwang. Er eroberte Stämme und übernahm sie, um sie dann zur Annahme des Islam zu zwingen. Aber laut der Biografie wurde Muhammad als eine Art Märtyrer dargestellt, der missverstanden wurde und sich sogar anderen gegenüber demütigte. Danach kamen die Menschen nacheinander, um die 'Wahrheit' in seiner Lehre zu erkennen und suchten ihn auf.\n\nEs gibt auch einige unheimliche Ähnlichkeiten zwischen den Diensten Jesu und den 'Wundern' Muhammads. Das offensichtlichste ist, als er Hammelfleisch und Milch nahm und sie so vervielfältigte, dass es für vierzig Männer mehr als genug gab. Diese Art von Schreiben lässt mich glauben, dass die Autoren wollten, dass Muhammad als bescheidener Prophet wahrgenommen wird, der nichts beweisen musste, sondern einfach in Wahrheit und Wundern lebte. Diese Art von Fehlschluss ist am schlimmsten, weil sie das Wunder und das Leben von Jesus Christus herabsetzt. Für mich ist es, als würden sie versuchen, das Leben und die Persönlichkeit von Jesus durch Muhammad zu stehlen und sich dafür Anerkennung zu verschaffen.\n\nEs gibt auch viele Geschichten in der Biografie, die es so erscheinen lassen, als sei es Teil ihrer Agenda, Beweise für das 'Zeugnis' oder dafür zu liefern, wie Menschen 'von selbst' zum Islam konvertierten. Aber das Problem ist, dass viele der Geschichten zumindest aus einer Perspektive einer dritten Partei stammen. In der Geschichte veranschaulicht der Autor, dass er von so-und-so gehört hat, der von so-und-so gehört hat usw. Das gefiel mir nicht besonders, denn obwohl ihre Idee war, dass es den Wahrheitsgehalt der Geschichten beweise, fand ich, dass es die Geschichten herabsetzte und sie umso verdächtiger erscheinen ließ.\n\nIch denke, das, was mich an diesem Werk am meisten stört, ist, dass sie versuchen, Muhammad als einen göttlichen Mann darzustellen, der bescheiden, liebenswert, weise und sanft war. Aber die Geschichte widerspricht der Vorstellung, dass Muhammad ein sanfter und bescheidener Mann war, und ich kann nicht anders, als zu denken, ob Muslime heute die wahre Geschichte hinter Muhammads Aufstieg zur Macht kennen.\n\n[REWRITE]  \nAlmost four years ago, I took a course on Islam at CBC.

    "transformed": "The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his life were swiftly put aside in the development of Christian thought that advanced after his time. Looking at this history broadly, we see Christianity gradually moving further from its origins. Today's world seems to reflect a growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive trend. While traditional individuals still exist and will resist any thinking beyond what they were taught, this portion of the population may not be influential enough to sway the entirety. Among Christians, historical awareness will grow immensely in the coming years. A yearning will spread to distinguish the doctrines added over time to Christianity from the religion's original intent.

    "raw_output": "Sure, here's the translation process:\n\n**English to German:**\n\nIch glaube, dass \"The Jungle\" zeigt, wie Menschen tief im Inneren von Natur aus gierig und egoistisch sind. Sie wollen nur für sich selbst sorgen und ihr Leben so gut wie möglich machen, aber sie kümmern sich nie um jemanden, der unter ihnen steht. \"The Jungle\" zeigt dies auf viele Arten. Der offensichtlichste Bereich sind die Besitzer und Manager der großen Fabriken. Alles, was sie tun wollen, ist, ihre Unternehmen und Fabriken so groß und großartig wie möglich zu machen. Sie kümmern sich nicht um irgendjemanden oder irgendetwas, das ihnen im Weg steht oder verletzt wird wegen ihres Fortschritts. Laut Upton Sinclairs Werk, \"Die Linie der Gebäude stand klar und schwarz gegen den Himmel; hier und da erhoben sich aus der Masse die großen Schornsteine, mit dem Fluss von Rauch, der bis ans Ende der Welt strömte\". Sinclair versucht, ein Bild von dem großen Schaden zu malen, den diese Verschmutzung verursacht. Er zeigt, dass die Besitzer keinerlei Rücksicht auf Menschen oder Tiere nehmen, die verletzt werden könnten. Sie kümmern sich nicht um die großen Rauchfahnen, die aus den Fabriken aufsteigen, oder um den Abfluss von Tierkot und Urin aus den Tausenden von Ställen rund um Packingtown. Die Besitzer und Manager kümmerten sich auch nicht um ihre Mitarbeiter, die sie reich machten. Sie würden alles tun, um einen zusätzlichen Dollar zu verdienen oder zu sparen. \"Von oben bis unten ist der Ort einfach ein brodelnder Kessel von Eifersüchteleien und Hass; es gibt nirgendwo Treue oder Anstand, es gibt keinen Ort, an dem ein Mensch etwas gegen einen Dollar zählt\". Sie zwingen ihre Mitarbeiter, schreckliche Stunden zu arbeiten, und dann könnten sie ohne Vorwarnung ganze Massen von Menschen entlassen, ohne Entschädigung oder Hilfe bei der Arbeitssuche. Während der Zeit, in der \"The Jungle\" spielt, gab es nicht viele, wenn überhaupt, Gesetze oder Vorschriften zum Schutz der Sicherheit oder des Wohlergehens der Arbeiter. Dies erlaubte es den Managern und Besitzern, wild herumzulaufen, ihre Mitarbeiter dazu zu zwingen, den Fortschritt zu beschleunigen und unter schrecklichen Bedingungen zu arbeiten. Obwohl das Buch es nie direkt sagt, wurde von den Menschen, die in Packingtown lebten und arbeiteten, einfach erwartet, dass sie mit den schrecklichen Bedingungen sowohl bei der Arbeit in den Fabriken als auch beim Leben um sie herum zurechtkommen. Es gab keine Agenturen oder Organisationen, die Informationen oder Hilfe für den Arbeiter bereitstellten. Es gab Gewerkschaften, die gegründet wurden, aber diese richteten oft mehr Schaden als Nutzen an, da sie von den armen Arbeitern profitierten. Die Arbeiter wurden so schlecht behandelt und hatten keinen Ausweg aus dem System von Packingtown, dass sie als Sklaven beschrieben wurden: \"Hier ist eine Bevölkerung, von niedrigem Stand und meist ausländisch, die ständig am Rande des Hungers hängt und für ihre Lebensmöglichkeiten von der Laune der Männer abhängt, ebenso brutal und skrupellos wie die Sklaventreiber der alten Zeit; unter solchen Umständen ist Unmoral genauso unvermeidlich und weit verbreitet wie unter dem System der Sklaverei.\"\n\n**German back to English:**\n\nI believe that \"The Jungle\" shows how humans, deep down, are naturally greedy and self-centered.

Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson.

Vergil benutzte den Begriff in Bezug auf eine Insel nördlich von Großbritannien, die die Griechen als Rand der bekannten Welt betrachteten.

Arndt bemerkt in seinem Buch \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon\" die Ähnlichkeit ihrer beiden Gedichte und zieht die Schlussfolgerung, dass Poe Goethe nachahmte. \nDas Oxford Companion to English Literature sagt über Goethe, dass er ein gefeierter Dichter des poetischen Dramas Faust war, das in zwei Teilen veröffentlicht wurde, der erste 1808 und der zweite im Jahr von Goethes Tod 1832. In der poetischen Dichtung des zweiten Teils von Faust liegt ein kurzes Gedicht mit dem Titel \"Der König von Thule\". Das Gedicht handelt von einem König, dessen Frau stirbt, nachdem sie ihm den Kelch geschenkt hat. Nachdem seine Frau verstorben ist, beginnt er stark zu trinken und vor Trauer über den Verlust seiner verstorbenen Königin zu weinen. Dann entscheidet er, dass es Zeit für ihn ist zu sterben und überlässt seinen Kindern seinen Besitz, außer dem Kelch. Dann geht er zu einer Klippe, wirft den Kelch ins Meer, schließt seine Augen und stirbt. Das Verhalten des Königs von Thule und die Beschreibung des Königs in Dream-Land sind sehr ähnlich, vielleicht ein dunkler Doppelgänger von Poes Verlust und seiner Neigung zum Trinken. Faust wurde auch 1842 von H. P. Grattan in ein romantisches Drama umgewandelt, weniger als ein Jahr bevor Poe den Begriff Thule in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" verwendete. \nPoe erwähnt Thule zweimal in seinen gesammelten Schriften. Einmal bezieht sich Poe auf \"ultima Thule\" in The Pit and the Pendulum, aber er verwendet diesen Ausdruck in \"Dream-Land\" zweimal als Rahmen für das Gedicht. \"Der König von Thule\" und \"Dream-Land\" können als Begleitstücke gelesen werden. In \"Dream-Land\" sagt der Sprecher. Er beschreibt dann die Landschaft von Thule und wie sie dunkel und einsam ist, er wird von toten Freunden heimgesucht und sieht eine schattierte Welt ohne Farbe. All diese Szenen würden in \"Der König von Thule\" von Goethe gelesen werden, da er gerade seine Frau verloren hat, einsam ist und seinen Willen zu herrschen oder sogar zu leben verloren hat. Das gesamte Gedicht ist eine Beschreibung, als ob der Sprecher in Goethes Gedicht eingetreten wäre. \nGoethe war ein bedeutender Autor, den Poe gekannt hätte, wenn auch aus keinem anderen Grund als wegen seines Respekts für Tennyson.

To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable.

Ein Richter wird Jennifer Palmers Anspruch auf Strafschadenersatz wahrscheinlich nicht ohne Weiteres abweisen. Um einen Anspruch auf Strafschadenersatz zu begründen, muss der Kläger nachweisen, dass die Handlungen des Beklagten mit einem wissentlichen und bewussten Missachten des wahrscheinlichen Schadens begangen wurden, der aus dem Verhalten resultieren würde, und dass das Verhalten verachtenswert war. Palmer kann argumentieren, dass Martin das wahrscheinliche Risiko hätte kennen müssen, die Verschüttung nicht zu beseitigen, da mehrere D&D-Kunden in den Monaten vor Palmers Unfall durch Ausrutschen verletzt wurden; und trotz dieses Wissens versäumte er es, die Verschüttung zu beseitigen. Palmers Argumentation, dass Martins Handlungen verachtenswert waren, ist weniger überzeugend, aber angesichts der Tatsache, dass im Jahr 2009 sechs Ausrutschunfälle passiert waren und Martin dennoch versäumte, geeignete Maßnahmen zur Sicherung seines Geschäfts zu ergreifen, immer noch nachvollziehbar. Am 13. Oktober 2009 um 17:00 Uhr informierte Rich Wayne, ein Mitarbeiter von D&D Markets, seinen Manager Paul Martin darüber, dass es einen Apfelmus-Verschüttung in einem Gang gab. Martin sagte Wayne, dass er in der Abendpause sei und \"keine Zeit habe, sich mit Kundenbeschwerden zu befassen.\" Um 17:15 Uhr informierte eine andere Mitarbeiterin, Mary J.

Das Gesetz definiert Böswilligkeit als Verhalten, das darauf abzielt, Schaden zu verursachen, oder in Ermangelung von Absicht muss das Verhalten \"verachtenswert\" und mit \"einem wissentlichen und bewussten Missachten der Rechte oder der Sicherheit anderer\" begangen werden. id. bei § (c)(1). Gerichte haben Verhalten als böswillig charakterisiert, wenn es mit einem bewussten Missachten der Rechte des Klägers begangen wurde, wenn der Beklagte \"sich der wahrscheinlichen gefährlichen Konsequenzen seines Verhaltens bewusst war und es absichtlich und vorsätzlich versäumte, diese Konsequenzen zu vermeiden.\" Taylor v.

Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).\n\n[REWRITE]Under California law, a customer injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store could be awarded punitive damages by demonstrating that the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice about the spill and failed to have it cleaned for half an hour because he was eating dinner. A judge is not likely to immediately dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages. To justify a claim for punitive damages, a plaintiff must provide evidence that the defendant's actions were taken with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, and that the conduct was despicable. Palmer could argue that Martin should have been aware of the probable harm of not cleaning up a spill, as several D&D customers had been injured from slipping in the months before Palmer's accident; despite this knowledge, he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer's argument that Martin's actions were despicable is less convincing but still reasonable given the fact that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate measures to ensure the safety of his store. On October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne, an employee of D&D Markets, informed his manager, Paul Martin, that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and \"didn't have time to deal with customer complaints.\" At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded in the same way. At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer's accident, five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are considering whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damage claim.

She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear.

    "original": "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",

Zunächst erlaubte die burmesische Regierung widerwillig den Mönchen, sich friedlich zu versammeln, doch bald eskalierte die Gewalt in einen Konflikt, den manche als offenen Krieg zwischen den Mönchen und der Militärjunta betrachteten, wobei das Militär aktiv Klöster im ganzen Land überfiel und plünderte. Ausländische Journalisten wurden zusammengetrieben und vor Ort inhaftiert, ein japanischer Fotojournalist namens Kenji Nagai wurde am 27.

Während die offizielle Zahl der Todesopfer bei 13 liegt, wird Oberst Hla Win, der einige Tage vor dem offiziellen Bericht aus der Armee übergelaufen war, mit den Worten zitiert: \"In den letzten Tagen sind viel mehr Menschen getötet worden, als Sie gehört haben. Die Leichen sind in mehreren Tausend zu zählen.\"\n\nDas ist nichts Neues. Während dies einige der jüngsten Beispiele für Gräueltaten in unserer Welt sind, gibt es den Wunsch einer Regierung, abweichende Meinungen zu unterdrücken und die vollständige Herrschaft über ihre Bürger zu behalten, schon so lange wie die Zivilisation selbst. Frühe römische Kaiser erklärten sich selbst als von den Göttern auserwählt, um die vollständige exekutive Herrschaft über jeden Aspekt ihrer Gesellschaft zu haben. Japanische Kaiser werden als Götter angesehen, die in unsere Welt gesandt wurden, um ihr Volk durch die Erfindung von Motorola-Handys und Harakiri zum Wohlstand zu führen, und unser derzeitiger Präsident George W. Bush hat wöchentliche Telefonkonferenzen mit Ted Haggard, dem Leiter von Stupid People Worldwide, einer Tochtergruppe der Republikanischen Partei.\n\nEinige der bekanntesten Beispiele solcher Handlungen sind Vorfälle wie der Protest am 4. Juni 1989 auf dem Tiananmen-Platz, bei dem sich Intellektuelle, Arbeitsaktivisten und Studenten versammelten, um gegen die autoritäre Herrschaft der Regierung zu protestieren. Die Zahl der Todesopfer in diesem speziellen Fall variiert stark, mit offiziellen Berichten der chinesischen Regierung, die 200-300 Tote angeben, gegenüber Berichten des chinesischen Roten Kreuzes, das 2.000-3.000 Tote erklärt. Ein weiteres Beispiel ist der Völkermord in Ruanda in den 1990er Jahren, bei dem Hutu-Milizgruppen, unterstützt von der ruandischen Regierung, eine systematische Tötung aller Tutsis sowie politischer Moderater begannen, unabhängig von ihrem ethnischen Hintergrund. Hitlers 'Drittes Reich', eine Periode, die sich über mehrere Jahre und Länder erstreckte, in der jeder jüdischer Abstammung zusammengetrieben und getötet wurde, ist ein weiteres extremes Beispiel.\n\n[REWRITE]Hitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, the star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner holding a piece of cardboard above her head, with a disturbing message scribbled on it with a Sharpie. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian country ruled by a tyrannical military junta that seized power in 1962 through a coup. In 2007, a series of street protests took place, marking the first public demonstrations in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests were called \"The Saffron Revolution,\" named after the color of the monks' robes. After the initial uprisings, the general public began to take an interest in the protests. Initially, the Burmese government reluctantly allowed the monks to hold peaceful gatherings, but soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries across the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, and a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai was killed on September 27, 2007, simply for attending a street protest. While the official death toll is listed as 13, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army a few days before the official report, is quoted as saying, \"Many more people have been killed in recent days than you've heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.\"\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities occurring in our world, a government's desire to suppress dissent and maintain complete control over its citizens has existed as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to exert complete executive control over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are considered to be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, holds weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republican Party.\n\nSome of the most well-known examples of such actions include events like the June 4, 1989 protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students gathered to protest the government's authoritarian rule. The death toll in that particular instance varies widely, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead, compared to reports from the Chinese Red Cross declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead. Another example is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis and political moderates, regardless of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler's 'Third Reich,' a period spanning several years and countries where anyone of Jewish descent was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example.[/REWRITE]",

Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound.

Ellingtons Präsenz am Klavier ist in vielen der für diese Aufgabe ausgewählten Kompositionen subtil, aber als Komponist glänzte Ellington darin, reiche und komplexe Stücke zu schaffen, die die individuellen Fähigkeiten der Bandmitglieder zur Geltung brachten. Ellington gestaltete das Gerüst, in dem ein Solist frei improvisieren konnte, zusätzlich zu den dicht orchestrierten Stücken und Phrasen, die den speziellen Stil der Bandmitglieder nutzten, um musikalische Ideen hervorzuheben. Dabei betonte er auch den Klang des Orchesters im Allgemeinen und schuf kohärente und originelle Klänge, die zu jedem Stück passten. Ellingtons Beherrschung des individuellen Klangs der Spieler und wie sie in einem wachsenden Ensemble zusammenpassen, ermöglichte es ihm, einige der innovativsten und brillantesten Stücke in der Jazzgeschichte zu schreiben. \n\nDas Grove Music Wörterbuch erwähnt in der Diskussion über Ellingtons Klang und Innovation Creole Love Call im Zusammenhang mit der Nutzung der Stimme „als Jazzinstrument“ während seiner gesamten Karriere. Dies ist ein frühes Beispiel für Ellingtons Einsatz der Stimme, um Textur und Farbe hinzuzufügen, ohne durch Texte behindert zu werden. Creole Love Call zeigt auch Ellingtons Fähigkeit, den Stil seiner Solisten zu ergänzen, was sich durch seine gesamte Karriere zieht. Dieses langsame, bedachte Zwölf-Takt-Blues-Stück enthält sechs Chorusse, wie folgt:\nChorus 1: Ruf und Antwort zwischen Stimme und Holzbläsern, wobei die Stimme sanft und melodisch beginnt und dann gegen Ende zu einem raueren Klang übergeht.\nChorus 2: Gedämpftes Trompetensolo, das die Grundmelodie ausarbeitet und mehrere erweiterte blaue Noten betont.\nChorus 3: Schwingendes Klarinettensolo im hohen Register, unterstützt durch eine subtile synkopierte Klavierphrase.\nChorus 4: Das gesamte Orchester wiederholt den ersten Chorus mit einem Ruf und Antwort zwischen Blech- und Holzbläsern.\nChorus 5: Der Höhepunkt des Stückes, da die Holzbläser nun den Ruf und die Antwort im hohen Register beginnen, unterstützt durch synkopierte Stopptakt aus den Blech- und Rhythmusgruppen.\nChorus 6: Eine Rückkehr zur Struktur des ersten Chorus, mit Ruf und Antwort zwischen Stimme und Holzbläsern. In diesem Chorus nimmt die Stimme den Klang der „Growl“-Technik an und soliert als Instrument.\nTag: Kurzer Tag mit einem vokalen Lauf und einem dissonanten Neuheitsschluss durch eine Posaune.\nEllingtons Einsatz der Stimme, um diesem Stück eine Dimension von Klangfarbe hinzuzufügen, ist ein Beispiel für ein stilistisches Merkmal, das sein Werk durchdringt. \n\nIn Hot and Bothered, aufgenommen ein Jahr später, verbindet Ellington seine Fähigkeit zur engen Orchestrierung mit seinem Gehör für Klangfarbe. Eine Ruf-und-Antwort-Phrase zwischen „Bubber“ Miley auf gedämpfter Trompete und Baby Coxs Scat-Gesang nutzt die vokalen Elemente von Mileys Spiel und die instrumentalen Aspekte von Coxs Stimme, um einen reichen und komplementären Klang zu erzeugen. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) erweitert diese Ideen, indem Ellington Joe „Tricky Sam“ Nanton, ein fester Bestandteil von Ellingtons Orchester, wirkungsvoll einsetzt, um die Melodie auf gedämpfter Posaune einzuführen.\n\n[REWRITE]Duke Ellington's influence in jazz largely stems from his long career and his creative ability to shape his orchestra.

Unsere Studie untersucht, wie mathematisches Modellieren von ontogenetischen und phylogenetischen Veränderungen in Prunum, in Kombination mit experimentellen Studien, genutzt werden kann, um die Mechanismen zu erhellen, die an der Richtung und dem Ausmaß der evolutionär-entwicklungsbiologischen Veränderung beteiligt sind. Wir verwendeten Röntgenbilder von Prunum-Arten, um quantitative Parameter zu bestimmen, die wiederum verwendet werden könnten, um hypothetische und tatsächliche Skelettmorphologien zu modellieren. Diese Parameter wurden in das Softwareprogramm CerioShell (Stone, 1995) eingegeben.

    "original": "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",

Here's the translation process.\n\n**English to German:**\n\nDie Klassifizierung von Populärmusik hat sich in den letzten 100 Jahren so stark erweitert, dass es schwierig ist, alle Genres endgültig aufzulisten. Erschwerend kommt hinzu, dass die meisten, wenn nicht alle Genres—Rap, Rock, Country, Jazz, Folk, um nur einige zu nennen—mehrere Sub- und Sub-Sub-Genres innerhalb ihres Bereichs hervorgebracht haben. Man könnte argumentieren, dass das Sub-Genre des Heavy Metal Rock in den letzten 40 Jahren zu einem der vielfältigsten und ausdrucksstärksten Genres der gesamten populären Musik geworden ist. Es ist ausdrucksstark, weil es ein breites Spektrum an Emotionen zeigt, obwohl sie dazu neigen, sich eher zur dunkleren Seite des Spektrums zu neigen. Es ist vielfältig, da kurz nach den Anfängen des Genres die Menschen zu erkennen begannen, dass es echte Flexibilität hatte und begannen, dies zu nutzen, um ihr eigenes Sub-Genre zu kreieren, dem dann Sub-Sub-Genres folgten, und die Kette setzt sich bis heute fort.\n\nHeute haben wir einen Punkt in der Heavy-Metal-Bewegung erreicht, an dem es so viele Nischen von Gruppen gibt, dass es schwer ist, genau zu bestimmen, was Heavy Metal ist. Es hat so viele Themen aus anderen Genres aufgenommen, aber wie alles andere ist es irgendwoher entstanden. Um die Metal-Musik, die heute überall existiert, richtig zu verstehen, muss man zuerst verstehen, was die Metal-Bewegung ist und warum sie eine Bewegung und nicht nur ein Genre ist.\n\nMetal ist in vielerlei Hinsicht eine Bewegung, die durch Dunkelheit definiert ist. Metal kann als „Musik des Mehr“ betrachtet werden—mehr Bass, mehr Lautstärke, mehr Gewalt, mehr Theatralik. Weniger Primitivismus, mehr Können; Menschen in Metal-Bands wissen wirklich, wie man ihr Instrument spielt, und das zeigt sich in der Musik. Metal ist auch—obwohl es vielleicht nicht überraschen mag—eine Bewegung, die stark durch Drogen beeinflusst ist. In den mittleren 70er Jahren gab es einen psychedelischen Drogenboom, der dazu führte, dass die Menschen verrückter wurden, was sie dazu brachte, verrückte, andereweltliche Platten zu machen und die Drogen als Sündenbock für ihre Kreationen zu benutzen. Es besitzt viele dunkle, viszerale Qualitäten, die auf der Musikszene sehr neu waren, da eine große Menge populärer Musik Qualitäten hatte, die nicht der dunkleren Seite des emotionalen Spektrums entsprachen. Auch spätere Generationen von Metal haben einige ihrer Einflüsse aus den dunklen, viszeralen Qualitäten gezogen, die in der Romantik so präsent waren. Texte wie die folgenden drücken die Dunkelheit aus, die ein solches Grundelement der Bewegung ist: (Byrne)\n\nDiese Texte aus Helter Skelter zeigen die dunklere Seite der Beatles. Sie zeigt ein Auf und Ab, angeblich das der Drogen. Dieses Lied wird von einigen als eines der ersten Heavy-Metal-Lieder angesehen. Es war eine Antwort auf ein Lied der Rolling Stones, das ebenfalls auf der schwereren, dunkleren Seite lag. Die Beatles wollten beweisen, dass sie genauso schwer wie die Stones sein konnten, also setzten sie dieses Lied auf das Weiße Album.\n\n**German back to English:**\n\nThe classification of popular music has expanded so much over the past 100 years that it is difficult to list all the genres definitively.

    "original": "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",

    "raw_output": "Einige Jahrzehnte bevor die surrealistischen Künstler begannen, ihre traumähnlichen Werke zu malen, schuf der Künstler Henri Rousseau sorgfältig seine eigenen Träume, buchstäblich und im übertragenen Sinne. Das Gemälde Der Traum von 1910 des berühmten Post-Impressionisten stellt nicht nur eine Frau dar, die voller Ehrfurcht die Wunder des Landes bewundert, das sie im Traum besucht, sondern auch Rousseaus eigene persönlichen Träume und Ziele als Maler. Seit Beginn seiner Arbeit träumte er von Anerkennung, Akzeptanz und Lob durch andere Künstler und Kunstliebhaber und stellte fest, dass er vor einem schwierigen inneren Dilemma stand, um dieses Ziel zu erreichen. Der Traum ist Henri Rousseaus Werk, das seinen lebenslangen inneren Kampf am besten widerspiegelt: entweder sich bestimmten Malstilen anzupassen, um von der kritischen Kunstwelt, die er so verehrte, akzeptiert zu werden, oder sich die kreative Unabhängigkeit und Einzigartigkeit zu erlauben und seinen eigenen Weg zu gehen.\n\nBevor man Der Traum aus dieser Perspektive analysieren kann, muss man mit Rousseaus biografischer Geschichte einigermaßen vertraut sein. Henri Rousseau wurde am 21. Mai 1844 in der Stadt Laval im Nordwesten Frankreichs geboren. Sein Vater war ein Klempner und Eisenwarenhändler, der \"bürgerlichen Wohlstand genoss\" (Shattuck 47). In seiner Jugend erhielt er keine formale künstlerische Ausbildung; stattdessen war er bis zum Alter von vierzig Jahren als Gabelou, ein Angestellter des städtischen Mautdienstes, tätig, obwohl ihm fälschlicherweise der Spitzname Douanier, ein Zollinspektor, zugeschrieben wurde (Shattuck 46). Der Tod seiner ersten Frau Clémence, der den Tod von acht Kleinkindern folgte, ließ Rousseau mit nur einem Kind, einer Tochter namens Julia, und einer immensen Trauer zurück (Shattuck 49). Er hoffte daher, in einem neuen Leben Zuflucht zu finden, und wandte sich der Malerei zu, um ihm Trost und einen Neuanfang zu bieten. Anders als seine zeitgenössischen Kollegen, die den Bauern in der Malerei sentimentalisierten und romantisierten, ist er im Wesentlichen ein Volksmaler mit den Hoffnungen und Träumen des durchschnittlichen Mitglieds seiner Klasse.\n\nRousseaus Besessenheit, von der Kunstwelt akzeptiert zu werden, ist einigermaßen verständlich, wenn man sie im Kontext bewertet: Wie besprochen, war er nicht nur in den Wegen der formalen Malerei ungebildet und begann seine Karriere in einem viel höheren Alter, sondern produzierte auch Werke zur gleichen Zeit wie viele andere talentierte und bekanntere moderne Künstler. Obwohl er schon viele Jahre arbeitete, begann Rousseau erst dann, angemessene Anerkennung für seine Kunst zu erhalten, als Matisse gerade dabei war, sich einen Ruf als Künstler zu erarbeiten. In dem Buch Moderne französische Maler behauptet der Autor Jan Gordon, dass die beiden, obwohl sie technisch Konkurrenten in der Kunstszene waren, nicht nur in Stil und Thema, sondern auch in ihren Gründen, überhaupt zu malen, unterschiedlich waren: \"Matisse war ein Maler, der eine Angst davor hatte, auf eine banale Art zu malen, während Rousseau den Wunsch hatte, ein Bild so konventionell zu malen, dass er in den Artiste Français aufgenommen würde\" (92).\n\n[REWRITE]A few decades before the Surrealist artists started creating their dreamlike paintings, artist Henri Rousseau was meticulously crafting his own dreams, both literally and figuratively.

    "original": "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities.

    "raw_output": "Sure, here is the translation process applied to the provided text:\n\nGerman Translation:\n\nViele große Denker haben eine enge Verbindung zwischen Ethik und Ästhetik, zwischen Wahrheit und Schönheit postuliert. Ich glaube, dass es auf einer fundamentalen Ebene einen Grund dafür gibt. Wie John Keats in „Ode on a Grecian Urn“ sagt: „Schönheit ist Wahrheit, Wahrheit Schönheit - Das ist alles / Was ihr auf Erden wisst, und alles, was ihr wissen müsst.“ Vieles von dem, was wir im Leben wissen, wird durch Bildung oder Erfahrung gelernt. Dennoch scheinen wir, wie Keats andeutet, Ethik und Ästhetik zu schätzen, ohne auf diese erwarteten Weisen unterrichtet zu werden. Sowohl Ethik als auch Ästhetik sind ein Versuch zu beschreiben, statt vorzuschreiben. Unsere Studien über Moral und Schönheit sind größtenteils Versuche zu erklären, warum ein Kunstwerk oder ein literarisches Werk schön ist oder warum eine Handlung moralisch ist, eher als eine Reihe von Regeln, um gute Kunst oder moralisches Verhalten zu beurteilen oder zu schaffen.\n\tVielmehr ist die Kritik von Kunst oder Moral nie in der Lage, die Essenz dessen, was gut oder was schön ist, vollständig zu erfassen. Eine Diskussion über den Wert von da Vincis Mona Lisa kann sich beispielsweise um Konzepte wie Vordergrund, Hintergrund, Kontrast oder kulturellen Kontext drehen, aber letztendlich beschreiben diese nicht, warum es gute Kunst ist. Wenn jemand nach einem Lieblingskunstwerk oder -literatur gefragt wird, hört man oft einen Satz wie „Es ist einfach etwas daran“ vor einer komplexeren oder kritischen Erklärung. Ich glaube, dass Kunst und Moral nie vollständig auf eine Beschreibung ihrer Eigenschaften reduziert werden können. Wie Flannery O'Connor sagt: „Eine Geschichte ist eine Möglichkeit, etwas zu sagen, das auf keine andere Weise gesagt werden kann ... man erzählt eine Geschichte, weil eine Aussage unzureichend wäre.“ Egal wie vollständig wir die Eigenschaften eines literarischen Werkes beschreiben, es bleibt etwas Transzendentes übrig. Ich glaube, dass Ethik diese gleiche Eigenschaft hat. Wie Wittgenstein sagt: „Es ist klar, dass Ethik nicht ausgedrückt werden kann. / Ethik ist transzendental. Ich schlage vor, dass es dieses „Etwas“ ist, dieses je ne sais quoi, das die mächtigste Eigenschaft von Kunst und Moral ist, und dass diese transzendentale Natur von Ethik und Ästhetik einen Verbindungspunkt zwischen ihnen bietet.\n\tIch glaube, dass Moral und Kunst so eng verwandt sind, weil wir beide am stärksten auf einer noumenalen Ebene erleben, um einen kantischen Begriff zu verwenden. Sie beeinflussen uns auf einer Ebene, die erfahren, aber nicht vollständig erklärt werden kann. Diese Verbindung ist noch stärker, wenn es um die Kunst der Literatur geht. Wie McKean sagt: „Was Literatur von den anderen Künsten am meisten unterscheidet, was in Wahrheit einzigartig an der Kunst ist, ist ihre moralische Qualität. Es mag sein, dass moralische Standards für andere Künste, zum Beispiel Musik, unangebracht sind, aber sie scheinen für die Literatur ebenso relevant zu sein wie für das Leben selbst. Leben beinhaltet notwendigerweise Werte. . . . Literatur ist uns wichtig, gerade wegen der Werte, die wir dort finden.“\n\nBack to English Translation:\n\nMany great thinkers have posited a close connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe there is a fundamental reason for this. As John Keats states in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\", \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty - That is all / You know on earth, and all you need to know.\" Much of what we learn in life is acquired through education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics attempt to describe rather than prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are largely attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging or creating good art or moral behavior.\n\tFurthermore, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A discussion about the value of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for instance, may revolve around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but ultimately, these do not describe why it is good art. When asked about a favorite piece of art or literature, it is common to hear a phrase like, \"There's just something about it\" preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how thoroughly we describe the properties of a literary work, there is something transcendent that remains. I believe ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.

Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language.

Dieselbe Kultur ist von Köln am Rhein durch das Zentrum Deutschlands bis zur sächsischen Stadt Dresden an der Elbe zu spüren. Bei einer so einzigartigen Kultur sollte es nicht überraschen, dass das heutige Deutschland aus mehreren verschiedenen Quellen und Stämmen hervorgegangen ist.\n\nGermania ist das angestammte Land der Deutschen. Die Ursprünge des Namens sind unter Gelehrten und Historikern stark umstritten. Tacitus behauptete, dass der Name von einem damals als Tungrier bekannten germanischen Stamm stamme, und dass sie zuvor als Germanen bekannt gewesen seien, bevor sie den Rhein überquerten und gegen die gallischen Kräfte kämpften (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar verwendete das Wort „Germanus“ erstmals in seinem Kommentar zu den Gallischen Kriegen, wo er die Gallier niederwarf und gegen germanische Stämme kämpfte, die oft unter zweifelhaften Vorwänden den Rhein überquerten. Er übernahm dieses Wort von den Galliern selbst und nutzte es, um zwischen denen, die er erobert hatte (die Gallier), und jenen, die er nicht erobert hatte, zu unterscheiden. Während der Ursprung ungewiss ist, glauben einige, dass es sich auf einen Nachbarn in der gallischen Sprache bezog. Im ersten Kapitel seines ersten Buches über diese Kriege merkt Julius Caesar an: „Germanen, die jenseits des Rheins wohnen, mit denen sie (die Gallier) ständig Krieg führen..... Sie kämpfen fast täglich mit den Germanen.“ (Julius Caesar, 50-40 v. Chr.) Andere behaupten, die Bedeutung stamme von dem Speer, den sie im Krieg benutzten, bekannt als ein Ger (O.E.D, 2010), oder vielleicht von dem altirischen Wort garim, das „schreien“ bedeutet, was darauf hinwies, dass die Germanen laut oder lärmend waren. (Names of Germany)\n\nDer frühe römische Historiker Tacitus verzeichnete in seinem AD 98 Werk „De Origine et situ Germanorum“, das von den Ursprüngen der Germanen erzählte, dass „ich (die Germanen) als ursprünglich und überhaupt nicht mit anderen Rassen durch Einwanderung oder Umgang vermischt betrachten würde. Denn früher war es nicht zu Land, sondern auf Schiffen, dass diejenigen, die auswandern wollten, ankommen würden....... Wer würde Asien oder Afrika für Italien für Deutschland verlassen, mit seinem wilden Land, seinen rauen Himmeln, seinen düsteren Sitten und Aussehen, es sei denn, es wäre in der Tat seine Heimat?(SIC)“ (Tacitus, 98)\n\nUnd wer würde Rom für Germania verlassen? Sicherlich nicht die Römer, zumindest noch nicht. Sie würden ihre Eroberungen in die Länder von Germania aussenden, um Waren zu bekommen, und gelegentlich eine Landkampagne führen, aber letztendlich kehrten sie meist in ihr weitläufiges Reich zurück. So begannen die germanischen Stämme im mittleren ersten Jahrhundert an den Grenzen des Römischen Reiches zu erscheinen und handelten mit den Waren, die sie vom Land nahmen, und ihren Fähigkeiten, indem sie in den Reihen der römischen Armee dienten (Ozment, 2005, S. 17).\n\n[REWRITE]Today's Germany is seen as a strong force, a united country with its own unique mixture of culture, stretching from the shadows of the Alps in Munich all the way to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel.

Natürlich kann ein so umfassendes Konzept wie ein ganzes Kolonialreich nicht durch eine so einfache Beschreibung erfasst werden. Das deutsche Kolonialreich war in seinen politischen Maßnahmen und seinem Herrschaftsstil ebenso vielfältig wie in seiner Geografie. Auch die Bildungsangebote in den Kolonien waren ähnlich vielfältig. Als die Briten 1919 Deutsch-Ostafrika (Tanganjika) übernahmen, fanden sie eine große Bevölkerung gebildeter und literarischer Afrikaner vor. Deutsche Bildungsbemühungen in Kamerun und anderen Kolonien wurden ebenfalls von zeitgenössischen Autoren gelobt. Die Situation in Südwestafrika (dem heutigen Namibia) stellte einen deutlichen Kontrast dar. Anders als in Ostafrika, wo die Regierung staatliche Schulen gründete und eine bedeutende Rolle in der Bildung der Einheimischen spielte, wurde in Südwestafrika die Aufgabe der einheimischen Bildung fast vollständig den Missionsgesellschaften überlassen, die nur begrenzte staatliche Unterstützung erhielten. Die Regierung investierte jedoch erhebliche Mittel in die Bildung der Europäer in der Kolonie, indem sie ein System von Staatsschulen etablierte und die Missionsschulen stärker unterstützte und regulierte. Diese Bildungspolitiken hatten langanhaltende Auswirkungen auf Südwestafrika, auch nach der deutschen Herrschaft. Während andere deutsche Kolonien bedeutende Zahlen literarischer und gebildeter Afrikaner aufwiesen, blieb in Südwestafrika „die überwältigende Mehrheit der Bevölkerung unberührt, ungebildet und analphabetisch.“ Verschiedene soziale, politische und wirtschaftliche Faktoren führten zu den unterschiedlichen Erfahrungen in Südwestafrika. Dieser Artikel versucht, die Diskussion zu erweitern, indem er diese Faktoren identifiziert und besonderen Wert auf neue Forschungen zu den Einstellungen der Siedler und Kolonialbehörden gegenüber den einheimischen Afrikanern legt. Es gibt eine Fülle von Literatur, die sich speziell mit Bildung im deutschen Kolonialreich beschäftigt. Die meisten dieser Quellen sind auf Deutsch und wurden im frühen zwanzigsten Jahrhundert, während oder kurz nach der deutschen Kolonialherrschaft, verfasst. Das Ziel der frühen Werke war es hauptsächlich, die Merkmale der Bildungssysteme in diesen Kolonien zu beschreiben. Spätere Schriften in Englisch erweiterten den Diskurs durch vergleichende Studien der Bildung in den verschiedenen deutschen Kolonien und detailliertere Analysen spezifischer Bildungsaspekte. Diese Studien zeigten signifikante Unterschiede in den Bildungssystemen der verschiedenen Kolonien auf. Die bekannteste Arbeit, die explizit das Thema dieses Artikels anspricht, ist Cohens Studie über Bildung in Südwestafrika und Ostafrika. Cohen vergleicht die Bildungssysteme der beiden Kolonien und diskutiert die Faktoren, die die Unterschiede zwischen ihnen erklären. Laut Cohen erklärt die große Siedlerbevölkerung Südwestafrikas viele der charakteristischen Aspekte des Bildungssystems der Kolonie. Im Vergleich zu den anderen kolonialen Besitztümern Deutschlands hatte Südwestafrika ein mäßig gemäßigtes Klima, obwohl ein Großteil des Gebiets von trockener Wüste bedeckt ist. Die europäische Bevölkerung Südwestafrikas spiegelte die relativ günstigen Bedingungen wider. Bis 1913 lebten fast 15.000 Weiße in Südwestafrika, während nur 5.336 in der Kolonie mit der nächstgrößten Siedlerbevölkerung, Ostafrika, lebten.\n\n[REWRITE]German colonial rule is noted by various observers for its brutality, particularly regarding the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa.

(Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

Der Höhepunkt dieser Rivalität war der Mexikanisch-Amerikanische Krieg von 1846-1848, in dem die Vereinigten Staaten Mexiko angriffen und besiegten und sich Texas und den amerikanischen Südwesten als neues Territorium sicherten. Viele weitere Auseinandersetzungen ereigneten sich zwischen den beiden Nationen, die schließlich kurz vor dem Ersten Weltkrieg nachließen. Die Rivalität begann, als Amerikaner und Mexikaner in wichtigen Fragen wie Religion, Kultur und Tradition aneinandergerieten und es zu einem großen Konflikt materieller Interessen kam (Schmitt 1974, S. 30-31).   \nDies ist nicht unähnlich zu vielen anderen Nationen, die eine andauernde Rivalität mit einem Nachbarn haben. Nationen, die eine Grenze teilen, neigen dazu, Interessenkonflikte zu haben, die zur Schaffung rivalisierender Positionen zwischen den Nationen führen. Die Vereinigten Staaten und Mexiko sind nicht unähnlich zu vielen anderen langanhaltenden Rivalitäten zwischen Nationen, die eine gemeinsame Grenze teilen. David M. Pletcher (1977) erklärt, dass \"nur in Mexiko und Kuba kann man langanhaltende umfassende amerikanische diplomatische Probleme finden\" (S. 41). Tatsächlich sind beide dieser Nationen geografisch nah an den Vereinigten Staaten und waren Rivalen der Vereinigten Staaten, während andere Nationen in Lateinamerika gute Beziehungen zu den Vereinigten Staaten genießen und genossen haben.   \nReligiöse Fragen schufen eine Kluft zwischen den beiden Nationen, ein Problem, das viele Nationen durch die Geschichte hindurch betroffen hat. Sally Frahm (2001) erklärt, dass \"wenn im zwanzigsten Jahrhundert die Amerikaner gegen den Faschismus und den Kommunismus waren, waren sie im achtzehnten und neunzehnten gegen den Katholizismus und die Monarchie\" (S. 86). Nicht unähnlich der Rivalität des Kalten Krieges zwischen den Vereinigten Staaten und der Sowjetunion war dies teils ein ideologischer Kampf und teils ein Wettbewerb um Interessen, die jede Nation als lebenswichtig erachtete. In diesem Fall basierten die ideologischen Kämpfe jedoch nicht auf der politischen Struktur, sondern auf den religiösen Präferenzen der Vereinigten Staaten und Mexikos. Dieses Misstrauen wuchs aus dem Misstrauen zwischen den Engländern und Spaniern. Das Erbe dieses Misstrauens von ihren ehemaligen kolonialen Herrschern war ein großes Hindernis bei der Etablierung freundschaftlicher Außenbeziehungen zwischen den Vereinigten Staaten und Mexiko.\nDiehl und Goerts (2000) listen 17 Streitigkeiten zwischen Mexiko und den Vereinigten Staaten in der 57-jährigen Rivalitätsperiode auf. Die Mehrheit der Streitigkeiten in der von Diehl und Goerts beschriebenen Rivalitätsperiode sind territoriale Probleme, die sich auf Grenzüberfälle aus mexikanischem Territorium nach Mexiko und andere Grenzprobleme beziehen. Grenzüberschreitende Überfälle von Banditen und Gesetzlosen auf amerikanische Grenzstädte waren ein großes Problem, das bestehen blieb, bis sowohl die Vereinigten Staaten als auch Mexiko militärische Gewalt an ihren Grenzen ausübten (Schmitt 1974, S. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) erklärt, dass die Rivalität zwischen den beiden Nationen nachzulassen begann, als \"Mexiko in erheblichem Maße von den Vereinigten Staaten abhängig wurde\" (S. 109) und schließlich endete, als die amerikanischen Ambitionen \"sich von territorialer Expansion zu wirtschaftlicher Intervention in Mexiko änderten\" (S. 110) im späteren Teil des 19.

To this day, I am disabled, and after 15 years of living on Social Security Disability, I literally have nothing left that I can call \"mine.\" I get by, but each day is a struggle and a challenge to my security, safety, and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore, yet there is one thing I know to be true. I could not have survived all these years without the help of my family and a few good friends, no matter how strong I was. And believe me, when real disaster strikes, you don't feel strong at all.\n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life—big and small. There are no guarantees, and no matter how well one prepares, some things are just too big to handle on your own.\n\nI wholeheartedly agree that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all our eggs in the big government's basket; Lord knows it's moldy and falling apart anyway. Yet, I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again—learning to help each other and to ask for help—instead of each of us individually heading to the backyard to build fallout shelters.\n\nThe Conservatives in the U.S. talk about the \"rugged individualism\" that built this country; but in truth, what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism, it was compassion, mutual respect, and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit; first aid supplies, water purification tablets, and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries, lots and lots of candles, waterproof matches, and canned goods too. If you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food—do it. It's a great idea, as is a wood stove, as long as you do not live in an apartment.\n\nBut while you're at it, get to know your neighbors.",

Chr. wurde ein Prinz geboren, der eines Tages Buddha genannt werden würde. Im Laufe seines Lebens entsagte er der Welt und wurde erleuchtet, und seine Lehren führten zur Entstehung des Buddhismus – die orthodoxeste Sekte davon ist als Theravada-Buddhismus bekannt. Die Religion ist etwa zweitausendfünfhundert Jahre alt; sie sieht heute anders aus als zu Lebzeiten Buddhas. Dies zeigt sich überall, beispielsweise in der Theravada-Nation Sri Lanka, wo die jährliche Wassertrennungszeremonie beobachtet wird. Mönche und Laien nehmen gleichermaßen an dieser Zeremonie teil, die eine gewisse religiöse Bedeutung hat, obwohl Buddha nie über ein solches Fest lehrte. Diese Unterschiede ziehen sich von den oberflächlichen Traditionen bis zum soteriologischen Kern der Religion. Die Theravada-Buddhistische Gemeinschaft musste sowohl aus klösterlicher Perspektive als auch aus der Perspektive der Laien im Laufe der Zeit ihre doktrinären Prinzipien ändern. Dies kann auf sowohl äußere als auch innere, sowohl feindliche als auch wohlwollende Kräfte zurückgeführt werden.\n\nEs gibt eine Reihe von qualifizierenden Begriffen, die in dieser Diskussion häufig verwendet werden. Es gibt das Konzept von intern versus extern. Hier wird eine interne Kraft als eine Kraft definiert, die von Mitgliedern der Buddhasasana ausgeht, unabhängig von ihrem klösterlichen Status. Eine externe Kraft ist jede Kraft von Nicht-Buddhisten. Eine feindliche Kraft ist jede Kraft, die der buddhistischen Gemeinschaft schadet oder beabsichtigt zu schaden – eine Kraft, die aus einer negativen Wahrnehmung des Buddhismus entsteht. Eine wohlwollende Kraft ist eine Kraft, die der buddhistischen Gemeinschaft weder schaden noch helfen möchte – obwohl sie letztendlich das eine oder andere als Nebenprodukt tun könnte. Diese Begriffe werden in dieser Diskussion immer wieder auftauchen.\n\nZuerst ist es wichtig, die Grundlagen der Religion zu untersuchen – die Lehren, die im Kern des Theravada-Buddhismus liegen. Buddhisten suchen Zuflucht in den drei Juwelen des Buddha, des Dhamma und der Sangha. Das Dhamma besteht im Wesentlichen aus dem Tripitaka – den drei Körben – buddhistischer Texte. Das Sutta Pitaka enthält alle Suttas, das Vinaya Pitaka enthält die disziplinarischen Regeln und das Abhidhamma Pitaka enthält die metaphysischen Komponenten des Buddhismus. Die metaphysischen Vorstellungen bestehen aus Dingen wie Anatta – keine Seele, Dukkha – inhärentes Leiden im Leben, und Anicca – Vergänglichkeit von allem. Nur durch das Erkennen dieser Konzepte kann man Sansara beenden, den Kreislauf von Tod und Wiedergeburt, der kontinuierlich stattfindet. Zusammen mit Sansara werden lobha – Begierde, dosa – Hass und moha – Täuschung enden, wenn man erleuchtet wird. Im Vinaya Pitaka werden Regeln für das Leben aufgestellt. Für Laien gibt es fünf Vorschriften (Ich soll nicht töten, ich soll nicht lügen, ich soll nicht stehlen, ich soll mich sexuell nicht falsch verhalten und ich soll keine berauschenden Substanzen einnehmen). Für Mönche gibt es noch viele weitere disziplinarische Regeln zu befolgen. Der grundlegendste doktrinäre Begriff im Buddhismus ist das Konzept der vier edlen Wahrheiten. Erstens, Dukkha; die Wahrheit, dass das Leben Leiden ist. Zweitens, dass Anhaftung Leiden verursacht. Drittens, dass das Leiden überwunden werden kann.\n\n**Back to English:**\n\n[REWRITE]  \nAt some point in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince was born who would one day be known as Buddha.
