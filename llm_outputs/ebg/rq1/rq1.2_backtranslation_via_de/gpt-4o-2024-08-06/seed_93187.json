    "raw_output": "Kultur spielt eine bedeutende Rolle in jeder Verhandlung. Kultur kann ebenso sehr durch das definiert werden, was sie nicht ist, wie durch das, was sie tatsächlich ist und was sie bedeutet. Kultur ist weder homogen, noch ist sie eine spezifische Sache. Sie ist auch nicht einzigartig oder einheitlich. Aussagen wie „alle Russen sind stur“ oder „alle Japaner sind entgegenkommend“ sind von Natur aus weit gefasst und zu einfach. Während das Verständnis von Verallgemeinerungen einer Kultur angebracht sein kann, ist es für einen Verhandler weitaus produktiver, die Bedeutung einer Kultur für das jeweilige Thema zu verstehen und wie die Einstellung dieser Kultur die Verhandlungen beeinflussen kann und wird. Wenn man sich einer fremden Kultur nähert, erlebt man sie auf eine Weise, die mit der eigenen Kultur vergleichbar ist, und notwendigerweise entstehen Vergleiche.\n\nDer Versuch, eine fremde Kultur oder Denkweise zu verstehen, kann alles umfassen, von der Erforschung ihrer Geschichte bis hin zur Erkenntnis ihrer Vorurteile. Anstatt eine Kultur zu beurteilen oder zu versuchen, sie zu ändern, muss man sie einfach so akzeptieren, wie sie ist, und innerhalb ihrer Grenzen arbeiten, insbesondere im Rahmen von Verhandlungen und vor allem, wenn man mit einer schwächeren Verhandlungsposition an den Tisch kommt. Ebenso kann Respekt vor Traditionen und Überzeugungen einem Verhandler, der sich in „fremdem“ Gebiet befindet, nur helfen, kulturelle Barrieren zu überwinden und die Verhandlung voranzutreiben.\n\nEs ist wichtig zu beachten, dass Kultur sich nicht unbedingt auf eine nationale/internationale Dichotomie beschränkt. Die meisten Unternehmen innerhalb eines bestimmten Landes etablieren ihre eigene Unternehmenskultur. Zum Beispiel könnte eine Unternehmenskultur lange Arbeitszeiten im Büro oder einen entspannteren Zeitplan betonen. Anzeichen einer Unternehmenskultur können in den Kleiderordnungen der Mitarbeiter, im Kommunikationsstil (direkte vs. indirekte Kommunikation, Aufgabenverteilung) und in den Einstellungspraktiken gesehen werden. Einige Unternehmen fördern Philanthropie auf jeder Ebene von Mitarbeitern, andere beschränken sie auf „unternehmensbewilligte“ Wohltätigkeitsorganisationen oder Spendenaktionen. Man muss nur die Unterschiede in der amerikanischen Unternehmenskultur von Unternehmen zu Unternehmen (und in der Tat existiert innerhalb eines Unternehmens sogar Vielfalt von Region zu Region, einschließlich städtischer und vorstädtischer Umgebungen) betrachten, um die Gedankenvielfalt zu schätzen, die innerhalb einer bestimmten gesellschaftlichen Kultur existieren kann. Bestimmte Kulturen sind nicht annähernd so schichtartig wie die amerikanische Kultur und mögen einem Außenstehenden einheitlicher erscheinen, aber ein ähnliches Äußeres ist einfach ein Zeichen dafür, tiefer zu graben.\n\nWerte sind noch wichtiger zu verstehen, weil sie das Warum einer Kultur liefern. Wenn Gesichtswahrung oder gemeinschaftliche Harmonie in einer Kultur geschätzt werden, ist es sicher, dass ein Verhandler nicht öffentlich sein Unternehmen oder seinen Vorgesetzten beschämen wird, um am Verhandlungstisch erfolgreich zu sein. Ebenso wird ein Verhandler aus einer Kultur, die einem harten Handel mehr Gewicht beimisst, nicht unbedingt dazu getrieben sein, sich bei der erstbesten Gelegenheit zu einigen. Diese Verallgemeinerungen zu berücksichtigen, ist wichtig, bevor man an den Verhandlungstisch kommt. Ein Verhandler ist jedoch gut beraten, etwas über seinen Gegner auf persönlicher Ebene zu lernen, um die Verhandlung effektiv zu gestalten.\n\n[REWRITE]Culture is crucial in any negotiation.

This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God.

    "raw_output": "Sure, let's start with the translation to German:\n\n„Der Narr spricht in seinem Herzen: ‚Es gibt keinen Gott.‘“ Das vorangegangene Zitat ist zuerst in Psalm 14 der christlichen Bibel zu sehen und findet sich am Anfang von St. Anselms Argumentation über die Existenz Gottes. Dieser Glaube scheint auch von dem anderen Autor vertreten zu werden, den wir besprechen werden, Thomas von Aquin. Da jeder ihrer Argumente zur Verteidigung desselben Konzepts dient und unsere Herausforderung darin besteht, festzustellen, welches das bessere der beiden ist, müssen wir aus Gründen der Kürze mit der Annahme beginnen, dass sie beide in ihrem Glauben an die Existenz Gottes richtig liegen, insbesondere des Gottes der Bibel. Die Zulassung einer Gott-ähnlichen Figur, die möglicherweise nicht der ähnelt, an den unsere beiden Autoren glauben, würde es uns nicht gestatten, ihre beiden Argumente angemessen zu vergleichen, da sie im Wesentlichen zur Verteidigung eines bestimmten Gottesbegriffs stehen. Das gesagt, würde ich vorschlagen, dass, während jeder von ihnen gültige Punkte hervorbringt, keiner wirklich eine ganzheitliche Grundlage für den Glauben an Gott bietet.\n\tUm diesen Punkt zu veranschaulichen, werden wir zuerst das Grundargument von St. Anselm untersuchen. Anselms Passage spiegelt einen Weg wider, Verständnis durch Glauben zu erlangen, indem man in sich selbst schaut, um den Beweis für Gott zu finden. Er erklärt, dass wir, da Gott in unserem Verständnis existiert, seine Nichtexistenz nicht effektiv begreifen können. Während dieses Konzept, wenn es in seiner Terminologie dargelegt wird, etwas mühsam und manchmal unklar ist, ist der grundlegende Kern, dass der Beweis für Gott im eigenen Geist liegt. St. Anselm schlägt vor, dass wir nicht über die Grenzen unserer eigenen Seele hinausgehen müssen, um die Wahrheit über Gott zu finden, sondern dass die Existenz dieses Wesens als wahr erkannt wird, indem wir das untersuchen, was wir inhärent als wahr in unserem eigenen Geist wissen. Fremde Beweise sind vermutlich unnötig. Dieses Konzept, das zu akzeptieren, wofür es keinen unwiderlegbaren Bestand an empirischen Beweisen gibt, wird oft in christlichen Texten als Glaube bezeichnet.\n\tDiese Idee unterscheidet sich sehr von der, die Thomas von Aquin vertritt. Aquin schlägt stattdessen vor, dass die Existenz Gottes vollständig durch Vernunft und empirische Beweise bewiesen werden kann, ohne jeglichen Bedarf an Glauben. Eine solche Idee wäre im Evangelium nützlich, einem wichtigen Element des Christentums, da sie es ermöglichen würde, neue Bekehrte ohne jegliche Abhängigkeit von ihrer Bereitschaft zu gewinnen, etwas zu akzeptieren, das nicht bewiesen werden kann. Sie könnten stattdessen allein durch Logik überzeugt werden. Thomas erläutert fünf verschiedene logische Argumente zur Unterstützung der Existenz Gottes: Wandel, Verursachung, Kontingenz, Grade der Exzellenz und Harmonie. In jedem zeigt er im Wesentlichen, dass der Beweis für Gott in der logischen Notwendigkeit für Gott liegt. Wenn Ihnen gesagt wird, dass Ihnen ein Puzzleteil fehlt und Sie den Rest des Puzzles zusammensetzen, diktiert die Logik, dass Sie die Merkmale und die Existenz des fehlenden Teils kennen können, ohne es sehen zu müssen.\n\nNow, translating back to English:\n\n[REWRITE] \"The fool says in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This quotation is first seen in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm's argument about the existence of God.

Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28).

Einige dieser Techniken sind effektiver als andere. F. Scott Fitzgerald verwendet viele dieser unterschiedlichen Techniken in seinem Roman Der große Gatsby. Manchmal paart Fitzgerald ein Adjektiv und ein Substantiv, die normalerweise nicht zusammenpassen, um den Lesern eine bestimmte Aura um ein Thema zu geben. Andere Male verleiht er einem Symbol eine Bedeutung und verwendet es dann für denselben Zweck. Fitzgerald nutzt diese letzte Technik mit vielen Farben, darunter Gold, Grün, Weiß/Grau und Rot/Rosa. In seinem Roman Der große Gatsby baut F. Scott Fitzgerald Bedeutung für Farben auf, nämlich Weiß/Grau und Rot/Rosa, um den Lesern später eine bestimmte Erinnerung an ein Gefühl um ein wichtiges Objekt zu geben.\n\nDie Bedeutung, die Fitzgerald für Weiß/Grau aufbaut und verwendet, ist Uniformität, wobei Weiß etwas angenehmer und höher klassifiziert ist und Grau älter und verblasst wirkt. Fitzgerald legt diese Bedeutung zu Beginn des Romans mit dem ständigen Gebrauch beider Farben fest. Daisy und Jordan sind ständig \"in Weiß\"—tatsächlich trägt jeder immer Weiß: Nick trägt \"weiße Flanellhosen\" auf Gatsbys Party, Tom trägt ein \"weißes Hemd\", als er Myrtle trifft, und Catherine ist \"milchig weiß gepudert\". Tatsächlich ist das einzige Mal, dass die Leute kein Weiß tragen, wenn Nick seine Eindrücke von Gatsbys Party bekommt: \"die Hallen... sind protzig in Primärfarben\". Fitzgerald definiert diese beiden Farben weiter, indem er viele gewöhnliche, unwichtige Themen in diesen Farben einfärbt: Als Nick zur Arbeit geht, geht er \"die weißen Schluchten des unteren New Yorks hinunter\", die Namen der Leute auf Gatsbys Partys sind jetzt \"graue Namen\" auf Nicks Fahrplan, Catherines Wohnung ist \"eine Scheibe in einem langen weißen Kuchen von Wohnhäusern\"—Uniformität. Er beschreibt auch einfache oder gewöhnliche Menschen oder Orte als weiß oder grau: Jordan und Daisy hatten zusammen eine \"weiße Kindheit\", es gibt \"graue Autos\" und \"graues Land\" im Aschental, das \"italienische Kind\" auf der Eisenbahn ist \"grau\", und der Hundeverkäufer ist \"ein grauer alter Mann\".\n\nNachdem Fitzgerald genug Bedeutung zu Weiß/Grau hinzugefügt hat, verwendet er sie, um Unwichtigkeit oder Uniformität zu bestimmten Themen zu signalisieren. Diese Verwendung von Farben, um den Lesern etwas zu zeigen, beginnt zuerst mit Daisy. Nach langer Zeit ohne nennenswerte Verwendung einer dieser Farben beschreibt Fitzgerald Daisy als \"in Weiß gekleidet\" in einem \"kleinen weißen Roadster\"; die Leser beginnen, Daisy weniger als Charakter zu sehen, mehr wie nur eine uniforme Ergänzung, etwas, das Gatsby will und sich nach sehnt. Fitzgerald verwendet mehr von dieser Technik um Daisy, um diesen Eindruck von Daisy als eine uniformere Ergänzung zu geben, zum Beispiel gibt es einen \"grauen Dunst von Daisys Pelzkragen\", und sie ist wieder in einem \"weißen\" Kleid vor der Begegnung von Tom und Gatsby.\n\n[REWRITE]Many authors use various methods to convey a specific feeling or attitude to their readers about important subjects.

    "original": "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water.

    "raw_output": "San Diego County ist sehr produktiv in der Landwirtschaft, dank eines milden, sonnigen Klimas. Zu den häufigen Anbauprodukten gehören: Tomaten, Zitrusfrüchte, Blattgemüse, Kürbis, Brokkoli, Kräuter, Baumfrüchte wie Pfirsiche und Zitronen, Beeren, Honig und Paprika. Es gibt einen beträchtlichen Markt für biologisch unterstützte Landwirtschaftsnahrungsmittel in der Region San Diego, wobei viele lokale Organisationen lange Wartelisten haben. Biologische Eier und Milch sind ebenfalls beliebt. Viele Bio-Bauernhöfe bieten auch Führungen durch ihre landwirtschaftlichen Betriebe sowie Zugang zum Wandern, Vogelbeobachten und anderen Freizeitaktivitäten an. Dies ist die Art von Betrieb, die es dem Landbesitzer ermöglichen würde, die Vorteile von Regierungsprogrammen zu nutzen und gleichzeitig den Lebensraum zu verbessern, was eine Erholungsnutzung ermöglicht und eine Gelegenheit für Bauernhofführungen und andere Programme zur Geldverdienung oder zu Bildungszwecken schafft.  \n\tNeben der Erfüllung eines potenziell lukrativen Nischenmarktes umfassen die Vorteile des ökologischen Landbaus oft eine größere Biodiversität bei Pflanzen und Tieren in der Region, dank des Fehlens von Chemikalien im Boden und Wasser. Der ökologische Landbau hat jedoch in mancher Hinsicht höhere Kosten als die konventionelle Landwirtschaft. Es erfordert intensivere Arbeit und Management, um Schädlinge und Unkraut zu entfernen und den Boden ohne Chemikalien zu düngen, und Verluste sind oft größer als bei herkömmlichen Methoden, während einem kleinen Bio-Bauernhof auch die Effizienz von großen Betrieben fehlt. Praktiken, die sich nicht auf den ökologischen Landbau beziehen, aber für die Tierwelt von Vorteil sind, können ebenfalls höhere Arbeitskosten verursachen, einschließlich des Anbaus von Zwischenfrüchten, strategischer Weiderotation, Entfernung invasiver Arten und aktives Management des Pflanzenwachstums, um spezifische Bedingungen wie Randhabitate oder offene Flächen bereitzustellen. Daher gibt es viele Gründe, warum der Landbesitzer in diesem Beispiel finanzielle Hilfe oder Fachwissen suchen könnte, um sowohl den Gewinn als auch die Qualität des Lebensraums zu maximieren.  \n\tDas für dieses Szenario ausgewählte Land ist ein Grundstück in der Nähe der Stadt Potrero, im nicht eingemeindeten San Diego County, Kalifornien. Es umfasst 160 Morgen aus Chaparral, nicht einheimischem mediterranem Grasland und Eichenwald in der Nähe des Cleveland National Forest. Es liegt in der Ökoregion der südlichen Vorgebirge des East County im Rahmen des San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. Der Plan wird noch überprüft, berücksichtigt derzeit aber über hundert Pflanzen- und Tierarten. Viele sind gefährdet, wie die Kängururatte von Stephens, der Berggelbbein-Frosch, mehrere Schmetterlingsarten und der Kalifornien-Gimpel; andere sind rückgängig und könnten bald aufgelistet werden, wie Burrowing Owls.\n\tDieses Gebiet wurde über unzählige Jahrhunderte von Ureinwohnern bewohnt und dann von Viehzüchtern und Brennholzverkäufern in den späten 1800er Jahren besiedelt. Dieses Stück Land war Teil eines ursprünglichen Homestead-Patents und wurde wahrscheinlich in vielen der dazwischenliegenden Jahrzehnte für Weidewirtschaft und/oder Holzproduktion genutzt.\n\tIch habe ein Grundstück von einer Immobilien-Website ausgewählt und verfügbare Regierungsprogramme recherchiert, um zu sehen, welche Optionen ein kleiner Landwirt realistisch gesehen haben könnte, um Kosten zu mindern und wildtierfreundliche Betriebe zu erhalten. Als Modell dafür, was jemand, der dieses Land bewirtschaftet, erreichen könnte, habe ich einen Bio-Bauernhof in derselben Gegend gefunden.\n\n[REWRITE]San Diego County is highly productive in agriculture due to its mild, sunny climate. Common crops include tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a significant market for organic, community-supported agricultural food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having long waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also offer tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This type of operation would allow the landowner to benefit from government programs while enhancing the habitat, thus enabling recreational use and creating opportunities for farm tours and other money-making or educational programs. \n\nIn addition to potentially filling a lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity among plants and wildlife in the area due to the absence of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has higher costs in some respects compared to conventional farming. It requires more intensive labor and management to control pests and weeds and to fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the economies of scale of large operations.

It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost.

    "raw_output": "Sure, here is the translation of the text to German, and then back to English:\n\nGerman Translation:\nEs gibt ein Band zwischen Brüdern; ein unzerbrechliches, unwiderrufliches Band. In diesem Band liegen viele Emotionen: Liebe, Stolz, Eifersucht und Grausamkeit, um nur einige zu nennen. Brüder verstehen einander, weit mehr als jeder andere mit einer solchen Bindung, und sie können sich selbst nur sehen, wenn sie ihren Bruder betrachten. Es ist in den kritischsten Situationen, dass die wahre Natur dieser Bindung sichtbar wird, sei es gut oder böse. Wenn diese Emotionen klar werden, tragen sie große Kosten mit sich. Teil des Verständnisses der Emotionen, die aus dieser brüderlichen Verbindung geboren werden, ist es, mit den Konsequenzen umzugehen, die sie mit sich bringen. Wenn man einem Bruder in die Augen sehen kann und in dieser Person sein eigenes Spiegelbild erkennt, sieht man sich selbst nicht, wie andere einen sehen, sondern wie man wirklich ist. Im Handeln und den Konsequenzen dieser Handlungen offenbart sich der wahre Charakter. In \"Die Scharlachrote Ibis\" erforschen zwei Brüder dieses Thema und all die tobenden Emotionen, die es begleiten. Durch eine üppige, lebhaft beschriebene Landschaft begeben sich diese beiden Jungen auf eine vergebliche Reise. Bittere Enttäuschung kollidiert mit intensivem Stolz in der Höhepunktszene, und nur ein Bruder überlebt. Das Thema wird durch die direkte Charakterisierung des Protagonisten, Doodle, und ihre Interaktionen miteinander ausgedrückt, sowie durch die Perspektive des Erzählers, die die komplexen Gefühle des Protagonisten und seine Sicht auf die Welt um ihn herum vermittelt, die beide großen Einfluss auf seine Handlungen haben.\nDie Handlungen des Protagonisten lassen sich alle durch eine zentrale Emotion zusammenfassen: Stolz. Vom ersten gemeinsamen Ausflug mit seinem kleinen Bruder Doodle bis zu ihrem letzten, schicksalhaften Abenteuer empfindet der Protagonist Groll gegen Doodle. Er wollte einen Bruder, dem er all seine weltlichen Fähigkeiten beibringen konnte, wie „… die Luft anhalten, rennen, springen oder die Ranken im Old Woman Swamp erklimmen…“ Er wollte einen Bruder, der die Rolle ausfüllen konnte von „… jemandem, mit dem man zum Horsehead Landing rennen kann … und jemandem, mit dem man auf der obersten Gabelung der großen Kiefer hinter der Scheune sitzen kann …“ Offensichtlich sind diese Dinge angesichts Doodles Zustand unmöglich. Doodle wurde mit einem extrem schwachen Herzen geboren, was es unwahrscheinlich machte, dass er überhaupt überleben würde. Selbst dann war es nahezu unmöglich, dass er jemals an anstrengender körperlicher Aktivität teilnehmen könnte. Was für ein Schlag für den jungen Protagonisten, dessen Kopf voller wilder Fantasien war, all diese Träume in einem Augenblick zerschlagen zu sehen. Tatsächlich zeigt sich sogar, dass er etwas Wut gegen das kleine Kind hegt, als er sich daran erinnert, dass er begann zu erwägen, ihn zu töten, indem er ihn mit einem Kissen erstickte. Was für ein Kind hätte den Verstand, Kindermord in Betracht zu ziehen? Doch sein Herz schmilzt, als das kleine Kind ihn anlächelt. So eine einfache Handlung gab dem Protagonisten solche Hoffnung! Das zeigt, dass seine Überzeugung wahrscheinlich nicht sehr stark war. Im Hinterkopf hatte er eine instinktive Liebe zu seinem Bruder.\n\nEnglish Re-Translation:\nThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond.

Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology.

There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. Initially, information is encoded. Each type of sensory input has specific forms of encoding. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to the appearance of the printed word, phonemically, referring to the sound of the word, or semantically, referring to the meaning of the word. Once stored, information must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for about 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a specific series of neurons for a short time. Information in long-term memory is thought to be maintained in the structure of certain proteins.\n\nThere are numerous models of how knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on how humans retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others on neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that there are nodes representing concepts, connected based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which could be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",

    "original": "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",

    "raw_output": "In 2007, geriet die Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika in eine erdrückende Finanzkrise. Die Arbeitslosigkeit stieg, der Immobilienmarkt brach ein, und viele der größten und wichtigsten Unternehmen Amerikas lagen in Trümmern. Diese Rezession dauert bis heute an, daher müssen wir die Frage stellen: Wie ist diese Krise entstanden, und wie können wir sie stoppen? Kurz gesagt, die Finanzkrise wurde durch egoistische und naive politische Entscheidungen verursacht, die Banken und Unternehmen drängten, Subprime-Darlehen in eine bereits unreife und unzureichende Finanzinfrastruktur zu vergeben. Unterdessen wurden Fannie Mae (FNMA) und Freddie Mac (FHLMC) dazu gedrängt, diese Hypotheken zu unterzeichnen und in CDOs und CDS umzupacken. Als Kreditnehmer mit diesen Darlehen in Verzug gerieten, hatten die Banken nicht genügend Kapitalreserven und übertrugen dieses Chaos auf die neu verpackten Hypotheken, die sie verkauft hatten, und auf den Rest der Wirtschaft.\n\nDie Wurzeln der Finanzkrise lagen im Jahr 1999 in der Clinton-Ära, als der Präsident eine zweite Amtszeit anstrebte. Er wollte seine Amtszeit verlängern, indem er seine Popularität steigerte. Um dies zu erreichen, lockerte die Clinton-Administration die Kreditvergabebeschränkungen, was dazu beitrug, die düstere Bühne für die Subprime-Krise sieben Jahre später zu bereiten. Steven Holmes von der New York Times berichtete 1999: \"Fannie Mae, der größte Hypothekenversicherer der Nation, steht unter wachsendem Druck der Clinton-Administration, Hypothekendarlehen unter Menschen mit niedrigem und mittlerem Einkommen auszuweiten und fühlte sich von Aktionären unter Druck gesetzt, sein phänomenales Wachstum bei den Gewinnen aufrechtzuerhalten.\" Holmes würde später die Folgen dieser Maßnahmen korrekt voraussagen: \"Aber die staatlich subventionierte Gesellschaft könnte in einem wirtschaftlichen Abschwung in Schwierigkeiten geraten, was eine staatliche Rettung ähnlich der der Spar- und Darlehensindustrie in den 1980er Jahren auslösen könnte.\" Wie in der Einführung beschrieben und wie von Holmes vorhergesehen, würde eine unkluge Kreditvergabe sicherlich zum Zusammenbruch der Wirtschaft führen.\n\nViele Faktoren trugen dazu bei, die Wirtschaft in einen Sturzflug zu versetzen, einer davon war die neue und komplexe Struktur der Hypotheken. Hypotheken mit variablem Zinssatz, hypothekenbesicherte Wertpapiere und besicherte Schuldverschreibungen (CDOs) wurden in den Jahren vor der Krise intensiv genutzt und trugen nur dazu bei, mehr Sektoren der Wirtschaft in den Immobilienmarkt zu verstricken. Dies führte dazu, dass sich US-Haushalte und Finanzmärkte im Allgemeinen im Immobilienmarkt übermäßig verschuldeten und sie extrem anfällig für selbst kleine Preisänderungen machten.\n\nTatsächlich platzte die Immobilienblase, und die Finanzinstitute, die diese hypothekenbesicherten Wertpapiere gekauft hatten, wurden getroffen. Die fünf größten US-Investmentbanken meldeten zusammen 4,1 Billionen Dollar an Hypothekenschulden im Jahr 2007, was etwa 30 % des BIP der USA ausmachte. Am Ende wurden Bear Stearns und Merrill Lynch extrem günstig verkauft, Lehman Brothers wurde zerschlagen, und Goldman Sachs und Morgan Stanley wurden gezwungen, Geschäftsbanken zu werden, die intensiver Regulierung unterliegen. Fannie und Freddie hatten 5 Billionen Dollar an Hypothekenschulden und wurden im September 2008 unter staatliche Kontrolle gestellt.\n\n[REWRITE]In 2007, the United States of America was engulfed in a severe financial crisis. Unemployment rose, the housing market collapsed, and many of America's largest and most significant corporations were left devastated. This recession continues today, prompting the question: how did this crisis arise, and how can we prevent it? The financial crisis was largely the result of selfish and naïve political decisions that pushed banks and firms to issue subprime loans into an already underdeveloped and inadequate financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to endorse and repackage these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, banks lacked sufficient capital reserves and passed the chaos onto the repackaged mortgages they had sold, affecting the entire economy.\n\nThe roots of the financial crisis trace back to 1999 during the Clinton era, as the President sought a second term in office.

Der Teil Ihrer Geschichte, in dem Sie Ihre kleinen Schriftstellerflügel ausbreiten und abheben, alle mit Ihrer magnetischen, ja magischen Prosa in Erstaunen versetzen. Oder der Teil, in dem Ihre Leser einschlafen und/oder den \"Zurück\"-Knopf drücken, während sie Ihren Namen verfluchen. Dr. Merlin ist bekannt dafür, ihren Monitor anzuschreien, wenn sie sich mitten in zu viel Information wiederfindet, und das nicht einmal auf unterhaltsame Weise.\n\nDie Exposition ist nicht dein Freund.\n\nMeine sanften Leser kennen bereits den grundlegenden Schreibtipp \"Zeigen, nicht erzählen\", aber Dr. Merlin stolpert immer noch in lange Textpassagen, in denen nichts passiert oder schlimmer noch, zu viel. Die Exposition ist der kleine Teufel, der auf Ihrer Schulter sitzt und sagt, dass man die Geschichte aus dem Weg räumen soll, um zu den guten Teilen zu gelangen (nicht zu verwechseln mit dem Teufel auf der anderen Schulter, der den Autor dazu drängt, seinem Publikum jedes Detail der Kindheit jeder Figur zu erzählen).\n\nExposition bedeutet, dem Publikum zu erzählen, was passiert ist, typischerweise in einfacher Prosa. Im Film passiert die Exposition, wenn eine Figur einer anderen eine Informationsflut à la \"Die Ballade von der alten Matrosin\" erzählt. In der Fiktion erzählt der Autor.\n\nEin Beispiel ist angebracht. Während Sie eine Geschichte lesen, wird Ihnen erzählt, dass die Heldin ihren Geliebten an einem bestimmten Ort und zu einer bestimmten Zeit traf, dass sie in festlicher Weise heirateten und dass ihr Ehemann vor ihren Augen ermordet wurde. Sie würden nicht erwarten, dass diese gesamte Sequenz zwei Seiten einnimmt, während der sowohl er als auch sie jeweils nur zwei Dialogzeilen bekommen. Sie würden erwarten, dass der Autor etwas Zeit auf den Charakter des Ehemanns verwendet und durch seine Sprache und sein Benehmen zeigt, wie tief er seine Frau liebt, und ebenso erwarten Sie von der Heldin, dass sie auf große und kleine Weise zeigt, wie sehr seine Anwesenheit in ihrem Leben sie verändert und bereichert hat (besonders, wenn die Geschichte Ihnen später direkt sagt, dass dies der Fall war). Eine ordentliche Einführung in den Charakter des Ehemanns würde es Ihnen ermöglichen, sich emotional mit seinem Schicksal zu verbinden und Ihnen Einblick in den Charakter der Heldin zu geben: was sie in ihm sah, wie tief ihre Verbindung war, Hinweise auf ihre Gedanken und Überzeugungen und Träume, wie sie durch das Prisma seiner Augen reflektiert wurden, und so weiter. Sie würden seinen Tod mit ihr betrauern und dadurch eine stärkere Verbindung zur Heldin selbst aufbauen.\n\nKurz gesagt, Sie würden erwarten, dass das einfache Gerüst der Handlung mit Substanz gefüllt wird: \"Sie trafen sich, sie heirateten, er starb.\"\n\nAls Schriftsteller müssen Sie diese Substanz bieten. (*schaut auf die Metapher, seufzt, macht weiter*) Manchmal ist es verlockend, an bestimmten Dingen vorbeizueilen. Vielleicht führen Sie eine neue Figur ein und wissen, dass er früher in der Luftwaffe war, jetzt der Nachtmanager einer Tankstelle ist, zweimal verheiratet war, keine Kinder hat, am Wochenende gerne angeln geht, heimlich davon träumt, eines Tages die Tankstelle zu besitzen und zum Frühstück Eggs Benedict hatte.\n\n**Back to English:**\n\n[REWRITE] Ah, exposition.

They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The segment was a bit short, but they used it as a \"teaser\" to keep viewers tuned in.\n\nThey also reported on a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said a dark-skinned black man robbed the store, wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. He was reported to be about six feet tall and weigh around one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they spent an unusual amount of time emphasizing that he was black and how dark his skin was.\n\nAnother story was about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute large amounts of marijuana to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted was that instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison, they said \"300\" months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded harsher or something else. They also mentioned he was Hispanic, which I don't think was really relevant to the story.",

Ein ETF bietet die Diversifikation eines Indexfonds und die Vorteile des Besitzes einzelner Aktien, wie die Möglichkeit, leer zu verkaufen, auf Marge zu kaufen und so wenig wie eine Aktie in einer Transaktion zu erwerben. Obwohl diese Vorteile äußerst attraktiv sind, sind die Kostenquoten von ETFs weit niedriger als die eines durchschnittlichen Investmentfonds. Leider gibt es einige Nachteile, wie die Notwendigkeit, eine Provision für jeden Handel mit ETFs zu zahlen, genau wie bei einer Aktienbestellung. Ein weiterer Vorteil von ETFs ist die große Vielfalt der verfügbaren Fonds. Obwohl diese Vorteile klar angegeben sind, ist es immer eine gute Übung für den klugen Finanzinvestor, zu beurteilen, ob die angegebenen Vorteile, wie die Diversifikation, tatsächlich existieren und in welchem Umfang sie vorhanden sind. Zu diesem Zweck werden wir den ETF IHF untersuchen und ihn mit den Top-10-Beteiligungen vergleichen, die den ETF ausmachen, um festzustellen, ob die Vorteile des Besitzes eines einzigen ETFs den Vorteilen des Besitzes eines diversifizierten Portfolios der zehn Aktien nahekommen und ob es bessere Konfigurationen derselben Aktien gibt, die ein optimales Sharpe-Verhältnis oder eine höhere Rendite bieten würden.\n\nUm den ETF zu bewerten, wäre es ziemlich unhandlich, jede Beteiligung einzubeziehen, daher haben wir uns entschieden, nur die Top-10-Investitionen aufzunehmen, die 63,58% aller Vermögenswerte im ETF ausmachen. Unten sind die Top-10-Beteiligungen und der Prozentsatz der Gesamtvermögenswerte.\n\nUm eine Schätzung dafür zu erhalten, wie gut diese zehn Aktien den ETF IHF als Ganzes repräsentieren, können wir den aktuellen Prozentsatz der Vermögenswerte, normalisiert auf 100%, verwenden, um die Beiträge jeder Aktie zu Beta und Rendite eines Portfolios zu berechnen, wenn das Portfolio ausschließlich aus diesen 10 Aktien in dem vom ETF festgelegten Verhältnis bestehen würde. Die Berechnungen von Beta und Rendite sind in der untenstehenden Tabelle enthalten.\n\nAus der obigen Tabelle geht hervor, dass die Rendite eines Portfolios, das nur die Top-10-Beteiligungen enthält, um 6,11% höher ist als die des ETFs, was einem Anstieg der Renditen um 16% entspricht. Es ist auch ersichtlich, dass das Beta der Top-10-Beteiligungen um 0,12 niedriger ist als das des gesamten ETFs. Aus den bisher erzielten Ergebnissen scheint es, dass ein Portfolio, das nur die Top-10-Beteiligungen umfasst, eine höhere Rendite bei niedrigerem Beta bieten könnte. Es besteht jedoch die Möglichkeit, dass die Mittel dieser beiden Portfolios statistisch nicht voneinander abweichen.\n\nUm zu beurteilen, ob diese Portfolios statistisch unterschiedlich sind, wird die Standardabweichung jeder der Top-10-Aktien ermittelt und auf 100% normalisiert, um ihre akkumulierte Standardabweichung mit der des ETF IHF zu vergleichen.\n\n[REWRITE] An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a security designed to track an index, a commodity, or a basket of assets like an index fund, but it is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.

That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car.

Das war etwas entmutigend, und es ist schwer zu sagen, warum das passiert sein könnte. Mit dem Einsetzen des Winters auf einem Campus in Neuengland gibt es eindeutig einen Rückgang der Menschen, die entweder mit dem Fahrrad oder zu Fuß pendeln, was einen Teil des Rückgangs erklären könnte. Der Dezember markiert auch das Ende des Herbstsemesters, wenn alle damit beschäftigt sind, Schulaufgaben zu beenden, Noten zu bearbeiten und so weiter. Das Ausfüllen des Pendlerprotokolls könnte für viele einfach in den Hintergrund geraten sein. Darüber hinaus bringt der Dezember die hektische Ferienzeit mit sich und die daraus resultierende einmonatige Pause für Studenten und Dozenten, während der viele gar nicht auf den Campus kommen müssen. Die Kurse beginnen dann Ende Januar wieder für das Frühlingssemester, was vielleicht auch ein Hinweis auf die geringe Anzahl von Protokollen für diesen Monat ist. Aber all das erklärt nicht wirklich die geringe Anzahl von Einreichungen im Februar. Man könnte auch vermuten, dass jedes Projekt dieser Art zu Beginn einen Energieschub und Begeisterung hat, die dann natürlich nachlassen kann. Um diesem Trend entgegenzuwirken, haben wir die Carpool Challenge Week ins Leben gerufen, eine spezielle Blitzkampagne im März, um die Initiative wieder zu beleben, was zu einem Anstieg der Protokolleinreichungen in diesem Monat führte. Eine der Herausforderungen, die wir erlebten, war also, wie man das Projekttempo angesichts eines natürlichen Rückgangs des Engagements sowie speziell der Problematik von Feiertagen und Semesterpausen im Hochschulbereich aufrechterhalten kann.\n\nEine weitere Herausforderung für dieses Projekt (oder jedes alternative Pendelprojekt) ist die einfache Tatsache, dass Menschen die Freiheit, Unabhängigkeit und Flexibilität des Autofahrens genießen. Dies ist tief in unserer Kultur verankert. Daher ist es entscheidend, Anreize für die Beteiligung an alternativen Pendelmodi zu schaffen. Wir gaben viele Preise in Form von Geschenkgutscheinen für lokale Restaurants, Cafés, Massagetherapeuten, den lokalen unabhängigen Buchladen und sogar einige größere nationale Kettenläden aus. Es wäre jedoch interessant gewesen zu sehen, wie sich einige noch größere Preise auf die Teilnahme ausgewirkt hätten – zum Beispiel die Verlosung eines schönen Fahrrads, Hybrid- oder Elektroautos. Dies hätte auch helfen können, den Rückgang des Engagements, den das Projekt erlebte, zu bekämpfen. Die Art der Preise änderte sich während des Projekts nicht wirklich. Wenn die Preise jedoch im Laufe des Projekts im Wert gestiegen wären, hätte das vielleicht geholfen. Die Geschenkkarten schienen zu Beginn des Projekts mehr als ausreichend zu sein, aber wenn wir im Dezember die Hinzufügung einiger Fahrräder und dann im Januar die Hinzufügung eines Hybrid- oder Elektroautos angekündigt hätten, kann man nur annehmen, dass die Teilnahme und das Engagement gestiegen wären, anstatt zu sinken.\n\n[REWRITE]Referring back to Figure 17, there was a sharp decline in commuter log submissions during the third month of the project.

    "raw_output": "In der Bibliothek früher Edison-Filme der Library of Congress beschloss ich, alle Trickfilme anzusehen, von denen es zwischen 1895 und 1901 fünfzehn gab. Diese Filme nutzen im Allgemeinen kreative Schnitttechniken, um Illusionen zu erzeugen. Meine Filmstudie konzentrierte sich hauptsächlich darauf, die Poetik der meisten Trickfilme zu beschreiben und die evolutionären Besonderheiten in einigen der späteren Filme zu untersuchen. Im Großen und Ganzen ist der Trickfilm zur Jahrhundertwende bühnengebunden, innerhalb eines frontalen Proszeniums komponiert, zeigt keine Kamerabewegung, verwendet lange und mittlere Aufnahmen und hält sich an die strikte Methodik, dass eine Aufnahme einem Film entspricht. Es gibt jedoch einige Filme zu Beginn des zwanzigsten Jahrhunderts, die es wagen, diese Richtlinien zu brechen, indem sie Aspekte wie mehrere Aufnahmen einführen.\n\nEines der auffälligsten Merkmale, die die Trickfilme gemeinsam haben, ist, dass sie in einem inneren Set innerhalb des Rahmens eines frontalen Proszeniums gedreht wurden. Die Kamera bewegt sich nicht aus ihrer Proszeniumsposition, um Figuren oder Objekte zu verfolgen. Diese Komposition war sehr häufig in frühen Filmen und wurzelte im Theater und, bei Trickfilmen, in Vaudeville- und Zauberkunststücken. Eine der Einschränkungen der Bühnennutzung besteht darin, dass sich Figuren in Trickfilmen im Allgemeinen nur seitwärts bewegen und nicht auf die Kamera zu oder von ihr weggehen. Nehmen Sie zum Beispiel die Handlung im Film Onkel Josh im Spukhotel (1900). Die Schauspieler kommen von der rechten Seite herein und bewegen sich entlang der horizontalen Achse hin und her. Auch wenn sie aus dem Rahmen treten, folgt die Kamera ihnen nicht.\n\nDer frontale Proszeniumsstil der Komposition bedeutet auch, dass die Aufnahmen tendenziell lange und, seltener, mittlere Aufnahmen sind. Nahaufnahmen werden in keinem der Trickfilme aus dem Edison-Katalog verwendet. Dies entlehnt sich der Theater- und Vaudeville-Tradition, bei der das Publikum die gesamte Aufführung zu jedem Zeitpunkt sehen würde, eingerahmt von den Grenzen der Bühne. Wie in den meisten frühen Filmen bewegen sich die Schauspieler nicht aus dem Mittelgrund zur Kamera, sodass Nahaufnahmen nie vorkommen.\n\nIm Allgemeinen folgen die meisten frühen Trickfilme dem Muster, dass eine konzeptionelle Aufnahme einem Film entspricht. Dies begrenzt die Länge der meisten Trickfilme auf etwa eine Minute oder weniger, abhängig von den verwendeten Bildern pro Sekunde. Es begrenzt auch die dramatische oder narrative Nutzung der Trickfilme; die meisten konzentrieren sich auf kurze Vaudeville-ähnliche Tricks, wie Magie, Verschwinden und Wechselakte mit wenig Geschichte. Beachten Sie jedoch, dass in einem Trickfilm eine konzeptionelle Aufnahme in den Augen des Betrachters nicht tatsächlich einer physischen Aufnahme entspricht. Eine einzige „Aufnahme“ kann tatsächlich mehrere zusammengefügte sein, um die Illusion des Erscheinens oder Verschwindens zu erzeugen. Betrachten Sie genau Die Hinrichtung von Maria Stuart (1895), einen der früheren Trickfilme. Eine gründlichere Untersuchung zeigt den Moment, in dem die physische Aufnahme mit dem abgetrennten „Kopf“ von Maria beginnt, obwohl der gesamte Film konzeptionell als eine Aufnahme wahrgenommen wird.\n\n[REWRITE]In exploring the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I chose to watch all the trick films, which numbered fifteen from 1895 to 1901.

Look closely at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary's severed \"head\" begins, even though the entire film is conceptually one shot to the viewer.",

    "original": "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels.

    "raw_output": "Die traditionelle \"Gothic Novel\" ist, sowohl im Wesen als auch im Namen, ein \"Oxymoron für 'Alt-Neu'\", wie Ian Watt sie in The Rise of the Gothic Novel beschreibt. Der gotische Modus wurde herabgesetzt, gelobt, beschuldigt, keine echte Tiefe zu haben, und für den 'schrecklichen Erhabenen' Aspekt, den er hervorrief, gefeiert (Burke). Der ursprüngliche \"Gothic Novel\", Horace Walpoles The Castle of Otranto, nutzte die Ideen sowohl der \"alten als auch der modernen\" Romanzen, um das Proto-Gothic-Genre zu schaffen und eine neue Methode des literarischen Ausdrucks zu entwickeln. Walpole verwendet \"alte\" theatralische Elemente und 'neue' Nachahmung der Natur in 'modernen' Romanen, um das zu präsentieren, was er als \"A Gothic Story\" bezeichnet (Walpole 4). Das gotische Genre verwendet viele Rückgriffe auf mittelalterliches gotisches Theater, Architektur und Traditionen. Selbst zur Zeit der Veröffentlichung von The Castle of Otranto war das Wort \"gotisch\" verwendet worden, um viele verschiedene Völker, Stile und Epochen zu beschreiben. Es wurde als archaisch oder unsophisticated angesehen angesichts der \"modernen\" gesellschaftlichen und literarischen \"Fortschritte\". Die Kombination des theatralischeren \"Gothic\" und des neuen Formats des Romans (das dem Leser eine persönlichere Sicht auf die Psychologie der Charaktere erlaubt) ist es, was es dem Gothic ermöglicht, so lange zu bestehen und zugleich für einen Leser, der zeitlich weit von der ursprünglichen Schrift entfernt ist, veraltet und neu zu werden.\n\nEines der prominentesten gotischen Konzepte in Gothic-Romanen ist das Konzept der Ritterlichkeit. Die mittelalterliche Idee der Ritterlichkeit, der Prozess der Ausbildung eines richtigen Ritters, wird sowohl beibehalten als auch im ursprünglichen Gothic-Roman, The Castle of Otranto, umgewandelt. Ritterlichkeit ist für Gothic-Autoren besonders wichtig, weil sie das klassische Bild des Ritters - tapfer, ehrenhaft, kompetent - repräsentiert und das vermeintliche oder wahrgenommene Fehlen dieses Ideals, das diese Autoren (insbesondere Walpole) in der Gesellschaft sahen. Durch die Verwendung der ritterlichen Konzepte und Manieren wird die \"gotische Vergangenheit\" idealisiert und romantisiert (was auf die zukünftige Entwicklung des Gothic zum Romantischen hindeutet) und wird verwendet, um die Gegenwart zu verbessern. Walpole befand sich, als er The Castle of Otranto schrieb, in einer politisch unruhigen Zeit und verzweifelte an der möglichen Zukunft. Er, vertieft in Politik und (umstritten) ungerechte Anschuldigungen, könnte begonnen haben zu denken, auch wenn nicht explizit, dass die vermeintliche Moral und angeborene \"Güte\" der Menschen, die in der gotischen Ära präsent waren, irgendwie in den Individuen verloren gegangen war, die die 'gegenwärtige' Gesellschaft ausmachten. In seinem Schreiben ist dieses Konzept in mehreren Charakteren deutlich zu sehen, einer davon ist die Figur Frederic. Der Leser kann erkennen, noch bevor er Frederic trifft, dass er viele ritterliche Eigenschaften verkörpert. Er wird beschrieben als:\n\nDie Beschreibung von ihm umfasst viele traditionell ritterliche Bilder; Frederic ist vor allem ein Prinz, er hat gelitten, wurde angemessen von Tragödien betroffen, die er verlässt, und wird derzeit vermutet, von Ungläubigen getötet worden zu sein. Die Figur des \"galanten und höflichen Ritters\" ist natürlich übertrieben, was das bald kommende gotische Motiv des Übermaßes ins Spiel bringt (66).\n\n[REWRITE]The traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is essentially an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New'\" both in essence and name, as Ian Watt describes in The Rise of the Gothic Novel.

The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",

Der Begriff Lieferkettenmanagement wurde 1982 von Keith Oliver, einem Berater, geprägt. Keith Oliver beschrieb den gesamten Prozess der Planung, Implementierung und Kontrolle dessen, was in der Lieferkette geschieht, um die Bedürfnisse der Kunden schnell und effizient zu erfüllen. Es gibt sechs Schlüsselelemente einer Lieferkette: Produktion, Lieferung, Bestandsmanagement, Standort, Transport und Information. Geschäftsleiter nutzen diese sechs Schlüsselelemente, um den bestmöglichen Kundenservice zu bieten.\n\nDie Produktion ist der erste Schritt im Prozess der Lieferkette und bildet die Grundlage für den gesamten Prozess. In der Produktionsphase wird festgelegt, wann, warum, wo und wie alles produziert wird. Manager müssen wissen, was Kunden wollen. Um das herauszufinden, können Manager den Markt analysieren. Der Markt ist der größte Indikator zur Bestimmung der Kundenanforderungen. Sobald Manager den Markt analysiert und die Nachfrage der Kunden verstanden haben, können sie entscheiden, welche Produkte produziert werden sollen und wie viele davon. Nachdem das Management entschieden hat, was produziert wird und in welcher Menge, bestimmen sie den besten Produktionsstandort hinsichtlich Volumen und Qualität der Waren, wobei die Kundennachfrage und -zufriedenheit berücksichtigt werden müssen. Nach der Festlegung des Produktionsstandorts konzentrieren sich die Manager auf die Planung der Arbeitslasten und die Wartung der Ausrüstung. Die Produktion ist ein sehr wichtiger Schritt im Lieferkettenprozess. Jedes Detail ist im gesamten Prozess entscheidend. Wenn nicht jedes Detail entsprechend geplant wird, könnte das Unternehmen auf lange Sicht viel Zeit und Geld kosten. Zum Beispiel habe ich früher bei Wal-Mart und Target gearbeitet. Beide Unternehmen haben ein Design, ein Handbuch und einen Prozess für jeden Bereich des Geschäfts. Es gibt ein festgelegtes Layout, wie die Uniform eines Mitarbeiters aussehen soll, bis hin zur Annahme von Lieferungen von Lastwagen. Klar umrissene Prozesse ermöglichen es einem Unternehmen, reibungslos zu arbeiten, ohne Verwirrung über Richtung und Erwartungen.\n\nDas zweite Schlüsselelement im Lieferkettenmanagement ist die Versorgung. Versorgung wird definiert als die strategischen Entscheidungen, die getroffen werden sollten, um die Kernfähigkeiten einer Einrichtung zu bestimmen, und Outsourcing-Partnerschaften sollten aus diesen Entscheidungen entstehen. Ein Unternehmen kann viele verschiedene Produktionsabteilungen für ein einziges Produkt haben. Alle Abteilungen bestehen aus unterschiedlichem Equipment, Arbeitern und Fachkenntnissen. Der Manager muss entscheiden, welche Abteilung am besten zu den verschiedenen Prozessen des Produkts passt. Das Management kann auch entscheiden, die Arbeit an andere Unternehmen auszulagern. Der Hauptgrund, warum ein Manager die Arbeit an Unternehmen auslagern würde, ist, Geschwindigkeit zu schaffen. Geschwindigkeit ist die Fähigkeit, Qualität und Flexibilität zu bieten und gleichzeitig die Kosten zu senken oder auf einem niedrigen Niveau zu halten.\n\n[REWRITE]Supply chain management involves the process of moving goods from the customer's order through raw materials, supply, production, and distribution to the customer.

Zwei Romane, die als viktorianisch gelten, aber von dieser Tradition abweichen, sind Oliver Twist und Wuthering Heights. Beide Romane verwenden ein Element des Geheimnisses und eine Vorliebe für das Bizarre, was untypisch für die Romane der Zeit ist, und stärken die Charaktere in jedem Werk, indem sie Einblicke in ihre Motive und Emotionen gewähren.\n\n„Und nun kamen Scharen von verwirrenden und verwirrenden Ideen, die sich in seinen Kopf drängten. Er schien immer noch zwischen Sikes und Crackit zu gehen, die heftig stritten: denn die Worte, die sie sagten, klangen in seinen Ohren; und als er seine eigene Aufmerksamkeit erlangte, ... stellte er fest, dass er mit ihnen sprach.... Plötzlich sprang er bei dem Bericht über Feuerwaffen zurück; und es erhoben sich laute Schreie und Rufe in die Luft; Lichter leuchteten vor seinen Augen, und alles war Lärm und Tumult, als eine unsichtbare Hand ihn hastig wegtrug. Durch all diese schnellen Visionen lief ein undefiniertes, unbehagliches Bewusstsein für Schmerz, das ihn unaufhörlich ermüdete und quälte.\" (Dickens, 220)\n\nDie beiden Romane nutzen dieses Geheimnis oft durch Traumsequenzen oder traumähnliche Zustände, obwohl der Inhalt und die Funktion in jedem spezifischen Fall variieren. In Oliver Twist enthüllen diese seltsamen Ereignisse oft einige Einblicke in Olivers innere Schichten, was ihn schmerzt und sein Bewusstsein über die wahre Natur der Dinge, die um ihn herum geschehen. Als das Schießen auf Oliver in Kapitel 28 endlich wieder aufgegriffen wird, erlebt Oliver das Schießen lebhaft erneut, als wäre es ein Traum, während er um Hilfe kämpft. Die Passage betont den Mangel an Kontrolle, den Oliver über die Ereignisse hatte, die sich entfalteten, sowie die ernsten Zustände, in die seine Gesundheit geraten war, was stark durch Olivers Halluzinationen von Sikes und Crackit präsent war. Das Schießen selbst überwältigt ihn, alle seine Sinne sind betäubt, da er die „unsichtbare Hand“ nicht bemerkt, die ihn wegträgt; er erlebt seine Verzweiflung erneut, entfernt vom Schock des Schmerzes, da der Schmerz jetzt konstant ist und mehr mit Angst als mit Überraschung verbunden ist. Da Oliver überwältigt ist, stellt sich die Frage, wessen Wille sein Unglück herbeigeführt hat, denn es war sicherlich nicht sein eigener. Diese Schießerei verstärkt die Vorstellung, dass Oliver wenig Kontrolle über irgendetwas hat, da er sich nicht einmal bemühen kann, die Kontrolle über den Ausgang eines Ereignisses zu gewinnen, selbst wenn sein Leben in Gefahr ist. Ein wachsendes Gefühl der Niederlage in Oliver wird auch durch diese Auswahl impliziert, als ob der alte Fagin begonnen hätte, ihn zu brechen, und ihn dazu zwang, diese Verzweiflung zu akzeptieren, was seine Fähigkeit zu reagieren beeinflusst. Denn sonst könnte man annehmen, dass Oliver sich zumindest um seines eigenen Lebens willen bemüht hätte.\n\n„Der Tag verging – Tag!

Ich habe mein Bestes getan, um ihnen in jedem Fach zu helfen, in dem sie Schwierigkeiten hatten, aber meine Stärken lagen in Englisch und Lesen. Einer der Lehrer hat mich gebeten, einem kleinen Jungen namens Adrian zu helfen (ich glaube, er war in der dritten oder vierten Klasse), der große Probleme beim Lesen hatte. Es dämmerte mir, dass etwas nicht stimmte; er hatte die seltsamsten Probleme. Einige Buchstaben konnte er perfekt aussprechen, andere überhaupt nicht, es war das merkwürdigste. Wissen Sie, er war lateinamerikanischer Abstammung, davon war ich überzeugt, aber der Junge sprach perfektes Englisch. Wir kämpften damit, bis zu dem Tag, an dem ich seine Mutter traf. Ich half beim Babysitten (mangels eines besseren Begriffs) ein paar Nachzügler, während der Rest der Nachmittagsgruppe auf einem Ausflug war, als seine Mutter hereinkam. Seine Mutter sprach kein Wort Englisch, nur Spanisch. Mit meinem sehr schlechten Spanischkenntnissen (ich lernte gerade erst), schafften wir es zu kommunizieren. Aber dann traf es mich wie ein Schlag: Adrian konnte gut lesen, er kannte nur das englische Alphabet nicht sehr gut. Ich weiß nicht, ob diese Erkenntnis ihm viel geholfen hat, aber ich hoffe, dass es ihm jetzt besser geht.\n\nIch erzähle diese Geschichte, um das Problem der Sprachbarriere in Schulen anzusprechen, besonders hier in Kalifornien. Ich erzähle sie auch, um zu beweisen, dass es nicht immer so offensichtlich ist, wie wir denken. Selbst für ein Kind, das perfekt Englisch spricht, kann das Lesen eine große Herausforderung sein. Ich denke, jeder kann zustimmen, dass dieses Problem existiert, also was tun wir? Im Fall von Adrian war die Lösung ziemlich einfach: Nachhilfe im englischen Lesen, besonders im Alphabet und in der Aussprache. Aber für die vielen Kinder, die kaum Englisch sprechen, ist die Lösung viel komplexer. Es gibt keine einzige Antwort. Das zweisprachige System, das Mainstream-Immersion, private Nachhilfe, ESL-Kurse, keine dieser Dinge wird dieses Problem allein lösen. Der Schlüssel liegt darin, all dies zu kombinieren!\n\nZunächst einmal ist das zweisprachige System eine großartige Idee. Nicht nur für Kinder, deren Muttersprache Spanisch ist, sondern für alle Kinder. \"Kinder in zweisprachigen Bildungsprogrammen haben sich akademisch besser als ihre Mitschüler erwiesen.\" Viel Angst umgibt diese Idee, dass es eine Verschwendung von Ressourcen ist und dass die Mehrheit der Kinder in den Schulen keinen Nutzen daraus ziehen wird. Aber das ist falsch. Wenn wir diese Art von Programmen als Regel und nicht als Ausnahme im Klassenzimmer anwenden würden, würden alle Kinder davon profitieren. Wie gehen wir das an? Müssen wir verlangen, dass alle Lehrer zweisprachig sind? Nein. Das wäre unvernünftig und etwas unrealistisch. Dennoch denke ich, dass es keinen Grund gibt, warum wir nicht spezielle Helfer, Tutoren, wie auch immer man sie nennen möchte, haben könnten, die zweisprachig sind.\n\n**Translation back to English:**\n\n[REWRITE] A few years ago, I worked in an after-school program tutoring elementary-aged students.

Einige von uns werden in die Sonntagsschule geschickt, um darüber zu lernen, während andere in den Tempel gehen oder in sich selbst nach Antworten suchen. Viele von uns akzeptieren bereitwillig die Religionen, die uns von unseren Eltern überliefert wurden. Einige jedoch lehnen sie vollständig ab und leugnen, dass es nichts gibt, das über das Wissen in unserem eigenen persönlichen egozentrischen Universum hinausgeht. Wir nehmen vielleicht eine Wertestruktur an, nur um später unsere Meinung zu ändern und eine andere an ihre Stelle zu setzen. Welchen Weg wir auch wählen, wir versuchen, einen Teil von uns selbst durch unsere eigenen einzigartigen Perspektiven der Spiritualität zu definieren. Wir suchen nach einem Licht in der Dunkelheit, das uns aus den Schatten heraus und in die Sonne führt.\n\n„Ein Kardinal“, sagte mein Vater, als ich ihn fragte, welche Vogelart seine liebste sei. Wir saßen auf der vorderen Veranda unseres Hauses und hörten dem Regen zu, der auf das Blechdach über uns prasselte, während wir gemeinsam Zigaretten rauchten. Die Regenrinnen leiteten den Regen ab und ertränkten die Pflanzen am Rand der Veranda. Er schaute in den Regen hinaus, mit einem Blick, der halb suchend, halb erinnernd wirkte. In den letzten Monaten war er dünner geworden, und seine Kleidung hing schlaff an seinem Körper. Auch sein Haar war weniger geworden, spärlicher als ich es in Erinnerung hatte. Er starrte immer noch in den Regen hinaus und vermied den Blickkontakt. Ich fühlte mich allein, ängstlich und unfähig, mit meinem Vater darüber zu sprechen, wie sehr ich ihn vermissen würde, weil das Reden darüber es für uns beide nur realer machen würde. Ich umarmte ihn, setzte mich wieder hin, rückte meinen Stuhl etwas näher zu seinem und schaute mit ihm gemeinsam in den fallenden Regen des Juniabends.\n\nMein Vater starb im Dezember desselben Jahres, fünf Tage nach meinem zweiundzwanzigsten Geburtstag.

Was für ein Gott würde so etwas tun, dachte ich mir. Nachts allein, sprach ich keine Gebete. Wenn es Gott gab, dachte ich, hatte er schon lange aufgehört, mir zuzuhören.\n\nIch hatte nicht sehen wollen, wie er von diesem Leben in ein anderes überging. Also hatte ich es nicht getan. Ich konnte nicht zusehen, wie das Leben, das mich erschaffen hatte, endete. Ich wollte meinen Vater so in Erinnerung behalten, wie er lebte, und nicht, wie er starb.

    "raw_output": "John Taylor aus Caroline war ein früher und leidenschaftlicher Verfechter des Republikanismus. Obwohl er in erster Linie Landwirt war, schuf dieser Beruf zusammen mit seiner kurzen politischen Karriere einen Mann, der für seine Hingabe und Offenheit in Fragen der persönlichen Freiheit und der Regierung bekannt war. Seine Hingabe an ein agrarisches System bildete die Grundlage für fast alle seine Ansichten über die Regierung. Sein Versuch, das zu bewahren und zu fördern, was er als den vorzüglichsten aller Berufe betrachtete, prägte seine Argumente über Souveränität, Verfassungsmäßigkeit und sogar das Justizsystem.\n\nJohn Taylor glaubte, dass die Vereinigten Staaten eine große Chance hatten, ein ideales System zu schaffen, da es keine einheimische Tradition gab, die die Schöpfer der Regierung behindern könnte, was die Etablierung eines Systems der Selbstregierung ermöglichte. Er glaubte fest an die natürlichen Rechte des Menschen und daran, dass sie alle voneinander abhängig sind – was bedeutet, dass, wenn eines verweigert wird, alle scheitern und der Wert der verbleibenden verringert wird. Diese Rechte sollten daher außerhalb der Reichweite der Regierung liegen. Er behauptete, dass das, was einige als den „Naturzustand“ bezeichneten, bedeutete, dass jene mit körperlicher Stärke und bösartiger Intelligenz profitierten, aber dass dies in einer Zivilisation nicht der Weg sein dürfe.\n\nUm diese ideale Gesellschaft zu schaffen, glaubte Taylor, dass eine Regierung geschaffen werden müsse, die das inhärente Gute und Böse im Menschen berücksichtigt. Taylor war in seinen Ansichten über eine dualistische Moral sehr starr. Er behauptete, dass „da die Regierung von Menschen ausgeübt wird, alle ihre Tugenden und Laster menschlich sein müssen“ (ebd., S. 167). Er definierte gute Prinzipien als solche, die Privateigentum schützen, die Landwirtschaft verbessern und den Kapitalismus entmutigen, und glaubte, dass eine Regierung, die auf guten Prinzipien gegründet ist, gerecht funktionieren würde, unabhängig von ihrer Verwaltung, die unvermeidlich von Gier und Eigeninteresse geleitet würde. Eigeninteresse, so glaubte er, sei die Motivation des Menschen in allen Dingen, aber dass diese Eigenschaft nur als böse angesehen werde, wenn sie über die Schaffung einer auf das Gemeinwohl basierenden Gesellschaft hinaus zu Untergesellschaften führe, die auf Kosten anderer lebten. Eine gute Regierung sei notwendig, um das natürliche Böse des Menschen zu bändigen, und selbst dann müsse sie sorgfältig beobachtet werden, um die Hinzufügung schlechter Prinzipien zu vermeiden.\n\nTaylor, wie viele andere entschlossene Republikaner seiner Zeit, forderte eine strikte Auslegung der Verfassung. Er wollte eine extrem begrenzte Bundesregierung, der nicht mehr Rechte oder Befugnisse zugestanden werden sollten, als explizit in der Verfassung angegeben waren. Er wusste, dass eine umfassende Bundesregierung teuer war und daher wahrscheinlich despotisch sein würde. Er glaubte jedoch, dass eine einfache, wörtliche Auslegung gefährlich sei und dass eine solche Methode ohne Bezug auf die Absicht der Verfasser leicht korrupt werden könnte. Noch mehr betrachtete er die Unabhängigkeitserklärung als die wahre Charta der Vereinigten Staaten, da sie das Land expliziter als eine Gruppe souveräner Staaten beschreibt und nicht als eine Nation.\n\n[REWRITE]John Taylor of Caroline was an early and passionate advocate of Republicanism.

His efforts to preserve and promote what he considered the most superior of all careers shaped his arguments on sovereignty, constitutionality, and even the judicial system.\n\nJohn Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government, allowing for the establishment of a system of self-government. He firmly believed in the natural rights of man and that they are all interdependent—meaning if one is denied, they all fail, and the value of those remaining is diminished. Therefore, these rights should be beyond the reach of the government. He claimed that what some called the \"state of nature\" meant that those with physical strength and malevolent intelligence benefited, but this must not be the way in a civilization.\n\nTo create this ideal society, Taylor believed a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil in man. Taylor was very rigid in his views on dualistic morality. He claimed that \"since government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). He defined good principles as those that protect private property, improve agriculture, and discourage capitalism, believing that a government founded on good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be led by greed and self-interest. Self-interest, he believed, was man's motivation in all things, but this trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies living at the expense of others. A good government was necessary to restrain man's natural evil, and even then, it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n\nLike many other staunch Republicans of his time, Taylor called for a strict construction of the Constitution. He wanted an extremely limited Federal government, with no more rights or powers than those explicitly stated in the Constitution. He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive and therefore likely to be despotic. However, he believed that a simple, literal interpretation was dangerous and that without reference to the intent of the writers, such a method could easily become corrupt. Furthermore, he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",

Emotionslos, still, mit einer geübten Aufmerksamkeit, die studierte, aber sich weigerte, das Studienobjekt mit einem abstrakten Verständnis zu verknüpfen, analysierte mein Verstand das Bild vor meinen Augen. Gedanken schlüpften in meinen Geist und verschwanden wieder fast schneller, als sie erschienen. So reibungslos und sauber arbeitete mein Bewusstsein, dass es schien, als hätte ich keine eigenen Gedanken, sondern nur eine aktive und flüssige Erfahrung dessen, was ich betrachtete. \nEinmal, auf Anraten eines Künstlers, mit dem ich arbeitete, kaufte ich ein Kunstlehrbuch mit dem Titel \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\". Ich wollte schon seit meinem sechsten Lebensjahr lernen, wie man zeichnet, und dieses Buch lehrt alles, vom Verständnis, was ein Bleistift ist, bis zu den Prozessen, die das Gehirn zur Interpretation von Linien verwendet. Eine Technik, die das Buch lehrt, ist, einen quadratischen Rahmen um jedes Bild zu legen, das der Künstler studieren möchte. So verwandelt sich ein überwältigend detailliertes Bild, zum Beispiel eine Schüssel mit Obst auf einem Tisch in einer Küche, die mit einem Esszimmer verbunden ist, in ein leicht verständliches Bild, diese Schüssel mit Obst auf einer einfachen Ebene. \nZu dieser Zeit, als ich auf die Schüssel vor mir blickte, konnte ich den Rahmen des Künstlers nicht mental projizieren. Ich war so überwältigt, so beeindruckt, dass ich nur stehen und in Verwunderung starren konnte. Picasso durchlief seine blaue Phase, Monet liebte Grünflächen, italienische Renaissance-Meister zeigten ein Regenbogen von Farben. Wenn ich irgendwelche Ansprüche hatte, meine Perspektive als künstlerisch wertvoll zu betrachten, dann waren vor mir die Anfänge meines Bildes, der Anfang meiner Geschichte, Arbeit in Braun. \nDie Fingerspitzen landeten auf meinem gewählten Kunstwerkzeug, die Muskeln spannten und entspannten sich, als meine Hand durch den Raum glitt, der Wille meines Geistes nahm Gestalt und Form an, was der kreativste Moment meines Lebens hätte sein können. Wasser wirbelte, ruhig und glatt, kristallklar und sauber. Materieflocken lösten sich vom Ganzen und wurden ins Nichts getragen. Die Muskeln spannten sich an, zuckten und verkrampften sich ein wenig schneller und ängstlicher beim zweiten Mal, meine Hand schlug erneut auf den Griff der Toilette. Das anstößige braune Paket weigerte sich zu bewegen, klebte wie eine Schnecke am Boden der Toilette. \nDer Wischmopp locker in der Hand, die Füße einen Fuß auseinander, die grüne Krawatte unbequem um meinen Hals geknotet, runzelte ich leicht die Stirn, als ich das unhöfliche Bündel verarbeiteter Tier- und Pflanzenreste betrachtete, das jemand als Nachricht für die Trottel hinterlassen hatte, die die Toiletten bei Rite Aid reinigten. Ein paar Spülungen mehr, ein paar weitere ruhige nachdenkliche Momente für mich, dann bewegte sich meine Hand zur Wand zu meiner Rechten, ergriff das Blatt am Ende des Toilettenpapiers und begann sich selbst zu mumifizieren, bis es einem Ofenhandschuh ähnelte. Aufrecht stehend, dann sich an der Taille biegend, tauchte meine Hand langsam in die Schüssel, wie eine Mutter, die in den Ofen für den Truthahn zum Erntedankfest greift...\n\nEnglish Translation:\nDownwards I stared, my mind blankly comprehending the sight before me.

    "raw_output": "Teenager sterben hinter dem Steuer. Verschiedene Faktoren kommen zusammen, um diesen tödlichen Vektor der Statistik für die jüngsten amerikanischen Fahrer zu schaffen. Die National Institutes of Health erklären, dass ein Aspekt des Problems darin besteht, dass das Gehirn von Teenagern buchstäblich nicht bereit für die Gefahren des Fahrens ist. Einfache Unerfahrenheit liegt auch im Kern des Problems. Diese Unerfahrenheit führt nicht nur zu mehr tödlichen Unfällen, sondern auch zu einer höheren Rate von Fahrzeugüberschlägen, überhöhter Geschwindigkeit und Abkommen von der Straße. Jugendliche schneiden auch viel schlechter ab, wenn sie mit Gleichaltrigen reisen – was jeder mit einem Funken Verstand weiß, dass sie regelmäßig tun. Das Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center führte eine Studie durch, die folgende Korrelation zeigte: zwischen dem Alter des Passagiers und der Anzahl der Verkehrsunfälle, die auftreten. Kalifornien und andere Staaten haben versucht, die Sicherheit von jugendlichen Fahrern zu erhöhen, indem sie vorübergehende provisorische Lizenzen verlangen, die die Stunden einschränken, in denen Jugendliche fahren dürfen, und andere Minderjährige als Passagiere ausschließen. Aber provisorische Führerscheine sind meiner Meinung nach nur eine Übergangslösung. Das eigentliche Problem ist, dass die jüngsten Fahrer als Gruppe – laut allen statistischen Indikatoren – einfach nicht in der Lage sind, die Risiken und Verantwortlichkeiten angemessen zu bewältigen. Psychologe Marvin Zuckerman glaubt, dass sogar 18 zu jung für einen regulären Führerschein ist. USA Today berichtet, dass Zuckerman Forschungen durchgeführt hat, die darauf hindeuten, dass es bei Personen unter 19-20 Jahren einen verbreiteten Wunsch gibt, Risiken allein wegen des Nervenkitzels einzugehen. Es ist daher sinnvoll, das Fahren zumindest solange zu verzögern, bis die Neigung zum Nervenkitzel nachzulassen beginnt. Wenn wir weiterhin Führerscheine an junge Teenager ausgeben, werden wir nicht nur weiterhin tödliche Unfälle sehen, sondern die Zahl der Todesopfer wird in den nächsten Jahren wahrscheinlich ein erschreckendes Ausmaß erreichen. Bis 2010 werden die Kinder der Babyboomer berechtigt sein, zu fahren, und Millionen neuer jugendlicher Fahrer werden bereit sein, auf die Straße zu gehen. Die Gesetzgebung, die sich mit diesem Problem befasst, wäre relativ einfach. Schulen könnten weiterhin Fahrunterricht anbieten, um den Lernprozess für zukünftige Fahrer zu beginnen, aber niemand unter 18 Jahren dürfte ein Kraftfahrzeug betreiben. Ein vorläufiger Führerschein könnte noch vor der Erteilung eines vollständigen Führerscheins ausgestellt werden, und eine bestimmte Anzahl praktischer Fahrstunden wäre ebenfalls erforderlich. Die spezifische Anzahl der erforderlichen Stunden könnte auf der Anzahl der Stunden basieren, die bereits von der Mehrheit der Staaten verlangt werden (in Kalifornien sind das zum Beispiel derzeit 6 Stunden hinter dem Lenkrad und 50 Stunden Praxis mit einem Erwachsenen). Da die tödlichen Statistiken für jugendliche Fahrer aus einem Querschnitt aller Staaten stammen, wäre eine einheitliche, nationale Gesetzgebung zu diesem Thema ein vernünftiges – und ich glaube, effektives – Mittel, um Jugendliche im ganzen Land zu schützen. Die von mir vorgeschlagene Gesetzgebung ist keineswegs eine neue Idee.\n\n[REWRITE]Teenagers are dying behind the wheel.

    "original": "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",

Anschließend wird die Diagnose erklärt, einschließlich häufiger Merkmale oder \"rote Fahnen\". Schließlich endet das Papier mit Möglichkeiten, wie ein Lehrer in einer integrierten Klassenumgebung einem Schüler mit CAPD helfen kann.\n\nDie zentrale auditorische Verarbeitungsstörung (CAPD), auch bekannt als Auditive Verarbeitungsstörung (APD), \"bezieht sich auf die Effizienz und Effektivität, mit der das zentrale Nervensystem (ZNS) auditorische Informationen nutzt. Eng definiert bezieht sich (C)AP auf die perzeptuelle Verarbeitung von auditorischen Informationen im ZNS und die neurobiologische Aktivität, die dieser Verarbeitung zugrunde liegt und elektrophysiologische auditive Potenziale erzeugt\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), was bedeutet, dass es sich um eine Störung handelt, bei der das zentrale Nervensystem (d.h. das Gehirn) Gehörtes nicht richtig verarbeiten kann. Menschen mit CAPD können normal hören und gelten daher nicht als \"hörgeschädigt\"; vielmehr funktioniert der Bereich des Gehirns, der das Gehörte übersetzt, Wörter trennt oder Gespräche von Hintergrundgeräuschen unterscheidet, nicht wie üblich.\n\nDie früheste Erwähnung der Störung, die zu CAPD wurde, stammt aus den mittleren 1950er Jahren und wurde \"auditorische Imperzeption\" genannt (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), als Forscher Kinder mit Kommunikationsstörungen untersuchten. Das italienische Forscherteam Bocca, Calearo und Cassinari begann 1954, Tests für diese Kinder zu entwickeln; 1961 führte Kimura \"dichotische Tests ein und formulierte ein Modell zur Erklärung der Physiologie des CANS, die der dichotischen Wahrnehmung zugrunde liegt\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Eine nationale Konferenz im Jahr 1977 regte die Forschung an Kindern mit CAPD an.\n\nCAPD manifestiert sich auf verschiedene Weise: Die betroffene Person kann möglicherweise nicht in der Lage sein, den Klang im Raum zu lokalisieren oder zu hören; sie könnte Schwierigkeiten haben, zwischen zwei oder mehr \"akustischen Ereignissen\" (Klangvorkommnissen) zu unterscheiden; sie kann möglicherweise keine Klangmuster erkennen; sie könnte nicht in der Lage sein, Veränderungen in der Sprache zu unterscheiden (wie z.B. Sarkasmus anhand einer Stimmänderung zu erkennen); ein Klang könnte durch einen nachfolgenden Klang blockiert werden; sie könnte nicht in der Lage sein, Klanghinweise zu synthetisieren (d.h. in einer bedeutungsvollen Weise zu interpretieren, auf die sie dann reagieren kann); und sie könnte nicht in der Lage sein, die Reihenfolge zu bestimmen, in der auditive Informationen präsentiert werden (Ferre).\n\nUm CAPD zu diagnostizieren, muss der Patient \"systematisch in Bezug auf Hörverhalten und/oder Leistung bei Tests der auditorischen Funktion\" beobachtet werden, was von \"Audiologen, SLPs, Psychologen und anderen unter Verwendung einer Vielzahl von Maßnahmen zur Bewertung auditorisch bezogener Fähigkeiten\" durchgeführt werden kann (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Dies kann Fragebögen und Umfragen, die Beobachtung von Hörverhalten und die Reaktion des Patienten auf bestimmte Reize umfassen. Derzeit gibt es kein einziges Werkzeug oder Test, der konsistent mit einer hohen Erfolgsrate zur Diagnose verwendet wird, und es ist keine Ursache für die Störung bekannt. Viele der verwendeten Tests präsentieren dem Patienten mehrere, gleichzeitige auditive Reize und fordern ihn dann auf, bestimmte Elemente zu unterscheiden, wie eine Reihe von Wörtern oder Zahlen.

Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",

Werte, die ich dem Bereich der Sozialarbeit bieten kann, umfassen Folgendes: Dienstleistung, Respekt, ethische Natur, Engagement zur Verbesserung der Beziehungen zwischen anderen und zur beruflichen Weiterentwicklung, um in meinem Bereich kompetent zu bleiben. Diese Kernwerte sind nicht nur für Sozialarbeiter wichtig; sie sind mir persönlich wichtig.\n\nIch wollte schon immer anderen helfen, war mir aber unsicher über den beruflichen Weg, dem ich folgen wollte. Während meiner Jahre in der High School und im College sah ich viele Menschen, die ihre Probleme verleugneten, und einige nutzten Bewältigungsmechanismen, die weniger ideal waren. Aufgrund der Situationen, die ich miterlebte, entschied ich mich, einen Bachelor-Abschluss in Psychologie zu verfolgen. Noch unsicher über einen Karriereweg, entschied ich mich, nach meinem Abschluss am Piedmont College im Jahr 2009 eine Pause einzulegen. Eines Tages in diesem Sommer besuchte ich eine Freundin, die mich einem sechzehnjährigen Jungen vorstellte, der nervös auf ihrem Sofa saß. Sie erklärte mir, warum er zu Besuch war: um seinen missbrauchenden Eltern zu entkommen. Am nächsten Tag erfuhr ich, dass er die Polizei zu seiner elterlichen Wohnung gerufen hatte. Um zu sehen, ob ich in irgendeiner Weise helfen konnte, fuhr ich zu seinem Elternhaus. Dort angekommen, erklärte ich der Polizei privat meine Bedenken und erzählte ihnen, dass ich gerade einen Psychologie-Abschluss am Piedmont College gemacht hatte. Die Polizei bat mich, mit den Eltern zu sprechen, da das Gesetz nichts für den Teenager tun konnte. Als ich die Eltern nach der Situation befragte, wirkten sie nervös und verwendeten Ausreden, um das „manipulative“ Verhalten ihres Sohnes zu beschreiben, weil er Außenstehende in „einfache“ Streitigkeiten einbezog. Nach dieser besonderen Erfahrung begann ich ernsthaft in Erwägung zu ziehen, eine Karriere in der Sozialarbeit einzuschlagen, um Kindern bei „einfachen“ Streitigkeiten zwischen Familienmitgliedern zu helfen.\n\nEin weiterer Wert, der für den Bereich der Sozialarbeit wichtig ist, ist soziale Gerechtigkeit. Als Gesellschaft behaupten wir, dass das Individuum wichtig ist, und wir betrauern diejenigen, die wir verloren haben. Das Konzept des \"Individuums\", das die Gesellschaft hält, ist mehr ein Anhänger archaischer Traditionen als tatsächliche Einzigartigkeit. Wenn die Gesellschaft also verloren gegangene Individuen betrauert, warum streben wir dann danach, „allen anderen“ ähnlich zu sein? Ich bin ein Individuum und genieße es nicht, mich selbst einzuschränken, um anderen ähnlich zu sein. Während meiner Jahre in der High School und im College protestierte ich wann immer möglich gegen soziale Ungerechtigkeit: färbte mein Haar in unnatürlichen Farben, trug Kleidung, die zu meiner Persönlichkeit passte, durchstach meine Ohren über das traditionelle Maß hinaus, erklärte mein Engagement bei der GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), kämpfte gegen Rassismus und Diskriminierung, wann immer ich es erlebte, usw. Ich glaube an soziale Gerechtigkeit und werde weiterhin gegen soziale Ungerechtigkeit protestieren.\n\n[REWRITE]In my pursuit of an education in social work, I aim to follow a career with the Division of Family and Children Services to assist children who have been abused or neglected, and to offer support to struggling families.

The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",

Die soziokulturellen Modelle betrachten Umweltbeziehungen und ihre Anwendungen auf Rasse, Ethnizität, Demografie und sozioökonomischen Status. Die folgende Überprüfung der Insomnie betrachtet diese Modelle und erklärt jede ausgewählte Forschung, die sich darauf bezieht und die Modelle besser erklärt. Die Erklärungen der Forschung und ihrer Ergebnisse werden dann kritisch bewertet, um ihre spezifischen Stärken und Schwächen zu erwähnen.\n\nEine Schlafstörung kann als primäre Schlafstörung, eine Schlafstörung im Zusammenhang mit einer anderen psychischen Störung oder eine Schlafstörung im Zusammenhang mit anderen Problemen charakterisiert werden. Die primären Schlafstörungen sind Dyssomnien oder Parasomnien, während Schlafstörungen, die mit einer anderen psychischen Störung in Verbindung stehen, mit einer Achse-I- oder Achse-II-Störung in Verbindung stehen. Andere Kategorien von Schlafstörungen können auf medizinische Komplikationen oder den Konsum einer Substanz zurückzuführen sein. Die Dyssomnien sind: Primäre Insomnie, Primäre Hypersomnie, Narkolepsie, Atmungsbezogene Schlafstörung, Schlafstörung des zirkadianen Rhythmus und Dyssomnie nicht anderweitig spezifiziert (NAS). Während primäre Insomnie eine Komplikation beim ausreichenden oder aufrechterhaltenen Schlaf darstellt, ist primäre Hypersomnie eine Schwierigkeit, wach zu bleiben, beide für mindestens einen Monat. Narkolepsie umfasst Kataplexie und/ oder automatischen REM-Schlaf. Während sich Dyssomnien auf das Einleiten und Aufrechterhalten des Schlafes konzentrieren, sind die Parasomnien Schlafstörungen, die mit Verhaltensstörungen und/oder physiologischen Ereignissen verbunden sind. Parasomnien sind Albtraumstörung, Schlafangststörung, Schlafwandelstörung und Parasomnien, die nicht anderweitig spezifiziert sind. Die Schlafstörungen im Zusammenhang mit einer anderen psychischen Störung umfassen Schlafschwierigkeiten aufgrund von Achse-I- (Klinische Störungen) oder Achse-II-Störungen (Persönlichkeitsstörungen oder geistige Behinderung). Die folgende Überprüfung konzentriert sich auf Insomnie und etwas auf primäre Schlafstörungen im Allgemeinen in Bezug auf die biologischen und soziokulturellen Modelle.\n\nDas biologische Modell von Schlafstörungen konzentriert sich auf Gene, vererbbare Faktoren und physiologisch erworbene Aspekte von Schlafstörungen. Neuronen im Hypothalamus, die Orexin enthalten, sind für die Regulierung von Schlaf und Wachheit verantwortlich. Diese Studie experimentierte mit Mäusen und stellte fest, dass es phänotypische GABAB-Rezeptoren auf den Orexin-Neuronen gibt, die speziell für Schlaf-/Wachzustände verantwortlich sind. Die Aktivierung des GABAA-Rezeptors induziert Reaktionen, die den Schlaf fördern. Wenn es am Feuern gehindert wird, kann dies die Angst reduzieren und den Schlaf fördern. Der GABAB-Agonist (Baclofen) erhöhte die Schlafzeit (Matsuki et al., 2009). Solche Ergebnisse implizieren, dass die Tiermodelle von Mäusen auf Studien am Menschen verallgemeinert werden können. Dies zeigt, dass es eine genetische und umweltbedingte Grundlage für den physischen GABAB-Rezeptor beim Menschen gibt. Ein Problem oder Fehlen dieses Rezeptors könnte die Fähigkeit beeinträchtigen, ohne Medikamente ausreichend zu schlafen. Die soziokulturelle Implikation dieser Studie ist, dass, wenn der Phänotyp vererbt wurde, dies den Schlaf regulieren könnte und eine Veränderung des Rezeptors den Schlaf einer Person natürlich stören würde. Dies würde sich negativ auf Lebensaspekte wie Schule, Karriere und alltägliche Ereignisse auswirken, die monotone Aufgaben und Konzentration erfordern.\n\n[REWRITE]The paper discusses the biological and sociocultural models related to the sleep disorder insomnia.

For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",

As our campus continues to grow, moving from place to place becomes increasingly difficult. What's the best solution to the mobility problem? On a college campus, it's the bicycle.

Die Menschen schätzen die Gemeinschaft über das Individuum und werden von Anfang an darauf konditioniert, sofortiges Glück über alles andere zu suchen. Die Bürger werden als Schachfiguren in einem größeren Spiel enthüllt, die an eine Ideologie gebunden sind, wie sie vom Weltkontrolleur diktiert wird. Bei der Betrachtung des Werks unter dem Aspekt des marxistischen Theismus bemerkt man die zugrunde liegenden Bedenken des Autors in Bezug auf die Entwicklung der genannten Systeme. Häufige Begriffe im Marxismus, wie Homogenität und Verdinglichung, unterstreichen die Idee, dass Huxleys Roman ein Kommentar zu den Fehlern der aufstrebenden Wirtschaft seiner Zeit ist.\n\nKapitalismus wird durch die Verwendung der marxistischen These des falschen Bewusstseins satirisiert. Im Wesentlichen wird der gewöhnlichen Bürgerschaft verhindert, die wahren Beziehungen zu anderen Klassen in wirtschaftlichen Begriffen zu erkennen, da sie in erster Linie an ihrem eigenen Vorteil interessiert sind. Es wird gesagt, dass dies das Ergebnis der ideologischen Kontrolle des Proletariats und der gewöhnlichen Arbeiter ist, was durch die Konditionierung der Menschen in \"Schöne neue Welt\" offensichtlich ist. Die gewöhnlichen Klassen, Delta, Gamma usw., haben keinen eigenen Willen; durch Hypnopädie wird der Drang zu konsumieren, auszugeben, zu genießen über alles andere hinaus gestärkt. Dies wird, wie bereits erwähnt, vom Weltkontrolleur manipuliert. Hegemonie, im Wesentlichen die Idee, dass Gruppen sozialer Klassen von einer separaten Gruppe von Individuen vollständig dominiert werden, wird in diesem Fall offensichtlich verwendet. Die unteren Klassen sind sich der Manipulation völlig unbewusst und \"kaufen buchstäblich in eine Ideologie ein, die diese Struktur unterstützt\" (d.h. Kapitalismus & Konsumismus). Die oberen Klassen werden mit der Fähigkeit geboren, sich dessen bewusst zu sein, tun jedoch nichts; nur wenige Alphas oder Betas, abgesehen von Charakteren wie Bernard, tun mehr als ihren Platz zu akzeptieren. In der Tat sind die Interaktionen der sozialen Klassen, wie ausführlicher diskutiert wird, bedeutende Hinweise auf die wahrgenommene Unterdrückung durch den Kapitalismus.\n\nBeziehungen zwischen unterschiedlichen Individuen existieren in \"Schöne neue Welt\" nicht. Der Roman weigert sich scheinbar, die Charaktere zu unterscheiden - sie sind, selbst unter den Hauptfiguren, ohne Tiefe. Vielleicht schlägt Huxley vor, dass der Aufstieg von Technologie und Kapitalismus zusammen den Menschen seines freien Willens und Ausdrucks beraubt. Liebe existiert nicht, noch die Extreme irgendeiner Emotion; vielmehr werden die Interaktionen oberflächlich gehalten, deutlich dargestellt durch die Bemerkungen der Männer über Frauen, die sich hauptsächlich auf ihr körperliches Erscheinungsbild beziehen (z.B. pneumatische Qualität), und die unverschämten Kommentare der Frauen über ihre Begegnungen, sozusagen. Darüber hinaus deutet die Zufriedenheit jeder gesellschaftlichen Klasse mit ihrem Status in der Hierarchie auf den sozioökonomischen Effekt des Kapitalismus hin. Ihr absolutes Gehorsam in ihrer Rolle in der Gemeinschaft ist ein Hinweis auf den marxistischen Gedanken über das Proletariat, das fälschlicherweise von seiner eigenen Überlegenheit über alles andere überzeugt ist, solange es weiterhin konsumiert, gehorcht und sich mit dem Rest seiner Gleichaltrigen in Einklang bringt.\n\n[REWRITE]Aldous Huxley criticizes the looming threat of technology and the capitalist structure that reinforces it through the creation of a dystopia in his novel \"Brave New World.\" People value community over the individual and are conditioned from the start to seek immediate happiness above all else.

Eines der Hauptthemen der hitzigen Diskussionen im Unterricht war, ob der Islam eine feindliche Religion ist oder nicht. Ich glaube, dass diese Frage heute noch relevanter ist als je zuvor. Rückblickend auf die Ereignisse seit dem 11. September habe ich persönlich beobachtet, wie sich die Massenmedien von einer feindlichen Sichtweise des Islam und seiner Extremisten zu einer extremen Form der Toleranz gegenüber dem Islam in Amerika entwickelt haben. Ich glaube nicht, dass wir im Jahr 2001 jemals einen Präsidentschaftskandidaten mit dem Namen Borac Obama hätten haben können, der offensichtlich einen muslimischen Hintergrund in seiner Familie hat.\n\nDie Biografie des Propheten fasziniert mich, denn laut dem, was ich über die Geschichte von Muhammad weiß, widerspricht die Biografie der Persönlichkeit von Muhammad. Aus dem, was ich weiß und in der Vergangenheit gelernt habe, dachte ich, dass Muhammad Menschen zum Islam zwang. Er eroberte Stämme und zwang sie dann, die islamische Religion anzunehmen. Aber laut der Biografie wurde Muhammad als eine Art Märtyrer dargestellt, der missverstanden wurde und sich sogar vor anderen demütigte. Danach kamen die Menschen Stück für Stück, um die 'Wahrheit' in seinen Lehren zu erkennen und suchten ihn auf.\n\nAußerdem gibt es einige unheimliche Ähnlichkeiten zwischen den Diensten von Jesus und den 'Wundern' von Muhammad. Das offensichtlichste ist, als er Hammelfleisch und Milch nahm und sie vermehrte, so dass es mehr als genug für vierzig Männer gab. Diese Art des Schreibens lässt mich glauben, dass die Autoren wollten, dass Muhammad als der demütige Prophet wahrgenommen wird, der nichts beweisen musste, sondern einfach in Wahrheit und Wundern lebte. Diese Art von Trugschluss ist die schlimmste, weil sie das Wunder und das Leben von Jesus Christus herabsetzt. Für mich wirkt es, als würden sie versuchen, das Leben und die Persönlichkeit von Jesus durch Muhammad zu stehlen und sich dafür Anerkennung zu verschaffen.\n\nEs gibt auch viele Geschichten in der Biografie, die es so erscheinen lassen, als sei ein Teil ihrer Absicht, Beweise für 'Zeugnisse' oder dafür zu liefern, wie Menschen 'von selbst' zum Islam konvertierten. Aber das Problem ist, dass viele der Geschichten zumindest aus einer dritten Perspektive stammen. In der Geschichte veranschaulicht der Autor, dass er es von so-und-so gehört hat, der es wiederum von so-und-so gehört hat usw. Das gefiel mir nicht besonders, weil, obwohl ihre Idee war, dass es die Wahrheit der Geschichten beweist, ich dachte, es mindert die Geschichten und macht sie umso verdächtiger.\n\nIch denke, das, was mich an diesem Werk am meisten stört, ist, dass sie versuchen, Muhammad als einen gottgefälligen Mann zu verherrlichen, der demütig, liebenswert, weise und sanft war. Aber die Geschichte widerspricht der Vorstellung, dass Muhammad ein sanfter und demütiger Mann war, und ich kann nicht umhin zu denken, ob die Muslime von heute die wahre Geschichte hinter Muhammads Aufstieg zur Macht kennen.\n\n[REWRITE]  \nNearly four years ago, I attended a course on Islam at CBC.

    "transformed": "The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his life were left behind as Christian thought evolved after his time. Looking at this history broadly, we notice a trend of Christianity moving further from its origins. Today's world shows a growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency. Although traditional individuals remain and resist thinking beyond what they were taught, this segment may not have enough influence over the whole. Among Christians, historical awareness is set to grow immensely in the coming years. A desire will spread to differentiate doctrines added to Christianity over time from the original intentions of the religion's namesake. It might take decades or centuries, but the result is inevitable: a significant reversal in Christian history will occur. There will be a shift back to its original form. A movement will grow to peel away layers of doctrine, one by one, as if the clock were turning back, until only the essence of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God remains, before any other thinkers made claims. As this trend moves through the United States and Europe, influencing many to worship as if they lived in Jesus' time, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way. However, as the theological clock moves backward, the vast diversity in Christendom will transform into more uniformity in belief and practice. Across regions, denominations, and divisions of all kinds, we will see increasing similarities instead of differences. Human history is filled with notable reversals.

They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements.

Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich.

Sie wollen nur für sich selbst sorgen und ihr Leben so gut wie möglich gestalten, aber nie für jemanden sorgen, der unter ihnen steht. \"Der Dschungel\" zeigt dies auf viele Arten. Der offensichtlichste Bereich sind die Besitzer und Manager der großen Fabriken. Alles, was sie tun wollen, ist, ihre Unternehmen und Fabriken so groß und großartig wie möglich zu machen. Sie kümmern sich nicht um jemanden oder irgendetwas, das ihnen im Weg steht oder verletzt wird, weil sie vorankommen. Laut Upton Sinclairs Werk \"Die Linie der Gebäude stand klar und schwarz gegen den Himmel; hier und da erhoben sich aus der Masse die großen Schornsteine, mit dem Fluss von Rauch, der bis ans Ende der Welt strömte\". Sinclair versucht, ein Bild des großen Schadens zu zeichnen, den diese Verschmutzung verursacht. Er zeigt, dass die Besitzer keine Rücksicht auf Menschen oder Tiere nehmen, die verletzt werden könnten. Sie kümmern sich nicht um die großen Rauchwolken, die aus den Fabriken quellen, oder um den Abfluss von Tierkot und Urin aus den tausenden von Ställen rund um Packingtown.  \nDie Besitzer und Manager kümmerten sich auch nicht um ihre Angestellten, die sie reich machten. Sie würden alles tun, um einen zusätzlichen Dollar zu verdienen oder zu sparen, \"So ist der Ort von oben bis unten einfach ein brodelnder Kessel voller Eifersucht und Hass; es gibt keine Loyalität oder Anstand irgendwo darin, es gibt keinen Platz darin, wo ein Mann etwas gegen einen Dollar zählt\". Sie zwingen ihre Angestellten, schreckliche Stunden zu arbeiten, und dann könnten sie, ohne auch nur einen Tag Vorwarnung, gleichzeitig viele Menschen entlassen, ohne Entschädigung oder Hilfe bei der Arbeitssuche. In der Ära, in der \"Der Dschungel\" spielt, gab es kaum oder keine Gesetze oder Vorschriften zum Schutz der Sicherheit oder des Wohlergehens der Arbeiter. Dies erlaubte es den Managern und Besitzern, unkontrolliert zu agieren und ihre Angestellten zu zwingen, den Fortschritt zu beschleunigen und unter schrecklichen Bedingungen zu arbeiten. Obwohl das Buch es nie direkt sagt, wurde von den Menschen, die in Packingtown lebten und sich zu Tode arbeiteten, einfach erwartet, dass sie mit den schrecklichen Bedingungen fertig werden, sowohl bei der Arbeit in den Fabriken als auch beim Leben in ihrer Nähe. Es gab keine Agenturen oder Organisationen, die Informationen oder Hilfe für die Arbeiter boten. Es gab Gewerkschaften, die gegründet wurden, aber diese schadeten oft mehr als sie halfen, da sie mit den armen Arbeitern Geld verdienten. Die Arbeiter wurden so schlecht behandelt und hatten keine Möglichkeit, dem System von Packingtown zu entkommen, dass sie als Sklaven beschrieben wurden: \"Hier ist eine Bevölkerung, von niedrigem Stand und meist ausländisch, die immer am Rande des Verhungerns hängt und für ihre Lebenschancen vom Willen der Männer abhängig ist, die ebenso brutal und skrupellos sind wie die Sklaventreiber der alten Zeit; unter solchen Umständen ist Unmoral genauso unvermeidlich und verbreitet wie im System der Sklaverei.\"\n\nBack to English Translation:  \n[REWRITE]  \nI believe that \"The Jungle\" demonstrates how deep down, humans are inherently greedy and selfish.

Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking.

In „Traumland“ verwendet Poe in den Zeilen 6 und 56 den Begriff „Thule“, den Mabbott auf Vergil zurückführt. Vergil benutzte den Begriff in Bezug auf eine Insel nördlich von Großbritannien, die die Griechen als Rand der bekannten Welt betrachteten. Es ist sicher, dass Vergil den Begriff verwendete, jedoch gibt es eine aktuellere Quelle, der einige Anerkennung gebührt. Poe war sehr an deutschen Autoren interessiert. Dieses Zitat ist wichtig, weil es Poes Vertrautheit mit Goethes Werken zeigt. Karl J. Arndt bemerkt in seinem Buch Poes Politian und Goethes Mignon die Ähnlichkeit ihrer beiden Gedichte und zieht die Schlussfolgerung, dass Poe Goethe nachahmte.\n\nDer Oxford Companion to English Literature sagt über Goethe, er war ein gefeierter Autor des poetischen Dramas Faust, das in zwei Teilen veröffentlicht wurde, der erste 1808 und der zweite im Todesjahr Goethes 1832. Im poetischen Vers des zweiten Teils von Faust befindet sich ein kurzes Gedicht mit dem Titel „Der König von Thule“. Das Gedicht handelt von einem König, dessen Frau stirbt, nachdem sie ihm den Kelch als Geschenk gegeben hat. Nach dem Tod seiner Frau beginnt er stark zu trinken und weint aus der Erinnerung an seine verstorbene Königin. Dann entscheidet er, dass es Zeit für ihn ist zu sterben, und gibt seinen Kindern seinen Besitz, außer dem Kelch. Er geht dann zu einer Klippe, wirft den Kelch ins Meer, schließt seine Augen und stirbt. Das Verhalten des Königs von Thule und die Beschreibung des Königs in Traumland sind sehr ähnlich, vielleicht ein dunkler Doppelgänger von Poes Verlust und Trinkgewohnheiten. Faust wurde auch 1842 von H. P. Grattan in ein romantisches Drama umgewandelt, weniger als ein Jahr bevor Poe den Begriff Thule in „Der Brunnen und das Pendel“ verwendete.\n\nPoe erwähnt Thule zweimal in seinen gesammelten Schriften. Einmal erwähnt Poe „ultima Thule“ in „Der Brunnen und das Pendel“, aber er verwendet diesen Ausdruck zweimal in „Traumland“, als Buchstützen für das Gedicht. „Der König von Thule“ und „Traumland“ können als Begleitstücke gelesen werden. In „Traumland“ sagt der Sprecher, dass er die Landschaft von Thule beschreibt und wie sie dunkel und einsam ist, er wird von toten Freunden heimgesucht und sieht eine schattierte Welt ohne Farbe. All diese Szenen würden in Goethes „Der König von Thule“ interpretiert werden, da er gerade seine Frau verloren hat, er einsam ist und seinen Willen zu herrschen oder sogar zu leben verloren hat. Das gesamte Gedicht ist eine Beschreibung, als wäre der Sprecher in Goethes Gedicht eingetreten.\n\nGoethe war ein bedeutender Autor, den Poe kennen würde, wenn auch nur aus Respekt vor Tennyson. Poe äußerte sich folgendermaßen, als man ihn fragte, ob er Tennyson bewundere. Abgesehen von der Verbindung zu Tennyson wäre Poe durch die vielen Reproduktionen, die nach der ursprünglichen Veröffentlichung stattfanden, Goethes Werk ausgesetzt gewesen.\n\nBack to English:\n\n[REWRITE]  \nDream-land is considered one of Edgar Allan Poe's self-proclaimed best poems.

Palmers Argument, dass Martins Handlungen verwerflich waren, ist weniger überzeugend, aber immer noch vernünftig angesichts der Tatsache, dass es 2009 sechs Vorfälle von Ausrutschen und Fallen gab und Martin immer noch keine geeigneten Maßnahmen ergriffen hat, um die Sicherheit seines Geschäfts zu gewährleisten.

Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are considering whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damages claim. In California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising from a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud, or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct intended to cause harm, or if absent intent, the conduct must be “reprehensible” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).[/REWRITE]",
    "transformed": "Under California law, could a customer injured from slipping and falling due to an applesauce spill in a grocery store be granted punitive damages by proving the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice about the spill and failed to clean it for half an hour as he was having dinner? A judge is unlikely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages. To establish a claim for punitive damages, a plaintiff must provide evidence that the defendant acted with a willful and conscious disregard for the likely harm resulting from their conduct, and also show that the conduct was reprehensible. Palmer could argue that Martin should have been aware of the potential harm from not cleaning the spill because several D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months before Palmer's accident; yet he still neglected to have the spill cleaned. Palmer's argument that Martin's actions were reprehensible is less compelling but remains reasonable given that six slip-and-fall incidents occurred in 2009, and Martin still failed to take appropriate measures to ensure his store's safety. On October 13, 2009, at 5:00 PM, Rich Wayne, an employee of D&D Markets, informed his manager, Paul Martin, of an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne he was on a dinner break and “didn't have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5:15 PM, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.

Mama, was ist los?!“ Sie sah ihre Mutter auf dem Boden liegen, die offenbar Schmerzen hatte und immer wieder „Aua“ in kurzen Atemzügen sagte.

Schätz-chen, ich ... brauche dich, um mich ins - Krankenhaus zu bringen.“ Die Worte kamen gehetzt und gepresst, und ihre Tochter konnte erkennen, dass sie große Schmerzen hatte. „Okay Mama, sag mir einfach, wo ich dich abholen kann.“ Ihre Mutter wies sie an, und in diesem Moment war der Held des Hauses sehr dankbar, dass sie Kurse besucht hatte, um sich selbst zu stärken.

    "original": "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",

Birma, auch bekannt als Myanmar, ist ein südostasiatisches Land, das von einer tyrannischen Militärjunta regiert wird, die 1962 durch einen Staatsstreich an die Macht kam. Im Jahr 2007 fanden eine Reihe von Straßenprotesten statt, die ersten öffentlichen Proteste seit einem Jahrzehnt. Diese Proteste, angeführt von einer großen Anzahl burmesischer Mönche, erhielten den Namen „Die Safranrevolution“, benannt nach der Farbe der Roben, die die Mönche trugen. Nach den ersten Aufständen begann die breite Öffentlichkeit, sich für die Proteste zu interessieren, und während die burmesische Regierung den Mönchen zunächst widerwillig erlaubte, sich friedlich zu versammeln, eskalierte die Gewalt bald zu dem, was einige als völligen Krieg zwischen den Mönchen und der Militärjunta betrachteten. Das Militär drang aktiv in Klöster im ganzen Land ein und plünderte sie. Ausländische Journalisten wurden auf der Stelle zusammengetrieben und eingesperrt, und ein japanischer Fotojournalist namens Kenji Nagai wurde am 27. September 2007 einfach dafür getötet, dass er an einem Straßenprotest teilnahm. Während die offizielle Zahl der Todesopfer bei 13 liegt, wird Oberst Hla Win, der einige Tage vor dem offiziellen Bericht aus der Armee übergelaufen ist, mit den Worten zitiert: „In den letzten Tagen wurden viel mehr Menschen getötet, als Sie gehört haben. Die Leichen können in mehreren Tausend gezählt werden.“\n\nDas ist nichts Neues. Während dies einige der jüngsten Beispiele für Gräueltaten sind, die in unserer Welt stattfinden, gibt es den Wunsch einer Regierung, abweichende Meinungen zu unterdrücken und die vollständige Herrschaft über ihre Bürger aufrechtzuerhalten, seit es die Zivilisation gibt. Frühe römische Kaiser erklärten sich selbst zu Auserwählten der Götter, um die vollständige exekutive Herrschaft über jeden Aspekt ihrer Gesellschaft zu haben. Japanische Kaiser gelten tatsächlich als Götter, die in unsere Welt gesandt wurden, um ihr Volk durch die Erfindung von Motorola-Handys und Hara-Kiri zum Wohlstand zu führen, und unser derzeitiger Präsident, George W. Bush, hat wöchentliche Telefonkonferenzen mit Ted Haggard, dem Anführer der Stupid People Worldwide, einer Tochtergruppe der Republikpartei.\n\nEinige der bekanntesten Beispiele für solche Handlungen sind Vorfälle wie der Protest am 4. Juni 1989 auf dem Tiananmen-Platz, bei dem sich Intellektuelle, Arbeitsaktivisten und Studenten versammelten, um gegen die autoritäre Herrschaft der Regierung zu protestieren.

Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career.

Ellingtons Präsenz am Klavier ist in vielen der für diese Aufgabe ausgewählten Kompositionen subtil, aber als Komponist glänzte Ellington darin, reiche und komplexe Stücke zu schaffen, die die individuellen Fähigkeiten der Bandmitglieder zur Geltung brachten. Ellington gestaltete den Rahmen, in dem ein Solist frei improvisieren konnte, zusätzlich zu seinen eng orchestrierten Stücken und Phrasen, die auf den individuellen Stil der Bandmitglieder setzten, um musikalische Ideen hervorzuheben. Dabei betonte er auch den allgemeinen Klang des Orchesters und schuf kohärente und originelle Klänge, die zu jedem Stück passten. Ellingtons Beherrschung des individuellen Klangs der Spieler sowie seiner Fähigkeit, sie in einem wachsenden Ensemble zu integrieren, ermöglichte es ihm, einige der innovativsten und brillantesten Stücke der Jazzgeschichte zu schreiben.\n\nDas Grove Music-Lexikon erwähnt in seiner Diskussion über Ellingtons Klang und Innovation Creole Love Call als Beispiel für die Nutzung der Stimme „als Jazzinstrument“ im Verlauf seiner Karriere. Dies ist ein frühes Beispiel für Ellingtons Einsatz der Stimme, um Textur und Farbe zu verleihen, ohne durch Texte behindert zu werden. Creole Love Call zeigt auch Ellingtons Fähigkeit, den Stil seiner Solisten zu ergänzen, was sich durch seine gesamte Karriere zieht. Dieses langsame, bedachte Zwölf-Takte-Blues-Stück enthält sechs Refrains, wie folgt:\nRefrain 1: Ruf und Antwort zwischen Stimme und Holzbläsern, wobei die Stimme sanft und melodisch beginnt und am Ende einen raueren Klang annimmt.\nRefrain 2: Solo einer gedämpften Trompete, das die Grundmelodie ausarbeitet und mehrere verlängerte Blautöne betont.\nRefrain 3: Schwungvolles Klarinettensolo in hoher Tonlage, begleitet von einer subtilen synkopierten Klavierphrase.\nRefrain 4: Die gesamte Band wiederholt den ersten Refrain mit einem Ruf und Antwort der Blech- und Holzbläsersektionen.\nRefrain 5: Der Höhepunkt des Stücks, da die Holzbläser nun in hoher Lage den Ruf und die Antwort beginnen, unterstützt durch synkopierte Stopzeit von den Blech- und Rhythmussektionen.\nRefrain 6: Eine Rückkehr zur Struktur des ersten Refrains, mit Ruf und Antwort zwischen Stimme und Holzbläsern. In diesem Refrain nimmt die Stimme den Klang der „Growl“-Technik an und soliert als Instrument.\nTag: Kurzer Tag mit einer vokalen Lauf und einem dissonanten, neuartigen Ende durch eine Posaune.\n\nEllingtons Einsatz der Stimme, um dieser Komposition eine Dimension von Klangfarbe hinzuzufügen, ist ein Beispiel für ein stilistisches Merkmal, das seine Arbeit durchdringt.\nIn Hot and Bothered, das ein Jahr später aufgenommen wurde, verbindet Ellington seine Fähigkeit zur engen Orchestrierung mit seinem Gespür für Klangfarbe. Eine Ruf- und Antwortphrase zwischen „Bubber“ Miley auf gedämpfter Trompete und Baby Cox' Scat-Gesang nutzt die vokalen Elemente von Mileys Spiel und die instrumentalen Aspekte von Cox' Stimme, um einen reichen und ergänzenden Klang zu erzeugen. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) erweitert diese Ideen, da Ellington Joe „Tricky Sam“ Nanton, einen festen Bestandteil von Ellingtons Orchester, wirkungsvoll einsetzt, um die Melodie auf gedämpfter Posaune einzuführen.\n\n[REWRITE]Duke Ellington's legacy in jazz largely stems from his longevity and, subsequently, his creative ability to shape his orchestra.

In jüngerer Zeit wurde die mathematische Modellierung auf allgemeine Aspekte der Molluskenskelettogenese sowohl durch Ontogenese als auch Phylogenese angewandt (z.B. Raup und Stanley, 1981). Unsere Studie untersucht, wie die mathematische Modellierung ontogenetischer und phylogenetischer Veränderungen bei Prunum in Kombination mit experimentellen Studien genutzt werden kann, um die Mechanismen zu beleuchten, die in Richtung und Ausmaß evolutionär-entwicklungsbiologischer Veränderungen involviert sind. Wir verwendeten Röntgenbilder von Prunum-Arten, um quantitative Parameter zu ermitteln, die wiederum zur Modellierung hypothetischer und tatsächlicher Skelettmorphologien verwendet werden konnten. Diese Parameter wurden in das Software-Programm CerioShell (Stone, 1995) eingegeben.

Diese Achse verläuft durch die zentrale Säule der Schale und ist als Columella bekannt. Die Geschwindigkeit, mit der die Windungen größer werden, kann variieren, und eine durchgehende Linie trennt jede Windung und wird als Naht bezeichnet. In den meisten Schalen ist die größte Windung einer Schale die letzte Windung (Körperwindung). Der Turm wird als alle Windungen außer der letzten betrachtet. Der Apex ist die Spitze des Turms und das entgegengesetzte Ende wird als Basis bezeichnet.

    "original": "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",

Die vielfältigen Gründe für diese Defizite werden unten diskutiert und deuten darauf hin, dass das Gesundheitssystem gestärkt werden muss, anstatt sich auf programmspezifische Interventionen zu konzentrieren.\n\nIndonesien hat Fortschritte bei der Anzahl der Geburten gemacht, bei denen eine qualifizierte Gesundheitskraft anwesend ist, wobei jetzt 72% der Geburten dieses Ziel erreichen. Das bedeutet jedoch, dass diese Kategorie immer noch traditionelle Arbeiter einschließt, wie Hebammen, die keine medizinischen Eingriffe vornehmen können, sollte die Schwangerschaft kompliziert sein (daher der hohe Prozentsatz an Müttersterblichkeit durch Blutungen). Mit anderen Worten, die in diesem speziellen Indikator erzielten Verbesserungen sind etwas irreführend, und es gibt noch viel zu tun. Darüber hinaus hat der Prozentsatz der von einem Gesundheitsfachmann behandelten Durchfallfälle bei Kindern unter fünf Jahren abgenommen. Obwohl die Daten zur postnatalen Versorgung unvollständig sind, ist klar, dass auch dieses Gebiet besorgniserregend ist, mit niedrigen Raten im ganzen Land.\n\nDie Kaiserschnittraten sind immer noch niedriger als erwartet, etwa 4%. Die Kaiserschnittraten weisen zusätzlich auf ein weiteres besorgniserregendes Problem hin. Während die Rate in städtischen Gebieten 7% beträgt, ist sie in ländlichen Gebieten nur 2%. Dies weist auf das Problem der Gerechtigkeit der Abdeckung im ganzen Land hin. Offensichtlich ist der Zugang zu Gesundheitsdiensten auf städtische Gebiete konzentriert. Ein weiteres Zugangsproblem betrifft die vertikale Gerechtigkeit. Es gibt eine Lücke von 27% in der Inanspruchnahme von Diensten zwischen den ärmsten und reichsten Quintilen. Offensichtlich fällt es den Armen viel schwerer, Gesundheitsdienste in Anspruch zu nehmen, wahrscheinlich aufgrund von Kosten, die aus eigener Tasche bezahlt werden müssen.\n\nBei der Diskussion über die nächsten Schritte zur Verbesserung der Indikatoren für die neonatale und maternale Versorgung ist die grundlegendste Frage, wie der Mangel an Diensten am effektivsten angegangen werden kann. Insbesondere sollte Indonesien programmeigene Ansätze entwickeln oder das gesamte Gesundheitssystem stärken, ohne sich auf die vor- und nachgeburtliche Betreuung von Mutter und Kind zu konzentrieren. Es besteht kein Zweifel, dass programmeigene Ansätze zur Lösung der oben skizzierten Probleme attraktiv sind. Nicht nur haben \"vertikale Ansätze\", die sich auf einen Sektor der Verbesserungen konzentrieren, viel gezieltere, handhabbare Ziele, sie erzielen auch in der Regel schnellere Ergebnisse. Es gibt jedoch einige Nachteile zu beachten. Ein wesentlicher Nachteil ist, dass eine starke Investition in die Programmierung eines bestimmten Bereichs des Gesundheitssektors oft bedeutet, dass die Finanzierung für andere Bereiche leidet und sich die personellen Ressourcen in den Bereich bewegen, der mehr Ressourcen hat (der Effekt der internationalen Finanzierung von HIV/AIDS und ihre Auswirkungen auf den Familienplanungssektor ist ein Beispiel). Darüber hinaus führt der Betrieb mehrerer paralleler Programme für einen Bereich zu einer doppelten Bereitstellung von Diensten, die auch zwischen den Programmen unkoordiniert sind. Dies führt zu einer Zunahme von Formularen und Papierkram für Lieferungen und Finanzierung.\n\n[REWRITE]The neonatal and infant mortality rate in Indonesia has remained relatively stable over the past ten years. While the country is on track to achieve many Millennium Development Goals, such as those for water and sanitation, the rates of improvement in child and maternal health fall significantly short of what is needed to meet their targets by 2015. The various reasons for these shortcomings are discussed below, highlighting the need to strengthen the health system rather than focusing solely on program-specific interventions.\n\nIndonesia has made progress in the number of births attended by a skilled health worker, with 72% of births now meeting this criterion. However, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot perform medical interventions if complications arise during pregnancy (hence the high percentage of maternal deaths due to hemorrhage). In other words, the improvements in this indicator are somewhat misleading, and there is still much work to be done. Additionally, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five treated by a health professional. Although data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is evident that this area is also concerning, with low rates across the country.\n\nCesarean-section rates are still lower than expected, at about 4%. These rates also highlight another concerning issue. While the rate is 7% in urban areas, it is only 2% in rural areas, pointing to the problem of equitable access across the country. Clearly, healthcare services are concentrated in urban regions. Another issue is related to vertical equity, with a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles. Clearly, the poor face much greater difficulties in accessing healthcare services, likely due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nWhen discussing the next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most fundamental question is how to effectively address the lack of services. Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing solely on pre and post-natal care for the mother and child? There is no doubt that program-specific approaches to solving the outlined problems are attractive. \"Vertical approaches\" that target specific sectors have more focused, manageable objectives and typically deliver faster results. However, there are drawbacks to consider. A major drawback is that heavily investing in one particular area of the health sector often means reduced funding for other areas, with human resources gravitating towards the more resource-rich area (the impact of international funding for HIV/AIDS on the family planning sector is one example). Moreover, running multiple parallel programs for one area leads to duplication of services that are uncoordinated between programs, increasing paperwork and forms for supplies and funding.

    "original": "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",

    "raw_output": "Sure, let's start with the translation to German:\n\nEinige Jahrzehnte bevor die surrealistischen Künstler begannen, ihre traumhaften Werke zu malen, gestaltete der Künstler Henri Rousseau sorgfältig seine eigenen Träume, im wörtlichen und übertragenen Sinne. Das Gemälde Der Traum aus dem Jahr 1910 des berühmten postimpressionistischen Künstlers stellt nicht nur eine Frau dar, die von den Wundern des Landes, das sie in einem Traum besucht, beeindruckt ist, sondern auch Rousseaus eigene persönliche Träume und Ziele als Maler. Seit er mit seiner Arbeit begann, träumte er von Anerkennung, Akzeptanz und Lob durch andere Künstler und Kunstliebhaber und stellte fest, dass er vor einem schwierigen inneren Dilemma stand, um dieses Ziel zu erreichen. Der Traum ist Henri Rousseaus Werk, das seinen lebenslangen inneren Kampf am besten widerspiegelt: Entweder sich an bestimmte Malstile anzupassen oder diese nachzuahmen, um von der kritischen Kunstwelt, die er so liebte, akzeptiert zu werden, oder sich selbst kreativ unabhängig und einzigartig zu erlauben, seinen eigenen Weg zu gehen. Bevor man Der Traum aus dieser Perspektive analysieren kann, muss man zunächst mit Rousseaus biografischer Geschichte einigermaßen vertraut sein. Henri Rousseau wurde am 21. Mai 1844 in der Stadt Laval im Nordwesten Frankreichs geboren. Sein Vater war ein Klempner und Eisenwarenhändler, der „bürgerlichen Wohlstand genoss“ (Shattuck 47). In seiner Kindheit erhielt er keine formale Ausbildung in der Kunst; stattdessen arbeitete er bis zu seinem vierzigsten Lebensjahr für Frankreich als Gabelou, oder Angestellter des städtischen Mautdienstes, obwohl er den irreführenden Beinamen Douanier, ein Zollinspektor, erhielt (Shattuck 46). Der Tod seiner ersten Frau, Clémence, der dem Tod von acht Kleinkindern folgte, ließ Rousseau mit nur einem Kind, einer Tochter namens Julia, und immensem Kummer zurück (Shattuck 49). Er hoffte daher, in einem neuen Leben Zuflucht zu finden, und wandte sich der Malerei zu, um ihm Trost und Neuanfänge zu bieten. Im Gegensatz zu zeitgenössischen Kollegen Rousseaus, die den Bauern in der Malerei sentimentalisierten und romantisierten, ist er im Wesentlichen ein Volksmaler und hat die Hoffnungen und Träume des durchschnittlichen Mitglieds seiner Klasse. Rousseaus Besessenheit, von der Kunstwelt akzeptiert zu werden, ist in gewissem Maße verständlich, wenn man sie im Kontext betrachtet: Wie besprochen, war er nicht nur in den Methoden der formalen Malerei ungebildet und begann seine Karriere in einem viel höheren Alter, sondern er produzierte Werke zur gleichen Zeit wie viele andere talentierte und bekanntere moderne Künstler. Obwohl er schon viele Jahre arbeitete, begann Rousseau erst dann, angemessene Anerkennung für seine Kunst zu erhalten, als Matisse etwa zur gleichen Zeit einen Ruf als Künstler zu erlangen begann. In dem Buch Moderne französische Maler erklärt die Autorin Jan Gordon, dass die beiden, obwohl sie technisch gesehen Konkurrenten im Kunstbereich waren, sich nicht nur in Stil und Thema unterschieden, sondern auch in ihren Gründen, überhaupt zu malen: „Matisse war ein Maler, der eine Angst davor hatte, auf banale Weise zu malen, während Rousseaus Wunsch war, ein Bild so konventionell zu malen, dass er in den Artiste Français aufgenommen würde“ (92).\n\nNow, let's translate back to English:\n\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began to paint their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully shaping his own dreams, both literally and figuratively.

    "original": "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term.

As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality.

    "raw_output": "To translate the text into German and then back to English, maintaining the meaning while allowing for natural variation, here's the process:\n\n**German Translation:**\n\nViele große Denker haben eine enge Verbindung zwischen Ethik und Ästhetik, zwischen Wahrheit und Schönheit postuliert. Ich glaube, dass es auf einer fundamentalen Ebene einen Grund dafür gibt. Wie John Keats in „Ode an eine griechische Urne“ sagt: „Schönheit ist Wahrheit, Wahrheit Schönheit – Das ist alles, / was ihr auf Erden wisst und alles, was ihr wissen müsst.“ Vieles von dem, was wir im Leben wissen, lernen wir durch Bildung oder Erfahrung. Dennoch scheinen wir, wie Keats andeutet, Ethik und Ästhetik zu schätzen, ohne auf diesen erwarteten Wegen unterrichtet zu werden. Sowohl Ethik als auch Ästhetik sind ein Versuch zu beschreiben, anstatt vorzuschreiben. Unser Studium der Moral und der Schönheit sind größtenteils Versuche zu erklären, warum ein Kunstwerk oder eine Literatur schön ist oder warum eine Handlung moralisch ist, anstatt eine Reihe von Regeln für die Beurteilung oder Schaffung guter Kunst oder moralischen Verhaltens zu bieten. \n\nMehr noch: Die Kritik an Kunst oder Moral kann nie vollständig das Wesen dessen erfassen, was gut oder schön ist. Eine Diskussion über den Wert von Da Vincis Mona Lisa könnte sich beispielsweise auf Konzepte wie Vordergrund, Hintergrund, Kontrast oder kulturellen Kontext konzentrieren, aber letztlich beschreiben diese nicht, warum es gute Kunst ist. Vielmehr hört man, wenn jemand nach einem Lieblingskunstwerk oder Literaturwerk gefragt wird, oft einen Satz wie „Es ist einfach etwas daran“ vor einer komplexeren oder kritischeren Erklärung. Ich glaube, dass Kunst und Moral nie vollständig auf eine Beschreibung ihrer Eigenschaften reduziert werden können. Wie Flannery O'Connor sagt: „Eine Geschichte ist eine Möglichkeit, etwas zu sagen, das auf keine andere Weise gesagt werden kann... man erzählt eine Geschichte, weil eine Aussage unzureichend wäre.“ Egal, wie vollständig wir die Eigenschaften eines literarischen Werkes beschreiben, es bleibt etwas Transzendentes. Ich glaube, dass die Ethik diese gleiche Eigenschaft hat. Wie Wittgenstein sagt: „Es ist klar, dass die Ethik nicht ausgedrückt werden kann. / Ethik ist transzendental.“ Ich schlage vor, dass dieses „etwas“, dieses je ne sais quoi, die mächtigste Eigenschaft von Kunst und Moral ist und dass diese transzendentale Natur von Ethik und Ästhetik einen Verbindungspunkt zwischen ihnen bietet.\n\nIch glaube, dass Moral und Kunst so eng miteinander verbunden sind, weil wir beide am stärksten auf einer noumenalen Ebene erleben, um einen kantianischen Begriff zu verwenden. Sie beeinflussen uns auf eine Weise, die erfahren, aber nicht vollständig erklärt werden kann. Diese Verbindung ist noch stärker, wenn es um die Kunst der Literatur geht. Wie McKean sagt: „Was die Literatur am meisten von den anderen Künsten unterscheidet, was an der Kunst in Wahrheit einzigartig ist, ist ihre moralische Qualität. Es mag sein, dass moralische Maßstäbe für andere Künste, zum Beispiel Musik, unangemessen sind, aber sie scheinen für die Literatur ebenso relevant zu sein wie für das Leben selbst. Leben beinhaltet notwendigerweise Werte... Literatur ist uns wichtig, genau wegen der Werte, die wir dort finden.“\n\n**Back to English Translation:**\n\nMany great thinkers have suggested a close connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe there is a fundamental reason for this. As John Keats says in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of what we learn in life comes through education or experience. However, as Keats implies, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics attempt to describe rather than prescribe. Our studies in morality and beauty are largely attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful or why an action is moral, rather than providing a set of rules for judging or creating good art or moral behavior.\n\nMoreover, criticism of art or morals can never fully capture the essence of what is good or beautiful. A discussion about the worth of Da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, might focus on concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but ultimately, these do not describe why it is good art.

With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire.

Mit einer so einzigartigen Kultur sollte es nicht überraschen, dass das heutige Deutschland aus mehreren verschiedenen Quellen und Stämmen stammt.\n\nGermanien ist das angestammte Land der Deutschen. Die Ursprünge des Namens sind unter Gelehrten und Historikern stark umstritten. Tacitus behauptete, der Name stamme von einem germanischen Stamm namens Tungrier, die zuvor als Germanen bekannt waren, bevor sie den Rhein überquerten und gegen die gallischen Kräfte kämpften (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar verwendete das Wort „Germanus“ erstmals in seinem Kommentar zu den Gallischen Kriegen, wo er die Gallier niederschlug und mit germanischen Stämmen kämpfte, die oft unter zweifelhaften Vorwänden den Rhein überquerten. Er übernahm dieses Wort von den Galliern selbst und benutzte es, um zwischen denen, die er erobert hatte (die Gallier), und denen, die er nicht erobert hatte, zu unterscheiden. Obwohl der Ursprung unsicher ist, glauben einige, dass es sich auf einen Nachbarn in der gallischen Sprache bezog. Im ersten Kapitel seines ersten Buches über diese Kriege stellt Julius Caesar fest: „Die Germanen, die jenseits des Rheins wohnen, mit denen sie (die Gallier) ständig Krieg führen.....Sie kämpfen mit den Germanen in fast täglichen Schlachten.“ (Julius Caesar, 50-40 v. Chr.) Andere behaupten, die Bedeutung stamme von der Lanze, die sie im Krieg benutzten, bekannt als Ger (O.E.D, 2010), oder vielleicht vom altirischen Wort Garim, das „rufen“ bedeutet, was darauf hindeutete, dass die Germanen laut oder lärmend waren. (Namen von Deutschland)\n\nDer frühe römische Historiker Tacitus schrieb in seinem Werk „De Origine et situ Germanorum“ aus dem Jahr 98 n. Chr., das über die Ursprünge der Germanen berichtete, dass „ich (die Germanen) als urtümlich betrachten würde und überhaupt nicht durch Einwanderung oder Umgang mit anderen Rassen vermischt. Denn in früheren Zeiten war es nicht auf dem Landweg, sondern auf dem Schiff, dass diejenigen, die auswandern wollten, ankamen.......Wer würde Asien oder Afrika für Italien für Deutschland verlassen, mit seinem wilden Land, seinem rauen Klima, seinen mürrischen Sitten und Anblick, es sei denn, es wäre seine Heimat?(SIC)“ (Tacitus, 98)\n\nUnd wer würde Rom für Germanien verlassen? Sicherlich nicht die Römer, zumindest noch nicht. Sie würden ihre Eroberungen in die Länder Germaniens senden, um Waren zu erhalten, und gelegentlich Landkampagnen führen, aber am Ende kehrten sie meist in ihr weitläufiges Reich zurück. So lebten die germanischen Stämme, als sie Mitte des ersten Jahrhunderts auftauchten, an den Grenzen des Römischen Reiches und handelten mit den aus dem Land gewonnenen Waren und ihren Fähigkeiten, indem sie innerhalb der Reihen der römischen Armee dienten.

Ein großes Problem beim Beenden einer Täuschung ist jedoch, dass man sich dabei entfremdet fühlen kann. Daher muss man letztendlich zwischen der eigenen Selbsterhaltung und der Erhaltung der Beziehungen zu den Menschen um sich herum entscheiden. Denn obwohl einige neutral darauf reagieren werden, dass sie getäuscht wurden, werden andere die Täuschung nicht so leicht nehmen und sich wahrscheinlich durch die ganze Farce beleidigt fühlen.\nDas Thema der Täuschung in der Umkehrung der Geschlechterrollen ist besonders problematisch, da es viele Nebenfragen aufwirft, vielleicht die wichtigste: Warum? Warum fühlt das Subjekt das Bedürfnis, seine eigene Identität abzulehnen und eine Verkleidung in Form des anderen Geschlechts anzunehmen? Im Fall von Viola ist es offensichtlich eine Form des Selbstschutzes: „Ich bringe dich zu einem Kapitän in dieser Stadt/ Wo meine Mädchenkleider liegen, durch dessen sanfte Hilfe/ Ich bewahrt wurde, um diesem edlen Grafen zu dienen...“ (5.1.247-249)\nNeu in einem fremden Land angekommen, fühlt sich Viola gezwungen, sich als Mann auszugeben, um sich vor potenziellen Angreifern zu schützen.

This is shown by how easily Olivia shifts her affections from Cesario to Sebastian and starts viewing Cesario/Viola as family rather than a romantic interest: \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315)[/REWRITE]",
    "transformed": "The play \"Twelfth Night\" suggests that while disguise can be useful for sustaining long-term deception, ultimately, one must abandon this newly adopted facade to avoid losing oneself entirely in the process. A major issue with ending deception is the potential for feeling alienated. Therefore, one must choose between self-preservation and maintaining relationships with others. While some may react neutrally to discovering they've been deceived, others may not take it as lightly and could be offended by the entire charade. The topic of deception in gender role reversal is particularly challenging because it raises many side questions, the most important being: Why? Why does someone feel compelled to reject their identity and adopt a disguise of the opposite gender? In Viola's case, it's clearly a form of self-protection: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" (5.1.247-249) Newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels the need to pretend to be a man to protect herself from potential threats. Viola's plan succeeds but also isolates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an essential support system. To complicate matters further, she is so convincing as a man that Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian and falls in love with her. \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" (5.1.138) Additionally, she must navigate suppressed romantic feelings with Orsino: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" (5.1.260-261) Although this may seem progressive, \"Twelfth Night\" might illustrate to modern readers how deception can unveil suppressed emotions, especially in Olivia and Orsino's cases. Some passages hint that these characters might have unspoken desires that Viola/Cesario's presence forces them to confront. For example, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because he appears as a man, or does she secretly have feelings for women? One could argue this is unlikely, as Shakespeare's Olivia seems to parody those who judge others solely on appearance. This is shown by how easily Olivia shifts her affections from Cesario to Sebastian and starts viewing Cesario/Viola as family rather than a romantic interest: \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315)",

Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule.

Natürlich kann nichts so Weitreichendes wie ein gesamtes Kolonialreich mit einer solch einfachen Beschreibung erklärt werden. Das deutsche Kolonialreich war in seinen politischen Maßnahmen und seinem Regierungsstil ebenso vielfältig wie in seiner Geografie. Auch das Bildungsangebot in den Kolonien war ähnlich vielfältig. Als die Briten 1919 Deutsch-Ostafrika (Tanganjika) übernahmen, fanden sie eine große Anzahl gebildeter und literater Afrikaner vor. Die deutschen Bildungsbemühungen in Kamerun und anderen Kolonien wurden ebenfalls von zeitgenössischen Autoren gelobt. \n\nDie Situation in Südwestafrika (dem heutigen Namibia) stellte einen scharfen Kontrast dar. Im Gegensatz zu Ostafrika, wo die Regierung staatliche Schulen einrichtete und eine bedeutende Rolle in der Bildung der Einheimischen spielte, wurde in Südwestafrika die Aufgabe der einheimischen Bildung fast vollständig den Missionsgesellschaften überlassen, die nur begrenzte staatliche Unterstützung erhielten. Die Regierung investierte jedoch erhebliche Ressourcen in die Bildung der Europäer in der Kolonie, wobei sie ein System von staatlichen Schulen etablierte und die Missionsschulen stärker unterstützte und regulierte. Diese Bildungspolitiken hatten langfristige Auswirkungen auf Südwestafrika, selbst nach der deutschen Herrschaft. Während andere deutsche Kolonien eine beträchtliche Anzahl von gebildeten und literaten Afrikanern aufwiesen, blieb in Südwestafrika \"die überwiegende Mehrheit der Bevölkerung unberührt, ungebildet und analphabetisch.\" Verschiedene soziale, politische und wirtschaftliche Faktoren führten zu den unterschiedlichen Erfahrungen in Südwestafrika. Dieses Dokument zielt darauf ab, die Diskussion zu erweitern, indem es diese Faktoren identifiziert und besondere Aufmerksamkeit auf neue Forschungen zu den Einstellungen der Siedler und kolonialen Behörden gegenüber den einheimischen Afrikanern legt.\n\nEs gibt eine Fülle von Literatur, die sich speziell mit der Bildung im deutschen Kolonialreich befasst. Die meisten dieser Quellen sind auf Deutsch und wurden im frühen zwanzigsten Jahrhundert, während oder kurz nach der Zeit der deutschen Kolonialherrschaft, verfasst. Ziel der frühen Werke war es hauptsächlich, die Merkmale der Bildungssysteme in diesen Kolonien zu beschreiben. Spätere Schriften in englischer Sprache erweiterten den Diskurs durch vergleichende Studien der Bildung in den verschiedenen deutschen Kolonien und detailliertere Analysen spezifischer Aspekte der Bildung. Diese Studien zeigten signifikante Unterschiede in den Bildungssystemen der verschiedenen Kolonien auf. Das prominenteste Werk, das explizit das Thema dieses Papiers adressiert, ist Cohens Studie zur Bildung in Südwestafrika und Ostafrika. Cohen vergleicht die Bildungssysteme der beiden Kolonien und diskutiert die Faktoren, die die Unterschiede zwischen ihnen erklären. Laut Cohen erklärt die große Siedlerbevölkerung von Südwestafrika viele der besonderen Aspekte des Bildungssystems der Kolonie.\n\nIm Vergleich zu anderen deutschen Kolonialbesitzungen hatte Südwestafrika ein mäßig gemäßigtes Klima, obwohl ein Großteil des Territoriums von trockener Wüste bedeckt ist. Die europäische Bevölkerung von Südwestafrika spiegelte die relativ gastfreundlichen Bedingungen wider. Bis 1913 lebten fast 15.000 Weiße in Südwestafrika, während nur 5.336 in der Kolonie mit der nächstgrößten Siedlerbevölkerung, Ostafrika, lebten.\n\n[REWRITE]German colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, especially regarding the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa.

The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.

Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

    "transformed": "Fifteen years ago, I was suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I had never known existed.\n\nAt the time, I was a nurse. I chose this profession out of a deep-seated need for the safety and security I lacked as a child. \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick,\" was the mantra I heard repeatedly as I reached adolescence and beyond. So, even though my dream was to become a scientist or a journalist—preferably a bit of both—I chose nursing.\n\nNonetheless, there I was: 46 years old and single, with no money in the bank and unable to work. To this day, I am still disabled, and after 15 years of living on Social Security Disability, I have literally nothing left that I can call \"mine.\" I get by, but every day is a struggle and an attack on my security, safety, and self-esteem.

Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
