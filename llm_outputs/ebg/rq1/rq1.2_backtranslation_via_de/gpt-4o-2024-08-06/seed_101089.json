While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks.

Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule.

    "raw_output": "Kultur spielt eine bedeutende Rolle in jeder Verhandlung. Kultur kann ebenso sehr durch das definiert werden, was sie nicht ist, wie durch das, was sie tatsächlich ist und was sie bedeutet. Kultur ist weder homogen noch eine spezifische Sache. Sie ist auch nicht singular oder einheitlich. Aussagen wie „alle Russen sind stur“ oder „alle Japaner sind entgegenkommend“ sind von Natur aus weit gefasst und zu einfach. Während das Verständnis für die Verallgemeinerungen einer Kultur angemessen ist, ist es für einen Verhandlungsführer viel produktiver, die Bedeutung einer Kultur für die jeweilige Angelegenheit zu verstehen und wie die Einstellung dieser Kultur die Gespräche am Tisch beeinflussen kann und wird. Wenn man sich einer fremden Kultur nähert, erlebt man sie auf eine Weise, die für die eigene Kultur nachvollziehbar ist, und Vergleiche ergeben sich zwangsläufig.\n\nDer Versuch, eine fremde Kultur oder Denkweise zu verstehen, kann alles umfassen, von der Untersuchung ihrer Geschichte bis hin zur Erkenntnis ihrer Vorurteile. Anstatt eine Kultur zu beurteilen oder zu versuchen, sie zu ändern, muss man sie einfach so akzeptieren, wie sie ist, und innerhalb ihrer Grenzen arbeiten, besonders im Rahmen von Verhandlungen, und insbesondere, wenn man mit einer schwächeren Verhandlungsposition an den Tisch kommt. Ebenso kann Respekt für Traditionen und Überzeugungen einem Verhandlungsführer helfen, kulturelle Barrieren zu überwinden und die Verhandlung voranzutreiben, wenn er sich auf „fremdem“ Terrain befindet.\n\nEs ist wichtig zu beachten, dass Kultur sich nicht unbedingt auf eine nationale/internationale Dichotomie beschränkt. Die meisten Unternehmen innerhalb einer Nation etablieren ihre eigene Unternehmenskultur. Zum Beispiel könnte eine Unternehmenskultur lange Arbeitszeiten im Büro oder einen entspannteren Zeitplan betonen. Anzeichen einer Unternehmenskultur können in den Kleidervorschriften der Mitarbeiter, im Kommunikationsstil (direkte vs. indirekte Kommunikation, Delegation von Aufgaben) und in den Einstellungspraktiken gesehen werden. Einige Unternehmen ermutigen zu jeder Ebene der Philanthropie von ihren Mitarbeitern, andere beschränken sie auf „firmengeprüfte“ Wohltätigkeitsorganisationen oder Fundraising-Aktivitäten. Man muss nur die Unterschiede in der amerikanischen Unternehmenskultur von Unternehmen zu Unternehmen (und in der Tat existiert auch innerhalb eines Unternehmens eine Vielfalt, sogar von Region zu Region, städtische bis vorstädtische Umgebungen eingeschlossen) betrachten, um die Vielfalt der Gedanken zu schätzen, die innerhalb einer bestimmten gesellschaftlichen Kultur existieren kann. Einige Kulturen sind nicht annähernd so geschichtet wie die amerikanische Kultur und können für einen Außenstehenden homogener erscheinen, aber ein ähnliches Äußeres ist einfach ein Zeichen dafür, tiefer zu graben.\n\nWerte sind noch wichtiger zu verstehen, weil sie das Warum einer Kultur liefern. Wenn das Bewahren des Gesichts oder die gemeinschaftliche Harmonie in einer Kultur geschätzt werden, wird ein Verhandlungsführer sicherlich nicht seine Firma oder seinen Vorgesetzten öffentlich bloßstellen, um am Verhandlungstisch erfolgreich zu sein. Ebenso wird ein Verhandlungsführer aus einer Kultur, die größeren Wert auf harte Verhandlungen legt, nicht unbedingt darauf drängen, sich frühzeitig zu einigen. Diese Verallgemeinerungen zu berücksichtigen, ist wichtig, bevor man zum Verhandlungstisch kommt. Ein Verhandlungsführer ist jedoch gut beraten, etwas über seinen Gegner auf persönlicher Ebene zu lernen, um die Verhandlung effektiv zu gestalten.\n\n[REWRITE]Culture plays a crucial role in any negotiation.

This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",

In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F.

Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects.

Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

Einige dieser Techniken sind effektiver als andere. F. Scott Fitzgerald nutzt viele dieser verschiedenen Techniken in seinem Roman \"The Great Gatsby\". Manchmal kombiniert Fitzgerald ein Adjektiv und ein Substantiv, die normalerweise nicht zusammenpassen, um den Lesern eine bestimmte Aura um ein Thema zu vermitteln. Andere Male verleiht er einem Symbol Bedeutung und verwendet es dann zu diesem Zweck. Fitzgerald nutzt diese letzte Technik mit vielen Farben, darunter Gold, Grün, Weiß/Grau und Rot/Rosa. In seinem Roman \"The Great Gatsby\" baut F. Scott Fitzgerald Bedeutungen für Farben auf, insbesondere Weiß/Grau und Rot/Rosa, und verwendet später diese Bedeutungen, um den Lesern eine bestimmte Erinnerung an ein Gefühl um ein wichtiges Objekt zu geben.\n\nDie Bedeutung, die Fitzgerald für Weiß/Grau aufbaut und verwendet, ist Gleichförmigkeit, wobei Weiß etwas angenehmer und höherklassig und Grau älter und verblasst ist. Fitzgerald etabliert diese Bedeutung am Anfang des Romans durch den ständigen Einsatz beider Farben. Daisy und Jordan sind ständig \"in Weiß\"—tatsächlich trägt jeder immer Weiß: Nick trägt \"weiße Flanellhosen\" zu Gatsbys Party, Tom trägt ein \"weißes Hemd\", als er Myrtle trifft, und Catherine ist \"milchig weiß gepudert\". Tatsächlich ist der einzige Moment, in dem Menschen kein Weiß tragen, als Nick seine Eindrücke von Gatsbys Party bekommt: \"die Hallen... sind knallig mit Primärfarben\". Fitzgerald definiert diese beiden Farben weiter, indem er viele alltägliche, unwichtige Themen in diesen Farben darstellt: Als Nick zur Arbeit geht, geht er \"die weißen Schluchten des unteren New York\" hinunter, die Namen der Leute auf Gatsbys Partys sind jetzt \"graue Namen\" auf Nicks Zeitplan, Catherines Wohnung ist \"ein Stück in einem langen weißen Kuchen von Wohnhäusern\"—Gleichförmigkeit. Er beschreibt auch einfache oder gewöhnliche Menschen oder Orte als weiß oder grau: Jordan und Daisy hatten eine \"weiße Kindheit\" zusammen, es gibt \"graue Autos\" und \"graues Land\" im Aschental, das \"italienische Kind\" im Zug ist \"grau\", und der Hundeverkäufer ist \"ein grauer alter Mann\".\n\nNachdem Fitzgerald genug Bedeutung für Weiß/Grau hinzugefügt hat, verwendet er sie, um Unwichtigkeit oder Gleichförmigkeit für bestimmte Themen zu signalisieren. Diese Verwendung von Farben, um den Lesern etwas zu zeigen, beginnt mit Daisy. Nach einer langen Zeit ohne signifikante Verwendung einer dieser Farben beschreibt Fitzgerald Daisy als \"in Weiß gekleidet\" in einem \"kleinen weißen Roadster\"; die Leser beginnen, Daisy weniger als Charakter zu sehen, sondern mehr als eine gleichförmige Ergänzung, etwas, das Gatsby will und begehrt. Fitzgerald verwendet mehr von dieser Technik um Daisy herum, um diesen Eindruck zu vermitteln, dass Daisy eine gleichförmigere Ergänzung ist, zum Beispiel gibt es einen \"grauen Schleier von Daisys Pelzkragen\", und sie ist wieder in einem \"weißen\" Kleid vor Tom und Gatsbys Begegnung.\n\n[REWRITE]Many authors employ various methods to convey a certain feeling or attitude about significant subjects to their readers.

Scott Fitzgerald establishes meanings for colors, specifically white/gray and red/pink, and later uses these meanings to evoke a specific sense of feeling around an important object.\n\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds for white/gray is uniformity, with white being somewhat more pleasant and upper-class, while gray is older and faded. Fitzgerald establishes this meaning at the novel's outset by frequently using both colors. Daisy and Jordan are constantly \"in white\"—in fact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears \"white flannels\" to Gatsby's party, Tom wears a \"white shirt\" when meeting Myrtle, and Catherine is \"powdered milky white.\" The only time people aren't wearing white is when Nick observes Gatsby's party: \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors.\" Fitzgerald further defines these two colors by coloring many ordinary, unimportant subjects in these hues: as Nick goes to work, he moves \"down the white chasms of lower New York,\" the names of people at Gatsby's parties are now \"gray names\" on Nick's timetable, and Catherine's apartment is \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\"—uniformity.

    "original": "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations.

    "raw_output": "San Diego County ist aufgrund eines milden, sonnigen Klimas sehr landwirtschaftlich produktiv. Häufig angebaute Kulturen sind: Tomaten, Zitrusfrüchte, Blattgemüse, Kürbis, Brokkoli, Kräuter, Baumfrüchte wie Pfirsiche und Zitronen, Beeren, Honig und Paprika. Es gibt einen erheblichen Markt für Bio-Lebensmittel im Rahmen der gemeinschaftlich unterstützten Landwirtschaft in der Region San Diego, wobei viele lokale Organisationen lange Wartelisten haben. Biologische Eier und Milch sind ebenfalls beliebt. Viele Biobetriebe bieten auch Führungen durch ihre landwirtschaftlichen Betriebe sowie Zugang zu Wanderungen, Vogelbeobachtung und anderen Freizeitaktivitäten an. Dies ist die Art von Betrieb, die es dem Landbesitzer ermöglichen würde, die Vorteile von Regierungsprogrammen zu nutzen, während er den Lebensraum verbessert, was eine Freizeitnutzung ermöglicht und eine Gelegenheit für Farmtouren und andere Programme zur Geldverdienung oder zu Bildungszwecken schafft.  \nZusätzlich zur Erfüllung eines potenziell lukrativen Nischenmarktes beinhalten die Vorteile des ökologischen Landbaus oft eine größere Biodiversität bei Pflanzen und Wildtieren in der Region, da keine Chemikalien im Boden und Wasser vorhanden sind. Der ökologische Landbau hat jedoch in gewisser Weise höhere Kosten als der konventionelle Anbau. Es erfordert intensivere Arbeit und Management, um Schädlinge und Unkräuter zu entfernen und den Boden ohne Chemikalien zu düngen, und die Verluste sind oft größer als bei konventionellen Methoden, während einem kleinen Biobetrieb auch die Effizienz der Größe großer Betriebe fehlt. Praktiken, die nicht mit dem biologischen Anbau zu tun haben, aber für die Tierwelt von Vorteil sind, können auch höhere Arbeitskosten verursachen, darunter das Pflanzen von Zwischenfrüchten, strategische Weiderotation, die Entfernung invasiver Arten und das aktive Management des Pflanzenwachstums, um spezifische Bedingungen wie Randhabitate oder offene Bodenflächen bereitzustellen. Daher gibt es viele Gründe, warum der Landbesitzer in diesem Beispiel finanzielle Hilfe oder Fachwissen suchen könnte, um sowohl Gewinne als auch die Qualität des Lebensraums zu maximieren.  \nDas für dieses Szenario gewählte Landstück liegt neben der Stadt Potrero im nicht eingemeindeten San Diego County, Kalifornien. Es umfasst 160 Morgen Chaparral, nicht heimisches mediterranes Grasland und Eichenwald neben dem Cleveland National Forest. Es liegt in der Ökoregion der südlichen Vorgebirge des East County im San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. Der Plan wird noch überprüft, berücksichtigt jedoch derzeit über hundert Pflanzen- und Tierarten. Viele sind gefährdet, wie die Kangururatte von Stephens, der Gelbbein-Bergfrosch, mehrere Schmetterlingsarten und der Kalifornische Gnatcatcher; andere nehmen ab und könnten bald aufgelistet werden, wie Grabeneulen.\nDieses Gebiet wurde über unzählige Jahrhunderte von Ureinwohnern bewohnt und dann in den späten 1800er Jahren von Viehzüchtern und Brennholzverkäufern besiedelt. Dieses Stück Land war Teil eines ursprünglichen Siedlungspatents und wurde wahrscheinlich viele der dazwischenliegenden Jahrzehnte für Weide- und/oder Holzproduktion genutzt.\nIch wählte ein Grundstück von einer Immobilienwebsite aus und recherchierte verfügbare Regierungsprogramme, um zu sehen, welche Optionen ein kleiner Landwirt realistischerweise zur Kostensenkung und Erhaltung wildtierfreundlicher Betriebe haben könnte. Als Modell dafür, was jemand, der dieses Land bewirtschaftet, erreichen könnte, fand ich einen Biobetrieb in derselben Gegend.\n\n[REWRITE]  \nSan Diego County is highly productive agriculturally, thanks to its mild, sunny climate. Common crops include tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a significant market for organic food from community-supported agriculture in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having long waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms offer tours of their agricultural operations and provide access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This type of operation allows the landowner to benefit from government programs while enhancing the habitat, thus permitting recreational use and creating opportunities for farm tours and other income-generating or educational programs.  \nIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area due to the absence of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has higher costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods. A small organic farm also lacks the scale efficiency of larger operations. Practices unrelated to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife can also incur higher labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitats or open ground patches.

Innerhalb dieses Bandes liegen viele Emotionen: Liebe, Stolz, Eifersucht und Grausamkeit, um nur einige zu nennen. Brüder verstehen einander weit mehr als jeder andere mit einer solchen Bindung, und sie können sich selbst nur sehen, wenn sie ihren Bruder ansehen. Es ist in den kritischsten Situationen, wenn die wahre Natur dieses Bandes sichtbar wird, sei es gut oder böse. Wenn diese Emotionen klar werden, tragen sie einen großen Preis mit sich. Ein Teil des Verständnisses der Emotionen, die aus dieser brüderlichen Verbindung entstehen, besteht darin, sich mit den Konsequenzen auseinanderzusetzen, die sie mit sich bringen. Wenn man einem Bruder in die Augen blicken und in dieser Person sein eigenes Spiegelbild sehen kann, sieht man sich selbst nicht so, wie andere einen sehen, sondern so, wie man wirklich ist. In ihren Handlungen und den Konsequenzen dieser Handlungen liegt ihr wahrer Charakter. In „Der scharlachrote Ibis“ erkunden zwei Brüder dieses Thema und alle aufwühlenden Emotionen, die damit einhergehen. Durch eine üppige, lebendig beschriebene Landschaft machen sich diese beiden Jungen auf eine vergebliche Reise. Bittere Enttäuschung stößt in der klimatischen Szene auf intensiven Stolz, und nur ein Bruder entkommt mit seinem Leben. Das Thema wird durch die direkte Charakterisierung des Protagonisten, Doodle, und ihre Interaktionen miteinander ausgedrückt, sowie durch die Perspektive des Erzählers, die die komplexen Gefühle des Protagonisten und seine Sicht auf die Welt um ihn herum vermittelt, die beide einen starken Einfluss auf seine Handlungen haben.\n\nDie Handlungen des Protagonisten lassen sich alle durch eine zentrale Emotion zusammenfassen: Stolz. Von dem Moment an, als er und sein kleiner Bruder Doodle das erste Mal zusammen hinausgingen, bis zu ihrem letzten, schicksalhaften Ausflug, empfindet der Protagonist Groll gegenüber Doodle. Er wollte einen Bruder, dem er all seine weltlichen Fähigkeiten beibringen konnte, wie „...meinen Atem anhalten, laufen, springen oder die Ranken im Alten Frauensumpf klettern...“ Er wollte einen Bruder, der die Rolle ausfüllen konnte, „...mit jemandem um das Pferdekopf-Landing zu rennen... und mit jemandem auf dem obersten Ast der großen Kiefer hinter der Scheune zu sitzen...“ Offensichtlich sind diese Dinge aufgrund von Doodles Zustand unmöglich. Doodle wurde mit einem extrem schwachen Herzen geboren, was es unwahrscheinlich machte, dass er überhaupt überleben würde. Selbst dann war es nahezu unmöglich, dass er jemals an anstrengenden körperlichen Aktivitäten teilnehmen könnte. Welch ein Schlag für den jungen Protagonisten, dessen Kopf voller wilder Fantasien war, all diese Träume in einem Augenblick zerschmettert zu sehen. Tatsächlich zeigt sich, dass er sogar etwas Wut gegenüber dem kleinen Kind hegt, da er sich daran erinnert, angefangen zu haben, darüber nachzudenken, ihn zu töten, indem er ihn mit einem Kissen erstickt. Was für ein Kind würde die Geistesgegenwart haben, einen Kindsmord in Erwägung zu ziehen? Doch sein Herz schmilzt, als das kleine Kind ihn anlächelt. Ein solch einfacher Akt gab dem Protagonisten so viel Hoffnung! Dies zeigt, dass seine Überzeugung wahrscheinlich nicht sehr stark war. Im Hinterkopf hatte er eine instinktive Liebe zu seinem Bruder.\n\n**Translation back to English:**\n\n[REWRITE]  \nThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond.

Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology.

    "original": "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation.

    "raw_output": "In 2007, die Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika gerieten in eine erdrückende Finanzkrise. Die Arbeitslosigkeit stieg, der Immobilienmarkt brach zusammen, und viele der größten und wichtigsten Unternehmen Amerikas lagen in Trümmern. Diese Rezession hält bis heute an, daher müssen wir die Frage stellen: Wie kam es zu dieser Krise, und wie können wir sie stoppen? Kurz gesagt, die Finanzkrise wurde durch egoistische und naive politische Entscheidungen verursacht, die Banken und Unternehmen dazu zwangen, Subprime-Kredite innerhalb einer bereits unreifen und unzureichenden Finanzinfrastruktur zu vergeben. Gleichzeitig wurden Fannie Mae (FNMA) und Freddie Mac (FHLMC) unter Druck gesetzt, diese Hypotheken zu unterzeichnen und in CDOs und CDS’ umzupacken. Als Kreditnehmer mit diesen Krediten in Verzug gerieten, waren die Banken knapp an Kapitalreserven und übertrugen dieses Chaos auf die neu verpackten Hypotheken, die sie verkauft hatten, und auf den Rest der Wirtschaft.\n\nDie Wurzeln der Finanzkrise lagen im Jahr 1999 der Clinton-Ära, als der Präsident eine zweite Amtszeit anstrebte. Er wollte seine Präsidentschaft verlängern, indem er seine Popularität steigerte. Um dies zu erreichen, lockerte die Clinton-Administration die Kreditvergaberestriktionen, was dazu beitrug, die düstere Bühne für die Subprime-Krise sieben Jahre später zu bereiten. Steven Holmes von der New York Times berichtete 1999: „Fannie Mae, der größte Hypothekenversicherer des Landes, steht unter zunehmendem Druck der Clinton-Administration, Hypothekendarlehen unter einkommensschwachen und mittleren Einkommensgruppen auszudehnen und fühlte sich vom Druck der Aktionäre getrieben, sein phänomenales Gewinnwachstum aufrechtzuerhalten.“ Holmes würde die Konsequenzen dieser Maßnahmen korrekt voraussehen: „Aber die staatlich subventionierte Gesellschaft könnte bei einem wirtschaftlichen Abschwung in Schwierigkeiten geraten und eine staatliche Rettung ähnlich derjenigen der Spar- und Darlehensindustrie in den 1980er Jahren auslösen.“ Wie in der Einleitung beschrieben und wie Holmes voraussah, würde schlecht beratene Kreditvergabe sicherlich zum Zusammenbruch der Wirtschaft führen.\n\nViele Faktoren führten dazu, dass die Wirtschaft ins Trudeln geriet, einer davon war die neue und komplexe Struktur der Hypotheken. Hypotheken mit variablem Zinssatz, hypothekenbesicherte Wertpapiere und besicherte Schuldverschreibungen (CDOs) wurden in den Jahren vor der Krise ausgiebig genutzt und dienten nur dazu, mehr Sektoren der Wirtschaft mit dem Immobilienmarkt zu verflechten. Dies führte dazu, dass sich die US-Haushalte und die Finanzmärkte im Allgemeinen im Immobilienmarkt übermäßig verschuldeten und dadurch extrem anfällig für selbst kleine Preisänderungen wurden.\n\nTatsächlich platzte die Immobilienblase, und die Finanzinstitute, die diese hypothekenbesicherten Wertpapiere gekauft hatten, waren betroffen. Die fünf größten US-Investmentbanken meldeten zusammen 2007 Hypothekenschulden in Höhe von 4,1 Billionen Dollar, was etwa 30 % des BIP der USA ausmachte. Schließlich wurden Bear Stearns und Merrill Lynch außergewöhnlich günstig verkauft, Lehman Brothers wurde aufgelöst, und Goldman Sachs und Morgan Stanley wurden gezwungen, zu kommerziellen Banken zu werden, die intensiver Regulierung unterlagen. Fannie und Freddie hatten 5 Billionen Dollar Hypothekenschulden und wurden im September 2008 unter staatliche Kontrolle gestellt.\n\n[REWRITE]In 2007, the United States of America fell into a severe financial crisis. Unemployment rose, the housing market collapsed, and many of America's largest and most crucial corporations were left in ruins. This recession continues today, prompting us to ask: how did this crisis happen, and how can we prevent it? In essence, the financial crisis was caused by selfish and naive political decisions that pressured banks and firms to issue sub-prime loans within an already immature and inadequate financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwrite and repackage these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, banks were short on capital reserves and passed this chaos onto the repackaged mortgages they had sold, impacting the rest of the economy.\n\nThe financial crisis had its roots in the Clinton era of 1999, as the President aimed for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidency by boosting his popularity. To achieve this, the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped set the stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate-income people and felt pressure from shareholders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\" Holmes correctly predicted the consequences of these actions: \"But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" As detailed in the introduction and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\nNumerous factors combined to throw the economy into a tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages.

Dieser Teil Ihrer Geschichte, in dem Sie Ihre kleinen Schriftstellerflügel ausbreiten und abheben, alle mit Ihrem magnetischen, ja geradezu magischen Stil verblüffen. Oder der Teil, in dem Ihre Leser einschlafen und/oder auf die Schaltfläche \"Zurück\" klicken, während sie Ihren Namen verfluchen. Dr. Merlin ist dafür bekannt, ihren Monitor anzuschreien, wenn sie sich inmitten von zu viel Information befindet, und das nicht einmal auf unterhaltsame Weise.\n\nExposition ist nicht Ihr Freund.\n\nMeine sanften Leser kennen bereits den grundlegenden Schreibtipp: \"Zeigen, nicht erzählen\", aber Dr. Merlin stolpert immer noch in lange Textpassagen, in denen nichts passiert oder schlimmer noch, zu viel. Exposition ist der kleine Teufel, der auf Ihrer Schulter sitzt und sagt, dass Sie die Geschichte aus dem Weg räumen sollen, um zu den guten Teilen zu gelangen (nicht zu verwechseln mit dem Teufel auf der anderen Schulter, der den Autor dazu drängt, dem Publikum jedes einzelne Detail der Kindheit jeder Figur zu erzählen).\n\nExposition bedeutet, dem Publikum zu sagen, was passiert ist, normalerweise in einfacher Prosa. Im Film geschieht die Exposition, wenn ein Charakter einem anderen eine Informationsflut à la \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" erzählt. In der Fiktion erzählt der Autor.\n\nEin Beispiel ist angebracht. Wenn Sie eine Geschichte lesen, erfahren Sie, dass die Heldin ihren Geliebten zu einer bestimmten Zeit und an einem bestimmten Ort traf, dass sie in großer Weise geheiratet haben und dass ihr Ehemann vor ihren Augen ermordet wurde. Sie würden nicht erwarten, dass diese gesamte Sequenz zwei Seiten einnimmt, während der sowohl er als auch sie jeweils nur zwei Zeilen Dialog erhalten. Sie würden erwarten, dass der Autor etwas Zeit mit dem Charakter des Ehemanns verbringt und durch seine Rede und sein Verhalten zeigt, wie tief er seine Frau liebt, und Sie würden ebenso erwarten, dass die Heldin auf große und kleine Weise zeigt, wie sehr seine Anwesenheit ihr Leben verändert und bereichert hat (besonders wenn die Geschichte Ihnen später direkt sagt, dass dies der Fall war). Eine ordnungsgemäße Einführung in den Charakter des Ehemanns würde es Ihnen ermöglichen, emotional in sein Schicksal involviert zu werden und Ihnen Einblick in den Charakter der Heldin geben: was sie in ihm sah, wie tief ihre Bindung war, Hinweise auf ihre Gedanken, Überzeugungen und Träume, die durch das Prisma seiner Augen reflektiert werden, und so weiter. Sie würden seinen Tod mit ihr betrauern und dadurch mehr Verbindung zur Heldin selbst aufbauen.\n\nKurz gesagt, Sie würden Fleisch auf dem einfachen Knochen der Handlung erwarten: \"Sie trafen sich, sie heirateten, er starb.\"\n\nAls Schriftsteller müssen Sie dieses Fleisch liefern. (*schaut auf die Metapher, seufzt, geht weiter*) Manchmal ist es verlockend, an bestimmten Dingen vorbeizueilen. Vielleicht stellen Sie eine neue Figur vor und Sie wissen, dass er früher bei der Air Force war, jetzt der Nachtmanager einer Tankstelle ist, zweimal verheiratet war, keine Kinder hat, gerne am Wochenende angeln geht, heimlich davon träumt, eines Tages die Tankstelle zu besitzen und Eggs Benedict zum Frühstück hatte.\n\nEnglish Translation:\nAh, exposition.

Details were provided about where they thought the incident occurred. It was determined that a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips leading to the shooter's arrest.\n\nThe next story was about the rain and thunderstorms forecasted for Saturday afternoon. They said temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The segment was a bit short, but they wanted to use it as a \"teaser\" to keep the audience watching.\n\nThey also reported a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was a dark-skinned black man who robbed the store, wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. He was described as about six feet tall and weighing around one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they spent an unusual amount of time emphasizing his race and how dark-skinned he was.\n\nAnother story was about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute large amounts of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. One curious thing I noted was that instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison, they said \"300\" months. I'm not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought it sounded harsher or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, which I don't think was really relevant to the story.",

Dabei ist er jedoch flexibler und wird wie eine Aktie an einer Börse gehandelt. Ein ETF bietet die Diversifikation eines Indexfonds und die Vorteile des Besitzes einzelner Aktien, wie die Möglichkeit, Leerverkäufe zu tätigen, auf Marge zu kaufen und so wenig wie eine einzelne Aktie bei einer Transaktion zu erwerben. Obwohl diese Vorteile äußerst attraktiv sind, sind die Kostenquoten von ETFs weitaus niedriger als die eines durchschnittlichen Investmentfonds. Leider gibt es einige Nachteile, wie die Notwendigkeit, bei jedem Handel mit ETFs eine Provision zu zahlen, genauso wie bei einem Aktienauftrag. Ein weiterer Vorteil von ETFs ist die große Vielfalt der verfügbaren Fonds. Obwohl diese Vorteile deutlich aufgeführt sind, ist es für den klugen Finanzinvestor immer eine gute Übung zu prüfen, ob die angegebenen Vorteile wie Diversifikation tatsächlich existieren und in welchem Ausmaß sie vorhanden sind. Für die Zwecke dieses Vorhabens werden wir den ETF IHF untersuchen und ihn mit den Top-10-Positionen vergleichen, aus denen der ETF besteht, um festzustellen, ob die Vorteile des Besitzes eines einzelnen ETFs den Vorteilen des Besitzes eines diversifizierten Portfolios der zehn Aktien nahekommen und ob es möglicherweise bessere Konfigurationen derselben Aktien gibt, die ein optimales Sharpe-Verhältnis oder eine bessere Rendite bieten würden.\n\nUm den ETF zu bewerten, wäre es ziemlich unübersichtlich, jede Position einzubeziehen, daher haben wir uns entschieden, nur die Top-10-Positionen einzubeziehen, die 63,58% aller Vermögenswerte im ETF ausmachen. Unten sind die Top-10-Positionen und der Prozentsatz der gesamten Vermögenswerte aufgeführt.\n\nUm eine Schätzung zu erhalten, wie gut diese zehn Aktien den ETF IHF insgesamt repräsentieren, können wir den aktuellen Prozentsatz der Vermögenswerte, normiert auf 100%, nutzen, um die Beiträge jeder Aktie zu Beta und Rendite eines Portfolios zu berechnen, wenn das Portfolio vollständig aus diesen 10 Aktien in der vom ETF festgelegten Proportion bestehen würde. Die Berechnungen von Beta und Rendite sind in der unten stehenden Tabelle enthalten.\n\nAus der obigen Tabelle geht hervor, dass die Rendite eines Portfolios, das nur die Top-10-Positionen enthält, 6,11% höher ist als die des ETFs, was einem Anstieg der Renditen um 16% entspricht. Es ist auch ersichtlich, dass das Beta der Top-10-Positionen um 0,12 niedriger ist als das des gesamten ETFs. Aus den bisher erzielten Ergebnissen scheint es, dass ein Portfolio, das nur aus den Top-10-Positionen besteht, eine höhere Rendite mit einem niedrigeren Beta bieten könnte. Es besteht jedoch die Möglichkeit, dass die Mittelwerte dieser beiden Portfolios statistisch nicht voneinander abweichen.\n\nUm zu bewerten, ob diese Portfolios statistisch unterschiedlich sind, wird die Standardabweichung jeder der Top-10-Aktien bestimmt und auf 100% normiert, um ihre kumulierte Standardabweichung mit der des ETFs IHF zu vergleichen.\n\n[REWRITE]  \nAn ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a financial instrument designed to track an index, a commodity, or a basket of assets like an index fund but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.

That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped.

Das war etwas entmutigend, und es ist schwer zu sagen, warum das passiert sein könnte. Mit dem Beginn des Winters auf einem Campus in Neuengland gibt es offensichtlich einen Rückgang bei den Menschen, die entweder mit dem Fahrrad oder zu Fuß pendeln, was einen Teil des Rückgangs erklären könnte. Der Dezember markiert auch das Ende des Herbstsemesters, wenn alle sehr beschäftigt sind, Schulaufgaben zu beenden, Noten zu verarbeiten und so weiter. Vielleicht geriet das Ausfüllen des Pendlerprotokolls einfach für viele aus dem Blickfeld. Zudem bringt der Dezember den Beginn der geschäftigen Feiertagssaison und die daraus resultierende einmonatige Pause für Studierende und Dozenten mit sich, während der viele gar nicht auf den Campus kommen müssen. Der Unterricht beginnt dann Ende Januar wieder für das Frühjahrssemester, was vielleicht auch ein Hinweis auf die geringe Anzahl von Protokollen in diesem Monat ist. Aber all das erklärt wirklich nicht die niedrige Anzahl von Einreichungen im Februar. Man könnte auch vermuten, dass jedes Projekt dieser Art anfangs einen Energieschub und Aufregung erlebt, die dann natürlich abnehmen könnten. Um diesem Trend entgegenzuwirken, haben wir die Carpool Challenge Week ins Leben gerufen, eine spezielle Blitzkampagne im März, um die Initiative neu zu beleben, was zu einem Anstieg der Protokolleinreichungen in diesem Monat führte. Eine der Herausforderungen, die wir erlebten, war also, wie man das Projekt in Schwung hält angesichts eines natürlichen Rückgangs des Engagements, aber auch speziell des Problems der Feiertags- und Semesterpausen, die im Hochschulbereich auftreten. Ein weiteres Problem bei diesem Projekt (oder jedem alternativen Pendelprojekt) ist die einfache Tatsache, dass Menschen die Freiheit, Unabhängigkeit und Flexibilität des Autofahrens genießen. Das ist tief in unserer Kultur verankert. Daher ist es wichtig, Anreize für die Teilnahme an alternativen Pendelmodi zu schaffen. Wir haben viele Preise in Form von Geschenkgutscheinen für lokale Restaurants, Cafés, Massagetherapeuten, den lokalen unabhängigen Buchladen und sogar einige größere nationale Kettenläden vergeben. Es wäre jedoch interessant gewesen zu sehen, wie sich einige noch größere Preise auf die Teilnahme ausgewirkt hätten – wie etwa die Vergabe eines schönen Fahrrads, eines Hybridautos oder eines Elektroautos. Dies hätte auch dazu beitragen können, den Rückgang des Engagements zu bekämpfen, den das Projekt erlebte. Die Art der Preise änderte sich im Verlauf des Projekts nicht wirklich. Wenn jedoch die Preise im Laufe des Projekts an Wert zugenommen hätten, hätte das vielleicht geholfen. Die Geschenkkarten schienen zu Beginn des Projekts mehr als ausreichend zu sein, aber wenn wir im Dezember die Ergänzung um ein paar Fahrräder und dann im Januar um ein Hybrid- oder Elektroauto angekündigt hätten, kann man nur vermuten, dass die Teilnahme und das Engagement zugenommen hätten statt abzunehmen.\n\nEnglish Translation:\n\n[REWRITE] Referring back to Figure 17, there was a steep decline in commuter log submissions during the third month of the project.

    "raw_output": "Beim Durchsehen der Sammlung früher Edison-Filme in der Library of Congress entschied ich mich, alle Trickfilme anzusehen, von denen es fünfzehn zwischen 1895 und 1901 gab. Diese Filme nutzen im Allgemeinen kreative Schnitttechniken, um Illusionen zu erzeugen. Meine Filmanalyse konzentrierte sich im Wesentlichen darauf, die poetischen Elemente der meisten Trickfilme zu beschreiben und die evolutionären Ausreißermerkmale in einigen der späteren Filme zu untersuchen. Im Großen und Ganzen ist der Trickfilm zur Jahrhundertwende an ein Set gebunden, innerhalb eines Frontalprosceniums komponiert, zeigt keine Kamerabewegungen, verwendet lange und mittlere Aufnahmen und hält sich an die strikte Methode: eine Aufnahme = ein Film. Es gibt jedoch einige Filme zu Beginn des zwanzigsten Jahrhunderts, die es wagen, diese Richtlinien zu brechen, indem sie Aspekte wie mehrere Aufnahmen einführen.\n\nEines der auffälligsten Merkmale, die die Trickfilme gemeinsam haben, ist das Filmen in einem Innenraum innerhalb des Rahmens eines Frontalprosceniums. Die Kamera bewegt sich nicht von ihrer Prosceniumsposition, um Figuren oder Objekte zu verfolgen. Diese Komposition war in frühen Filmen sehr verbreitet und hat ihre Wurzeln im Theater und, für Trickfilme, in Vaudeville- und Zauberkunststücken. Eine der in der Verwendung der Bühne innewohnenden Einschränkungen besteht darin, dass sich Figuren in Trickfilmen im Allgemeinen nur seitwärts bewegen und nicht zur Kamera hin oder von ihr weggehen. Nehmen Sie zum Beispiel die Aktion im Film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). Die Schauspieler treten von der rechten Seite ein und bewegen sich entlang der horizontalen Achse hin und her. Auch wenn sie aus dem Bild verschwinden, folgt die Kamera ihnen nicht.\n\nDer Frontalproscenium-Stil der Komposition bedeutet auch, dass die Aufnahmen dazu neigen, Weitwinkelaufnahmen zu sein und, seltener, mittlere Aufnahmen. Nahaufnahmen werden in keinem der Trickfilme aus dem Edison-Katalog verwendet. Dies entlehnt sich der Tradition des Theaters und Vaudevilles, wo das Publikum die gesamte Aufführung zu jeder Zeit innerhalb der Rahmen des Bühnenbildes sehen würde. Wie in den meisten frühen Filmen bewegen sich die Schauspieler nicht vom Mittelgrund zur Kamera, sodass Nahaufnahmen nie vorkommen.\n\nIm Allgemeinen folgen die meisten frühen Trickfilme dem Muster, dass eine konzeptionelle Aufnahme einen Film ergibt. Dies begrenzt die Länge der meisten Trickfilme auf etwa eine Minute oder weniger, je nach verwendeten Bildern pro Sekunde. Es begrenzt auch die dramatische oder narrative Nutzung der Trickfilme; die meisten konzentrieren sich auf kurze Tricks im Vaudeville-Stil, wie Magie, Verschwinden und Wechselakte mit wenig Handlung. Beachten Sie jedoch, dass in einem Trickfilm eine konzeptionelle Aufnahme in den Augen des Betrachters nicht tatsächlich einer physischen Aufnahme entspricht. Ein einziges „Shot“ kann tatsächlich mehrere zusammengefügte sein, um die Illusion des Erscheinens oder Verschwindens zu erzeugen. Schauen Sie genau auf The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), einen der früheren Trickfilme. Eine gründlichere Inspektion offenbart den Moment, in dem die physische Aufnahme mit Marys abgetrenntem „Kopf“ beginnt, obwohl der gesamte Film konzeptionell für den Betrachter eine Aufnahme ist.\n\n[REWRITE]While exploring the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I decided to watch all the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901.

As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\n\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative use of the trick films; most focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, like magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer's eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single \"shot\" may actually be several joined together to create the illusion of appearing or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary's severed \"head\" begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer.",

The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto.

Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic.

    "original": "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",

Der Begriff Lieferkettenmanagement wurde 1982 von dem Berater Keith Oliver erfunden. Keith Oliver beschrieb den gesamten Prozess der Planung, Umsetzung und Kontrolle dessen, was in der Lieferkette geschieht, um die Bedürfnisse der Kunden schnell und effizient zu erfüllen. Es gibt sechs Schlüsselelemente einer Lieferkette: Produktion, Versorgung, Lagerbestand, Standort, Transport und Information. Geschäftsleiter nutzen diese sechs Schlüsselelemente, um den besten Kundenservice zu bieten.\n\nDie Produktion ist der erste Schritt im Lieferkettenprozess. Die Produktion ist die Grundlage für den gesamten Lieferkettenprozess. Die Produktionsphase skizziert, wann, warum, wo und wie alles produziert wird. Manager müssen wissen, was Kunden wollen. Um zu wissen, was Kunden wollen, können Manager den Markt beobachten. Der Markt ist der größte Indikator, um zu entscheiden, was die Kundenanforderungen sind. Nachdem Manager den Markt analysiert und die Nachfrage der Kunden verstanden haben, sind sie bereit zu entscheiden, welche Produkte produziert werden sollen und wie viele dieser Produkte produziert werden sollen. Nachdem das Management entschieden hat, was produziert wird und wie viel, sind sie bereit zu entscheiden, wo die Produkte produziert werden sollen und welches Werk am besten für Volumen und Qualität der Waren geeignet ist, wobei die Kundennachfrage und -zufriedenheit berücksichtigt werden müssen. Nachdem der Produktionsstandort für die Produkte festgelegt wurde, liegt der nächste Schritt darin, dass sich die Manager auf die Planung der Arbeitsbelastung und die Wartung der Ausrüstung konzentrieren. Die Produktion ist ein sehr wichtiger Schritt im Lieferkettenprozess. Jedes Detail ist während des gesamten Prozesses entscheidend. Wenn nicht jedes Detail entsprechend geplant wird, könnte das Unternehmen auf lange Sicht viel Zeit und Geld kosten. Zum Beispiel habe ich in den Einzelhandelsgeschäften von Wal-Mart und Target gearbeitet. Beide Unternehmen haben ein Design, ein Handbuch und einen Prozess für jede Einheit des Geschäfts. Es gibt ein gestaltetes Layout, wie die Uniform eines Mitarbeiters aussehen sollte, um die Lieferung von Lastwagen zu erhalten. Die Festlegung von Prozessen ermöglicht es einem Unternehmen, reibungslos zu arbeiten, ohne Verwirrung über Richtung und Erwartungen.\n\nDas zweite Schlüsselelement im Lieferkettenmanagement ist die Versorgung. Versorgung wird als die strategischen Entscheidungen definiert, die getroffen werden sollten, um die Kernfähigkeiten einer Einrichtung zu bestimmen, und Outsourcing-Partnerschaften sollten aus diesen Entscheidungen hervorgehen. Ein Unternehmen kann viele verschiedene Produktionsabteilungen für ein einzelnes Produkt haben. Alle Abteilungen bestehen aus unterschiedlicher Ausrüstung, Arbeitern und Spezialgebieten. Der Manager muss entscheiden, welche Abteilung am besten für die unterschiedlichen Prozesse des Produkts geeignet ist. Das Management kann auch entscheiden, die Arbeit an andere Unternehmen auszulagern. Der Hauptgrund, warum ein Manager die Arbeit an Unternehmen auslagern würde, besteht darin, Geschwindigkeit zu erzeugen. Geschwindigkeit ist die Fähigkeit, Qualität und Flexibilität zu bieten und gleichzeitig die Kosten zu senken oder auf niedrigem Niveau zu halten.\n\n**Back to English Translation:**\n\n[REWRITE]  \nSupply chain management involves the flow of processes that move goods from the customer order through the raw materials phase to delivery, production, and distribution to the customer.

Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own.

Zwei Romane, die als viktorianisch gelten, aber von dieser Tradition abweichen, sind Oliver Twist und Wuthering Heights. Beide Romane nutzen ein Element des Geheimnisses und eine Vorliebe für das Bizarrere, was für die Romane der Zeit untypisch ist, und stärken dadurch die Charaktere in jedem Werk; sie bieten Einblick, der ihre Motive und Emotionen ausführlicher darstellt.\n\n„Und nun drängten sich Heerscharen verwirrter und verwirrender Ideen in seinen Geist. Es schien, als ginge er immer noch zwischen Sikes und Crackit, die wütend stritten: denn die Worte, die sie sagten, klangen in seinen Ohren; und als er auf sich selbst achtete, ... stellte er fest, dass er mit ihnen sprach... Plötzlich schreckte er zurück beim Geräusch von Schüssen; und es erhoben sich laute Schreie und Rufe in die Luft; Lichter funkelten vor seinen Augen, und alles war Lärm und Tumult, als ihn eine unsichtbare Hand hastig forttrug. Durch all diese schnellen Visionen zog sich ein undefiniertes, unbehagliches Bewusstsein von Schmerz, das ihn unablässig quälte und peinigte.“ (Dickens, 220)\n\nDie beiden Romane nutzen dieses Geheimnis oft durch Traumsequenzen oder traumähnliche Zustände, wobei der Inhalt und die Funktion in jedem spezifischen Fall variieren. In Oliver Twist enthüllen diese seltsamen Ereignisse oft Einblicke in Olivers innere Schichten, was ihn schmerzt und sein Bewusstsein über die wahre Natur der Dinge, die um ihn herum geschehen. Wenn die Schießerei auf Oliver in Kapitel 28 schließlich wieder aufgegriffen wird, erlebt Oliver die Schießerei lebhaft, als wäre es ein Traum, während er darum kämpft, Hilfe zu finden. Die Passage betont den Mangel an Kontrolle, den Oliver über die sich entfaltenden Ereignisse hatte, sowie die kritische Lage, in der sich seine Gesundheit befand, was stark durch Olivers Halluzinationen von Sikes und Crackit zum Ausdruck kommt. Die Schießerei selbst überwältigt ihn, all seine Sinne sind betäubt, da er die „unsichtbare Hand“ nicht bemerkt, die ihn fortträgt; er erlebt seine Verzweiflung erneut, losgelöst von dem Schock des Schmerzes, da der Schmerz nun konstant ist und eher mit Angst als mit Überraschung verbunden ist. Da Oliver überwältigt ist, stellt sich die Frage, wessen Wille sein Unglück herbeiführte, denn sicherlich war es nicht sein eigener. Diese Schießerei verstärkt die Vorstellung, dass Oliver kaum Kontrolle über irgendetwas hat, da er sich nicht einmal dazu bringen kann, zu versuchen, den Ausgang eines Ereignisses zu beeinflussen, selbst wenn sein Leben in Gefahr ist. Ein wachsendes Gefühl der Niederlage in Oliver wird ebenfalls durch diese Auswahl angedeutet, als ob der alte Fagin begonnen hätte, ihn zu brechen, ihn dazu zu zwingen, diese Verzweiflung zu akzeptieren und seine Fähigkeit zu beeinflussen, zu reagieren. Denn andernfalls kann angenommen werden, dass Oliver zumindest im Interesse seines eigenen Lebens einige Anstrengungen unternommen hätte.\n\n„Der Tag verging – Tag! Es gab keinen Tag; er war verschwunden, sobald er gekommen war – und die Nacht brach wieder herein; Nacht so lang und doch so kurz; lang in ihrem schrecklichen Schweigen und kurz in ihren flüchtigen Stunden.“\n\n[REWRITE]  \nVictorian novels are known for their meticulous attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the time.

    "raw_output": "Sure, let's start with the translation to German:\n\nVor ein paar Jahren arbeitete ich in einem Nachmittagsprogramm und betreute Grundschüler. Ich tat mein Bestes, um ihnen in jedem Fach zu helfen, mit dem sie Schwierigkeiten hatten, aber meine Stärken lagen in Englisch und Lesen. Einer der Lehrer bat mich, einem kleinen Jungen namens Adrian zu helfen (ich glaube, er war in der dritten oder vierten Klasse), der große Probleme beim Lesen hatte. Es dämmerte mir, dass etwas nicht stimmte; er hatte die merkwürdigsten Probleme. Einige Buchstaben konnte er perfekt aussprechen, andere überhaupt nicht, es war das seltsamste. Wissen Sie, er war lateinamerikanischer Abstammung, das war mir klar, aber der Junge sprach perfektes Englisch. Wir kämpften weiter, bis zu dem Tag, als ich seine Mutter traf. Ich half dabei, auf einige Kinder aufzupassen (aus Mangel an einem besseren Ausdruck), während der Rest der Nachmittagsgruppe auf einem Ausflug war, als seine Mutter hereinkam. Seine Mutter sprach kein Wort Englisch, nur Spanisch. Mit meinem sehr schlechten Spanisch (ich lernte es gerade), gelang es uns zu kommunizieren. Aber dann traf es mich wie ein Schlag: Adrian konnte gut lesen, er kannte nur das englische Alphabet nicht besonders gut. Ich weiß nicht, ob diese Erkenntnis ihm viel geholfen hat, aber ich hoffe, dass es ihm jetzt besser geht.\n\nIch erzähle diese Geschichte, um das Problem der Sprachbarriere in Schulen anzusprechen, besonders hier in Kalifornien. Ich erzähle es auch, um zu beweisen, dass es nicht immer so offensichtlich ist, wie wir denken. Selbst für ein Kind, das perfekt Englisch spricht, kann das Lesen immer noch ein großes Hindernis sein. Ich denke, jeder kann zustimmen, dass dieses Problem existiert, also was tun wir? Im Fall von Adrian war die Lösung ziemlich einfach: Nachhilfe im englischen Lesen, besonders im Alphabet und in der Aussprache. Aber für die vielen Kinder, die kaum Englisch sprechen, ist die Lösung viel komplexer. Es gibt keine einfache Antwort. Das doppelte Sprachsystem, das Mainstream-Immersion, private Nachhilfelehrer, ESL-Klassen, keine dieser Dinge allein wird dieses Problem lösen. Der Schlüssel liegt darin, all das zu kombinieren!\n\nZunächst einmal ist das doppelte Sprachsystem eine großartige Idee. Nicht nur für Kinder, deren Muttersprache Spanisch ist, sondern für alle Kinder. „Kinder in zweisprachigen Bildungsprogrammen übertreffen ihre Altersgenossen akademisch.“ Viel Angst umgibt diese Idee, dass es eine Verschwendung von Ressourcen ist und dass die Mehrheit der Kinder in Schulen keinen Nutzen daraus ziehen wird. Aber das ist falsch. Wenn wir diese Art von Programmen als Regel im Klassenzimmer anwenden würden, anstatt als Ausnahme, würden alle Kinder davon profitieren. Wie gehen wir das an? Müssen wir alle Lehrer dazu verpflichten, zweisprachig zu sein? Nein. Das wäre unvernünftig und leicht unrealistisch. Ich denke jedoch, dass es keinen Grund gibt, warum wir keine speziellen Hilfen, Tutoren oder wie auch immer Sie sie nennen möchten, haben können, die zweisprachig sind.\n\nNow, let's translate it back to English:\n\n[REWRITE]  \nA few years ago, I worked in an after-school program tutoring elementary school students.

    "raw_output": "John Taylor aus Caroline war ein früher und leidenschaftlicher Verfechter des Republikanismus. Obwohl er in erster Linie Landwirt war, machte ihn sein Beruf zusammen mit seiner kurzen politischen Karriere zu einem Mann, der für seine Hingabe und Offenheit in Fragen der persönlichen Freiheit und der Regierung bekannt war. Seine Hingabe an ein agrarisches System bildete die Grundlage für fast alle seine Ansichten über die Regierung. Es war sein Versuch, das zu bewahren und zu fördern, was er als die überlegenste aller Karrieren betrachtete, der seine Argumente zu Souveränität, Verfassungsmäßigkeit und sogar zum Justizsystem prägte.\n\nJohn Taylor glaubte, dass die Vereinigten Staaten eine großartige Gelegenheit hatten, ein ideales System zu schaffen, weil es keine einheimische Tradition gab, die die Schöpfer der Regierung behindern könnte, was die Schaffung eines Systems der Selbstverwaltung ermöglichte. Er glaubte fest an die natürlichen Rechte des Menschen und daran, dass sie alle voneinander abhängig sind – was bedeutet, dass wenn einem das Recht verweigert wird, alle scheitern werden und der Wert der verbleibenden verringert wird. Diese Rechte sollten daher außerhalb der Reichweite der Regierung liegen. Er behauptete, dass das, was einige den „Naturzustand“ nannten, bedeutete, dass diejenigen mit körperlicher Stärke und bösartiger Intelligenz profitieren, aber dass dies in einer Zivilisation nicht der Weg sein darf.\n\nUm diese ideale Gesellschaft zu schaffen, glaubte Taylor, dass eine Regierung geschaffen werden müsse, die das inhärente Gute und Böse im Menschen berücksichtigt. Taylor war sehr unnachgiebig in seinen Ansichten über eine dualistische Moral. Er behauptete, dass „da die Regierung von Menschen ausgeübt wird, alle ihre Tugenden und Laster menschlich sein müssen“. Er definierte gute Prinzipien als diejenigen, die Privateigentum schützen, die Landwirtschaft verbessern und den Kapitalismus entmutigen, und glaubte, dass eine in guten Prinzipien gegründete Regierung gerecht funktionieren würde, unabhängig von ihrer Verwaltung, die zwangsläufig von Habgier und Eigeninteresse geleitet würde. Eigeninteresse, so glaubte er, sei die Motivation des Menschen in allen Dingen, aber dass die Eigenschaft nur dann als böse angesehen wurde, wenn sie über die Schaffung einer auf das Gemeinwohl ausgerichteten Gesellschaft hinaus zu Untergesellschaften führte, die auf Kosten anderer lebten. Eine gute Regierung war notwendig, um das natürliche Böse des Menschen zu bewahren, und selbst dann musste sie sorgfältig überwacht werden, um die Hinzufügung schlechter Prinzipien zu vermeiden.\n\nTaylor, wie viele andere überzeugte Republikaner seiner Zeit, forderte eine strikte Auslegung der Verfassung. Er wollte eine äußerst eingeschränkte Bundesregierung, der keine weiteren Rechte oder Befugnisse eingeräumt wurden, als in der Verfassung ausdrücklich festgelegt. Er wusste, dass eine umfangreiche Bundesregierung teuer war und daher wahrscheinlich despotisch. Er hielt jedoch eine einfache, wörtliche Auslegung für gefährlich und glaubte, dass eine solche Methode ohne Bezugnahme auf die Absicht der Verfasser leicht korrupt werden könnte. Noch mehr betrachtete er die Unabhängigkeitserklärung als die wahre Charta der Vereinigten Staaten, weil sie das Land als eine Gruppe souveräner Staaten klarer beschreibt als als eine Nation.\n\n[REWRITE]  \nJohn Taylor of Caroline was an early and passionate advocate of Republicanism.

A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)

Die National Institutes of Health erklären, dass ein Aspekt des Problems darin besteht, dass das Gehirn von Teenagern buchstäblich nicht bereit ist für die Gefahren des Fahrens. Einfache Unerfahrenheit liegt ebenfalls im Kern des Problems. Diese Unerfahrenheit führt nicht nur zu mehr tödlichen Unfällen, sondern auch zu einer höheren Rate von Fahrzeugüberschlägen, Geschwindigkeitsüberschreitungen und Abkommen von der Straße.\n\nTeenager schneiden auch viel schlechter ab, wenn sie mit Gleichaltrigen reisen—was jeder mit einem Funken Verstand weiß, dass sie es regelmäßig tun. Das Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center führte eine Studie durch, die folgende Korrelation zeigte: zwischen dem Alter des Passagiers und der Anzahl der Verkehrsunfälle.\n\nKalifornien und andere Staaten haben versucht, die Sicherheit von jugendlichen Fahrern zu erhöhen, indem sie vorübergehende vorläufige Führerscheine verlangen, die die Fahrzeiten der Teenager einschränken und andere Minderjährige als Passagiere verbieten.\n\nAber vorläufige Führerscheine sind meiner Meinung nach nur Übergangslösungen. Das eigentliche Problem ist, dass die jüngsten Fahrer als Gruppe nach allen statistischen Maßstäben einfach nicht in der Lage sind, die Risiken und Verantwortungen angemessen zu bewältigen. Psychologe Marvin Zuckerman glaubt, dass selbst 18 zu jung für einen regulären Führerschein ist. USA Today berichtet, dass Zuckerman Forschung betrieben hat, die darauf hindeutet, dass unter 19-20-Jährigen ein gemeinsames Verlangen besteht, Risiken einzugehen, nur um den Nervenkitzel zu erleben. Es macht also Sinn, das Fahren zumindest so lange zu verzögern, bis die Neigung zum Nervenkitzel nachlässt. Wenn wir weiterhin Führerscheine an junge Teenager ausgeben, werden wir nicht nur weiterhin tödliche Unfälle sehen, sondern die Zahl der Todesopfer wird in den nächsten Jahren wahrscheinlich erschreckende Ausmaße erreichen. Bis 2010 werden die Babys der Babyboomer berechtigt sein zu fahren, und Millionen neuer Teenager-Fahrer werden bereit sein, auf die Straße zu gehen.\n\nGesetzgebung, die sich mit diesem Problem befasst, wäre relativ unkompliziert. Schulen könnten weiterhin Fahrunterricht anbieten, um den Lernprozess für zukünftige Fahrer zu beginnen, aber niemand unter 18 Jahren dürfte ein Kraftfahrzeug bedienen. Ein vorläufiger Führerschein könnte immer noch vor der Erteilung eines vollen Führerscheins ausgestellt werden, und eine bestimmte Anzahl von praktischen Fahrschulstunden wäre ebenfalls erforderlich. Die genaue Anzahl der erforderlichen Stunden könnte auf der Anzahl der Stunden basieren, die bereits von der Mehrheit der Staaten verlangt werden (in Kalifornien beispielsweise sind es derzeit 6 Stunden hinter dem Steuer und 50 Stunden Übung mit einem Erwachsenen). Da die tödlichen Statistiken für jugendliche Fahrer aus einem Querschnitt aller Staaten stammen, wäre eine einheitliche, nationale Gesetzgebung zu diesem Thema ein vernünftiges—und ich glaube, effektives—Mittel, um Teenager im gesamten Land zu schützen.\n\nDie von mir vorgeschlagene Gesetzgebung ist keineswegs eine neue Idee.\n\n[REWRITE]Teenagers are losing their lives behind the wheel.

Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",

Anschließend wird die Diagnose mit häufigen Merkmalen oder \"Warnsignalen\" erklärt. Abschließend beschreibt der Artikel, wie ein Lehrer in einer integrativen Klassenzimmerumgebung einem Schüler mit CAPD helfen kann.\n\nDie zentrale auditive Verarbeitungsstörung (CAPD) oder Auditive Verarbeitungsstörung (APD) bezieht sich auf die Effizienz und Effektivität, mit der das zentrale Nervensystem (ZNS) auditive Informationen nutzt. Eng definiert bezieht sich (C)AP auf die Wahrnehmungsverarbeitung von auditiven Informationen im ZNS und die neurobiologische Aktivität, die dieser Verarbeitung zugrunde liegt und elektrophysiologische Hörpotenziale erzeugt (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), was bedeutet, dass es sich um eine Störung handelt, bei der das zentrale Nervensystem (d. h. das Gehirn) Gehörtes nicht richtig verarbeiten kann. Menschen mit CAPD können normal hören und gelten daher nicht als \"hörgeschädigt\"; vielmehr funktioniert der Bereich des Gehirns, der Gehörtes übersetzt, Wörter trennt oder Gespräche von Hintergrundgeräuschen unterscheidet, nicht so, wie er es normalerweise sollte.\n\nDie früheste Erwähnung der Störung, die zu CAPD wurde, stammt aus den mittleren 1950er Jahren und wurde als \"auditive Imperception\" bezeichnet, als Forscher Kinder mit Kommunikationsstörungen untersuchten. Das italienische Forscherteam Bocca, Calearo und Cassinari begann 1954, Tests für diese Kinder zu entwickeln; 1961 führte Kimura \"dichotische Tests ein und formulierte ein Modell, um die Physiologie des ZNS zu erklären, die der dichotischen Wahrnehmung zugrunde liegt\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Eine nationale Konferenz 1977 stimulierte die Forschung an Kindern mit CAPD.\n\nCAPD zeigt sich auf vielfältige Weise: Die betroffene Person kann möglicherweise keinen Schall im Raum lokalisieren oder hören; sie könnte Schwierigkeiten haben, zwischen zwei oder mehr \"akustischen Ereignissen\" zu unterscheiden; sie könnte nicht in der Lage sein, Klangmuster zu erkennen; sie könnte Veränderungen in der Sprache nicht differenzieren können (wie Sarkasmus aufgrund von Stimmveränderungen zu erkennen); ein Geräusch könnte durch ein nachfolgendes Geräusch blockiert werden; sie könnte nicht in der Lage sein, Klanghinweise zu synthetisieren (das heißt, sie sinnvoll zu interpretieren, um daraufhin handeln zu können); und sie könnte die Reihenfolge, in der auditive Informationen präsentiert werden, nicht bestimmen können (Ferre).\n\nUm CAPD zu diagnostizieren, muss der Patient mit \"systematischer Beobachtung des Hörverhaltens und/oder Leistungstests der auditiven Funktion\" untersucht werden, die von \"Audiologen, Sprachtherapeuten, Psychologen und anderen mit verschiedenen Messverfahren, die auditiv bezogene Fähigkeiten bewerten\", durchgeführt werden können (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Dies kann Fragebögen und Umfragen, die Beobachtung auditiver Verhaltensweisen, einschließlich der Reaktion des Patienten auf bestimmte Reize, umfassen. Derzeit gibt es kein einheitliches Werkzeug oder Test, der durchweg eine hohe Erfolgsrate bei der Diagnose aufweist, und es gibt keine bekannte Ursache für die Störung. Viele verwendete Tests präsentieren dem Patienten multiple, gleichzeitige auditive Stimuli und fordern ihn dann auf, bestimmte Elemente, wie eine Reihe von Wörtern oder Zahlen, zu unterscheiden. Fortgeschrittenere Tests umfassen das Aufzeichnen von akustischen Signalen im Ohr und das Messen der Reaktionen auf diese Signale.\n\n[REWRITE]  \nThis article examines three aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD).

Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",

Werte, die ich in das Feld der Sozialarbeit einbringen kann, umfassen Folgendes: Dienstleistung, Respekt, ethische Grundsätze, Engagement zur Verbesserung von Beziehungen zu anderen und zur beruflichen Weiterentwicklung, um in meinem Bereich kompetent zu bleiben. Diese Kernwerte sind nicht nur für Sozialarbeiter wichtig; sie sind mir persönlich wichtig.\n\nIch wollte schon immer anderen helfen, war mir aber unsicher über den Karriereweg, den ich einschlagen wollte. Während meiner Schul- und Collegejahre sah ich viele Menschen, die ihre Probleme im Verleugnen flüchteten, und einige nutzten Bewältigungsmechanismen, die weniger ideal waren. Aufgrund der Situationen, die ich erlebt habe, entschied ich mich, einen Bachelor in Psychologie zu verfolgen. Immer noch unsicher über den Karriereweg, beschloss ich, nach meinem Abschluss am Piedmont College im Jahr 2009 eine Pause einzulegen. Eines Sommertages besuchte ich eine Freundin, die mir einen sechzehnjährigen Jungen vorstellte, der nervös auf ihrer Couch saß. Sie erklärte mir, warum er zu Besuch war: um seinen missbrauchenden Eltern zu entkommen. Am nächsten Tag erfuhr ich, dass er die Polizei zum Wohnsitz seiner Eltern gerufen hatte. Um zu sehen, ob ich in irgendeiner Weise helfen konnte, fuhr ich zu seinem Elternhaus. Dort angekommen, erklärte ich privat den Polizisten meine Bedenken und sagte ihnen, dass ich gerade einen Abschluss in Psychologie vom Piedmont College gemacht hatte. Die Polizei bat mich, mit den Eltern zu sprechen, da das Gesetz nichts für den Teenager tun konnte. Als ich die Eltern über die Situation befragte, wirkten sie nervös und benutzten Ausreden, um das \"manipulative\" Verhalten ihres Sohnes zu beschreiben, weil er externe Quellen einbezogen hatte, um \"einfache\" Streitigkeiten zu lösen. Nach diesem besonderen Erlebnis begann ich ernsthaft in Betracht zu ziehen, eine Karriere in der Sozialarbeit einzuschlagen, um Kindern bei \"einfachen\" Streitigkeiten innerhalb der Familie zu helfen.\n\nEin weiterer Wert, der für das Feld der Sozialarbeit wichtig ist, ist soziale Gerechtigkeit. Als Gesellschaft behaupten wir, dass das Individuum wichtig ist und wir betrauern diejenigen, die wir verloren haben. Das Konzept des \"Individuums\", das die Gesellschaft hält, ist eher ein Anhänger archaischer Traditionen als wirkliche Einzigartigkeit. Wenn die Gesellschaft also verlorene Individuen betrauert, warum streben wir dann danach, ähnlich wie \"alle anderen\" zu sein? Ich bin ein Individuum und genieße es nicht, mich selbst zu beschränken, um anderen ähnlich zu sein. Während meiner Schul- und Collegejahre protestierte ich wann immer möglich gegen soziale Ungerechtigkeit: färbte meine Haare in unnatürlichen Farben, trug Kleidung, die meiner Persönlichkeit entsprach, durchbohrte meine Ohren über das traditionelle Set hinaus, erklärte meine Beteiligung an der GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), kämpfte gegen Rassismus und Diskriminierung, wann immer ich es sah, usw. Ich glaube an soziale Gerechtigkeit und werde weiterhin gegen soziale Ungerechtigkeit protestieren.\n\n[REWRITE]In pursuing an education in social work, I plan to follow a career with the Division of Family and Children Services to assist children who have been abused or neglected, and to support troubled families. Values I can bring to the field of social work include: service, respect, ethical principles, commitment to improving relationships with others, and professional development to remain competent in my field. These core values are not only important to social workers; they hold personal significance for me.\n\nI have always wanted to help others, but I was uncertain about the career path I wanted to take.

The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",

Die soziokulturellen Modelle betrachten Umweltbeziehungen und ihre Anwendung auf Rasse, Ethnizität, Demografie und sozioökonomischen Status. Die folgende Übersicht über Insomnie betrachtet diese Modelle und erklärt jede ausgewählte Forschungsarbeit, um sie mit den Modellen in Beziehung zu setzen und besser zu erklären. Die Erklärungen der Forschung und ihrer Ergebnisse werden dann kritisiert, um ihre spezifischen Stärken und Schwächen zu erwähnen.\n\nEine Schlafstörung kann als primäre Schlafstörung, als Schlafstörung im Zusammenhang mit einer anderen psychischen Störung oder als Schlafstörung im Zusammenhang mit anderen Problemen charakterisiert werden. Die primären Schlafstörungen sind Dyssomnien oder Parasomnien, während Schlafstörungen im Zusammenhang mit einer anderen psychischen Störung mit einer Achse-I- oder Achse-II-Störung in Verbindung stehen. Andere Kategorien von Schlafstörungen können auf medizinische Komplikationen oder die Einnahme einer Substanz zurückzuführen sein. Die Dyssomnien sind: Primäre Insomnie, Primäre Hypersomnie, Narkolepsie, Atembezogene Schlafstörung, Schlafstörung des zirkadianen Rhythmus und Dyssomnie nicht näher spezifiziert (NOS). Während Primäre Insomnie eine Schwierigkeit bei ausreichendem oder durchgehendem Schlaf ist, ist Primäre Hypersomnie eine Schwierigkeit, wach zu bleiben, beide für mindestens einen Monat. Narkolepsie beinhaltet Kataplexie und/oder automatisches REM. Während Dyssomnien sich auf das Einschlafen und Durchschlafen konzentrieren, sind Parasomnien Schlafstörungen, die mit Verhaltensauffälligkeiten und/oder physiologischen Vorkommnissen verbunden sind. Parasomnien sind Albtraumstörung, Schlafterrorstörung, Schlafwandeln und Parasomnien nicht näher spezifiziert. Die Schlafstörungen im Zusammenhang mit einer anderen psychischen Störung betreffen Schlafschwierigkeiten aufgrund von Achse I (Klinische Störungen) oder Achse II (Persönlichkeitsstörungen oder geistige Behinderung). Die folgende Übersicht konzentriert sich auf Insomnie und teilweise auf primäre Schlafstörungen im Allgemeinen in Bezug auf die biologischen und soziokulturellen Modelle.\n\nDas biologische Modell von Schlafstörungen konzentriert sich auf Gene, vererbbare Faktoren und physiologisch erworbene Aspekte von Schlafstörungen. Neuronen im Hypothalamus, die Orexin enthalten, sind für die Regulierung von Schlaf und Wachzustand verantwortlich. Diese Studie experimentierte mit Mäusen und fand heraus, dass es phänotypische GABAB-Rezeptoren auf den Orexin-Neuronen gibt, die speziell für Schlaf-/Wachzustände verantwortlich sind. Die Aktivierung des GABAA-Rezeptors induziert Reaktionen, die den Schlaf fördern. Wenn seine Aktivität gehemmt wird, kann dies die Angst reduzieren und den Schlaf fördern. Der GABAB-Agonist (Baclofen) erhöhte die Schlafzeit (Matsuki et al., 2009). Solche Ergebnisse implizieren, dass die Tiermodelle von Mäusen auf Studien am Menschen verallgemeinert werden können. Dies zeigt, dass es eine genetische und umweltbedingte Grundlage für den physischen GABAB-Rezeptor beim Menschen gibt. Ein Problem oder das Fehlen dieses Rezeptors könnte die Fähigkeit, ohne Medikamente ausreichend zu schlafen, beeinträchtigen. Die soziokulturelle Implikation dieser Studie ist, dass, wenn der Phänotyp vererbt wurde, dieser den Schlaf regulieren könnte und eine Veränderung des Rezeptors den Schlaf eines Individuums natürlich stören würde. Dies würde sich negativ auf Lebensaspekte wie Schule, Karriere und alltägliche Ereignisse auswirken, die monotone Aufgaben und Konzentration erfordern.\n\n[REWRITE]The paper discusses biological and sociocultural models concerning the sleep disorder insomnia.

For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle.

Für viele, mich eingeschlossen, kann es ein Problem sein, sich auf dem Campus zurechtzufinden. Im ersten Studienjahr wurde ich in einem Wohnheimzimmer in den East Halls untergebracht; praktisch die östlichste Grenze des Campus, abgesehen vom Stadion und dem Bryce Jordan Center. Der Weg von meinem Wohnheim in Stuart Hall zu den Klassen in weit entfernten Orten wie dem Willard-Gebäude, in der Nähe des Campuszentrums, konnte zu Fuß bis zu 25 Minuten dauern, besonders wenn das Wetter schlecht war, wie es in State College oft der Fall ist. Als ich mit einem ehemaligen Studenten sprach, der nicht viel älter ist als ich, erfuhr ich, dass die Wohnheime in den East Halls vor nicht allzu langer Zeit durch große ungenutzte Landflächen vom Rest der Schule getrennt waren. Heute ist dieser leere Raum mit Sportfeldern, riesigen neuen Gebäuden, darunter die neue Molkerei und das neue Gesundheitszentrum, gefüllt und von Apartments umgeben. Da unser Campus weiter wächst, wird es immer schwieriger, von einem zum anderen Ort zu gelangen. Was ist die beste Lösung für das Mobilitätsproblem? Auf einem College-Campus ist es das Fahrrad. Aber das Fahrrad allein löst keine Probleme. Die Studenten müssen sie benutzen, und der Campus muss so gestaltet sein, dass er den Bedürfnissen der Radfahrer gerecht wird. Ich sprach mit einem Freund, der nach einer mehrjährigen Pause kürzlich wieder mit dem Radfahren begonnen hat. Er erwähnte, dass er sich fragte, warum er überhaupt aufgehört hatte. „Fahrräder sind großartig“, sagte er, „einige Jahre war es nicht cool, Fahrrad zu fahren, aber es ist der einzige Weg, um herumzukommen.“ Neben den gesundheitlichen Vorteilen ist Radfahren die effizienteste Art zu reisen. Eine Schüssel Haferflocken und ein wenig körperliche Anstrengung bringen dich 30 Meilen oder mehr weit. Wie viele Studenten lebe ich jetzt außerhalb des Campus; genauso weit vom Campuszentrum entfernt wie einige Wohnheime. Die klügste Entscheidung, die ich in diesem Jahr getroffen habe, war der Kauf eines Fahrrads. Jeden Tag habe ich Unterricht im Thomas-Gebäude, ein Spaziergang von 25 Minuten von meinem Zuhause. Mit dem Fahrrad kann ich die Zeit auf 5 Minuten verkürzen, wenn ich schnell genug trete. Das einzige Problem ist, dass die Pollock Road der direkteste Weg zum Thomas-Gebäude von meinem Haus aus ist, und es ist nicht immer eine einfache Straße, weder mit noch ohne Fahrrad. Es gibt auch einiges zu Fuß zu sagen, aber ich persönlich bin zu beschäftigt, um zu laufen. Wenn ich mein Fahrrad nicht hätte, wäre Gehen meine einzige zuverlässige Option, um zum Unterricht zu kommen. Jeden Tag zu Fuß nach Thomas zu gehen, würde mir zusätzlich 30-40 Minuten pro Tag abverlangen. Das sind über zweieinhalb Stunden jede Woche. Dazu kommt noch die ganze andere Zeit, die ich mit dem Gehen zu und von anderen Klassen, Terminen usw. verbringen müsste. Das ist mehr Zeit, als ich erübrigen kann.\n\n[REWRITE]I have been a student at University Park for around two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters.

He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for some years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” Besides being good for your health, cycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a bit of physical effort can take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off-campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in the Thomas building, a walk of twenty-five minutes from my home. Riding a bike can reduce that time to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only issue is that Pollock Road is the most direct route to the Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel, with or without a bike. Walking has its merits too, but I'm personally too busy to walk. Without my bike, walking would be my only reliable way to get to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an additional 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours each week. Add to that all the other time I would need to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, etc. That's more time than I can afford.",

Die Menschen schätzen die Gemeinschaft über das Individuum und werden von Anfang an darauf konditioniert, sofortiges Glück über alles andere zu suchen. Die Bürger werden als Spielfiguren in einem größeren Spiel enthüllt, die einer einzigen Ideologie unterworfen sind, wie sie vom Weltkontroller vorgegeben wird. Betrachtet man das Werk durch die Brille des marxistischen Theismus, erkennt man die zugrunde liegenden Verdachtsmomente des Autors in Bezug auf die Entwicklung der genannten Systeme. Häufige Begriffe in der marxistischen Theorie wie Homogenität und Vergegenständlichung verstärken die Idee, dass Huxleys Roman ein Kommentar zu den Fehlern der aufkommenden Wirtschaft seiner Zeit ist.\n\nDer Kapitalismus wird durch die Verwendung der marxistischen These des falschen Bewusstseins satirisiert. Im Wesentlichen wird der gewöhnlichen Bürgerschaft verhindert, die wahren Beziehungen zu anderen Klassen in wirtschaftlichen Begriffen zu erkennen, da sie in erster Linie an ihrem eigenen Vorteil interessiert sind. Dies soll das Ergebnis ideologischer Kontrolle der Arbeiterklasse und der gewöhnlichen Arbeiter sein, etwas, das offensichtlich durch die Konditionierung der Menschen in der \"Schönen neuen Welt\" ist. Die gewöhnlichen Klassen, Delta, Gamma usw., haben keinen eigenen Willen; durch Hypnopädie wird der Antrieb zu konsumieren, auszugeben, zu genießen über alles andere gestärkt. Dies wird, wie bereits erwähnt, vom Weltkontroller manipuliert. Hegemonie, im Wesentlichen die Idee, dass Gruppen sozialer Klassen von einer separaten Gruppe von Individuen vollständig dominiert werden, wird offensichtlich in diesem Fall verwendet. Die unteren Klassen sind sich der Manipulation völlig unbewusst und 'kaufen' buchstäblich eine Ideologie, die diese Struktur unterstützt (d.h. Kapitalismus und Konsumismus). Die oberen Klassen werden mit der Fähigkeit geboren, sich dessen bewusst zu sein, tun aber nichts; wenige Alphas oder Betas, abgesehen von Charakteren wie Bernard, tun mehr, als ihren Platz zu akzeptieren. Tatsächlich sind die Interaktionen der sozialen Klassen, wie noch ausführlicher diskutiert wird, bedeutende Anzeichen für die wahrgenommene Unterdrückung des Kapitalismus.\n\nBeziehungen zwischen unterschiedlichen Individuen existieren in der \"Schönen neuen Welt\" nicht. Der Roman scheint die Charaktere nicht zu unterscheiden - sie sind selbst unter den Hauptcharakteren ohne Tiefe. Vielleicht schlägt Huxley vor, dass der Aufstieg von Technologie und Kapitalismus zusammen den Menschen seines freien Willens und Ausdrucks beraubt. Liebe existiert nicht, noch die Extreme irgendeiner Emotion; vielmehr bleiben die Interaktionen oberflächlich, dargestellt durch die Bemerkungen der Männer über Frauen, vor allem über deren körperliches Erscheinungsbild (z.B. pneumatische Qualität), und die ungenierten Kommentare der Frauen über ihre Erlebnisse, sozusagen. Darüber hinaus zeigt die Zufriedenheit jeder gesellschaftlichen Klasse mit ihrem Platz in der Hierarchie die sozioökonomische Wirkung des Kapitalismus. Ihr absolutes Gehorsam gegenüber ihrem Teil in der Gemeinschaft ist ein Hinweis auf das marxistische Denken über das Proletariat, das fälschlicherweise von seiner eigenen Überlegenheit über alles andere überzeugt ist, solange es weiter konsumiert, gehorcht und mit dem Rest seiner Mitmenschen in Einklang bleibt.\n\n[REWRITE]Aldous Huxley criticizes the looming threat of both technology and the capitalist structure, which is reinforced by creating a dystopia in the novel Brave New World.

I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.

The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.

That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.

Eines der Hauptthemen der hitzigen Diskussion im Unterricht war, ob der Islam eine feindliche Religion ist oder nicht. Ich glaube, dass diese Frage heute relevanter ist als je zuvor. Rückblickend auf die Ereignisse seit dem 11. September habe ich persönlich beobachtet, wie die Massenmedien von einer feindlichen Sicht auf den Islam und seine Extremisten zu einer extremen Form der Toleranz gegenüber dem Islam in Amerika übergegangen sind. Ich glaube nicht, dass wir 2001 jemals einen Präsidentschaftskandidaten mit dem Namen Barack Obama hätten haben können, der in seiner Familie einen offensichtlichen muslimischen Hintergrund hat.\n\nDie Biografie des Propheten ist für mich faszinierend, denn nach dem, was ich über die Geschichte Muhammads weiß, widerspricht die Biografie der Persönlichkeit Muhammads. Nach meinem bisherigen Wissen und Lernen dachte ich, dass Muhammad Menschen zum Islam zwang. Er eroberte Stämme und übernahm sie, um sie dann zur Annahme der islamischen Religion zu zwingen. Doch laut der Biografie wurde Muhammad als eine Art Märtyrer dargestellt, der missverstanden wurde und sich sogar anderen gegenüber demütigte. Danach kamen die Menschen nacheinander, um die 'Wahrheit' in seinen Lehren zu erkennen und suchten ihn auf.\n\nEs gibt auch einige verblüffende Ähnlichkeiten zwischen den Diensten von Jesus und den 'Wundern' von Muhammad. Das offensichtlichste Beispiel ist, als er Hammelfleisch und Milch nahm und es so vervielfältigte, dass es mehr als genug für vierzig Männer war. Dieser Schreibstil lässt mich glauben, dass die Autoren wollten, dass Muhammad als demütiger Prophet wahrgenommen wird, der nichts beweisen musste, sondern einfach in Wahrheit und Wundern lebte. Diese Art von Irrtum ist für mich die schlimmste, weil sie das Wunder und Leben von Jesus Christus herabsetzt. Es wirkt, als würden sie versuchen, das Leben und die Person Jesu durch Muhammad zu imitieren und sich dafür Anerkennung zu verschaffen.\n\nEs gibt auch viele Geschichten in der Biografie, die es so aussehen lassen, als sei es Teil ihrer Agenda, Beweise für 'Zeugen' oder dafür zu liefern, wie Menschen 'von selbst' zum Islam konvertierten. Das Problem ist jedoch, dass viele der Geschichten mindestens aus einer Perspektive einer dritten Partei stammen. In der Geschichte illustriert der Autor, dass er von diesem und jenem gehört hat, der es wiederum von jemand anderem gehört hat, usw. Das gefiel mir nicht besonders, denn obwohl ihre Idee war, dass es Beweise für die Wahrheit der Geschichten lieferte, dachte ich, dass es die Geschichten abschwächte und sie umso verdächtiger machte.\n\nIch denke, was mich an dieser Arbeit am meisten stört, ist, dass sie versuchen, Muhammad als gottesfürchtigen Mann zu erheben, der demütig, liebenswert, weise und sanft war. Aber die Geschichte widerspricht der Vorstellung, dass Muhammad ein sanfter und demütiger Mann war, und ich kann nicht umhin zu denken, ob Muslime heute die wahre Geschichte hinter Muhammads Aufstieg zur Macht kennen.\n\n[REWRITE]Almost four years ago, I took a course on Islam at CBC.

They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",

    "raw_output": "**Translation to German:**\n\nIch glaube, dass \"The Jungle\" zeigt, wie Menschen tief im Inneren von Natur aus gierig und ichbezogen sind. Sie wollen nur für sich selbst sorgen und ihr Leben so gut wie möglich gestalten, aber nie für jemanden sorgen, der unter ihnen steht. \"The Jungle\" zeigt dies auf viele Arten. Der offensichtlichste Bereich sind die Besitzer und Manager der großen Fabriken. Alles, was sie tun wollen, ist, ihre Unternehmen und Fabriken so groß und großartig wie möglich zu machen. Sie kümmern sich nicht um irgendjemanden oder irgendetwas, das ihnen im Weg steht oder das durch ihre Fortschritte verletzt wird. Laut Upton Sinclairs Werk: \"Die Linie der Gebäude stand klar und schwarz gegen den Himmel; hier und da stiegen aus der Masse die großen Schornsteine auf, mit dem Fluss des Rauches, der bis zum Ende der Welt strömte\". Sinclair versucht ein Bild des großen Schadens zu zeichnen, den diese Verschmutzung verursacht. Er zeigt, dass die Eigentümer keine Rücksicht auf irgendeine Person oder ein Tier nehmen, das verletzt werden könnte. Sie kümmern sich nicht um die großen Rauchwolken, die aus den Fabriken aufsteigen, oder um die tierischen Fäkalien und den Urinabfluss aus den Tausenden von Gehegen in Packingtown. Die Besitzer und Manager kümmerten sich auch nicht um ihre Angestellten, die sie reich machten. Sie würden alles tun, um einen zusätzlichen Dollar zu verdienen oder zu sparen: \"Von oben bis unten ist der Ort einfach ein brodelnder Kessel aus Eifersüchteleien und Hass; es gibt nirgendwo Loyalität oder Anstand, es gibt keinen Ort, an dem ein Mann gegen einen Dollar etwas zählte\". Sie zwingen ihre Angestellten, schreckliche Stunden zu arbeiten, und dann, ohne auch nur einen Tag Vorwarnung, könnten sie eine Vielzahl von Menschen auf einmal entlassen, ohne jegliche Entschädigung oder Hilfe bei der Arbeitssuche. In der Ära, in der \"The Jungle\" spielt, gab es nicht viele, wenn überhaupt, Gesetze oder Vorschriften, die den Schutz der Sicherheit oder des Wohlergehens der Arbeiter gewährleisteten. Dies ermöglichte es den Managern und Eigentümern, wild zu agieren, ihre Angestellten zu zwingen, den Fortschritt zu beschleunigen und unter schrecklichen Bedingungen zu arbeiten. Obwohl das Buch es nie direkt sagt, wurde von den Menschen, die in Packingtown lebten und arbeiteten, einfach erwartet, mit den schrecklichen Bedingungen sowohl bei der Arbeit in den Fabriken als auch beim Leben in der Nähe fertig zu werden. Es gab keine Agenturen oder Organisationen, die Informationen oder Hilfe für die Arbeiter bereitstellten. Es gab Gewerkschaften, die gegründet wurden, aber diese richteten oft mehr Schaden als Nutzen an, da sie von den armen Arbeitern Geld verdienten. Die Arbeiter wurden so schlecht behandelt und hatten keine Möglichkeit, dem System von Packingtown zu entkommen, dass sie als Sklaven beschrieben wurden: \"Hier ist eine Bevölkerung, niedrigklassig und meist fremd, die immer am Rande des Hungers hängt und für ihre Lebenschancen auf das Gutdünken von Männern angewiesen ist, die ebenso brutal und skrupellos sind wie die Sklaventreiber der alten Zeit; unter solchen Umständen ist Unmoral genauso unvermeidlich und weit verbreitet wie unter dem System der Sklaverei\".\n\n**Translation back to English:**\n\n[REWRITE]  \nI believe that \"The Jungle\" reveals how humans are naturally greedy and self-centered at their core.

It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given.

Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live.

    "raw_output": "Sure, here is the translation process:\n\n**Translation to German:**\n\nDas Traumland ist eines von Edgar Allan Poes selbsternannten besseren Gedichten. In \"Traumland\" verwendet Poe den Begriff \"Thule\" in den Zeilen 6 und 56, den Mabbott auf Vergil zurückführt. Vergil verwendete den Begriff in Bezug auf eine Insel nördlich von Großbritannien, die die Griechen als den Rand der bekannten Welt betrachteten. Es ist sicher, dass Vergil den Begriff verwendete, jedoch gibt es eine aktuellere Quelle, der einigen Kredit gegeben werden muss. Poe war sehr an deutschen Autoren interessiert. Dieses Zitat ist wichtig, weil es Poes Vertrautheit mit Gothe's Schriften zeigt. Karl J. Arndt kommentiert in seinem Buch Poes Politian und Goethes Mignon die Ähnlichkeit ihrer beiden Gedichte und zieht die Schlussfolgerung, dass Poe Goethe nachahmte. Der Oxford Companion to English Literature sagt über Gothe, dass er ein gefeierter Schriftsteller des poetischen Dramas Faust war, das in zwei Teilen veröffentlicht wurde, der erste 1808 und der zweite im Jahr von Gothe’s Tod 1832. Im poetischen Vers des zweiten Teils von Faust befindet sich ein kurzes Gedicht mit dem Titel \"Der König von Thule\". Das Gedicht handelt von einem König, dessen Frau stirbt, nachdem sie ihm das Geschenk eines Kelchs gegeben hat. Nachdem seine Frau gestorben ist, beginnt er stark zu trinken und weint aus der Erinnerung an seine tote Königin. Er beschließt dann, dass es an der Zeit ist zu sterben, und gibt seine Besitztümer seinen Kindern, abgesehen vom Kelch. Er geht dann zu einer Klippe, wirft den Kelch ins Meer, schließt seine Augen und stirbt. Das Auftreten des Königs von Thule und die Beschreibung des Königs im Traumland sind sehr ähnlich, vielleicht ein dunkler Doppelgänger von Poes Verlust und Trinkgewohnheiten. Faust wurde auch 1842 von H P Grattan in ein romantisches Drama umgeschrieben, weniger als ein Jahr bevor Poe den Begriff Thule in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" verwendete. Poe bezieht sich zweimal in seinen gesammelten Schriften auf Thule. Einmal erwähnt Poe \"ultma Thule\" in The Pit and the Pendulum, aber er verwendet diesen Ausdruck in \"Traumland\" zweimal, als Buchenden für das Gedicht. \"Der König von Thule\" und \"Traumland\" können als Begleitstücke gelesen werden. Im \"Traumland\" sagt der Sprecher. Er beschreibt dann die Landschaft von Thule und wie sie dunkel, einsam ist, er wird von toten Freunden heimgesucht, und er sieht eine schattige Welt ohne Farbe. All diese Szenen würden in \"Der König von Thule\" von Gothe gelesen, da er gerade seine Frau verloren hat, er einsam ist und seinen Willen zu herrschen oder sogar zu leben verloren hat. Das gesamte Gedicht ist eine Beschreibung, als hätte der Sprecher Goethes Gedicht betreten. Gothe war ein bedeutender Autor, den Poe gekannt hätte, wenn nicht aus einem anderen Grund, dann aus Respekt vor Tennyson. Poe sagte dies, als er gefragt wurde, ob er Tennyson bewundere. Abgesehen von der Verbindung zu Tennyson wäre Poe durch die vielen Reproduktionen, die nach der ursprünglichen Veröffentlichung stattfanden, Goethes Werk ausgesetzt gewesen.\n\n**Translation back to English:**\n\n[REWRITE]  \nDream-Land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems.

Palmers Argument, dass Martins Handlungen verachtenswert waren, ist weniger überzeugend, aber angesichts der Tatsache, dass im Jahr 2009 sechs Ausrutsch- und Sturzvorfälle passiert sind und Martin immer noch keine geeigneten Maßnahmen zur Sicherstellung der Sicherheit seines Geschäfts ergriffen hat, dennoch vernünftig.

Es begann, als sie etwa 14 Jahre alt war und gerade ins Teenagerleben eintrat. Und es war immer noch da, drei Jahre später, im Alter von 17 Jahren. Inzwischen hatte sie festgestellt, dass sie jemanden statt etwas wollte. Doch sie hatte kein Interesse an Jungen. Einige hatten sich zu ihr hingezogen gefühlt, waren durch die unbeholfenen Versuche gegangen, das Unbezauberbare zu bezaubern, aber niemand sprach sie an. Sie fragte sich oft mit diesem seltsamen Gefühl, was es sein könnte, das so etwas Seltsames bei einem Teenagermädchen verursachen könnte. Die wenigen Jahre der Nachdenklichkeit hatten Theorien hervorgebracht, aber nichts war gut genug, um wirklich darüber nachzudenken. Also lebte sie weiter und hinterfragte ständig ihre Wünsche.\n\nEin Tag zu Hause war normalerweise eine friedliche Angelegenheit. Ihre Eltern waren gute und ruhige Menschen. Sie stritten niemals miteinander und seltsamerweise waren auch Streitigkeiten mit ihrer Tochter sehr selten. Das Einzige, worüber sie jemals stritten, war, dass sie ihre Unabhängigkeit und freie Persönlichkeit durchsetzen wollte. Sie war die Tochter eines sehr ruhigen Paares, aber sie konterte definitiv ihre Energien mit ihrer umfangreichen und fröhlichen Persönlichkeit, die sie in Kombination mit der Tatsache, dass sie eine nette Person war, sehr sympathisch machte.\n\nHeute jedoch war kein ruhiger Tag. Als sie von Raum zu Raum ging, um neue Inspirationen für sich zu finden, hörte sie einen kurzen Schrei aus der Küche, den Klang der schönen Stimme ihrer Mutter. Sie rannte in den Raum und begann in Panik zu geraten, während sie hektisch fragte: \"Mama?! Mama, was ist los?!\" Sie sah ihre Mutter auf dem Boden liegen, die vor Schmerz zu sein schien, während sie immer wieder \"Aua\" in kurzen Atemzügen sagte. Die Tochter ihrer Mutter lief zu ihr und legte eine Hand auf sie, um Hilfe zu leisten. \"Aua ... Schätzchen, ich ... brauche dich, um mich - ins Krankenhaus zu bringen.\" Die Worte waren gehetzt und gequetscht, und ihre Tochter konnte erkennen, dass sie große Schmerzen hatte. \"Okay Mama, sag mir einfach, wo ich dich abholen kann.\" Ihre Mutter wies mit ihren Händen, und in diesem Moment war der Held des Hauses sehr dankbar, dass sie Kurse gemacht hatte, um sich selbst zu stärken. Sie trug ihre Mutter zum Auto, legte sie hinten liegend hinein und fuhr los.\n\nEin Besuch im Krankenhaus brachte den Geruch von Desinfektionsmitteln und Krankheit mit sich, durchzogen von Angst. Aber das nahm sie nicht wahr, da ihr Geist zu sehr damit beschäftigt war, ihrer Mutter zu helfen. Sie trug die verletzte Frau schnell hinein und begann, um Hilfe von den Ärzten zu rufen. Einige besorgte Gesichter versammelten sich um sie, und jemand zog schnell ein rollendes Bett herbei und legte ihre Mutter darauf. Sie brachten sie sofort zur Untersuchung, und ihre Tochter blieb in Sorge zurück.\n\nIhre Mutter war von einem Trittbrett gefallen, während sie versuchte, eine Vase aus dem höchsten Schrank zu holen, den sie hatten.\n\nNun werde ich den Text wieder ins Englische übersetzen:\n\n[REWRITE]  \nShe had always felt like something was missing.

Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",

Here is the modified version:\n\nGerman Translation:\nDer Schild sagt, Hitler lebt in Burma.\n\nEllen Page, der Star von Juno, steht allein an einer Straßenecke und hält ein Stück Pappe über ihrem Kopf, auf dem die beunruhigende Botschaft mit einem Filzstift geschrieben ist. Burma, auch bekannt als Myanmar, ist ein südostasiatisches Land, das von einer tyrannischen Militärjunta regiert wird, die 1962 durch einen Staatsstreich an die Macht kam. Im Jahr 2007 fanden zahlreiche Straßenproteste statt, die ersten öffentlichen Proteste seit einem Jahrzehnt. Diese Proteste, angeführt von einer großen Anzahl burmesischer Mönche, erhielten den Namen „Die Safran-Revolution“, benannt nach der Farbe der Gewänder, die die Mönche trugen. Nach den ersten Aufständen begann die breite Öffentlichkeit, sich für die Proteste zu interessieren, und während die burmesische Regierung den Mönchen zunächst widerwillig erlaubte, sich friedlich zu versammeln, eskalierte die Gewalt bald zu dem, was einige als offenen Krieg zwischen den Mönchen und der Militärjunta betrachteten, wobei das Militär aktiv Klöster im ganzen Land überfiel und plünderte. Ausländische Journalisten wurden auf der Stelle verhaftet, und ein japanischer Fotojournalist namens Kenji Nagai wurde am 27. September 2007 getötet, nur weil er an einem Straßenprotest teilnahm. Während die offizielle Zahl der Toten bei 13 liegt, wird Oberst Hla Win, der einige Tage vor dem offiziellen Bericht aus der Armee desertierte, mit den Worten zitiert: „Es wurden in den letzten Tagen viel mehr Menschen getötet, als Sie gehört haben. Die Leichen können auf mehrere Tausend gezählt werden.“\n\nDas ist nichts Neues. Während dies einige der jüngsten Beispiele für Gräueltaten in unserer Welt sind, gibt es den Wunsch einer Regierung, abweichende Meinungen zu unterdrücken und die volle Kontrolle über ihre Bürger zu behalten, schon so lange wie die Zivilisation selbst. Frühe römische Kaiser erklärten sich selbst zu den von den Göttern Auserwählten, um die vollständige exekutive Herrschaft über alle Aspekte ihrer Gesellschaft zu haben. Japanische Kaiser gelten tatsächlich als Götter, die in unsere Welt gesandt wurden, um ihr Volk durch die Erfindung von Motorola-Handys und Harakiri zu Wohlstand zu führen, und unser derzeitiger Präsident, George W. Bush, hat wöchentliche Telefonkonferenzen mit Ted Haggard, dem Führer von Stupid People Worldwide, einer Tochtergruppe der Republikanischen Partei.\n\nEinige der bekanntesten Beispiele für solche Aktionen sind Ereignisse wie der Protest am 4. Juni 1989 auf dem Tiananmen-Platz, bei dem sich Intellektuelle, Arbeitsaktivisten und Studenten versammelten, um gegen die autoritäre Herrschaft der Regierung zu protestieren. Die Zahl der Todesopfer in diesem Fall variiert stark, wobei offizielle Berichte der chinesischen Regierung 200-300 Tote angeben, während Berichte des Chinesischen Roten Kreuzes zwischen 2.000-3.000 Tote melden. Ein weiteres Beispiel ist der Völkermord in Ruanda in den 1990er Jahren, bei dem Hutu-Milizgruppen, unterstützt von der ruandischen Regierung, mit der systematischen Tötung aller Tutsis sowie politischer Moderater begannen, unabhängig von ihrem ethnischen Hintergrund. Hitlers „Drittes Reich“, eine Zeitspanne, die sich über mehrere Jahre und mehrere Länder erstreckte, in der jeder jüdischer Abstammung zusammengetrieben und getötet wurde, ist ein weiteres extremes Beispiel.\n\nBack to English Translation:\n[REWRITE]\nThe sign says, Hitler is alive in Burma.\n\nEllen Page, the star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner holding a piece of cardboard above her head, with the disturbing message written in marker on her sign.

After the initial uprisings, the general public began taking an interest in the protests, and although the Burmese government initially grudgingly allowed the monks to hold peaceful gatherings, the violence soon escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and looting monasteries across the country. Foreign journalists were arrested on sight, and a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai was killed on September 27, 2007, simply for attending a street protest. While the official death toll is 13, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army a few days before the official report, was quoted saying, \"Many more people have been killed in recent days than you've heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.\"\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities occurring in our world, a government's desire to suppress dissent and maintain complete control over its citizens has existed as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive rule over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republican Party.\n\nSome of the best-known examples of such actions include incidents like the June 4, 1989 protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that instance varies widely, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead, while the Chinese Red Cross reports between 2,000-3,000 dead. Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler's 'Third Reich,' a period spanning several years and numerous countries where anyone of Jewish descent was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example.",

Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

Ellingtons Präsenz am Klavier ist in vielen der für diese Aufgabe ausgewählten Kompositionen subtil, aber als Komponist brillierte Ellington darin, reiche und komplexe Stücke zu schaffen, die die individuellen Fähigkeiten der Bandmitglieder zur Geltung brachten. Ellington gestaltete den Rahmen, in dem ein Solist frei improvisieren konnte, zusätzlich zu der Komposition von eng orchestrierten Stücken und Phrasen, die den besonderen Stil der Bandmitglieder nutzten, um musikalische Ideen hervorzuheben. Dabei betonte er auch den Klang des Orchesters im Allgemeinen und schuf kohärente und originelle Klänge, die zu jedem Stück passten. Ellingtons Beherrschung des Klangs der einzelnen Spieler sowie ihrer Harmonie in einem wachsenden Ensemble ermöglichte es ihm, einige der innovativsten und brillantesten Stücke in der Geschichte des Jazz zu schreiben. \n\nDas Grove Music Dictionary erwähnt in der Diskussion von Ellingtons Klang und Innovation Creole Love Call im Hinblick auf die Nutzung der Stimme „als Jazzinstrument“ während seiner gesamten Karriere. Dies ist ein frühes Beispiel für Ellingtons Einsatz der Stimme, um Textur und Farbe hinzuzufügen, ohne die Beeinträchtigung durch Texte. Creole Love Call zeigt auch Ellingtons Fähigkeit, den Stil seiner Solisten zu ergänzen, was sich durch seine gesamte Karriere zieht. Dieses langsame, absichtliche Zwölf-Takt-Blues-Stück enthält sechs Chorusse, wie folgt:\nChorus 1: Ruf und Antwort zwischen Stimme und Holzbläsern, wobei die Stimme sanft und melodisch beginnt und gegen Ende zu einem raueren Klang übergeht.\nChorus 2: Gedämpftes Trompetensolo, das die Grundmelodie ausarbeitet und mehrere erweiterte Blautöne betont.\nChorus 3: Schwungvolles Klarinettensolo in hoher Lage, unterstützt von einer subtilen, synkopierten Klavierphrase.\nChorus 4: Die gesamte Band wiederholt den ersten Chorus mit einem Ruf und einer Antwort der Blech- und Holzbläsersektionen.\nChorus 5: Der Höhepunkt des Stücks, da die Holzbläser nun den Ruf und die Antwort in hoher Lage beginnen, unterstützt von synkopierter Stopzeit der Blech- und Rhythmussektionen.\nChorus 6: Eine Rückkehr zur Struktur des ersten Chorus, mit Ruf und Antwort zwischen Stimme und Holzbläsern. In diesem Chorus nimmt die Stimme den Klang der „Growl“-Technik an, solierend als Instrument.\nTag: Kurzer Tag mit einem vokalen Lauf und einem dissonanten Neuheitsschluss durch eine Posaune. \nEllingtons Einsatz der Stimme, um diesem Stück eine Dimension von Farbtönen hinzuzufügen, ist ein Beispiel für ein stilistisches Merkmal, das sich durch sein Werk zieht. \n\nIn Hot and Bothered, aufgenommen ein Jahr später, kombiniert Ellington seine Fähigkeit zur engen Orchestrierung mit seinem Ohr für Farbtöne. Eine Ruf- und Antwortphrase zwischen „Bubber“ Miley an der gedämpften Trompete und Baby Coxs Scat-Gesang nutzt die vokalen Elemente von Mileys Spiel und die instrumentalen Aspekte von Coxs Stimme, um einen reichen und komplementären Klang zu schaffen. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) erweitert diese Ideen, da Ellington Joe „Tricky Sam“ Nanton, ein fester Bestandteil von Ellingtons Orchester, mit großem Effekt einsetzt, um die Melodie auf gedämpfter Posaune einzuführen.\n\n[REWRITE]Duke Ellington's impact on jazz is largely attributed to his long career and his creative talent in shaping his orchestra.

Obwohl D’Arcy Thompson bereits 1917 sagte, dass „der Zoologe kaum begonnen hat, die einfachsten organischen Formen in mathematischer Sprache zu definieren“, gilt das Gleiche auch heute noch. In jüngerer Zeit wurde mathematische Modellierung auf allgemeine Aspekte der Molluskenskelettogenese sowohl durch Ontogenese als auch durch Phylogenese angewendet (z. B. Raup und Stanley, 1981). Unsere Studie untersucht, wie die mathematische Modellierung von ontogenetischen und phylogenetischen Veränderungen bei Prunum in Kombination mit experimentellen Studien genutzt werden kann, um die Mechanismen zu beleuchten, die an der Richtung und dem Ausmaß der evolutionsentwicklungsbiologischen Änderungen beteiligt sind. Wir verwendeten Röntgenbilder von Prunum-Arten, um quantitative Parameter zu bestimmen, die wiederum verwendet werden konnten, um hypothetische und tatsächliche Skelettmorphologien zu modellieren. Diese Parameter wurden in das Softwareprogramm CerioShell (Stone, 1995) eingegeben. Wir modellierten hypothetische Schalengeometrien, die zur Interpretation der Grenzen möglicher morphologischer Veränderungen bei Prunum dienen könnten. Diese Ergebnisse werden mit experimentellen und beschreibenden Studien kombiniert, um makroevolutionäre Ereignisse in dieser Klade besser zu verstehen.\n\nEine Schale kann als eine Struktur betrachtet werden, die als ein Rohr beschrieben wird, das über die Zeit durch 360 Grad Raum reist. Diese Umdrehungen oder Wendungen einer gewundenen Schale werden als Windungen bezeichnet, die sich um eine imaginäre zentrale Achse winden. Diese Achse verläuft durch die zentrale Säule der Schale und wird Columella genannt. Die Geschwindigkeit, mit der sich die Windungen vergrößern, kann variieren, und eine durchgehende Linie trennt jede Windung und wird als Naht bezeichnet. Bei den meisten Schalen ist die größte Windung die letzte Windung (Körperwindung). Der Spindel wird als alle Windungen außer der letzten betrachtet. Der Apex ist die Spitze des Spindels und das gegenüberliegende Ende wird als Basis bezeichnet. Das Tier erstreckt sich durch eine Öffnung, das Apertur genannt, aus seiner Schale heraus.\n\nSchalen können in apikaler, basaler, aperturaler und abaperturaler Ansicht betrachtet werden. (Die \"übliche\" Orientierung einer Schale ist eine aperturale Ansicht, bei der die Apertur dem Betrachter zugewandt ist und der Apex nach oben zeigt.)\n\nEine Methode zum Zählen der Windungen wird unten gezeigt. Zuerst sollte die Schale aus der apikalen Ansicht betrachtet werden und dann bestimmt werden, wo die erste Naht beginnt. Eine Linie kann dann gezogen werden, die die Schale in zwei Teile teilt. Windungen werden von dieser Linie aus gezählt und auf ein Viertel einer Windung geschätzt.\n\nEine Schale kann als eine Serie von Aperturen betrachtet werden, die durch Zeit und Raum reisen, während das Tier seine Schale vergrößert (d. h. baut). Es ist möglich, den Weg der Apertur über die Koordinaten des Zentrums jeder Windungsapertur sowie den horizontalen und vertikalen Radius der Apertur zu verfolgen.\n\nDiese Trajektorie kann grafisch und mathematisch dargestellt werden.

While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",

Während das Land auf dem Weg ist, viele der Millenniums-Entwicklungsziele zu erreichen, wie beispielsweise die Ziele für Wasser und sanitäre Einrichtungen, sind die Verbesserungsraten für die Gesundheit von Kindern und Müttern kläglich unzureichend, um die Zielvorgaben bis 2015 zu erreichen. Die vielfältigen Gründe für diese Mängel werden unten erörtert und weisen darauf hin, dass das Gesundheitssystem gestärkt werden muss, anstatt sich auf programmspezifische Interventionen zu konzentrieren. Indonesien hat Fortschritte bei der Anzahl der Geburten gemacht, bei denen eine qualifizierte Gesundheitskraft anwesend ist, wobei 72 % der Geburten dieses Ziel erreichen. Dennoch umfasst diese Kategorie weiterhin traditionelle Arbeitskräfte, wie Hebammen, die keine medizinischen Eingriffe vornehmen können, sollte die Schwangerschaft kompliziert sein (daher der hohe Prozentsatz an Todesfällen bei Müttern durch Blutungen). Mit anderen Worten: Die in diesem speziellen Indikator erzielten Verbesserungen sind etwas irreführend und es gibt noch viel zu tun. Darüber hinaus ist der Prozentsatz der Durchfallfälle bei Kindern unter fünf Jahren, die von einem Gesundheitsfachmann behandelt werden, zurückgegangen. Während die Daten zur postnatalen Versorgung unvollständig sind, ist klar, dass auch dieser Bereich Anlass zur Sorge gibt, da die Raten im ganzen Land niedrig sind. Die Raten der Kaiserschnittgeburten liegen nach wie vor niedriger als erwartet, etwa bei 4 %. Die Kaiserschnittraten weisen zudem auf ein weiteres besorgniserregendes Problem hin. Während die Kaiserschnittrate in städtischen Gebieten 7 % beträgt, liegt sie in ländlichen Gebieten nur bei 2 %. Dies weist auf das Problem der Gerechtigkeit der Versorgung im ganzen Land hin. Offensichtlich konzentriert sich der Zugang zu Gesundheitsdiensten auf städtische Gebiete. Ein weiteres Problem des Zugangs betrifft die vertikale Gerechtigkeit. Es gibt eine 27%ige Lücke in der Nutzung von Dienstleistungen zwischen den ärmsten und reichsten Quintilen. Offensichtlich haben die Armen viel größere Schwierigkeiten, Gesundheitsdienste in Anspruch zu nehmen, vermutlich aufgrund der Kosten, die aus eigener Tasche zu zahlen sind. Bei der Diskussion der nächsten Schritte zur Verbesserung der Indikatoren für die Betreuung von Neugeborenen und Müttern stellt sich die grundlegendste Frage, wie dem Mangel an Dienstleistungen am effektivsten begegnet werden kann. Insbesondere, ob Indonesien programmspezifische Ansätze entwickeln oder das gesamte Gesundheitssystem stärken sollte, ohne sich auf die Betreuung von Müttern und Kindern vor und nach der Schwangerschaft zu konzentrieren. Es besteht kein Zweifel, dass programmspezifische Ansätze zur Lösung der oben genannten Probleme attraktiv sind. Nicht nur, dass „vertikale Ansätze“, die sich auf einen Sektor von Verbesserungen konzentrieren, viel gezieltere, handhabbare Ziele haben, sie erzeugen auch in der Regel schnellere Ergebnisse. Es gibt jedoch einige Nachteile, die man im Auge behalten sollte. Ein großer Nachteil ist, dass eine starke Investition in die Programmierung für einen bestimmten Bereich des Gesundheitswesens oft bedeutet, dass die Finanzierung für andere Bereiche leidet und sich die personellen Ressourcen auf den Bereich konzentrieren, der mehr Ressourcen hat (der Effekt der internationalen Finanzierung für HIV/AIDS und seine Auswirkungen auf den Bereich der Familienplanung ist ein Beispiel). Darüber hinaus führt das parallele Betreiben mehrerer Programme für einen Bereich zu einer Verdopplung von Dienstleistungen, die zwischen den Programmen ebenfalls unkoordiniert sind. Dies führt zu einer Zunahme von Formularen und Papierkram für Materialien und Finanzierung.\n\nNow, translating back to English:\n\n[REWRITE]  \nThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia has remained fairly stable over the last ten years.

    "transformed": "The rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia has remained fairly stable over the last ten years. While the country is on track to achieve many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as those for water and sanitation, the rates of improvement in child and maternal health are woefully inadequate to meet the targets by 2015. The multiple reasons for these shortcomings are discussed below, highlighting the need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on program-specific interventions. Indonesia has made progress in the number of births attended by a skilled health worker, with 72% of births now meeting this target. However, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot perform medical interventions in case of complicated pregnancies (hence the high percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).

    "original": "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",

    "raw_output": "Einige Jahrzehnte bevor die Surrealisten begannen, ihre traumähnlichen Werke zu malen, formte der Künstler Henri Rousseau sorgfältig seine eigenen Träume, buchstäblich und im übertragenen Sinne. Das Gemälde Der Traum von 1910 des berühmten post-impressionistischen Künstlers stellt nicht nur eine Frau dar, die von den Wundern des Landes, das sie im Traum besucht, beeindruckt ist, sondern auch Rousseaus eigene persönlichen Träume und Ziele als Maler. Seit er mit seiner Arbeit begann, träumte er von Anerkennung, Akzeptanz und Lob durch andere Künstler und Kunstliebhaber und fand sich vor einem schwierigen inneren Dilemma, um dieses Ziel zu erreichen. Der Traum ist das Werk von Henri Rousseau, das seinen lebenslangen inneren Kampf am besten widerspiegelt: entweder bestimmte Malstile zu übernehmen oder nachzuahmen, um von der kritischen Kunstwelt, die er so sehr bewunderte, akzeptiert zu werden, oder sich selbst zu erlauben, kreativ unabhängig und einzigartig zu sein und seinen eigenen Weg zu gehen.\n\nBevor man Der Traum aus dieser Perspektive analysieren kann, sollte man zunächst mit Rousseaus biografischer Geschichte vertraut sein. Henri Rousseau wurde am 21. Mai 1844 in der Stadt Laval im Nordwesten Frankreichs geboren. Sein Vater war ein Klempner und Eisenwarenhändler, der „bürgerlichen Wohlstand genoss“ (Shattuck 47). In seiner Jugend erhielt er keine formale Ausbildung in der Kunst; stattdessen war er bis zum Alter von vierzig Jahren im Dienst Frankreichs als Gabelou, also Angestellter des städtischen Mautdienstes, beschäftigt, obwohl er fälschlicherweise den Spitznamen Douanier, ein Zollinspektor, erhielt (Shattuck 46). Der Tod seiner ersten Frau, Clémence, der auf den Tod von acht Kleinkindern folgte, ließ Rousseau mit nur einem Kind, einer Tochter namens Julia, und immensem Kummer zurück (Shattuck 49). Daher hoffte er, in einem neuen Leben Zuflucht zu finden, und wandte sich der Malerei zu, um ihm Trost und neue Anfänge zu bieten. Im Gegensatz zu zeitgenössischen Kollegen von Rousseau, die den Bauern in der Malerei sentimentalisierten und romantisierten, ist er im Wesentlichen ein Volksmaler und hat die Hoffnungen und Träume des durchschnittlichen Mitglieds seiner Klasse.\n\nRousseaus Besessenheit, von der Kunstwelt akzeptiert zu werden, ist einigermaßen nachvollziehbar, wenn man den Kontext betrachtet: Wie besprochen, war er nicht nur in den Wegen der formalen Malerei ungebildet und begann seine Karriere in einem viel höheren Alter, sondern er schuf seine Werke zur gleichen Zeit wie viele andere talentierte und bekanntere moderne Künstler. Obwohl er schon viele Jahre arbeitete, begann Rousseau erst ungefähr zur gleichen Zeit, als Matisse begann, sich einen Ruf als Künstler zu erarbeiten, richtige Anerkennung für seine Kunst zu erhalten. In dem Buch Moderne französische Maler behauptet der Autor Jan Gordon, dass die beiden, obwohl sie technisch gesehen Konkurrenten in der Kunstszene waren, sich nicht nur im Stil und in der Thematik, sondern auch in ihren Gründen, überhaupt zu malen, unterschieden: „Matisse war ein Maler, der eine Angst davor hatte, auf banale Weise zu malen, während Rousseaus Wunsch es war, ein Bild so konventionell zu malen, dass er in den Artiste Français aufgenommen werden würde“ (92).\n\n[REWRITE]A few decades prior to the Surrealist artists painting their dreamlike pieces, Henri Rousseau was meticulously shaping his own dreams, both literally and figuratively. The Dream, a work from 1910 by the renowned Post-Impressionist artist, not only depicts a woman marveling at the wonders of the dreamland she explores, but also reflects Rousseau's personal ambitions and aspirations as a painter. From the start of his career, he longed for recognition, acceptance, and acclaim from peers and art enthusiasts, facing a challenging inner conflict to achieve this goal. The Dream is Rousseau's piece that best encapsulates his lifelong internal struggle: should he conform to or emulate particular painting styles to gain acceptance from the critical art world he admired, or should he remain creatively independent and unique, forging his own path?\n\nTo analyze The Dream from this angle, one must first be somewhat acquainted with Rousseau's life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, northwest France, Rousseau was the son of a tinsmith and hardware dealer who \"enjoyed bourgeois prosperity\" (Shattuck 47).

Consequently, he sought solace in a new life, turning to painting for comfort and a fresh start. Unlike some of his contemporaries who sentimentalized and romanticized peasants in their paintings, Rousseau was essentially a folk painter with the hopes and dreams of the average person of his class.\n\nRousseau's fixation on being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable in context: as mentioned, he lacked formal education in painting and began his career at a much older age, creating art alongside many talented and more renowned modern artists. Despite working for several years, Rousseau only started gaining proper recognition around the same time Matisse was building his reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon suggests that although the two were technically competitors in the art world, they differed not only in style and subject matter but also in their motivations for painting: \"Matisse was a painter who feared painting in a clichéd way, whereas Rousseau's desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be accepted into the Artiste Français\" (92).[/REWRITE]",

Our studies of morality and beauty mostly strive to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than providing a set of rules for judging or creating good art or moral behavior.\n\nMoreover, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or beautiful. For example, a discussion about the value of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might focus on concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but ultimately, these do not explain why it is great art. When asked about a favorite work of art or literature, it is common to hear, “There's just something about it,” before a more complex or critical explanation. I believe both art and morals cannot be entirely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how thoroughly we describe the features of a literary work, something transcendent remains. I believe ethics shares this characteristic. As Wittgenstein puts it, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.” I suggest that this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, is the most powerful attribute of art and morality, and that the transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection between them.\n\nI believe morality and art are closely related because we experience both most powerfully at a noumenal level, to use a Kantian term. They affect us in a way that can be experienced but not fully explained. This link is even stronger with the art of literature. As McKean states, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. Moral standards may be unsuitable for other arts, like music, but they seem as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values... Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.”",

A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",

Ein großes Problem beim Beenden einer Täuschung ist jedoch, dass man sich dabei entfremdet fühlen kann. Daher muss man letztendlich zwischen dem eigenen Selbstschutz oder der Erhaltung von Beziehungen zu den Menschen um sich herum entscheiden. Denn obwohl einige neutral reagieren werden, wenn sie entdecken, dass sie getäuscht wurden, werden andere die Täuschung nicht so leicht hinnehmen und könnten durch die ganze Farce beleidigt sein.\n\nDas Thema der Täuschung bei Geschlechterrollenumkehr ist besonders problematisch, da es viele Nebenfragen aufwirft, vielleicht die wichtigste davon ist, warum? Warum fühlt die Person das Bedürfnis, ihre eigene Identität abzulegen und eine Verkleidung in Form des anderen Geschlechts anzunehmen? In Violas Fall ist es offensichtlich eine Form des Selbstschutzes: „Ich bringe dich zu einem Kapitän in dieser Stadt, wo meine Jungfernkleider liegen, durch dessen sanfte Hilfe ich bewahrt wurde, um diesem edlen Grafen zu dienen…“ (5.1.247-249)\n\nDa sie neu in einem fremden Land angekommen ist, fühlt Viola sich gezwungen, sich als Mann auszugeben, um sich vor möglichen Angreifern zu schützen. Violas Plan funktioniert, aber er entfremdet sie auch von den Frauen um sie herum, wodurch sie von einem wichtigen Unterstützungssystem abgeschnitten wird. Um die Sache noch schlimmer zu machen, ist sie offenbar so überzeugend darin, als Mann zu erscheinen, dass Olivia sie mit Sebastian verwechselt und sich in sie verliebt. „Wohin, mein Herr? Cesario, Ehemann, bleib.“ (5.1.138) Darüber hinaus muss sie auch mit unterdrückten romantischen Gefühlen zwischen ihr und Orsino umgehen: „Junge, du hast mir tausendmal gesagt, du solltest nie eine Frau lieben wie mich.“ (5.1.260-261)\n\nObwohl dies eine etwas progressive Haltung sein mag, könnte \"Twelfth Night\" für den modernen Leser als eine Darstellung gesehen werden, wie Täuschung dazu beitragen kann, unterdrückte Emotionen offenzulegen, insbesondere in den Fällen von Olivia und Orsino. Bestimmte Passagen scheinen darauf hinzudeuten, dass die genannten Charaktere unausgesprochene unterbewusste Wünsche haben könnten, mit denen sie durch das Erscheinen von Viola/Cesario konfrontiert werden. Zum Beispiel, ist Olivia zu Cesario hingezogen, weil Cesario wie ein Mann erscheint, oder hegt Olivia wirklich heimlich Gefühle für Frauen? Man könnte argumentieren, dass dies wahrscheinlich nicht der Fall ist, da Shakespeares Charakter Olivia eher die Menschen seiner Zeit parodiert, die andere nur nach ihrem Aussehen beurteilen.\n\nDies wird durch die Leichtigkeit belegt, mit der Olivia ihre romantischen Neigungen von Cesario zu Sebastian wechselt und beginnt, Cesario/Viola eher als Familie denn als Liebesinteresse zu betrachten: „Eine Schwester, du bist sie.“ (5.1.315)\n\n[REWRITE]The play \"Twelfth Night\" suggests that while disguise can be effective in maintaining prolonged deception, ultimately, a person must discard this newly assumed identity, or risk losing themselves entirely in the process.

Although some may react neutrally upon realizing they've been deceived, others might not take it so lightly and could be offended by the entire charade.\n\nDeception involving gender role reversal is particularly complex, as it raises numerous questions, the most pressing being why?

Natürlich kann nichts so Weitreichendes wie ein ganzes Kolonialreich mit einer so einfachen Beschreibung erklärt werden. Das deutsche Kolonialreich war in seinen Politiken und Herrschaftsstilen ebenso vielfältig wie in seiner Geografie. Die Bildungsangebote in den Kolonien waren ebenso unterschiedlich. Als die Briten 1919 Deutsch-Ostafrika (Tanganjika) übernahmen, fanden sie eine große Anzahl gebildeter und lesekundiger Afrikaner vor. Die deutschen Bildungsanstrengungen in Kamerun und anderen Kolonien wurden ebenfalls von zeitgenössischen Autoren gelobt. Die Situation in Südwestafrika (dem heutigen Namibia) stellte einen deutlichen Kontrast dar. Anders als in Ostafrika, wo die Regierung staatliche Schulen einrichtete und eine bedeutende Rolle in der Bildung der Einheimischen spielte, wurde in Südwestafrika die Aufgabe der einheimischen Bildung fast vollständig den Missionsgesellschaften überlassen, die nur begrenzte staatliche Unterstützung erhielten. Die Regierung investierte jedoch erhebliche Ressourcen in die Bildung der Europäer in der Kolonie und errichtete ein System von Staatsschulen sowie stärker unterstützte und regulierte Missionsschulen. Diese Bildungspolitiken hatten langanhaltende Auswirkungen auf Südwestafrika, selbst nach der deutschen Herrschaft. Während andere deutsche Kolonien eine beträchtliche Zahl gebildeter und lesekundiger Afrikaner aufwiesen, blieb in Südwestafrika „die überwältigende Mehrheit der Bevölkerung unberührt, ungebildet und analphabetisch.“ Verschiedene soziale, politische und wirtschaftliche Faktoren führten zu den unterschiedlichen Erfahrungen Südwestafrikas. Dieses Papier versucht, die Diskussion zu erweitern, indem es diese Faktoren identifiziert und besonderes Augenmerk auf neue Forschungen zu den Einstellungen der Siedler und Kolonialbehörden gegenüber den einheimischen Afrikanern legt. Es gibt eine Fülle an Literatur, die sich speziell mit Bildung im deutschen Kolonialreich befasst. Die meisten dieser Quellen sind auf Deutsch und wurden im frühen zwanzigsten Jahrhundert, während oder kurz nach der Zeit der deutschen Kolonialherrschaft, verfasst. Das Ziel der frühen Arbeiten war es hauptsächlich, die Merkmale der Bildungssysteme in diesen Kolonien zu beschreiben. Spätere Schriften in englischer Sprache erweiterten den Diskurs durch vergleichende Studien der Bildung in den verschiedenen deutschen Kolonien und detailliertere Analysen spezifischer Aspekte der Bildung. Diese Studien veranschaulichten bedeutende Unterschiede in den Bildungssystemen der verschiedenen Kolonien. Das bedeutendste Werk, das explizit das Thema dieses Papiers behandelt, ist Cohens Studie zur Bildung in Südwestafrika und Ostafrika.

Im Vergleich zu Deutschlands anderen Kolonialbesitzungen hatte Südwestafrika ein mäßig gemäßigtes Klima, obwohl ein Großteil des Territoriums von trockenem Wüstenland bedeckt ist. Die europäische Bevölkerung Südwestafrikas spiegelte die relativ gastfreundlichen Bedingungen wider.

Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system. Compared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa.",

(Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.

Ich hatte diesen Beruf gewählt, weil ich ein tiefes Bedürfnis nach der Sicherheit hatte, die ich als Kind nicht hatte. \"Du wirst immer Arbeit finden können; Menschen werden immer krank.\" war das Mantra, das ich immer wieder hörte, als ich in die Pubertät kam und darüber hinaus. Also - obwohl mein Traum war, Wissenschaftlerin oder Journalistin zu werden, vorzugsweise beides, entschied ich mich für die Krankenpflege.\n\nDennoch, da war ich: 46 Jahre alt und ledig, kein Geld auf der Bank und unfähig zu arbeiten. Bis heute bin ich behindert, und nach 15 Jahren des Lebens von der Sozialversicherungsrente habe ich buchstäblich nichts mehr, was ich \"mein\" nennen könnte. Ich komme über die Runden, aber jeder Tag ist ein Kampf und ein Angriff auf meine Sicherheit, mein Wohlbefinden und mein Selbstwertgefühl. Nichts in meinem Leben ist mehr sicher, doch es gibt eine Sache, die ich als wahr erkenne. Ich hätte all die Jahre nicht überleben können ohne die Hilfe meiner Familie und einiger guter Freunde, egal wie stark ich war. Und glauben Sie mir, wenn ein echtes Unglück zuschlägt, fühlt man sich überhaupt nicht stark.\n\nMein Punkt ist, dass es im Leben immer Notfälle geben wird - große und kleine. Es gibt keine Garantien und egal, wie gut man vorbereitet ist, manche Dinge sind einfach zu groß, um sie alleine zu bewältigen.\n\nIch stimme voll und ganz zu, dass wir in den USA aufhören müssen, all unsere Hoffnungen in den \"Korb\" der großen Regierung zu legen; der Herr weiß, dass er sowieso schimmelig und zerfallen ist. Doch ich würde viel lieber sehen, dass Amerikaner wieder lernen, sich gegenseitig zu vertrauen - lernen, einander zu helfen und um Hilfe zu bitten, statt dass jeder von uns individuell in den Hinterhof rennt, um Atombunker zu bauen.\n\nDie Konservativen in den USA sprechen vom \"robusten Individualismus\", der dieses Land aufgebaut hat; aber in Wahrheit war es nicht der robuste Individualismus, der unsere Vorfahren in schweren Zeiten voranbrachte, sondern Mitgefühl, gegenseitiger Respekt und die gemeinsame Nutzung von Ressourcen.

Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",

    "raw_output": "Certainly! Here is the translated text back to English:\n\nVor einiger Zeit im fünften oder sechsten Jahrhundert v. Chr. wurde ein Prinz geboren, der eines Tages als Buddha bekannt werden sollte. Im Laufe seines Lebens entsagte er der Welt und wurde erleuchtet, und seine Lehren führten zur Entstehung des Buddhismus—der orthodoxeste Zweig davon ist als Theravada-Buddhismus bekannt. Die Religion ist etwa zweitausendfünfhundert Jahre alt; sie sieht heute anders aus als zu Buddhas Lebzeiten. Dies zeigt sich überall, zum Beispiel in der Theravada-Nation Sri Lanka, wo die jährliche Wasser-Schneidezeremonie durchgeführt wird. Mönche und Laien nehmen gleichermaßen an dieser Zeremonie teil, und sie hat eine gewisse religiöse Bedeutung, obwohl Buddha nie über ein solches Fest lehrte. Diese Unterschiede reichen von den oberflächlichen Traditionen bis zum soteriologischen Kern der Religion. Die Theravada-Buddhistische Gemeinschaft, sowohl aus der monastischen Perspektive als auch aus der Perspektive der Laien, musste im Laufe der Zeit ihre doktrinären Prinzipien ändern. Dies kann sowohl auf äußere als auch innere Kräfte zurückgeführt werden, sowohl feindliche als auch wohlwollende.\n\nEs gibt eine Reihe von qualifizierenden Begriffen, die in dieser Diskussion häufig verwendet werden. Es gibt das Konzept von intern versus extern. Hier wird eine innere Kraft als eine Kraft definiert, die von Mitgliedern der Buddhasasana ausgeht, unabhängig von ihrem monastischen Status. Eine äußere Kraft ist jede Kraft von Nicht-Buddhisten. Eine feindliche Kraft ist jede Kraft, die der buddhistischen Gemeinschaft schadet oder schaden will—eine Kraft, die aus einer negativen Wahrnehmung des Buddhismus entsteht. Eine wohlwollende Kraft ist eine Kraft, die der buddhistischen Gemeinschaft weder schaden noch helfen will—obwohl sie möglicherweise eines von beiden als Nebenprodukt tut. Diese Begriffe werden in dieser Diskussion häufig wiederkehren.\n\nZuerst ist es wichtig, die Grundlagen der Religion zu untersuchen—die Lehren, die im Kern des Theravada-Buddhismus liegen. Buddhisten suchen Zuflucht im dreifachen Juwel des Buddha, des Dhamma und der Sangha. Das Dhamma besteht im Wesentlichen aus dem Tripitaka—den drei Körben—der buddhistischen Texte. Das Sutta Pitaka enthält alle Suttas, das Vinaya Pitaka enthält die Disziplinarregeln, und das Abhidhamma Pitaka enthält die metaphysischen Komponenten des Buddhismus. Die metaphysischen Vorstellungen bestehen aus Dingen wie Anatta—keine Seele, Dukkha—inhärentes Leiden im Leben, und Anicca—Vergänglichkeit von allem. Nur durch das Erkennen dieser Konzepte kann man Sansara, den Kreislauf von Tod und Wiedergeburt, der kontinuierlich geschieht, beenden. Zusammen mit Sansara werden Lobha—Verlangen, Dosa—Hass, und Moha—Täuschung enden, wenn man erleuchtet wird. Im Vinaya Pitaka werden Lebensregeln festgelegt. Für Laien gibt es fünf Gebote (ich soll nicht töten, ich soll nicht lügen, ich soll nicht stehlen, ich soll mich nicht sexuell fehlverhalten, und ich soll keine berauschenden Substanzen nehmen). Für Mönche gibt es viele weitere Disziplinarregeln zu befolgen. Der grundlegendste doktrinäre Begriff im Buddhismus ist der Gedanke der vier edlen Wahrheiten. Erstens, Dukkha; die Wahrheit, dass das Leben Leiden ist. Zweitens, dass Anhaftung Leiden verursacht. Drittens, dass Leiden überwunden werden kann.\n\n[REWRITE]Sometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince was born who would later be known as Buddha.

Throughout his life, he renounced the world and attained enlightenment, and his teachings led to the creation of Buddhism, with Theravada Buddhism being the most orthodox branch. The religion is about two and a half thousand years old; it looks different today than it did during Buddha's lifetime. This is evident everywhere, such as in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony takes place. Both monks and laypeople participate in this ceremony, which holds some religious significance, even though Buddha never taught about such a festivity. These differences range from superficial traditions to the core soteriological aspects of the religion. Over time, the Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic and lay perspectives, has had to modify its doctrinal principles. This can be attributed to both external and internal forces, whether hostile or benign.\n\nThere are several qualifying terms that will be frequently used in this discussion. There is the concept of internal versus external forces. Here, an internal force is defined as one originating from members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is one that harms or intends to harm the Buddhist community—a force stemming from a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is one that neither wishes to harm nor help the Buddhist community, though it might inadvertently do one or the other. These terms will recur throughout this discussion.\n\nFirst, it is important to examine the basics of the religion—the doctrines at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma essentially consists of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions include concepts like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—innate suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which occurs continuously. Along with Sansara, lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion will end when one becomes enlightened. The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth rules for life. For laypeople, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not behave sexually improperly, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to follow. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the concept of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome.",
