    "original": "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",

Werte, die ich in den Bereich der Sozialarbeit einbringen kann, sind unter anderem: Dienstleistung, Respekt, ethisches Verhalten, Engagement für die Verbesserung der Beziehungen zwischen Menschen und das Streben nach beruflicher Weiterentwicklung, um in meinem Fachgebiet kompetent zu bleiben. Diese Grundwerte sind nicht nur für Sozialarbeiter wichtig, sondern auch für mich persönlich. \n\nIch habe schon immer anderen helfen wollen, war mir aber unsicher, welchen Karriereweg ich einschlagen sollte. Während meiner Schul- und Studienzeit sah ich viele Personen, die vor ihren Problemen flüchteten und einige nutzten weniger geeignete Bewältigungsmechanismen. Aufgrund der Situationen, die ich miterlebt habe, entschied ich mich, einen Bachelor-Abschluss in Psychologie zu erwerben. Auch nach meinem Abschluss an der Piedmont College im Jahr 2009 war ich mir noch unsicher über meinen Karriereweg und entschloss mich, eine Pause einzulegen. Eines Tages im Sommer besuchte ich eine Freundin, die mir einen 16-jährigen Jungen vorstellte, der nervös auf ihrem Sofa saß. Sie erklärte mir, warum er sie besuchte: um seinen missbräuchlichen Eltern zu entfliehen. Am nächsten Tag erfuhr ich, dass er die Polizei zu den Wohnräumen seiner Eltern gerufen hatte. Um zu sehen, ob ich irgendwie helfen konnte, fuhr ich zu den Eltern. Dort erklärte ich den Beamten meine Bedenken und erwähnte, dass ich gerade meinen Abschluss in Psychologie an der Piedmont College erhalten hatte. Die Polizei bat mich, mit den Eltern zu sprechen, da sie dem Jugendlichen nichts rechtlich beibringen konnten. Als ich die Eltern auf die Situation ansprach, wirkten sie nervös und verwendeten Ausreden, um das \"manipulative\" Verhalten ihres Sohnes zu beschreiben, der externe Hilfequellen einbeziehen würde, um \"einfache\" Streitigkeiten zu lösen. Nach diesem Erlebnis begann ich ernsthaft darüber nachzudenken, eine Karriere in der Sozialarbeit zu verfolgen, um Kindern bei \"einfachen\" Konflikten innerhalb der Familie zu helfen. \n\nEin weiterer wichtiger Wert für den Bereich der Sozialarbeit ist soziale Gerechtigkeit. Als Gesellschaft behaupten wir, dass der Einzelne wichtig ist, und trauern um diejenigen, die wir verloren haben. Das Konzept des \"Einzelnen\", das die Gesellschaft vertritt, ist eher ein Anhänger altertümlicher Traditionen als ein aktives Einzigartiges. Wenn die Gesellschaft also um verlorene Einzelpersonen trauert, warum streben wir danach, uns allen gleich zu sein? Ich bin ein Individuum und genieße es nicht, mir Grenzen zu setzen, um mich anderen anzupassen. Während meiner Schul- und Studienzeit protestierte ich gegen soziale Ungerechtigkeit, wann immer es mir möglich war: färbte meine Haare in unnatürlichen Farben, trug Kleidung, die zu meiner Persönlichkeit passte, löcherte meine Ohren über die traditionelle Anzahl hinaus, erklärte mich für die GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance) und kämpfte gegen Rassismus und Diskriminierung, wann immer ich es miterlebte. Ich glaube an soziale Gerechtigkeit und werde weiterhin gegen soziale Ungerechtigkeit protestieren.\n\n\n\n## Rewritten English Translation:\n\n[REWRITE] In pursuing a career in social work, I aim to collaborate with the Division of Family and Children Services to support children who have experienced abuse or neglect, and to provide assistance to troubled families.

The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",

Als nächstes wird die Diagnosestellung erläutert, einschließlich der häufigen Merkmale, oder „Alarmsignale“. Abschließend fasst der Aufsatz zusammen, wie ein Lehrer in einem integrativen Klassenzimmer einen Schüler mit CAPD unterstützen kann.\n\nZentrales Hörverarbeitung Disorder (CAPD), oder Hörverarbeitung Disorder (APD), \"bezieht sich auf die Effizienz und Wirksamkeit, mit der das zentrale Nervensystem (ZNS) auditorische Informationen nutzt. Enger definiert, bezieht sich (C)AP auf die Wahrnehmungsprozesse auditorischer Informationen im ZNS und die neurobiologische Aktivität, die dieser Verarbeitung zugrunde liegt und zu elektrophysiologischen Hörpotentialen führt\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), was bedeutet, dass es sich um eine Störung handelt, bei der das zentrale Nervensystem (d. h. das Gehirn) Dinge, die gehört werden, nicht richtig verarbeiten kann. Menschen mit CAPD hören normalerweise gut und werden daher nicht als „Hörbeeinträchtigt“ betrachtet, sondern der Bereich im Gehirn, der das Interpretieren dessen, was wir hören, übernimmt, indem er Wörter trennt oder Konversation von Hintergrundgeräuschen unterscheidet, funktioniert nicht so, wie es normalerweise der Fall wäre.\n\nDie früheste Erwähnung der Störung, die zum CAPD wurde, stammt aus den Mitte der 1950er Jahre und wurde als „auditive Imperzeption“ (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) bezeichnet, als Forscher Kinder mit kommunikativen Störungen untersuchten. Das italienische Forscherteam Bocca, Calearo und Cassinari begann 1954 mit der Entwicklung von Tests für diese Kinder; 1961 führte Kimura „Dichotests ein und formulierte ein Modell, um die Physiologie des CANS zu erklären, die hinter der dihotomischen Wahrnehmung steht“ (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). 1977 fand eine nationale Konferenz statt, die die Forschung an Kindern mit CAPD förderte.\n\nCAPD manifestiert sich auf vielfältige Weise: Die betroffene Person kann möglicherweise den Schall nicht lokalisieren oder hören; kann Schwierigkeiten haben, zwischen zwei oder mehr „akustischen Ereignissen“ (Schalls ereignissen) zu unterscheiden; kann keine Schallmuster erkennen; kann keine Änderungen in der Sprache unterscheiden (wie z. B. Sarkasmus basierend auf Tonfalländerungen); ein Schall kann von einem nachfolgenden Schall blockiert werden; kann die Fähigkeit nicht haben, Schall线索 zu synthetisieren (d. h. so zu interpretieren, dass sie danach handeln können); und kann die Reihenfolge der präsentierten auditorischen Informationen nicht bestimmen (Ferre).\n\nUm CAPD zu diagnostizieren, muss der Patient mit „systematischer Beobachtung des Hörverhaltens und/oder Leistungstests der Hörfunktion“ untersucht werden, die von „Audiologen, Sprachtherapeuten, Psychologen und anderen mit einer Vielzahl von Maßnahmen durchgeführt werden können, die auditorische Fähigkeiten bewerten“ (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Dazu können Fragebögen und Umfragen, die Beobachtung von Hörverhalten, einschließlich der Reaktion des Patienten auf bestimmte Reize, gehören. Es gibt derzeit kein einziges Instrument oder Test, der mit hoher diagnostischer Erfolgsrate verwendet wird, und es gibt keine bekannte Ursache für die Störung. Viele Tests präsentieren dem Patienten mehrere gleichzeitig auftretende auditorische Reize und bitten dann, bestimmte Elemente wie eine Reihe von Wörtern oder Zahlen zu unterscheiden. Fortgeschrittenere Tests umfassen die Aufnahme von akustischen Signalen im Ohr und die Messung der Reaktionen auf die Signale.\n\n\n## English Translation:\n\n[REWRITE] This paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD).

    "original": "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women?

    "raw_output": "Die Komödie \"Twelfth Night\" scheint zu sagen, dass zwar Verkleidung tatsächlich nützlich ist, um lange Zeit Betrug zu begehen, aber am Ende muss man diese neu gebildete Maske ablehnen, sonst riskiert man, sich in diesem Prozess für immer zu verlieren. Ein großes Problem beim Beenden eines Betrugs ist jedoch, dass man sich im Prozess entfremdet fühlen kann. Daher muss man am Ende zwischen dem Selbsterhaltungstrieb und der Erhaltung der Beziehungen zu den Menschen in seiner Umgebung wählen. Denn obwohl einige neutral reagieren, wenn sie erfahren, dass sie getäuscht wurden, werden andere den Betrug nicht so leicht auf sich nehmen und werden wahrscheinlich von der ganzen Farce beleidigt sein.\nDas Thema des Betrugs bei der Umkehrung der Geschlechterrollen ist besonders problematisch, da es viele Nebenfragen aufwirft, die wichtigste davon ist vielleicht: Warum? Warum fühlt sich die betroffene Person compelled, ihre eigene Identität aufzugeben und eine Verkleidung in Form des anderen Geschlechts anzunehmen? In Violas Fall ist es offensichtlich eine Form des Selbstschutzes: „Ich bringe dich zu einem Hauptmann in dieser Stadt/ Wo meine Jungferkleider liegen, durch deren sanfte Hilfe/ Ich gerettet wurde, um diesem edlen Grafen zu dienen …“ (5.1.247-249)\nNeu in einem fremden Land angekommen, fühlt sich Viola gezwungen, als Mann zu tun, um sich vor möglichen Angreifern zu schützen. Violas Plan funktioniert, aber er isoliert sie auch von den Frauen um sie herum und trennt sie von einem wichtigen Stützsystem. Schlimmer noch, sie scheint so überzeugend als Mann aufzutreten, dass Olivia sie mit Sebastian verwechselt und sich in sie verliebt: „Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.“ (5.1.138) Darüber hinaus muss sie auch mit unterdrückten romantischen Wünschen zwischen ihr und Orsino zu kämpfen haben: „Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.“ (5.1. 260-261)\nObwohl dies eine möglicherweise fortschrittliche Einstellung ist, könnte \"Twelfth Night\" für den modernen Leser als Illustration dafür dienen, wie Betrug dazu beitragen kann, unterdrückte Emotionen, insbesondere bei Olivia und Orsino, zu enthüllen. Bestimmte Passagen deuten darauf hin, dass die genannten Charaktere ungedrückte unterbewusste Wünsche haben, mit denen sie sich durch das Auftreten von Viola/Cesario auseinandersetzen müssen. Zum Beispiel ist Olivia vielleicht auf Cesario wegen seines männlichen Aussehens angezogen, oder hegt Olivia wirklich heimliche Gefühle für Frauen? Man könnte argumentieren, dass dies wahrscheinlich nicht der Fall ist, weil Shakespeares Figur Olivia eher die Menschen seiner Zeit parodiert, die andere nur nach ihrem Aussehen beurteilen. \nDies wird durch die Leichtigkeit, mit der Olivia ihre romantischen Gefühle von Cesario zu Sebastian verlagert und Cesario/Viola als Familie statt als Liebesinteresse betrachtet, belegt: „A sister, you are she.“ (5.1.315)\n\n\n[REWRITE]\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to suggest that while disguise can be useful for perpetrating deception over long periods, ultimately a person must reject that newly formed persona, or risk losing themselves completely in the process. A major drawback to ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, one must ultimately choose between self-preservation and preserving relationships with those around them.

Natürlich lässt sich ein ganzes Kolonialreich wie dieses durch eine so einfache Beschreibung nicht vollständig erfassen. Das deutsche Kolonialreich war so vielseitig in seinen politischen Richtlinien und seinen Herrschaftsformen wie es geografisch vielfältig war. Die Bildungsvorschläge in den Kolonien waren ähnlich vielfältig. Als die Briten 1919 Deutsch-Ostafrika (Tanganjika) eroberten, fanden sie eine große Bevölkerung von gebildeten und lesenden Afrikanern. Die deutschen Bildungsinitiativen in Kamerun und anderen Kolonien wurden auch von zeitgenössischen Autoren gelobt. \nDie Situation in Südwestafrika (heute Namibia) stellte einen krassen Kontrast dar. Im Gegensatz zu Ostafrika, wo die Regierung staatliche Schulen gründete und eine bedeutende Rolle bei der Bildung der Eingeborenen spielte, wurde die Aufgabe der indigenen Bildung in Südwestafrika fast vollständig an Missionsgesellschaften übertragen, die nur begrenzte staatliche Unterstützung erhielten. Die Regierung investierte jedoch bedeutende Ressourcen in die Bildung der Europäer in der Kolonie und richtete ein System staatlicher Schulen ein sowie die Unterstützung und Regulierung von Missionschulen. Diese Bildungspraktiken hatten langfristige Auswirkungen auf Südwestafrika, selbst nach dem Ende der deutschen Herrschaft. Während andere deutsche Kolonien mit einer erheblichen Anzahl von lesenden und gebildeten Afrikanern aufwarten konnten, blieb in Südwestafrika „die überwältigende Mehrheit der Bevölkerung unberührt, ohne Bildung und Analphabet.“ Verschiedene soziale, politische und wirtschaftliche Faktoren führten zu den unterschiedlichen Erfahrungen in Südwestafrika. Diese Arbeit zielt darauf ab, die Diskussion zu erweitern, indem sie diese Faktoren identifiziert und besondere Aufmerksamkeit auf neue Forschungsergebnisse über die Einstellung der Siedler und Kolonialbehörden gegenüber den einheimischen Afrikanern lenkt.\n\nEs gibt eine Fülle von Literatur zum Thema Bildung im deutschen Kolonialreich. Die meisten dieser Quellen sind auf Deutsch und wurden im frühen 20. Jahrhundert, während oder kurz nach der Zeit der deutschen Kolonialherrschaft verfasst. Ziel der frühen Arbeiten war hauptsächlich die Beschreibung der Merkmale der Bildungssysteme in diesen Kolonien. Spätere Arbeiten auf Englisch erweiterten den Diskurs durch vergleichende Studien zur Bildung in den verschiedenen deutschen Kolonien und detailliertere Analysen spezifischer Aspekte der Bildung. Diese Studien zeigten erhebliche Unterschiede in den Bildungssystemen der verschiedenen Kolonien auf. Die bedeutendste Arbeit, die das Thema dieser Arbeit explizit behandelt, ist Cohens Studie zur Bildung in Südwestafrika und Ostafrika. Cohen vergleicht die Bildungssysteme der beiden Kolonien und diskutiert die Faktoren, die für die Unterschiede zwischen ihnen verantwortlich sind. Laut Cohen erklärt die große Anzahl an Siedlern in Südwestafrika viele der Besonderheiten des Bildungssystems der Kolonie.\n\nIm Vergleich zu den anderen kolonialen Besitztümern Deutschlands hatte Südwestafrika ein relativ mildes Klima, obwohl ein Großteil des Territoriums von trockenen Wüsten bedeckt ist. Die europäische Bevölkerung in Südwestafrika spiegelte die relativ günstigen Bedingungen wider.

Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",

Verwirrenderweise sind die meisten, wenn nicht sogar alle Genres - Rap, Rock, Country, Jazz, Folk, um nur einige zu nennen - innerhalb ihres Bereichs in mehrere Unter- und Unteruntergenres aufgeteilt.  Es ist wahrscheinlich, dass das Untergenre Heavy Metal Rock in den letzten 40 Jahren zu einem der vielfältigsten und ausdrucksstärksten Genres aller populären Musik geworden ist. Es ist ausdrucksstark, weil es eine breite Palette von Emotionen zeigt, obwohl diese eher zur dunkleren Seite des Spektrums tendieren. Es ist vielfältig, weil die Menschen schon bald nach Beginn des Genres erkannten, dass es eine echte Flexibilität hatte, und diese ausnutzten, um ihre eigenen Untergenres zu schaffen, was dann von Unteruntergenres gefolgt wurde, und die Kette setzt sich bis heute fort.\n\nHeute haben wir einen Punkt im Heavy Metal-Bewegung erreicht, an dem es so viele Nischen von Gruppen gibt, dass es schwer ist, genau zu bestimmen, was Heavy Metal ist. Es hat so viele Themen aus anderen Genres aufgenommen, aber wie alles andere hat es irgendwo angefangen. Um die heute allgegenwärtige Metal-Musik richtig zu verstehen, muss man zuerst verstehen, was die Metal-Bewegung ist und warum sie eine Bewegung ist und nicht nur ein Genre.\n\nMetal ist in vielerlei Hinsicht eine Bewegung, die von Dunkelheit geprägt ist. Metal kann als \"Musik des mehr\" betrachtet werden - mehr Bass, mehr Lautstärke, mehr Gewalt, mehr Theatralik. Weniger Primitivismus, mehr Virtuosität; die Leute in Metalbands können wirklich gut auf ihren Instrumenten spielen, und das kommt in der Musik durch. Metal ist auch - obwohl es vielleicht nicht überraschend kommt - eine Bewegung, die stark durch Drogen beeinflusst wird. Es gab einen Boom an psychedelischen Drogen in den Mitte der 1970er Jahre, der dazu führte, dass die Menschen verrückter wurden und dadurch verrückte, übersinnliche Schallplatten aufnahmen, wobei sie die Drogen als Sündenbock für ihre Kreation nutzten. Es besitzt viele dunkle, viszerale Eigenschaften, was für die Musikszene sehr neu war, da ein Großteil der populären Musik Eigenschaften hatte, die nicht der dunklen Seite des emotionalen Spektrums treu waren. Auch spätere Generationen des Metals haben sich von den dunklen, viszeralen Qualitäten beeinflusst lassen, die in der Romantik so präsent waren.\n\n\n \n[REWRITE] These lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles.

    "original": "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",

In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n\n[REWRITE]\nSeveral decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau carefully crafted his own dreams, both literally and figuratively. \"The Dream,\" a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe of the wonders of the land she visits in a dream, but also Rousseau's own personal dreams and aspirations as a painter. Since he began his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise from other artists and art lovers. He faced a difficult internal dilemma in trying to achieve this goal. \"The Dream\" is Henri Rousseau's work that best reflects his lifelong internal struggle: to either conform to or imitate certain painting styles to be accepted by the critical art world he admired so much, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, forging his own path.\nBefore one can analyze \"The Dream\" from this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau's biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who \"enjoyed bourgeois prosperity\" (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal art training; instead, he worked for France until the age of forty as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he was mistakenly called a douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to find a new life and turned to painting for comfort and a fresh start.

Die gleiche Kultur ist in Köln am Rhein, durch das Zentrum Deutschlands bis zur sächsischen Stadt Dresden an der Elbe spürbar. Mit einer so einzigartigen Kultur sollte es nicht überraschend sein, dass Deutschland, wie wir es heute kennen, aus verschiedenen Quellen und Stämmen hervorgegangen ist.\n\nGermania ist das Heimatland der Deutschen. Die Ursprünge des Namens sind unter Gelehrten und Historikern umstritten. Tacitus behauptete, der Name stamme von einem germanischen Stamm namens Tungri ab, die zuvor als Germanen bekannt waren, bevor sie den Rhein überquerten und gegen die gallischen Truppen kämpften (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar verwendete den Begriff „Germanus“ erstmals in seinem Kommentar zu den gallischen Kriegen, in dem er die Gallier besiegte und mit germanischen Stämmen kämpfte, die häufig unter hinterhältigen Vorwänden den Rhein überquerten. Er nahm dieses Wort von den Galliern selbst und verwendete es, um diejenigen zu unterscheiden, die er erobert hatte (die Gallier), und diejenigen, die er nicht erobert hatte. Obwohl der Ursprung ungewiss ist, glauben einige, dass es sich auf einen Nachbarn in der gallischen Sprache bezog. Im ersten Kapitel seines ersten Buches über diese Kriege bemerkt Julius Caesar: „Germanen, die jenseits des Rheins wohnen, mit denen sie (die Gallier) ständig Krieg führen.....Sie bekämpfen die Germanen in fast täglichen Schlachten.“ (Julius Caesar, 50-40 v. Chr.) Andere behaupten, dass die Bedeutung vom Speer stammt, den sie im Krieg verwendeten und der als ger bekannt war (O.E.D, 2010), oder vielleicht vom alten irischen Wort garim, was „brüllen“ bedeutet, was darauf hindeutet, dass die Germanen laut oder lautstark waren. (Namen Deutschlands)\n\nDer frühe römische Historiker Tacitus beschrieb in seinem Werk „De Origine et situ Germanorum“ aus dem Jahr 98 n. Chr. die Herkunft der Germanen und schrieb: „Ich würde sie (die Germanen) als ursprungliches Volk betrachten und nicht vermischt mit anderen Völkern durch Einwanderung oder Verkehr. Denn früher kamen diejenigen, die auswandern wollten, nicht über Land, sondern auf Schiffen an....... Wer würde aus Asien oder Afrika nach Italien oder nach Deutschland, mit seinem wilden Land, seinem ungemütlichen Klima, seinen düsteren Sitten und seinem bedrohlichen Aussehen, auswandern, es sei denn, es wäre seine Heimat? (SIC)“ (Tacitus, 98)\n\nUnd wer würde Rom für Germania verlassen? Bestimmt nicht die Römer, zumindest nicht noch lange nicht. Sie würden ihre Eroberungen in die Länder Germanias schicken, um Waren zu erhalten und gelegentlich Landkampagnen führen, aber am Ende würden sie hauptsächlich zurück in ihr weitläufiges Imperium reisen. So lebten die germanischen Stämme, als sie im ersten Jahrhundert auftraten, an den Grenzen des Römischen Reiches und handelten mit den Waren, die sie aus dem Land bezogen, und mit ihren Fähigkeiten, indem sie in den Reihen der römischen Armee dienten.

Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",

Unemotionell, still, mit einem geübten Bewusstsein, das das Objekt des Studiums untersuchte, aber sich weigerte, es einem abstrakten Verständnis zuzuordnen, das mein Geist analysierte, analysierte ich das Bild vor meinen Augen. Gedanken schlichen sich in meinen Geist und schlichen sich fast so schnell wieder heraus, wie sie erschienen waren. So glatt und sauber arbeitete mein Bewusstsein, dass es schien, als hätte ich keine eigenen wirklichen Gedanken, sondern nur ein aktives und flüssiges Erlebnis dessen, was ich sah. \nEinst hatte ich auf Rat eines Künstlers, mit dem ich arbeitete, ein Kunstbuch namens „The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain“ gekauft. Ich hatte schon seit meinem sechsten Lebensjahr lernen wollen, zu zeichnen, und dieses Buch lehrt alles, von dem Verständnis dessen, was ein Bleistift ist, bis hin zu den Prozessen, die das Gehirn verwendet, um Linien zu interpretieren. Eine der Techniken, die das Buch lehrt, ist es, einen quadratischen Rahmen um jedes Bild zu legen, das der Künstler studieren möchte.  Dadurch wird ein überwältigend detailliertes Bild, zum Beispiel eine Schale mit Obst, die auf einem Tisch liegt, der sich in einem Esszimmer befindet, das mit einer Küche verbunden ist, in ein leicht zu fassendes Bild verwandelt, nämlich diese Schale mit Obst, die auf einer einfachen Ebene liegt.\nZu der Zeit konnte ich, während ich auf die Schale vor mir hinunterblickte, den Rahmen des Künstlers nicht mental projizieren. Ich war so überwältigt, so bestaunt, dass ich nur stehen und staunend schauen konnte. Picasso durchlebte seine blaue Phase, Monet liebte das Grün, die italienischen Renaissance-Meister zeigten einen Regenbogen an Farben. Wenn ich irgendwelche Ambitionen hatte, meine Perspektive als würdig des Titels „Künstlerisch“ zu betrachten, dann waren vor mir der Beginn meines Bildes, der Anfang meiner Geschichte, „Arbeit in Braun“, zu sehen.  \nDie Fingerkuppen landeten auf meinem gewählten Instrument der Künstlerlichkeit, die Muskeln spannten sich an und entspannten sich, als meine Hand durch den Raum bewegte, der Wille meines Geistes in Form und Gestalt gebrachte, was in dem möglicherweise kreativsten Moment meines Lebens sein konnte. Wasser wirbelte, ruhig und glatt, kristallklar und rein. Stückchen Materie lösten sich vom Ganzen und wurden in die Nichtsheit getragen. Die Muskeln spannte sich an, zuckten und krampften ein wenig schneller und ängstlicher zum zweiten Mal, meine Hand schlug mit der Klobrille zusammen. Das beleidigende braune Paket weigerte sich zu bewegen, festgeklebt wie eine Schnecke am Boden der Toilette.\nMop locker in der Hand, Füße ein Fuß voneinander entfernt, grüner Schal unangenehm um den Hals geknüpft, runzelte ich leicht die Stirn, während ich den unhöflichen Bund aus verarbeitetem Tier- und Pflanzenmaterial betrachtete, den jemand als Botschaft für die Dummköpfe hinterlassen hatte, die die Toiletten im Rite Aid putzen. Ein paar weitere Spülungen, ein paar weitere ruhige, introvertierte Momente für mich, dann bewegte sich meine Hand zur Wand rechts, griff das Papier am Ende des Toilettenpapiers und begann, sich selbst wie einen Backhandschuh einzupacken.   Aufrecht stehend, dann mich nach vorne beugend, tauchte meine Hand langsam in die Schüssel, wie eine Mutter, die in den Backofen für das Truthahn geht….\n\n\n[REWRITE]\nDownwards I stared, my mind blankly comprehending the view before me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes. Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared. So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to the processes the brain uses to interpret lines. One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study. Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame. I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment. Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life. Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean. Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness. Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxiously the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again. The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid. A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.

Die National Institutes of Health erklären, dass ein Aspekt des Problems darin liegt, dass das Teenagergehirn buchstäblich nicht auf die Gefahren des Fahrens vorbereitet ist. Auch die einfache Unerfahrenheit liegt im Herzen des Problems. Diese Unerfahrenheit führt nicht nur zu mehr tödlichen Unfällen, sondern auch zu einer höheren Rate an Fahrzeugumkippungen, Geschwindigkeitsüberschreitungen und Abfahrten von der Straße. \nJugendliche haben es auch deutlich schlechter, wenn sie mit ihren Altersgenossen reisen – was jeder mit einem Hauch von Verstand weiß, dass sie regelmäßig tun. Das Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center führte eine Studie durch, die eine solche Korrelation zeigte: zwischen dem Alter des Passagiers und der Zahl der Verkehrsunfälle.\n Kalifornien und andere Bundesstaaten haben versucht, die Sicherheit von Teenagerfahrern zu erhöhen, indem sie vorübergehende Führerscheine erlassen werden, die die Stunden einschränken, in denen Jugendliche fahren dürfen, und das Mitfahren anderer Minderjähriger verbieten.\n Aber vorläufige Führerscheine sind meiner Meinung nach nur Übergangslösungen. Das eigentliche Problem ist, dass die jüngsten Fahrer als Gruppe statistisch gesehen einfach nicht in der Lage sind, die Risiken und Verantwortlichkeiten ausreichend zu bewältigen. Der Psychologe Marvin Zuckerman glaubt, dass selbst 18 Jahre zu jung für einen regulären Führerschein ist. Die USA Today berichtet, dass Zuckerman Forschung durchgeführt hat, die darauf hindeutet, dass unter 19-20-Jährigen ein gemeinsamer Wunsch besteht, Risiken einzugehen, einfach aus dem puren Reiz der Sensation. Es ist dann sinnvoll, das Fahren mindestens bis zu dem Zeitpunkt zu verschieben, an dem der Drang zum Nervenkitzel nachgelassen hat. Wenn wir weiterhin Führerscheine an junge Teenager ausstellen, werden wir nicht nur weiterhin tödliche Unfälle sehen, sondern die Anzahl der Todesopfer wird in den nächsten Jahren wahrscheinlich erschreckende Ausmaße annehmen. Bis zum Jahr 2010 werden die Kinder der Baby-Boomer fahreignungsberechtigt sein und Millionen von neuen Teenagerfahrern bereit sein, auf die Straße zu gehen. \nEine Gesetzgebung, die sich mit diesem Problem befasst, wäre relativ einfach. Schulen könnten weiterhin Fahrerbildungskurse anbieten, um den Lernprozess für zukünftige Fahrer zu beginnen, aber niemand unter 18 Jahren dürfe ein Kraftfahrzeug bedienen. Ein vorläufiger Schein kann immer noch ausgestellt werden, bevor ein vollständiger Führerschein erteilt wird, und es wären immer noch eine bestimmte Anzahl von praktischen Fahrstunden erforderlich. Die genaue Anzahl der Stunden könnte auf die Anzahl der Stunden basieren, die bereits von den meisten Staaten gefordert werden (in Kalifornien sind es beispielsweise derzeit 6 Stunden Fahrtraining hinterm Lenkrad und 50 Stunden Übung mit einem Erwachsenen). Weil die tödlichen Statistiken für Teenagerfahrer aus einer Querschnittprobe aller Bundesstaaten stammen, wäre eine einheitliche, nationale Gesetzgebung zu diesem Thema ein angemessenes – und meiner Meinung nach wirksames – Mittel, um Teenager im ganzen Land zu schützen. \nDie von mir vorgeschlagene Gesetzgebung ist keineswegs eine neue Idee.\n\n[REWRITE]\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.

    "raw_output": "## German Translation:\n\nIn der Bibliothek des Kongresses Bibliothek von frühen Edison-Filmen durchgesehen, beschloss ich, alle Trickfilme anzusehen, von denen es zwischen 1895 und 1901 fünfzehn gab. Diese Filme nutzen im Allgemeinen die kreative Bearbeitung, um Illusionen zu erzeugen. Meine Filmanalyse konzentrierte sich hauptsächlich darauf, die Poetik der meisten Trickfilme zu beschreiben und die evolutionären Randerscheinungen zu untersuchen, die in einigen der späteren Filme zu finden sind. Im Großen und Ganzen ist der Trickfilm um die Jahrhundertwende auf ein Set beschränkt, innerhalb eines frontal projizierten Prosceniums komponiert, weist keine Kamerabewegungen auf, verwendet lange und mittlere Aufnahmen und hält sich an die strenge Methode: eine Aufnahme = ein Film. Es gibt jedoch einige Filme zu Beginn des zwanzigsten Jahrhunderts, die sich diese Richtlinien wagen, indem sie Aspekte wie mehrere Aufnahmen einführen.\n\nEiner der auffälligsten Aspekte, den die Trickfilme gemeinsam haben, ist ihre Aufnahme in einem Innenraum innerhalb des Rahmens eines frontal projizierten Prosceniums. Die Kamera bewegt sich nicht von ihrer Proscenium-Position, um Figuren oder Objekte zu verfolgen. Diese Komposition war in frühen Filmen sehr verbreitet und entsprang dem Theater und, für Trickfilme, dem Varieté und Magie. Eine der Einschränkungen, die mit der Verwendung der Bühne verbunden sind, ist, dass sich Figuren in Trickfilmen im Allgemeinen nur seitlich bewegen und nicht auf die Kamera zu oder von ihr weggehen. Nehmen Sie beispielsweise die Aktion im Film \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900) zum Beispiel. Die Schauspieler treten von rechts ein und bewegen sich entlang der horizontalen Achse hin und her. Selbst wenn sie aus dem Bild gehen, folgt ihnen die Kamera nicht.\n\nDer frontale Proscenium-Stil der Komposition bedeutet auch, dass die Aufnahmen tendenziell Langaufnahmen und, seltener, Mittelbilder sind. Nahaufnahmen werden in keinem der Trickfilme aus dem Edison-Katalog verwendet. Das entspringt der Theater- und Varieté-Tradition, in der das Publikum die gesamte Vorstellung jederzeit im Rahmen der Bühne sehen konnte. Wie in den meisten frühen Filmen bewegen sich die Schauspieler nicht vom Mittelgrund auf die Kamera zu, daher treten keine Nahaufnahmen auf.\n\nIm Allgemeinen folgen die meisten frühen Trickfilme dem Muster, dass eine konzeptionelle Aufnahme einem Film entspricht. Dies beschränkt die Länge der meisten Trickfilme auf etwa eine Minute oder weniger, abhängig von den Bildern pro Sekunde. Es begrenzt auch die dramatische oder narrative Verwendung der Trickfilme; die meisten von ihnen konzentrieren sich auf kurze, varietéstilliche Tricks wie Magie, Verschwinden und Wechsel-Akte mit wenig Geschichte. Beachten Sie jedoch, dass in einem Trickfilm eine konzeptionelle Aufnahme aus der Sicht des Betrachters nicht tatsächlich einer physischen Aufnahme entspricht. Eine einzelne „Aufnahme“ kann tatsächlich mehrere Aufnahmen zusammengefügt sein, um den Eindruck von Erscheinungen oder Verschwinden zu erzeugen. Schauen Sie sich \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895) genau an, einem der früheren Trickfilme. Eine genauere Untersuchung zeigt den Moment, in dem die physische Aufnahme mit Marys abgetrennten „Kopf“ beginnt, obwohl der ganze Film konzeptionell eine Aufnahme für den Zuschauer darstellt.\n\n\n[REWRITE]\nIn browsing the Library of Congress’s collection of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901.

    "original": "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",

Es war sein Versuch, zu bewahren und zu fördern, was er für die beste aller Berufe hielt, der seine Argumente zu Souveränität, Verfassungsmäßigkeit und sogar zum Rechtssystem färbte.\n\nJohn Taylor glaubte, dass die Vereinigten Staaten eine große Chance hatten, ein ideales System zu schaffen, weil es keine einheimische Tradition gab, die die Erfinder der Regierung behindern konnte, was die Einrichtung eines Systems der Selbstregierung ermöglichte. Er glaubte stark an die natürlichen Rechte des Menschen und an die Tatsache, dass diese alle voneinander abhängig sind - was bedeutet, dass, wenn einer ihnen verweigert wird, sie alle scheitern werden, und der Wert der verbleibenden sinkt. Diese Rechte sollten daher außerhalb der Reichweite der Regierung sein. Er behauptete, dass das, was manche den \"Naturzustand\" nannten, bedeutete, dass diejenigen mit körperlicher Stärke und bösartiger Intelligenz diejenigen profitierten, aber dass dies in einer Zivilisation nicht so sein müsse.\n\nUm diese ideale Gesellschaft zu schaffen, glaubte Taylor, dass eine Regierung geschaffen werden müsse, die auf das angeborene Gute und Böse in Menschen Rechnung trägt. Taylor war in seinen Ansichten über eine dualistische Moral sehr starr. Er behauptete: \"Da die Regierung von Menschen ausgeübt wird, müssen all ihre Tugenden und Laster menschlich sein\" (ebd., S. 167). Er definierte gute Prinzipien als solche, die Privateigentum schützen, die Landwirtschaft fördern und Kapitalismus entmutigen, und glaubte, dass eine Regierung, die auf guten Prinzipien gegründet ist, unabhängig von ihrer Verwaltung fair funktionieren würde, was unweigerlich von Habgier und Selbstherrlichkeit geleitet werden würde. Selbstherrlichkeit, so glaubte er, sei die Motivation des Menschen in allen Dingen, aber diese Eigenschaft werde nur dann als böse betrachtet, wenn sie über die Schaffung einer Gesellschaft auf der Grundlage des Gemeinwohls hinausführte zu Untergesellschaften, die auf Kosten anderer lebten. Eine gute Regierung war notwendig, um das natürliche Böse des Menschen zu bändigen, und selbst dann musste sie unter sorgfältiger Beobachtung stehen, um die Hinzufügung schlechter Prinzipien zu vermeiden.\n\nTaylor, wie viele andere entschiedene Republikaner seiner Zeit, forderte eine strenge Auslegung der Verfassung. Er wünschte sich eine äußerst begrenzte föderale Regierung, ohne mehr Rechte oder Befugnisse, als in der Verfassung explizit aufgeführt waren. Er wusste, dass eine ausgedehnte föderale Regierung teuer wäre und daher wahrscheinlich despotisch wäre. Er glaubte jedoch, dass eine einfache, literale Interpretation gefährlich sei und dass ohne Bezugnahme auf die Absichten der Autoren diese Methode leicht korrumpiert werden könnte. Darüber hinaus betrachtete er die Unabhängigkeitserklärung als das wahre Grundgesetz der Vereinigten Staaten, weil sie das Land expliziter als eine Gruppe souveräner Staaten und nicht als eine Nation beschreibt.\n\n\n[REWRITE]\nJohn Taylor of Carolina was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism. Though he was primarily an agriculturalist, that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government. His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government. It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty, constitutionality, and even the judicial system.\n\nJohn Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system, because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government, which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government. He believed strongly in the natural rights of man, and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied, then they all will fail, and the value of those remaining is lessened. These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government. He claimed that what some called the “state of nature” meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited, but that in a civilization, this must not be the way.\n\nIn order to create this ideal society, Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man. Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality. He claimed that “As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human” (Ibid., pg. 167). He defined good principles as those that protect private property, improve agriculture, and discourage capitalism, and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest. Self-interest, he believed, was man's motivation in all things, but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others. A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil, and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n\nTaylor, like many other staunch Republicans of his time, called for a strict construction of the Constitution. He wanted an extremely limited Federal government, with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution. He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive, and therefore likely to be despotic. However, he believed that a simple, literal interpretation was dangerous, and that without reference to the intent of the writers, such a method could easily become corrupt. Even more, he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation. \n\n\n[/REWRITE]",

Das war etwas entmutigend, und es ist schwer zu sagen, warum das passiert sein könnte. Mit dem Einsetzen des Winters an einem New England Campus sinkt die Zahl der Menschen, die mit dem Fahrrad oder zu Fuß pendeln, was wahrscheinlich für einen Teil des Rückgangs verantwortlich ist. Dezember markiert auch das Ende des Herbstsemesters, in dem alle sehr beschäftigt sind, ihre Hausaufgaben zu beenden, die Noten zu bearbeiten und so weiter. Das Ausfüllen des Pendlerlogs ist für viele vielleicht einfach vom Radar verschwunden. Darüber hinaus bringt Dezember den Beginn der geschäftigen Weihnachtszeit und die daraus resultierende einmonatige Pause für Studenten und Fakultät, während derer viele nicht einmal zum Campus kommen müssen. Die Vorlesungen beginnen dann im späten Januar für das Frühjahrsemester, was möglicherweise auch ein Hinweis auf die geringe Anzahl von Protokollen für diesen Monat ist. Aber all das erklärt nicht wirklich die niedrige Anzahl der Einreichungen für Februar. Man könnte auch spekulieren, dass jedes Projekt dieser Art zu Beginn einen anfänglichen Schub an Energie und Begeisterung haben wird, der sich dann natürlich abnutzt. Um dieser Tendenz entgegenzuwirken, haben wir die „Carpool Challenge Week“ ins Leben gerufen, eine spezielle Blitzkampagne im März, um die Initiative wiederzubeleben, was zu einer Steigerung der Einreichungen von Protokollen für diesen Monat führte. Eine der Herausforderungen, denen wir begegnet sind, war also, den Projektdurchlauf trotz des natürlichen Rückgangs der Beteiligung und insbesondere des Problems der Ferien- und Semesterferien im Hochschulwesen aufrechtzuerhalten.\n\n\nEine weitere Herausforderung für dieses Projekt (oder jedes alternative Pendelprojekt) ist die einfache Tatsache, dass Menschen die Freiheit, Unabhängigkeit und Flexibilität lieben, mit ihrem Auto zu fahren. Das ist tief in unserer Kultur verwurzelt. Daher ist es wichtig, Anreize für die Nutzung alternativer Verkehrsmittel zu schaffen. Wir haben viele Preise in Form von Geschenkgutscheinen für lokale Restaurants, Cafés, Masseurinnen, den lokalen unabhängigen Buchladen und sogar einige größere nationale Kettenläden vergeben. Es wäre jedoch interessant gewesen zu sehen, wie sich einige noch größere Preise auf die Teilnahme auswirken könnten – zum Beispiel, wenn man ein schönes Fahrrad, ein Hybridfahrzeug oder ein Elektrofahrzeug verschenkt hätte. Dies hätte auch dazu beitragen können, den Rückgang der Beteiligung zu bekämpfen, den das Projekt erfahren hat. Die Art der Preise hat sich im Laufe des Projekts nicht wirklich geändert. Wenn die Preise jedoch im Laufe des Projekts an Wert gewonnen hätten, hätte das helfen können. Die Geschenkgutscheine schienen zu Beginn des Projekts mehr als ausreichend zu sein, aber wenn wir im Dezember angekündigt hätten, ein paar Fahrräder zu ergänzen, und dann im Januar ein Hybrid- oder Elektroauto, kann man nur vermuten, dass die Teilnahme und die Engagement anstelle des Rückgangs gestiegen wäre.\n\n[REWRITE]\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a steep drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project.

Ein ETF bietet Ihnen die Diversifizierung eines Indexfonds und die Vorteile des Einzelaktienbesitzes wie die Möglichkeit, Short zu verkaufen, auf Margin zu kaufen und bei jeder Transaktion so wenige wie eine Aktie zu erwerben.  Obwohl diese Vorteile äußerst attraktiv sind, sind die Kostenquoten von ETFs deutlich niedriger als die der durchschnittlichen Investmentfonds.  Leider gibt es einige Nachteile, wie z.B. die Notwendigkeit, bei jedem Handelsgeschäft mit ETFs eine Provision zu zahlen, genau wie bei einer Aktienorder. Ein weiterer Vorteil von ETFs ist die große Auswahl an Fonds. Obwohl diese Vorteile klar formuliert sind, ist es immer eine gute Übung für den erfahrenen Finanzinvestor, zu bewerten, ob die genannten Vorteile, wie die Diversifizierung, tatsächlich existieren und in welchem ​​Ausmaß. Zu diesem Zweck werden wir den ETF IHF untersuchen und ihn mit den Top 10-Positionen vergleichen, die den ETF bilden, um festzustellen, ob die Vorteile eines einzigen ETF in die Nähe der Vorteile eines diversifizierten Portfolios der zehn Aktien kommen und ob es bessere Konfigurationen der gleichen Aktien gibt, die einen optimaleren Sharp-Ratio oder Return bieten würden.\nUm den ETF zu bewerten, würde es unhandlich werden, alle Positionen einzubeziehen, daher haben wir beschlossen, nur die Top 10-Positionen einzubeziehen, die 63,58% aller Vermögenswerte des ETF ausmachen.  \n\nUnten finden Sie die Top 10-Positionen und den Prozentsatz der Gesamtvermögenswerte.\n\nUm eine Schätzung zu erhalten, wie gut diese zehn Aktien den gesamten ETF IHF repräsentieren, können wir den aktuellen Prozentsatz der Vermögenswerte, normalisiert auf 100%, verwenden, um den Beitrag jedes Aktien zum Beta und Return eines Portfolios zu berechnen, wenn das Portfolio ausschließlich aus diesen 10 Aktien in dem Verhältnis zusammengesetzt wäre, das der ETF durch seine Positionen festgelegt hat. Die Berechnungen von Beta und Return sind in der folgenden Tabelle enthalten.\n\n\nAus der obigen Tabelle geht hervor, dass die Rendite eines Portfolios, das nur die Top 10-Positionen enthält, 6,11% höher ist als die des ETF, ein Anstieg der Renditen um 16 %.  Es ist auch evident, dass das Beta der Top 10-Positionen um 0,12 niedriger ist als das des gesamten ETF.

    "original": "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",

Arndt kommentiert in seinem Buch \"Poes Politian und Goethes Mignon\" die Ähnlichkeit der beiden Gedichte und zieht den Schluss, dass Poe Goethe imitierte. \nOxford Companion to English Literature sagt von Goethe, dass er ein gefeierter Schriftsteller des poetischen Dramas Faust war, das in zwei Teilen veröffentlicht wurde, der erste 1808 und der zweite im Jahr Goethes Todes im Jahr 1832. In den poetischen Versen des zweiten Teils von Faust befindet sich ein kurzes Gedicht mit dem Titel \"Der König von Thule\". Das Gedicht handelt von einem König, dessen Frau stirbt, nachdem sie ihm das Geschenk eines Kelches gemacht hat. Nachdem seine Frau gestorben ist, beginnt er stark zu trinken und weint vor Trauer um seine verstorbene Königin. Dann beschließt er, dass es Zeit für ihn ist zu sterben und gibt seine Besitztümer an seine Kinder, mit Ausnahme des Kelches. Dann geht er zu einer Klippe, wirft den Kelch in den Ozean, schließt die Augen und stirbt. Das Auftreten des Königs von Thule und die Beschreibung des Königs in Traumland sind sehr ähnlich, vielleicht ein dunkler Doppelgänger von Poes Verlust und seinem Trinkschub. Faust wurde auch 1842 von H P Grattan in ein romantisches Drama umgewandelt, weniger als ein Jahr bevor Poe den Begriff Thule in \"Die Schwingung und das Pendel\" verwendete.\n\nPoe bezieht sich zweimal in seinen gesammelten Schriften auf Thule. Einmal erwähnt Poe \"ultma Thule\" in \"Die Schwingung und das Pendel\", aber er verwendet diesen Ausdruck in \"Traumland\" zweimal, als Buchenden des Gedichts. \"Der König von Thule\" und \"Traumland\" können als Begleitstücke gelesen werden. In \"Traumland\" sagt der Sprecher: Dann beschreibt er die Landschaft von Thule und wie sie dunkel und einsam ist, er wird von toten Freunden gequält und er sieht eine schattige Welt ohne Farbe. All diese Szenen würden in \"Der König von Thule\" von Goethe gelesen werden, da er gerade seine Frau verloren hat, er ist einsam und er hat den Willen, zu regieren oder sogar zu leben, verloren. Das ganze Gedicht ist eine Beschreibung, als hätte der Sprecher Goethes Gedicht betreten.\n\nGoethe war ein bedeutender Autor, den Poe aus Respekt vor Tennyson hätte kennen müssen. Poe sagte Folgendes, als er gefragt wurde, ob er Tennyson bewunderte: Abgesehen von der Verbindung zu Tennyson wäre Poe Goethes Werk in den vielen Reproduktionen ausgesetzt gewesen, die nach der ursprünglichen Veröffentlichung stattfanden.\n\n\n[REWRITE] Dream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe's self-proclaimed better poems. In \"Dream-land\" Poe uses the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Goethe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \nOxford Companion to English Literature says of Goethe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Goethe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \nPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thulé” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Goethe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \nGoethe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Goethe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. \n\n\n[/REWRITE]",

Palmer wird argumentieren können, dass Martin hätte wissen müssen, welche wahrscheinlich Folgen ein unzureichendes Reinigen eines Unfalls haben könnte, da in den Monaten vor Palmers Unfall bereits mehrere Kunden von D&D wegen Rutschen verletzt wurden; und trotz dieses Wissens hat er die Reinigung des Unfalls in Kauf genommen. Palmers Argument, dass Martins Handlungen verwerflich waren, ist weniger überzeugend, aber angesichts der Tatsache, dass 2009 sechs Fälle von Rutschunfällen aufgetreten waren und Martin trotzdem keine angemessenen Maßnahmen ergriffen hat, um die Sicherheit seines Geschäfts zu gewährleisten, sind sie dennoch nachvollziehbar.\n\nAm 13.

Eines der wichtigsten Themen, über die in der Klasse lebhaft diskutiert wurde, war die Frage, ob der Islam eine feindselige Religion sei. Ich glaube, dass diese Frage heute relevanter denn je ist. Wenn ich an die Ereignisse seit dem 11. September zurückdenke, habe ich persönlich beobachtet, wie die Massenmedien von einer feindseligen Haltung gegenüber dem Islam und den Extremisten zu einer extremen Form der Toleranz gegenüber dem Islam in Amerika übergegangen sind. Ich denke nicht, dass wir 2001 jemals einen Präsidentschaftskandidaten mit dem Namen Borac Obama hätte haben können, der einen offensichtlichen muslimischen Hintergrund in seiner Familie hat.\n\tDie Biographie des Propheten finde ich faszinierend, denn nach meinem Kenntnisstand über die Geschichte Muhammads widerspricht die Biographie der Persönlichkeit Muhammads. Aus dem, was ich wusste und gelernt habe, dachte ich, dass Muhammad Konvertiten zum Islam zwang. Er eroberte Stämme und zwang sie dann, die Religion des Islam anzunehmen. Aber laut der Biographie wird Muhammad als eine Art Märtyrer beschrieben, der missverstanden wurde und sich sogar anderen gegenüber demütigte. Danach kamen die Menschen eins nach dem anderen und sahen die \"Wahrheit\" in seiner Lehre und suchten ihn auf.\n\tEs gibt auch einige unheimliche Ähnlichkeiten zwischen den Diensten Jesu und den \"Wundern\" Muhammads. Das offensichtlichste ist, als er Schaf und Milch nahm und sie so vervielfachte, dass es mehr als genug für vierzig Männer gab. Es ist dieser Schreibstil, der mich glauben lässt, dass die Autoren wollten, dass Muhammad als der bescheidene Prophet wahrgenommen wird, der nichts beweisen musste, sondern einfach in Wahrheit und Wundern lebte. Diese Art von Falschheit ist die schlimmste, weil sie das Wunder und das Leben Jesu Christi herunterpielt. Für mich ist es so, als würden sie stehlen und versuchen, sich das Leben und die Person Jesu durch Muhammad anzueignen.\n\tEs gibt auch viele Geschichten in der Biographie, die den Eindruck erwecken, dass es Teil ihrer Agenda ist, Beweise für \"Zeugnis\" oder dafür zu liefern, dass Menschen \"eigenständig\" zum Islam konvertiert sind. Das Problem ist, dass viele der Geschichten zumindest aus einer dritten Person Perspektive stammen. Das heißt, in der Geschichte illustriert der Autor, dass er von so und so hörte, der von so und so hörte usw. Das gefiel mir nicht so gut, denn obwohl ihre Idee war, dass es den Beweis für die Wahrheit der Geschichten lieferte, fand ich, dass es die Geschichten schmälerte und es viel verdächtiger machte.\n\tIch glaube, was mich an diesem Werk am meisten stört, ist, dass sie versuchen, Muhammad als einen frommen Mann zu erheben und zu ehren, der bescheiden, liebenswürdig, weise und sanft war. Die Geschichte widerspricht jedoch der Vorstellung, dass Muhammad ein sanfter und bescheidener Mann war, und ich kann mir nicht helfen, zu denken, ob Muslime heute die wahre Geschichte hinter Muhammads Aufstieg zur Macht kennen.\n\n[REWRITE]\nAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.

    "original": "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.

Wenn man diese Geschichte in breiten Strichen betrachtet, sieht man einen Trend, wie das Christentum immer weiter von seinen Wurzeln abweicht. Es scheint, dass die heutige Welt ein wachsendes Bewusstsein und eine beispiellose progressive Tendenz zeigt. Während traditionelle Menschen verbleiben und sich gegen jede Art des Denkens widersetzen, das über das hinausgeht, was ihnen beigebracht wurde, mag dieser Teil der Bevölkerung nicht prominent genug sein, um das Ganze zu beeinflussen. Unter Christen wird in den kommenden Jahren ein historisches Bewusstsein stark wachsen. Ein Sehnsucht wird sich verbreiten, die Lehren, die im Laufe der Zeit in das Christentum aufgenommen wurden, von der eigentlichen Absicht der Religion ihres Namensgebers zu unterscheiden. Es mag Jahrzehnte oder sogar Jahrhunderte dauern, aber das Ergebnis wird unausweichlich sein: Es wird eine große Kehrtwende in der Entwicklung der christlichen Geschichte geben. Es wird eine Entwicklung zurück zu seiner ursprünglichen Form geben. Eine Bewegung wird an Bedeutung gewinnen, die Schicht für Schicht dogmatische Überlagerungen entfernt, so als ob die Uhr rückwärtslaufen würde, bis nichts mehr übrig ist als die Vorstellung von dem, was Jesus der Menschheit im Namen Gottes vorgestellt hat, bevor andere Denker solche Behauptungen aufstellten. Wenn dieser Trend durch die Vereinigten Staaten und Europa weht und Massen auf seinem Weg beeinflusst, um so zu verehren, als lebten wir zur Zeit Jesu, und nur seine Ideen zu befolgen, wird die Kirche als Institution stark bleiben, um den Weg zu weisen.   Da die theologische Uhr jedoch rückwärts bewegt worden wäre, würde sich die extreme Vielfalt im Christentum in immer mehr Einheitlichkeit von Glauben und Praxis umkehren. Zwischen Regionen, zwischen Konfessionen und zwischen Abteilungen jeder Art werden wir statt Unterschiede zunehmend Ähnlichkeiten sehen. Die menschliche Geschichte ist voller großer Kehrtwenden. Ein Beispiel dafür ist, wie Christen einst vom Römischen Reich verfolgt, verstoßen und getötet wurden. Später wurde dieses Reich jedoch zu einer christlichen Institution. Unser Land ist von der afrikanisch-amerikanischen Sklaverei zur afrikanisch-amerikanischen Führung gelangt. Die große Kehrtwende, die in unserer Zukunft bevorsteht, wird sich in der Arena der christlichen Religion entfalten, die Geschichte auf der Suche nach der Quelle rückgängig machen und dabei die Vielfalt auflösen. Es ist wichtig zu beachten, dass Teil davon, was diesen Prozess möglich machen wird, eine Methode sein wird, die Worte Jesu als metaphorisch und nicht als wörtliche Aussagen liest. \n\n\n##  English Translation\n\n[REWRITE]\n\nThe teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life. If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origins. It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency. While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole. Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years. A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake. It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable: There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history. There will be a progression back to its original form. A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims. When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way. However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice. Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities. Human history is filled with great reversions. Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire. But later that empire became a Christian institution. Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.

Der offensichtlichste Bereich ist der der Besitzer und Manager der großen Fabriken.  All das, was sie wollen, ist, ihre Unternehmen und Fabriken so groß und großartig wie möglich zu machen.

Er zeigt, dass den Besitzern an keiner Person oder Tier egal ist, die verletzt werden könnte. Sie kümmern sich nicht um die großen Rauchschwaden, die aus den Fabriken steigen, oder den Kot- und Urinabfluss aus den Tausenden von Ställen rund um Packingtown.\n\nAuch die Besitzer und Manager kümmerten sich nicht um ihre Mitarbeiter, die für ihren Reichtum arbeiteten. Sie würden alles tun, um einen zusätzlichen Dollar zu verdienen oder zu sparen: \"Von oben bis unten ist der Ort einfach ein brodelndes Kesselhaus aus Eifersucht und Hass; es gibt nirgends Loyalität oder Anstand, es gibt keinen Platz, an dem ein Mensch etwas gegen einen Dollar zählt.\" Sie zwingen ihre Mitarbeiter, schreckliche Stunden zu arbeiten, und dann entlassen sie ohne vorherige Ankündigung auf einmal viele Menschen ohne Entschädigung oder Hilfe bei der Arbeitssuche. In der Zeit, in der \"The Jungle\" spielt, gab es nur wenige, wenn überhaupt, Gesetze oder Vorschriften, die den Arbeitsschutz oder das Wohlergehen der Arbeiter schützten.

Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",

Viele Bio-Farmen bieten außerdem Führungen durch ihre landwirtschaftlichen Betriebe sowie Zugang zu Wanderungen, Vogelbeobachtungen und anderen Freizeitaktivitäten an. Dies ist die Art von Betrieb, der es dem Landbesitzer ermöglichen würde, die Vorteile von staatlichen Programmen zu nutzen und gleichzeitig das Habitat zu verbessern, was Freizeitaktivitäten ermöglicht und die Möglichkeit für landwirtschaftliche Führungen und andere Programme zum Geldverdienen oder zu Bildungszwecken schafft.\nZusätzlich zur Befüllung eines potenziell lukrativen Nischenmarktes umfassen die Vorteile des ökologischen Landbaus oft eine höhere Biodiversität von Pflanzen und Wildtieren in der Gegend dank des fehlenden Einsatzes von Chemikalien in Boden und Wasser. Der ökologische Landbau hat jedoch auf einige Weise höhere Kosten als der konventionelle Landbau. Er erfordert mehr intensive Arbeits- und Managementbemühungen, um Schädlinge und Unkräuter zu entfernen und den Boden ohne Chemikalien zu düngen, und die Verluste sind oft größer als bei konventionellen Methoden. Ein kleiner ökologischer Betrieb verfügt außerdem nicht über die Skaleneffizienz großer Betriebe. Praktiken, die nicht mit dem ökologischen Landbau zusammenhängen, sondern für die Wildtiere vorteilhaft sind, können ebenfalls zu höheren Arbeitskosten führen, einschließlich des Anbaus von Gründüngemitteln, strategischer Weidewirtschaft, der Entfernung invasiver Arten und der aktiver Bewirtschaftung des Pflanzenwachstums, um bestimmte Bedingungen wie Randlebensräume oder offene Flächen zu schaffen. Daher gibt es viele Gründe, warum der Landwirt in diesem Beispiel finanzielle Hilfe oder Expertise suchen könnte, um sowohl Gewinne als auch die Qualität des Habitats zu maximieren.  \nDas für dieses Szenario gewählte Land ist ein Grundstück angrenzend an die Stadt Potrero im nicht eingegliederten San Diego County, Kalifornien. Es handelt sich um 65 Hektar Chaparral, nicht einheimische mediterrane Grasland und Eichenwald neben dem Cleveland National Forest. Es liegt im Ökoregion \"East County Southern Foothills\" des San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. Der Plan wird derzeit noch geprüft, beinhaltet aber derzeit über hundert Pflanzen- und Tierarten. Viele sind vom Aussterben bedroht, wie z. B. der Stephens-Kangurufrosch, die Berg-Gelbfußlamme, mehrere Schmetterlingsarten und der Kaliforniensänger. Andere sind rückläufig und könnten bald aufgelistet werden, wie z. B. der Bauchwürger.\nDiese Gegend war seit unzählbaren Jahrhunderten von den indigenen Völkern bewohnt und wurde dann im späten 19. Jahrhundert von Viehzüchtern und Holzhauerbesitzern besiedelt. Dieses Grundstück war Teil eines ursprünglichen Homestead-Patents und wurde wahrscheinlich jahrzehntelang zur Weidewirtschaft und/oder Holzeinschlag genutzt. \nIch habe ein Grundstück von einer Immobilienwebsite ausgewählt und die verfügbaren staatlichen Programme recherchiert, um zu sehen, welche Möglichkeiten ein kleiner Landwirt hätte, Kosten zu mindern und tierfreundliche Betriebe zu erhalten. Als Modell dafür, was jemand, der auf diesem Land Landwirtschaft betreibt, erreichen könnte, habe ich eine ökologische Farm in der gleichen Gegend gefunden.\n\n## English Translation:\n\n[REWRITE]\nSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.\n\nIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.\n\nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California.

The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals.

Kultur kann ebenso definiert werden durch das, was sie nicht ist, wie durch das, was sie tatsächlich ist und was sie bedeutet. Kultur ist nicht homogen, noch ist sie eine bestimmte Sache. Sie ist auch nicht eindimensional oder einheitlich. Aussagen wie \"alle Russen sind hartnäckig\" oder \"alle Japaner sind entgegenkommend\" sind von Natur aus weit gefasst und zu vereinfachend. Während das Verständnis der allgemeinen Merkmale einer Kultur angebracht ist, ist es für einen Verhandlungsführer viel produktiver, die Bedeutung einer Kultur für die konkrete Angelegenheit zu verstehen und wie die Haltung dieser Kultur sich auf die Verhandlungen auswirken kann und wird.\n\nWenn man einer fremden Kultur begegnet, erlebt man sie auf eine Weise, die mit der eigenen Kultur vergleichbar ist, und Vergleiche entstehen zwangsläufig.  Das Verstehen einer fremden Kultur oder Denkweise kann alles umfassen, von der Beschäftigung mit ihrer Geschichte bis zur Erkenntnis ihrer Vorurteile. Anstatt eine Kultur zu verurteilen oder zu versuchen, sie zu ändern, muss man sie einfach so akzeptieren, wie sie ist, und innerhalb ihrer Grenzen arbeiten, besonders im Rahmen der Verhandlung und besonders, wenn man mit einer schwächeren Verhandlungsposition am Tisch sitzt. Ebenso kann ein Respekt für Traditionen und Überzeugungen in einem \"auswärtigen\" Gebiet nur dazu beitragen, kulturelle Barrieren zu überwinden und die Verhandlungen voranzutreiben.\n\nEs ist wichtig zu beachten, dass Kultur sich nicht unbedingt auf eine nationale/internationale Dichotomie beschränkt. Die meisten Unternehmen innerhalb eines Landes etablieren ihre eigene Unternehmenskultur. Zum Beispiel kann sich die Unternehmenskultur auf lange Arbeitszeiten im Büro oder auf einen entspannteren Stundenplan konzentrieren. Belege für eine Unternehmenskultur sind in Dresscodes der Mitarbeiter, im Kommunikationsstil (direkte vs. indirekte Kommunikation, Delegation von Aufgaben) und in den Einstellungspraktiken zu sehen. Einige Unternehmen fördern die Philanthropie auf allen Ebenen der Mitarbeiter, andere beschränken sie auf „von der Firma genehmigte“ Wohltätigkeitsorganisationen oder Spendensammlungen. Man braucht nur den Unterschied der amerikanischen Unternehmenskultur von Unternehmen zu Unternehmen (und tatsächlich existiert auch intra-firmenmäßige Vielfalt sogar von Region zu Region, von städtischen zu suburbanen Umgebungen) zu betrachten, um die Vielfalt der Gedanken zu schätzen, die in einer bestimmten gesellschaftlichen Kultur leben kann. Bestimmte Kulturen sind nicht annähernd so gestratifiziert wie die amerikanische Kultur und erscheinen einem Außenstehenden möglicherweise einheitlicher, aber ein ähnliches Äußeres ist einfach ein Zeichen, tiefer einzutauchen.\n\nWerte sind noch wichtiger zu verstehen, denn sie geben den \"Warum\" einer Kultur. Wenn das Erhalten des Ansehens oder die Gemeinschaftssinn innerhalb einer Kultur wertgeschätzt werden, ist es gewiss, dass ein Verhandlungsführer seine Firma oder seinen Vorgesetzten öffentlich nicht beschämen wird, um am Verhandlungstisch erfolgreich zu sein. Ebenso wird sich ein Verhandlungsführer aus einer Kultur, die einem hartnäckigen Geschäft mehr Gewicht gibt, nicht unbedingt dazu drängen, so früh wie möglich zu einer Einigung zu kommen. Die Berücksichtigung dieser Allgemeinplätze ist wichtig, bevor man sich an den Verhandlungstisch setzt. Ein Verhandlungsführer ist jedoch gut beraten, etwas über seinen Gegner auf persönlicher Ebene zu erfahren, um die Verhandlungen effektiv zu gestalten. \n\n\n[REWRITE]\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation.

Diese Überzeugung scheint auch von dem anderen Autor, den wir besprechen werden, Thomas von Aquin, geteilt zu werden. Da sich beide Argumente zur Verteidigung desselben Konzepts, nämlich der Existenz Gottes, richten und unsere Aufgabe darin besteht, zu bestimmen, welches die bessere der beiden ist, müssen wir aus Gründen der Kürze mit der Annahme beginnen, dass sie beide in ihrer Überzeugung von der Existenz Gottes, genauer gesagt des Gottes der Bibel, korrekt sind. Um einen Gott-artigen Wesen zuzulassen, der demjenigen, an dem unsere beiden Autoren glauben, möglicherweise nicht ähnelt, würde uns nicht erlauben, ihre beiden Argumente angemessen zu vergleichen, da sie im Wesentlichen die Verteidigung eines spezifischen Gotteskonzepts sind. \n\nDas heißt, ich würde vorschlagen, dass, während jeder von ihnen stichhaltige Punkte anspricht, keiner wirklich eine ganzheitliche Grundlage für den Glauben an Gott bietet. \n\nUm diesen Punkt zu veranschaulichen, werden wir zunächst das grundlegende Argument des heiligen Anselm untersuchen. Anselms Passage spiegelt einen Weg wider, Erkenntnis durch Glauben zu erlangen, indem man sich in sich selbst umsieht, um Beweise für Gott zu finden. Er erklärt, dass weil Gott in unserem Verständnis existiert, können wir seine Nicht-Existenz nicht effektiv begreifen. Während dieses Konzept, wenn es in seiner Terminologie ausgearbeitet wird, etwas langwierig und zeitweise unklar ist, besteht das grundlegende Verständnis darin, dass der Beweis für Gott im eigenen Geist liegt. St. Anselm schlägt uns vor, dass wir nicht über die Grenzen unserer eigenen Seele hinausgehen müssen, um Wahrheit über Gott zu finden, sondern dass die Existenz dieses Wesens einfach dadurch wahr ist, dass man das untersucht, was wir in unseren eigenen Gedanken als wahr kennen. Fremde Beweise sind wahrscheinlich überflüssig. Dieses Konzept, die Annahme dessen, für das es keine unbestreitbare Menge an empirischen Beweisen gibt, wird in christlichen Texten oft als Glaube bezeichnet.\n\nDiese Idee ist sehr unterschiedlich von der, die St. Thomas von Aquin vertritt. Aquin schlägt stattdessen vor, dass die Existenz Gottes vollständig durch Vernunft und empirische Beweise bewiesen werden kann, ohne jeglichen Glauben. Eine solche Idee wäre im Evangelismus, einem wichtigen Element des Christentums, von Vorteil, da sie die Gewinnung neuer Konvertiten ermöglichen würde, ohne dass sie sich auf ihre Bereitschaft verlassen müssten, etwas zu akzeptieren, das nicht bewiesen werden kann. Stattdessen könnten sie allein durch Logik überzeugt werden. St. Thomas erläutert fünf verschiedene logische Argumente, die die Existenz Gottes stützen: Veränderung, Kausalität, Konditionalität, Grad der Vollkommenheit und Harmonie. In jedem von ihnen demonstriert er im Wesentlichen, dass der Beweis für Gott in der logischen Notwendigkeit für Gott liegt. Wenn man einem gesagt wird, dass man ein fehlendes Puzzlestein vermisst, und man den Rest des Puzzles zusammensetzt, diktiert die Logik, dass man die Merkmale und die Existenz des fehlenden Steins kennen kann, ohne ihn sehen zu müssen.\n\n\n[REWRITE]\n\nThe fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’ This quotation first appears in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument concerning the existence of God.

    "original": "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",

Im Laufe seines Lebens gab er der Welt den Rücken und wurde erleuchtet, und seine Lehren führten zur Gründung des Buddhismus - der orthodoxeste Zweig davon ist als Theravada-Buddhismus bekannt. Die Religion ist etwa zweitausendfünfhundert Jahre alt; sie sieht heute anders aus als zu Buddhas Lebzeiten. Das lässt sich überall beobachten, zum Beispiel in der Theravada-Nation Sri Lanka, wo die jährliche Wasser-Schneidungszeremonie begangen wird. Mönche und Laien nehmen an dieser Zeremonie teil, und sie hat religiöse Bedeutung, obwohl Buddha nie von einer solchen Feierlichkeit sprach. Diese Unterschiede reichen von den oberflächlichen Traditionen bis zum soteriologischen Kern der Religion. Die Theravada-Buddhistische Gemeinschaft, sowohl aus monastischer als auch aus weltlicher Sicht, musste ihre lehrhaften Prinzipien im Laufe der Zeit ändern. Dies ist auf sowohl externe als auch interne Kräfte, sowohl feindliche als auch wohlwollende, zurückzuführen.\n\nEs gibt eine Reihe von Qualifizierungsbegriffen, die in diesem Gespräch häufig verwendet werden.  Es gibt das Konzept von innen gegen außen. Hier wird eine interne Kraft als eine Kraft definiert, die von Mitgliedern des Buddhasasana ausgeht, unabhängig vom monastischen Status. Eine externe Kraft ist jede Kraft von Nicht-Buddhisten. Eine feindliche Kraft ist jede Kraft, die der buddhistischen Gemeinschaft Schaden zufügen will oder zufügt - eine Kraft, die aus einer negativen Wahrnehmung des Buddhismus entsteht. Eine wohlwollende Kraft ist eine Kraft, die der buddhistischen Gemeinschaft weder schaden noch helfen möchte - obwohl sie möglicherweise als Nebenwirkung eines oder des anderen tut. Diese Begriffe werden in diesem Gespräch immer wieder auftreten.\n\nZunächst ist es wichtig, die Grundlagen der Religion zu untersuchen - die Lehren, die am Herzen des Theravada-Buddhismus liegen. Buddhisten suchen Zuflucht im Dreifaltigkeits-Juwel des Buddha, des Dhamma und der Sangha. Das Dhamma besteht im Wesentlichen aus dem Tripitaka - den drei Körben - buddhistischer Schriften. Der Sutta Pitaka enthält alle Suttas, der Vinaya Pitaka enthält die disziplinarischen Regeln und der Abhidhamma Pitaka enthält die metaphysischen Komponenten des Buddhismus. Die metaphysischen Vorstellungen umfassen Dinge wie Anatta - keine Seele, Dukkha - innewohnender Schmerz im Leben und Anicca - die Vergänglichkeit von allem. Nur durch die Erkenntnis dieser Konzepte kann man Sansara, den Kreislauf von Tod und Wiedergeburt, beenden, der kontinuierlich stattfindet. Zusammen mit Sansara werden lobha - Begierde, dosa - Hass und moha - Täuschung enden, wenn man erleuchtet wird. Im Vinaya Pitaka werden Regeln für das Leben festgelegt. Für Laien gibt es fünf Precepts (Ich werde niemanden töten, ich werde nicht lügen, ich werde nichts stehlen, ich werde mich nicht ungebührlich verhalten und ich werde keine berauschenden Substanzen konsumieren). Für Mönche gibt es viele mehr disziplinarische Regeln, die befolgt werden müssen. Die grundlegendeste lehrhafte Vorstellung im Buddhismus ist die Vorstellung der vier edlen Wahrheiten. Erstens, Dukkha; die Wahrheit, dass das Leben Leid ist. Zweitens, dass Anhaftung Leid verursacht. Drittens, dass Leid überwunden werden kann.\n\n[REWRITE]\nSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign. \nThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion. \nFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. [/REWRITE]\n\n\n",

The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.

Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.

Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).

Der Höhepunkt dieses Rivalitäten war der Mexikanisch-Amerikanische Krieg von 1846-1848, in dem die Vereinigten Staaten Mexiko angriffen und besiegten und sich Texas und den amerikanischen Südwesten als neues Territorium sicherte.  Es gab viele weitere Zusammenstöße zwischen den beiden Nationen, die schließlich kurz vor dem Ersten Weltkrieg nachließen.  Die Rivalität begann, als Amerikaner und Mexikaner über grundlegende Fragen wie Religion, Kultur und Traditionen kollidierten und es zu einem großen Interessenkonflikt kam (Schmitt 1974 S. 30-31).\n\nDies ist nicht anders als bei vielen anderen Nationen, die eine dauerhafte Rivalität mit einem Nachbarn haben. Nationen, die eine gemeinsame Grenze teilen, neigen dazu, Interessenkonflikte zu haben, die zur Entstehung von Rivalitäten zwischen den Nationen führen. Die Vereinigten Staaten und Mexiko gleichen vielen anderen dauerhaften Rivalitäten zwischen Nationen, die eine gemeinsame Grenze teilen. David M. Pletcher (1977) stellt fest: „Nur in Mexiko und Kuba findet man lang anhaltende übergreifende amerikanische diplomatische Probleme“ (S. 41). Tatsächlich sind beide dieser Nationen geographisch nahe bei den Vereinigten Staaten und waren Rivalen der Vereinigten Staaten, während andere Nationen in Lateinamerika gute Beziehungen zu den Vereinigten Staaten pflegen und gepflegt haben.\n\nReligiöse Fragen schufen einen Riss zwischen den beiden Nationen, ein Problem, das viele Nationen im Laufe der Geschichte plagte. Sally Frahm (2001) erklärt: „Wenn Amerikaner im 20. Jahrhundert gegen Faschismus und Kommunismus waren, waren sie im 18. und 19. Jahrhundert gegen Katholizismus und Monarchie“ (S. 86). Nicht anders als die Rivalität zwischen den Vereinigten Staaten und der Sowjetunion während des Kalten Krieges war zum Teil ein ideologischer Kampf und zum Teil ein Wettbewerb um Interessen, die jede Nation für lebensnotwendig hielt. In diesem Fall basierten die ideologischen Konflikte jedoch nicht auf der politischen Struktur, sondern auf den religiösen Vorlieben der Vereinigten Staaten und Mexikos. Dieses Misstrauen entstand aus dem Misstrauen zwischen Engländern und Spaniern. Der Erbschaft dieser Misstrauensgefühle von ihren ehemaligen Kolonialherren stellte ein wichtiges Hindernis für die Errichtung freundschaftlicher ausländischer Beziehungen zwischen den Vereinigten Staaten und Mexiko dar.\n\nDiehl und Goerts (2000) führen 17 Streitigkeiten zwischen Mexiko und den Vereinigten Staaten im Zeitraum der 57-jährigen Rivalität auf. Die Mehrheit der Streitigkeiten aus dem von Diehl und Goerts beschriebenen Rivalitätszeitraum sind territoriale Angelegenheiten, die sich aus Grenzüberschreitungen von mexikanischem Territorium nach Mexiko und anderen Grenzproblemen ergeben. Grenzüberschreitungen von Banditen und Gesetzlosen aus amerikanischen Grenzstädten waren ein großes Problem, das bis zum Zeitpunkt anhielt, als sowohl die Vereinigten Staaten als auch Mexiko militärische Gewalt an ihren Grenzen ausübten (Schmitt 1974 S. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) erläutert, dass die Rivalität zwischen den beiden Nationen begann, nachzulassen, „als Mexiko in erheblichem Maße von den Vereinigten Staaten abhängig wurde“ (S. 109) und schließlich endete, als sich die amerikanischen Ambitionen „von der territorialen Expansion zur wirtschaftlichen Intervention in Mexiko“ (S. 110) im späten 19.

Ich hatte meinen Beruf aus einem tief verwurzelten Bedürfnis nach Sicherheit und Geborgenheit gewählt, das mir in meiner Kindheit fehlte.  “Du wirst immer Arbeit finden; Menschen werden immer krank sein.” Das war das Mantra, das ich immer wieder hörte, als ich ins Erwachsenenalter trat und darüber hinaus. Also – obwohl mein Traum war, Wissenschaftlerin oder Journalistin zu sein – vorzugsweise ein bisschen von beidem – wählte ich die Krankenpflege. \n\nNichtsdestotrotz war ich dort: 46 Jahre alt und ledig, kein Geld auf dem Konto und nicht in der Lage zu arbeiten. Bis heute bin ich behindert, und nach 15 Jahren, in denen ich von der Sozialhilfe gelebt habe, habe ich buchstäblich nichts mehr, das ich als meines bezeichnen kann. Ich komme über die Runden, aber jeder Tag ist ein Kampf und eine Angriffsform auf meine Sicherheit, meinen Schutz und mein Selbstwertgefühl. Nichts in meinem Leben ist mehr sicher, doch es gibt eine Sache, die ich weiß: Ich hätte ohne die Hilfe meiner Familie und einiger guter Freunde diese Jahre nicht überstanden, egal wie stark ich war. Und glauben Sie mir, wenn eine echte Katastrophe eintritt, fühlen Sie sich überhaupt nicht stark. \n\nMein Punkt ist, dass es im Leben immer wieder, groß und klein, Notfälle geben wird.

Gibt es Einschränkungen oder Beschränkungen, die die Richtung des evolutionären Wandels beeinflussen? Obwohl D’Arcy Thompson 1917 feststellte: „Selbst jetzt hat der Zoologe kaum angefangen, die einfachsten organischen Formen in mathematischer Sprache zu definieren“, lässt sich das heute immer noch sagen. In jüngerer Zeit wurde mathematisches Modellieren auf allgemeine Aspekte der Mollusken-Skeletogenese durch Ontogenese und Phylogenie angewendet (z. B. Raup und Stanley, 1981). Unsere Studie untersucht, wie mathematisches Modellieren des ontogenetischen und phylogenetischen Wandels bei Prunum in Kombination mit experimentellen Studien verwendet werden kann, um die Mechanismen, die die Richtung und die Größe des evolutionären-entwicklungsbedingten Wandels beeinflussen, aufzudecken. Wir nutzten X-radiographische Bilder von Prunum-Arten, um quantitative Parameter zu definieren, die ihrerseits verwendet werden konnten, um hypothetische und tatsächliche Skelettmorphologien zu modellieren. Diese Parameter wurden in das Softwareprogramm CerioShell (Stone, 1995) eingegeben. Wir modellierten hypothetische Schalenmorphologien, die zur Interpretation der Grenzen möglicher morphologischer Veränderungen bei Prunum verwendet werden konnten. Diese Ergebnisse werden mit experimentellen und deskriptiven Studien kombiniert, um Makroevolutionäre Ereignisse in dieser Klade besser zu verstehen.\n\nEine Schale kann als eine Struktur betrachtet werden, die sich im Laufe der Zeit durch 360 Grad Raum bewegt. Diese Revolutionen oder Wendungen einer gekrümmten Schale werden Wirbel genannt und werden als spirale um eine imaginäre zentrale Achse betrachtet. Diese Achse verläuft durch die zentrale Säule der Schale und wird als Columella bezeichnet. Die Geschwindigkeit, mit der sich die Wirbel vergrößern können, variiert. Eine kontinuierliche Linie trennt jeden Wirbel und wird als Naht bezeichnet. Bei den meisten Schalen ist das größte Wirbel die letzte Wirbel (Körperwirbel). Die Spitze wird als alle Wirbel außer dem letzten betrachtet. Die Spitze ist die Spitze der Spitze und die gegenüberliegende Seite wird als Basis bezeichnet. Das Tier erstreckt sich durch eine Öffnung, die als Öffnung bezeichnet wird, aus seiner Schale.\n\nSchalen können in apikaler, basal, aperturaler und abaperturaler Ansicht betrachtet werden. (Die \"übliche\" Ausrichtung einer Schale ist eine apertural Ansicht, mit der Öffnung zum Betrachter und mit der Spitze nach oben.)\n\nEine Methode zum Zählen von Wirbeln wird unten gezeigt. Zuerst sollte die Schale aus der apikalen Ansicht betrachtet werden und dann sollte bestimmt werden, wo die erste Naht beginnt. Eine Linie kann dann gezeichnet werden, die die Schale in zwei Teile teilt. Die Wirbel werden von dieser Linie gezählt und auf ein Viertel eines Wirbels geschätzt.\n\nEine Schale kann als eine Reihe von Öffnungen betrachtet werden, die sich durch Zeit und Raum bewegen, während sich das Tier akkumulierert (d. h. aufbaut) seine Schale. Es ist möglich, den Pfad der Öffnung anhand der Koordinaten des Zentrums der Öffnung jedes Wirbels sowie des horizontalen und vertikalen Radius der Öffnung zu verfolgen.\n\nDiese Trajektorie kann graphisch und mathematisch dargestellt werden. Sobald eine mathematische Formulierung erstellt wurde, ist es dann möglich, Parameter zu variieren und die Skeletogenese des Mollusks zu modifizieren.\n\n\n\n## Rewritten English:\n\n[REWRITE] Why do organisms evolve in the way they do?

Obwohl das Land auf dem Weg ist, viele der Millennium-Entwicklungsziele zu erreichen, wie z.B. die Ziele für Wasser und Sanitärversorgung, liegen die Verbesserungsraten für die Gesundheit von Kindern und Müttern weit unter den Fortschritten, die bis 2015 benötigt werden, um die Ziele zu erreichen.  Die vielfältigen Gründe für diese Mängel werden im Folgenden diskutiert und weisen auf die Notwendigkeit hin, das Gesundheitssystem zu stärken, anstatt sich auf programmatische Interventionen zu konzentrieren.\n\nIndonesien hat Fortschritte bei der Anzahl der Geburten mit einem qualifizierten Gesundheitspersonal gemacht, wobei 72 % der Geburten dieses Ziel erreichen.  Gleichzeitig umfasst diese Kategorie auch traditionelle Arbeiter, wie z.B. Hebammen, die bei Komplikationen während der Schwangerschaft keine medizinischen Eingriffe durchführen können (daher der hohe Prozentsatz an maternen Todesfällen durch Blutungen).  Mit anderen Worten, die in diesem speziellen Indikator erzielten Verbesserungen sind etwas irreführend und es gibt noch viel Arbeit zu tun.  Darüber hinaus ist der Anteil an Durchfallfällen bei Kindern unter fünf Jahren, die von einem medizinischen Fachpersonal behandelt werden, gesunken.  Obwohl die Daten zur postnatalen Versorgung unvollständig sind, ist klar, dass dies ebenfalls ein Bereich des Bedauerns ist, mit niedrigen Raten im ganzen Land.\n\nDie Kaiserschnittquoten sind noch immer niedriger als erwartet, etwa 4 %.  Die Kaiserschnittquoten weisen zusätzlich auf ein weiteres besorgniserregendes Problem hin.  Während die Kaiserschnittquote in städtischen Gebieten bei 7 % liegt, beträgt sie in ländlichen Gebieten nur 2 %.  Dies zeigt das Problem der Gerechtigkeit im Zugang zu Leistungen im ganzen Land.  Es ist klar, dass der Zugang zu Gesundheitsleistungen auf städtische Gebiete konzentriert ist.  Ein weiteres Problem im Zugang betrifft die vertikale Gleichberechtigung.  Es gibt eine 27%-Lücke in der Nutzung von Leistungen zwischen den ärmsten und reichsten Fünftel.  Es ist klar, dass die Armen es viel schwerer haben, Zugang zu Gesundheitsleistungen zu erhalten, wahrscheinlich aufgrund von Selbstzahlungen.\n\nBei der Diskussion der nächsten Schritte zur Verbesserung der Indikatoren für die Versorgung von Neugeborenen und Müttern stellt sich die grundlegendste Frage, wie man den Mangel an Leistungen am effektivsten angehen kann.  Konkret: Sollte Indonesien programmspezifische Ansätze entwickeln oder das allgemeine Gesundheitssystem stärken, ohne sich auf die Vorsorge- und Nachsorge für Mutter und Kind zu konzentrieren?  Es steht außer Frage, dass programmatische Ansätze, um die oben beschriebenen Probleme zu lösen, attraktiv sind.  Nicht nur haben \"vertikale Ansätze\", die einen Sektor der Verbesserungen betreffen, viel gezieltere und überschaubare Ziele, sie erzielen im Allgemeinen auch schnellere Ergebnisse.  Es gibt jedoch einige Nachteile zu beachten.  Ein Hauptnachteil ist, dass die intensive Investition in Programme für einen bestimmten Bereich des Gesundheitswesens oft bedeutet, dass die Finanzierung für andere Bereiche leidet und menschliche Ressourcen zu dem Bereich wandern, der mehr Ressourcen hat (der Effekt der internationalen Finanzierung des HIV/AIDS und seine Auswirkungen auf den Bereich der Familienplanung ist ein Beispiel).  Darüber hinaus führt die Durchführung mehrerer paralleler Programme für einen Bereich zu einer Überschneidung von Leistungen, die auch zwischen den Programmen nicht koordiniert sind.  Dies führt zu einem Anstieg von Formularen und Papierkram für Lieferungen und Finanzierung.\n\n\n\n**[REWRITE]\nThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia has remained rather stable over the last ten years.

Zwei Romane, die zwar als viktorianisch gelten, aber von dieser Tradition abweichen, sind „Oliver Twist“ und „Wuthering Heights“. Beide Romane verwenden ein Element des Mysteriums und eine Vorliebe für das Bizarre, was untypisch für die Romane der damaligen Zeit ist, und stärkt die Charaktere in jedem Werk; sie liefern Einblicke, die ihre Motive und Emotionen erläutern. \n\n„Und jetzt drängten sich eine Vielzahl verwirrender und verwirrender Ideen in seinen Geist. Er schien immer noch zwischen Sikes und Crackit zu gehen, die wütend stritten: denn die Worte, die sie sagten, klangen in seinen Ohren; und als er seine eigene Aufmerksamkeit auf sich lenkte, … fand er, dass er zu ihnen sprach…. Plötzlich sprang er zurück bei dem Knall von Schusswaffen zurück; und es erhoben sich laute Rufe und Schreie in die Luft; Lichter flackerten vor seinen Augen, und alles war Lärm und Tumult, als eine unsichtbare Hand ihn eilends wegtrug. Durch all diese schnellen Visionen lief ein undefinierbares, unruhiges Bewusstsein von Schmerz, das ihn unablässig quälte.“ \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\nDie beiden Romane nutzen dieses Mysterium oft durch Traumsequenzen oder traumähnliche Zustände, obwohl der Inhalt und die Funktion in jedem spezifischen Fall variieren. Bei „Oliver Twist“ offenbaren diese seltsamen Ereignisse oft Einblicke in Oliver‘s innere Schichten, was ihn quält und sein Bewusstsein über die wahre Natur der ihn umgebenden Dinge. Wenn die Schießerei von Oliver schließlich im Kapitel 28 wiederaufgenommen wird, erfährt Oliver die Schießerei lebhaft, als wäre er träumen, während er Hilfe sucht (siehe links). Der Abschnitt betont den Mangel an Kontrolle, den Oliver über die sich abspielenden Ereignisse hatte, sowie die verzweifelte Lage, in der sich seine Gesundheit befand, was stark durch Olivers Halluzinationen von Sikes und Crackit zum Ausdruck kam. Die Schießerei selbst überwältigt ihn; alle seine Sinne werden betäubt, da er die „unsichtbare Hand“ nicht bemerkt, die ihn wegträgt; er erlebt sein Verzweiflung erneut, getrennt vom Schock des Schmerzes, da der Schmerz nun ständig ist und mit Angst verbunden ist, anstatt mit Überraschung. Da Oliver überwältigt wird, stellt sich die Frage, wessen Wille sein Unglück verursacht hat, denn es war sicher nicht sein eigener. Diese Schießerei verstärkt die Vorstellung, dass Oliver wenig Kontrolle über etwas hat, da er sich nicht einmal bemühen kann, das Ergebnis eines Ereignisses zu kontrollieren, auch wenn sein Leben in Gefahr ist. Ein wachsendes Gefühl der Niederlage bei Oliver wird auch in diesem Abschnitt angedeutet, als wäre altes Fagin ihn gebrochen und ihn gezwungen, diese Verzweiflung anzunehmen, was seine Fähigkeit, zu reagieren, beeinflusst. Denn ansonsten kann man annehmen, dass Oliver zumindest aus dem Interesse an seinem eigenen Leben einen Versuch unternommen hätte.\n\n\n„Der Tag verging – Tag!

Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flair for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions. \n\n\"And now, a multitude of bewildering and confusing ideas crowded upon his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of firearms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights flashed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as if an unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which wore and tormented him incessantly.\" \n(Dickens, 220)\n\nThese two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function vary in each specific case. In \"Oliver Twist\" these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straits his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n\"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as it came – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\"",

Ich habe mein Bestes gegeben, um ihnen bei allen Fächern zu helfen, in denen sie Schwierigkeiten hatten, aber meine Stärken lagen in Englisch und Lesen. Eine der Lehrerinnen fragte mich, ob ich einem kleinen Jungen namens Adrian helfen könnte (ich glaube, er war in der dritten oder vierten Klasse), der große Probleme mit dem Lesen hatte. Es wurde mir klar, dass etwas nicht stimmte; er hatte die merkwürdigsten Probleme. Einige Buchstaben konnte er perfekt aussprechen, andere überhaupt nicht, es war das Seltsamste. Wissen Sie, er war lateinamerikanischer Abstammung, das war mir sicher, aber der Junge sprach fließend Englisch. Wir kämpften weiter, bis zum Tag, an dem ich seine Mutter traf. Ich half dabei, ein paar Kinder zu betreuen (um es mal so zu nennen), während der Rest der Nachmittagsgruppe auf einem Ausflug war, als seine Mutter hereintrat. Seine Mutter sprach kein Wort Englisch, nur Spanisch. Mit meinem sehr schlechten Spanischkenntnissen (ich lernte gerade erst), gelang es uns, zu kommunizieren. Aber in diesem Moment wurde mir etwas klar: Adrian konnte lesen, er kannte aber das englische Alphabet nicht sehr gut. Ich weiß nicht, ob diese Erkenntnis ihm jemals viel geholfen hat, aber ich hoffe, dass es ihm jetzt besser geht.\n\nIch erzähle diese Geschichte, um das Problem der Sprachbarriere in Schulen, insbesondere hier in Kalifornien, zu beleuchten. Ich erzähle es auch, um zu beweisen, dass es nicht immer so offensichtlich ist, wie wir denken. Auch für ein Kind, das fließend Englisch spricht, kann das Lesen eine große Herausforderung sein. Ich denke, jeder kann sich einig sein, dass dieses Problem existiert, also was tun wir? Im Fall von Adrian war die Lösung recht einfach: Nachhilfe in englischem Lesen, insbesondere im Bereich Alphabet und Aussprache. Aber für viele Kinder, die kaum Englisch sprechen, ist die Lösung viel komplexer. Es gibt keine einzige Antwort. Das zweisprachige System, der direkte Eintauchen in die Mehrheitskultur, private Nachhilfelehrer, Englisch als Zweitsprache-Kurse, keine dieser Dinge allein wird dieses Problem lösen. Der Schlüssel liegt darin, all diese Elemente zu kombinieren!\n\nZunächst einmal ist das zweisprachige System eine großartige Idee. Nicht nur für Kinder, deren Muttersprache Spanisch ist, sondern für alle Kinder. \"Kinder in zweirichtungigen bilingualen Bildungsprogrammen haben im Vergleich zu ihren Altersgenossen bessere akademische Leistungen erzielt.\" Um diese Idee ranken sich viele Ängste, dass es eine Verschwendung von Ressourcen ist und dass die Mehrheit der Kinder in Schulen keinen Nutzen davon ziehen würde. Aber das stimmt nicht. Wenn wir diese Programme in den Klassenzimmer als Regel, anstatt als Ausnahme, anzuwenden, würden alle Kinder davon profitieren. Wie können wir das erreichen? Müssen alle Lehrer zweisprachig sein? Nein. Das wäre unvernünftig und etwas unrealistisch. Ich denke jedoch, dass es keinen Grund gibt, warum wir nicht spezielle Helfer, Nachhilfelehrer, wie man es immer nennen will, haben könnten, die zweisprachig sind.\n\n\n\n[REWRITE] A couple years ago, I worked in an after-school program tutoring elementary-age students.

Einige von uns werden in die Sonntagsschule geschickt, um darüber zu lernen, während andere in den Tempel gehen oder nach den Antworten in sich selbst suchen. Viele von uns akzeptieren bereitwillig die Religionen, die uns von unseren Eltern weitergegeben wurden. Einige von uns lehnen sie jedoch ganz und gar ab und bestreiten, dass es nichts gibt, das jenseits unseres eigenen egozentrischen Universums existieren kann. Wir können eine Werteordnung annehmen, nur um später unsere Meinung zu ändern und eine andere an ihre Stelle zu setzen. Welchen Weg wir auch wählen, wir reisen, um einen Teil uns selbst durch unsere eigenen einzigartigen Perspektiven der Spiritualität zu definieren. Wir suchen nach einem Licht in der Dunkelheit, das uns aus den Schatten und in die Sonne führt.\n\n“Ein Kardinal”, sagte mein Vater, als ich ihn fragte, welche Art von Vogel sein Lieblingsvogel sei. Wir saßen auf dem Veranda unserer Haus, und hörten, wie der Regen auf dem Blechdach dröhnte, während wir zusammen Zigaretten rauchten. Die Rinnsteine brachten den Regen herunter und ertränkten die Pflanzen am Rande der Veranda. Er blickte in den Regen, ein Blick, der halb suchend, halb erinnere war. Er war in den letzten Monaten dünner geworden, und seine Kleider hingen schlaff an ihm. Seine Haare waren weniger geworden, dünner als ich es mich erinnerte. Er starrte immer noch in den Regen und vermied den Augenkontakt. Ich fühlte mich allein, ängstlich und unfähig, mit meinem Vater darüber zu sprechen, wie sehr ich ihn vermissen würde, weil es nur alles für uns beide greifbarer machen würde. Ich umarmte ihn, setzte mich wieder hin, bewegte meinen Stuhl ein wenig näher zu ihm und schloß mich ihm an, um in den fallenden Regen der Juni-Dämmerung zu schauen.\n\nMein Vater starb im Dezember dieses Jahres, fünf Tage nach meinem 22. Geburtstag. Die Chemotherapie und die Strahlentherapie hatten mein Vaters Leiden nicht gelindert, aber er hatte ihm ein paar Monate länger das Leben erhalten als die Ärzte prognostiziert hatten; was der Wert war, als er nur länger litt, konnte ich nicht definieren.  Welcher Gott würde das tun, dachte ich mir. Einsam in der Nacht, betete ich keine Gebete. Wenn Gott existierte, dachte ich, er hörte seit langem nicht mehr auf mich.\n\nIch hatte nicht gewollt, zu beobachten, wie er von diesem Leben in ein anderes überging. Also habe ich es auch nicht getan. Ich konnte nicht zuschauen, wie das Leben, das mich erschaffen hatte, zu Ende ging.

Through the use of chivalric concepts and manners, the \"Gothic past\" becomes idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have begun to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the Gothic era had been somehow lost in the individuals that make up 'present' society. In his writing, this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits; he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels.

    "transformed": "The traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in essence and in name, an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of lacking real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"ancient\" and \"modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre and a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre draws heavily on medieval Gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the characters' psychology) is what allows Gothic to endure for such a long time, becoming both obsolete and new to a reader significantly removed in time from the original writing.\nOne of the most prominent Gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transformed in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal that those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society.

Der Begriff Lieferkettenmanagement wurde 1982 von Keith Oliver, einem Berater, erfunden. Keith Oliver beschrieb den gesamten Prozess der Planung, Implementierung und Kontrolle dessen, was in der Lieferkette geschieht, um die Bedürfnisse der Kunden schnell und effizient zu erfüllen.  Es gibt sechs Schlüsselkomponenten einer Lieferkette: Produktion, Versorgung, Lagerhaltung, Standort, Transport und Information. Manager von Unternehmen verwenden diese sechs Schlüsselkomponenten, um den besten Kundenservice für die Kunden zu bieten. \n\nDie Produktion ist der erste Schritt im Lieferkettenprozess. Die Produktion bildet die Grundlage für den gesamten Lieferkettenprozess. Die Produktionsstufe wird festlegen, wann, warum, wo und wie alles produziert werden soll. Manager müssen wissen, was die Kunden wollen. Damit Manager wissen, was Kunden wollen, können sie den Markt betrachten. Der Markt ist der wichtigste Indikator, um zu entscheiden, welche Kundenbedürfnisse bestehen. Sobald die Manager den Markt analysiert haben und die Kundennachfrage verstehen, sind sie bereit, zu entscheiden, welche Produkte produziert werden sollen und wie viele davon. Nachdem die Führungskräfte entschieden haben, was produziert und in welcher Menge, sind sie bereit, zu entscheiden, wo die Produkte hergestellt werden sollen und welches Werk für das Volumen und die Qualität der Ware am besten geeignet ist, unter Berücksichtigung der Tatsache, dass die Kundennachfrage und -zufriedenheit erfüllt werden müssen. Nachdem der Produktionsort für die Produkte festgelegt wurde, konzentriert sich der nächste Schritt auf die Planung der Arbeitsaufträge und die Wartung der Ausrüstung. Die Produktion ist ein sehr wichtiger Schritt im Lieferkettenprozess. Jeder Detail ist wichtig für den gesamten Prozess. Wenn nicht jedes Detail entsprechend geplant ist, kann es dem Unternehmen langfristig viel Zeit und Geld kosten. Zum Beispiel habe ich früher bei den Einzelhandelsgeschäften Wal-Mart und Target gearbeitet. Beide Unternehmen haben ein Design, eine Broschüre und einen Prozess für jede Einheit des Geschäfts. Es gibt eine festgelegte Anordnung, wie das Arbeitskleidung eines Mitarbeiters aussehen soll, bis hin zum Empfang von Sendungen von LKWs. Die Festlegung von Prozessen ermöglicht es einem Unternehmen, reibungslos zu arbeiten, ohne Verwirrung über Richtung und Erwartungen. \n\nDas zweite Schlüsselelement im Lieferkettenmanagement ist die Versorgung. Die Versorgung ist definiert als die strategischen Entscheidungen, die getroffen werden sollten, um die Kernkapazitäten einer Einrichtung festzulegen und die Partnerschaften im Rahmen der Auslagerung sollten aus diesen Entscheidungen hervorgehen. Ein Unternehmen kann viele verschiedene Produktionsabteilungen für ein einzelnes Produkt haben. Alle Abteilung bestehen aus unterschiedlichen Geräten, Arbeitskräften und Spezialisierungen. Der Manager muss entscheiden, welche Abteilung am besten für die verschiedenen Prozesse des Produkts geeignet ist. Die Führungskräfte können auch entscheiden, die Arbeit an andere Unternehmen auszugestalten. Der wichtigste Grund, warum ein Manager die Arbeit an andere Unternehmen auslagert, ist die Schaffung von Geschwindigkeit. Geschwindigkeit ist die Fähigkeit, Qualität und Flexibilität zu gewährleisten, gleichzeitig aber Kosten zu senken oder niedrige Kostensätze zu halten. \n\n\n\n**[REWRITE]\nSupply chain management is the flow of processes that move goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer.

Burma, auch bekannt als Myanmar, ist ein südöstasiatisches Land, das von einer tyrannischen Militärdiktatur regiert wird, die 1962 durch einen Militärputsch an die Macht kam. 2007 fanden mehrere Straßenproteste statt, die ersten öffentlichen Proteste in einem Jahrzehnt. Geleitet von einer großen Zahl burmesischer Mönche, erhielten diese Proteste den Namen „Die Saffran-Revolution“, benannt nach der Farbe der Gewänder, die die Mönche trugen. Nach den ersten Aufständen zeigte sich die breite Öffentlichkeit an den Protesten interessiert, und während die burmesische Regierung zunächst zögerlich den Mönchen erlaubte, friedliche Versammlungen abzuhalten, eskalierte die Gewalt bald in einen, was einige als einen offenen Krieg zwischen den Mönchen und der Militärjunta betrachteten, mit der aktiven Invasion und Plünderung von Klöstern im ganzen Land. Ausländische Journalisten wurden sofort verhaftet und eingesperrt, wobei der japanische Fotojournalist Kenji Nagai am 27. September 2007 einfach für seine Anwesenheit bei einem Straßenprotest getötet wurde. Während die offizielle Todesbilanz bei 13 Toten liegt, wird Oberstleutnant Hla Win, der einige Tage vor dem offiziellen Bericht aus der Armee desertierte, zitiert mit den Worten: „In den letzten Tagen wurden mehr Menschen getötet, als Sie gehört haben. Die Toten lassen sich in mehreren tausend zählen.“\n\nDas ist nichts Neues. Während dies einige der jüngsten Beispiele für Gräueltaten in unserer Welt sind, besteht der Wunsch einer Regierung, Dissidenten zu unterdrücken und die totale Kontrolle über ihre Bürger zu behalten, seit jeher. Frühe römische Kaiser erklärten sich für von den Göttern auserwählt, die vollständige Exekutivgewalt über alle Aspekte ihrer Gesellschaft zu besitzen. Es wird angenommen, dass japanische Kaiser tatsächlich Götter sind, die in unsere Welt gesandt wurden, um ihr Volk durch die Erfindung von Motorola-Handys und Hara-Kiri zum Wohlstand zu führen, und unser aktueller Präsident, George W. Bush, hat wöchentliche Videokonferenzen mit Ted Haggard, dem Leiter von „Stupid People Worldwide“, einer Tochtergesellschaft der Republikanischen Partei.\n\nEinige der bekanntesten Beispiele für diese Handlungen sind Vorfälle wie der Protest am 4. Juni 1989 auf dem Tiananmen-Platz, bei dem Intellektuelle, Arbeitskampf-Aktivisten und Studenten versammelten, um gegen die autoritäre Herrschaft der Regierung zu protestieren. Die Zahl der Todesopfer in diesem konkreten Fall schwankt stark, wobei offizielle Berichte der chinesischen Regierung 200-300 Tote angeben, während Berichte der Chinesischen Rotkreuz-Gesellschaft zwischen 2.000 und 3.000 Toten melden. Ein weiteres Beispiel ist der Völkermord in Ruanda in den 1990er Jahren, bei dem Hutu-Milizgruppen, unterstützt von der ruandischen Regierung, eine systematische Ermordung aller Tutsi sowie politischer Moderaten, unabhängig von ihrer ethnischen Zugehörigkeit, begannen. Hitlers „Drittes Reich“, eine Periode, die mehrere Jahre und mehrere Länder umfasste, in der alle Personen jüdischer Abstammung zusammengefasst und ermordet wurden, ist ein weiteres extremer Beispiel.\n\n\n\n[REWRITE]\n\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says. \n\nEllen Page, the star of *Juno*, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with a Sharpie onto her sign.

    "original": "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

Ellings’ Präsenz am Klavier ist in vielen der für diese Aufgabe ausgewählten Kompositionen subtil, aber als Komponist übertraf Ellington sich in der Schaffung von reichen und komplexen Stücken, die die individuellen Fähigkeiten der Bandmitglieder in den Vordergrund rückten. Ellington schuf den Rahmen, in dem ein Solist frei improvisieren konnte, zusätzlich zu fest arrangierten Stücken und Phrasen, die den jeweiligen Stil der Bandmitglieder einsetzten, um musikalische Ideen hervorzuheben. Dabei betonte er auch den Ton des Orchesters im Allgemeinen und schuf kohärente und originelle Klänge, die zu jedem Stück passten. Ellings’ Beherrschung des individuellen Sounds der Spieler sowie ihres Zusammenspiels in einem wachsenden Ensemble ermöglichte es ihm, einige der innovativsten und brillanteste Stücke in der Geschichte des Jazz zu schreiben.\n\nDas Grove Music-Lexikon erwähnt in seiner Betrachtung von Ellings’ Klang und Innovation „Creole Love Call“ in Bezug auf die Verwendung der Stimme „als Jazzinstrument“ über seine gesamte Karriere hinweg. Dies ist ein frühes Beispiel für Ellings’ Einsatz der Stimme, um Textur und Farbe hinzuzufügen, ohne durch Texte eingeschränkt zu sein. „Creole Love Call“ zeigt auch Ellings’ Fähigkeit, den Stil seiner Solisten zu ergänzen, was sich in seiner gesamten Karriere zeigt. Dieses langsame, bewusste Zwölf-Takte-Blues-Stück enthält sechs Strophen:\n\nStrophe 1: Call and Response zwischen Stimme und Holzbläsern, wobei die Stimme zunächst glatt und melodisch ist, dann am Ende zu einem raueren Klang übergeht.\nStrophe 2: Gedämpftes Trompetensolo, das die Grundmelodie weiterentwickelt und mehrere verlängerte Blues-Töne betont.\nStrophe 3: Schwepfendes Klarinettensolo in einem hohen Register, unterstützt von einem subtilen synkopierten Klavierakkord.\nStrophe 4: Das ganze Orchester wiederholt die erste Strophe mit einem Call and Response durch die Bläser- und Holzbläser-Sektionen.\nStrophe 5: Die klimaaktive Strophe des Stückes, da die Holzbläser nun den Call and Response in einem hohen Register beginnen, unterstützt von einem synkopierten Stop-Time der Bläser- und Rhythmus-Sektionen.\nStrophe 6: Rückkehr zur Struktur der ersten Strophe mit Call and Response zwischen Stimme und Holzbläsern. In dieser Strophe übernimmt die Stimme den Klang der „Growl“-Technik und spielt als Instrument solo.\nTag: Kurze Signatur mit einem Gesangspassagen und einem dissonanten Neuheitende durch ein Trombon.\n\nEllings’ Verwendung der Stimme, um der Komposition eine Dimension der Tonfarbe hinzuzufügen, ist ein Beispiel für ein Stilmerkmal, das sich in seiner gesamten Arbeit durchzieht. \n\nIn „Hot and Bothered“, aufgenommen ein Jahr später, kombiniert Ellington seinen Geschick im engen Arrangement mit seinem Gespür für Tonfarbe. Ein Call and Response-Motiv zwischen „Bubber“ Miley am gedämpften Trompeten und Baby Cox’s Scat-Gesang nutzt die Gesangselementen von Miley’s Spiel und die instrumentale Aspekte von Cox’ Stimme, um einen reichen und ergänzenden Klang zu erzeugen. „It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing)“ erweitert diese Ideen, da Ellington Joe „Tricky Sam“ Nanton, ein Stammmitglied in Ellings’ Orchester, mit großem Erfolg einsetzt, um die Melodie am gedämpften Trombon einzuführen.\n\n\n## Rewritten Text:\n\n[REWRITE]Duke Ellington's legacy in jazz stems largely from his longevity and, by extension, his creative ability to shape his orchestra. Ellington's presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer, he excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual talents of the band members. Ellington crafted a framework within which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called upon the particular style of each band member to highlight musical ideas. In doing so, he also emphasized the overall tone of the orchestra, creating coherent and original sounds to suit each piece. Ellington's mastery of the individual players' sound, as well as how they fit together as an ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary, when discussing Ellington's sound and innovation, mentions \"Creole Love Call\" as an example of his use of voice \"as a jazz instrument\" throughout his career. This is an early example of Ellington's use of voice to add texture and color without the constraints of lyrics. \"Creole Love Call\" also demonstrates Ellington's ability to complement the style of his soloists, something evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\n\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus, the voice takes on the sound of the \"growl\" technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \n\nIn \"Hot and Bothered\", recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley's playing and the instrumental aspects of Cox's voice to create a rich and complementary sound. \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing)\" extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington's orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

Es begann, als sie etwa 14 Jahre alt war, gerade in das Teenagerleben eingestiegen. Und es war immer noch da 3 Jahre später, im Alter von 17 Jahren. Mittlerweile hatte sie beschlossen, dass sie jemanden und nicht ein Objekt wollte. Trotzdem hatte sie kein Interesse an irgendwelchen Jungen gezeigt. Einige waren von ihr angezogen worden, hatten die unangenehmen Versuche unternommen, die Unverwundbare zu umschwärmen, aber niemand hat sie angesprochen. Sie stellte sich oft diese seltsame Vorstellung zur Rede und versuchte zu überlegen, was denn möglicherweise so etwas seltsames mit einem Teenagermädchen auslösen konnte. Die wenigen Jahre der Betrachtung hatten Theorien hervorgebracht, aber nichts, das gut genug war, damit sie wirklich darüber spekulieren konnte. Also lebte sie ihr Leben und stellte ständig ihre Wünsche in Frage.\n\nEin Tag zu Hause war in der Regel eine friedliche Angelegenheit. Ihre Eltern waren gute und ruhige Menschen. Sie stritten nie miteinander und seltsamerweise waren auch Streitigkeiten mit ihrer Tochter sehr selten. Das einzige, worüber sie sich jemals stritten, war ihre Behauptung ihrer Unabhängigkeit und ihrer freien Persönlichkeit. Sie war die Tochter eines sehr ruhigen Paares, aber sie konterte ihre Energien mit ihrer umfangreichen und unterhaltsamen Persönlichkeit, was sie in Kombination mit der Tatsache, dass sie eine nette Person war, sehr sympathisch machte.\n\nHeute war es aber kein ruhiger Tag. Als sie von Raum zu Raum ging und versuchte, neue Inspiration für sich selbst zu finden, hörte sie einen kurzen Schrei aus der Küche, den Klang ihrer Mutter's wunderschöner Stimme. Sie rannte in den Raum und begann in Panik zu fragen: \"Mama?! Mama, was ist los?!\" Sie sah ihre Mutter am Boden liegen, die scheinbar Schmerzen hatte und ständig \"Au\" in kurzen Atemzügen sagte. Die Tochter der Mutter rannte zu ihrer Seite und legte ihre Hand auf sie, um ihr zu helfen. \"Au ... Süße, ich ... brauche, dass du mich zum - Krankenhaus fährst.\" Die Worte waren eilig und zusammengequetscht und ihre Tochter konnte erkennen, dass sie starke Schmerzen hatte. \"Okay Mom, sag mir nur, wo ich dich abholen kann.\" Ihre Mutter zeigte mit den Händen und in diesem Moment war die Heldin des Hauses sehr dankbar, dass sie Kurse besucht hatte, um sich zu stärken. Sie trug ihre Mutter zum Auto, legte sie hinten liegend hinein und fuhr los.\n\nEin Besuch beim Krankenhaus brachte Gerüche von Desinfektionsmittel und Krankheit, vermischt mit Angst. Aber sie spürte das nicht, denn ihr Geist war zu beschäftigt damit, ihrer Mutter zu helfen. Sie trug die verletzte Frau schnell herein und rief nach Hilfe bei den Ärzten.

    "original": "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity.

Die Arbeitslosigkeit stieg, der Immobilienmarkt brach zusammen und viele der größten und wichtigsten Unternehmen Amerikas wurden zerstört. Diese Rezession hält bis heute an, daher müssen wir uns die Frage stellen: Wie kam es zu dieser Krise und wie können wir sie stoppen? Kurz gesagt, die Finanzkrise wurde durch egoistisches und naives politisches Handeln verursacht, das Banken und Unternehmen dazu drängte, subprime-Kredite in eine bereits unreife und unzureichende finanzielle Infrastruktur zu vergeben. Währenddessen wurden Fannie Mae (FNMA) und Freddie Mac (FHLMC) unter Druck gesetzt, diese Hypotheken in CDOs und CDSs zu unterzeichnen und zu verpacken. Als die Kreditnehmer diese Kredite nicht zurückzahlten, fehlten den Banken die Kapitalreserven und sie übertrugen diese Chaos auf die verpackten Hypotheken, die sie verkauft hatten, und auf den Rest der Wirtschaft.\n\nDie Finanzkrise hatte ihre Wurzeln im Jahr 1999 in der Ära Clinton, als der Präsident sich um eine zweite Amtszeit bemühte. Er strebte danach, seine Präsidentschaft zu verlängern, indem er seine Popularität erhöhte. Um dies zu erreichen, löste die Clinton-Administration die Kreditbeschränkungen auf, was sieben Jahre später die Bühne für die Subprime-Krise bereitete. Steven Holmes vom New York Times berichtete 1999: „Fannie Mae, der größte Vermittler von Hypotheken in der Nation, steht unter wachsendem Druck der Clinton-Administration, Kredite für Menschen mit niedrigem und mittlerem Einkommen zu erweitern, und fühlt den Druck der Aktionäre, das phänomenale Wachstum der Gewinne zu erhalten.“ Holmes würde voraussagen, welche Folgen diese Handlungen haben würden: „Aber die staatlich subventionierte Körperschaft könnte in einer wirtschaftlichen Krise in Schwierigkeiten geraten und eine staatliche Rettung ähnlich wie die der Spar- und Kreditanstalt in den 1980er Jahren erforderlich machen.“ Wie im Einleitungsteil und wie Holmes vorausgesagt hat, würden schlecht überlegte Kredite sicherlich zu einem Zusammenbruch der Wirtschaft führen.\n\nViele Faktoren führten dazu, dass die Wirtschaft in eine Talfahrt geriet, darunter die neue und komplexe Struktur von Hypotheken. Variable-Rate-Hypotheken, hypothekenbesichert Wertpapiere und Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs) wurden in den Jahren vor der Krise weit verbreitet eingesetzt und dienten nur dazu, weitere Sektoren der Wirtschaft an den Immobilienmarkt zu binden. Dies führte dazu, dass sich US-Haushalte und Finanzmärkte im Allgemeinen im Immobilienmarkt überzeichneten und dadurch extrem anfällig für selbst kleine Preisänderungen wurden.\n\nIn der Tat platzte die Immobilienblase, und die Finanzinstitute, die diese hypothekenbesicherten Wertpapiere gekauft hatten, wurden geschädigt. Die fünf größten US-Investmentbanken meldeten zusammen im Jahr 2007 Hypothekenverbindlichkeiten in Höhe von 4,1 Billionen US-Dollar, was etwa 30% des Bruttoinlandsprodukts der USA ausmachte. Am Ende wurden Bear Sterns und Merrill Lynch zu einem sehr niedrigen Preis verkauft, Lehman Brothers wurde aufgelöst und Goldman Sachs und Morgan Stanley wurden gezwungen, zu kommerziellen Banken zu werden, die einer intensiven Regulierung unterworfen waren. Fannie und Freddie hatten 5 Billionen US-Dollar Hypothekenverschuldung und wurden im September 2008 unter staatliche Kontrolle gestellt.\n\n[REWRITE]\nIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corporations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and insufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwrite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repackaged mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\nThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this, the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the subprime crisis seven years later.

Exposition ist der kleine Teufel, der auf deiner Schulter sitzt und sagt, dass man die Geschichte aus dem Weg räumen soll, um zu den guten Teilen zu kommen (nicht zu verwechseln mit dem Teufel auf der anderen Schulter, der den Autor dazu drängt, dem Publikum jedes einzelne Detail über die Kindheit jedes Charakters zu erzählen).\n\nExposition bedeutet, dem Publikum zu erzählen, was passiert ist, in der Regel in einfacher Sprache. Im Film geschieht die Exposition, wenn ein Charakter einem anderen einen Datenblock Informationen wie \"Die Ballade des alten Seefahrers\" erzählt. In der Fiktion ist es der Autor, der erzählt.\n\nEin Beispiel ist angebracht. Wenn du eine Geschichte liest, wird dir erzählt, dass die Heldin ihren Geliebten an einem bestimmten Ort und zu einer bestimmten Zeit getroffen hat, dass sie standesgemäß geheiratet haben und dass ihr Mann vor ihren Augen ermordet wurde. Du würdest nicht erwarten, dass dieser ganze Ablauf zwei Seiten in Anspruch nimmt, während er und sie jeweils nur zwei Zeilen Dialoge haben. Du würdest erwarten, dass der Autor etwas Zeit mit der Charakterisierung des Mannes verbringt und durch seine Sprache und seinen Charakter zeigt, wie sehr er seine Frau liebt, und du würdest genauso erwarten, dass die Heldin auf große und kleine Weise zeigt, wie sehr sein Auftreten in ihrem Leben ihr Leben verändert und bereichert hat (insbesondere, wenn die Geschichte dir später zu verstehen gibt, dass dies der Fall war). Eine richtige Einführung in den Charakter des Mannes würde dir erlauben, sich emotional mit seinem Schicksal zu verbinden und würde dir Einblicke in die Charaktere der Heldin geben: was sie an ihm sah, wie tief ihre Verbindung war, Hinweise auf ihre Gedanken, Überzeugungen und Träume, die sich durch das Prisma seiner Augen widerspiegeln, und so weiter. Du würdest seinen Tod mit ihr trauern und würdest so noch stärker mit der Heldin verbunden sein.\n\nKurz gesagt, du würdest Fleisch auf dem einfachen Knochen der Handlung erwarten: \"Sie trafen sich, sie heirateten, er starb.\"\n\nAls Schriftsteller musst du dieses Fleisch liefern. (*blickt auf die Metapher, seufzt und stürzt weiter vorwärts*) Manchmal ist es verlockend, an bestimmten Dingen vorbei zu hetzen. Vielleicht stellst du einen neuen Charakter vor, und du weißt, dass er früher in der Luftwaffe war, jetzt ist er Nachtmanager an einer Tankstelle, er war zweimal verheiratet, hat keine Kinder, fährt am Wochenende gerne Angeln und träumt heimlich davon, eines Tages die Tankstelle zu besitzen, und hatte am Morgen Benedikt-Eier.\n\n\n[REWRITE]\nAh, Exposition.

Die Hauptmeldung handelte von einem Mann aus Ashley, Ohio, der seine Frau erstochen hatte. Der Name der Frau wurde nicht genannt, aber der des Mannes war Shad Hostettler. Man zeigte sein Polizeifoto, und er sah aus wie pure Böse. Sie widmeten ungefähr zwei Minuten dieser Geschichte, da sie sich noch entwickelte. Die einzigen Details, die sie lieferten, waren, dass er sie mehrmals gestochen und festgenommen worden war. Ich denke, sie haben angemessene Zeit für diese Geschichte verwendet.\n\nDie zweite Geschichte handelte von einer Schießerei in den frühen Morgenstunden an Travis Buyers, 18. Er wurde im Bereich Sharon Woods erschossen und schwer verletzt; es gab zu diesem Zeitpunkt keine Festnahmen oder Verdächtige. Das SWAT-Team ermittelte. Diese Geschichte schien kurz zu sein, und ich glaube, das lag daran, dass es sich um einen „schwarzen“ Mann oder eine schwarze Nachbarschaft handelte. Ich habe bemerkt (und das schon seit Jahren), dass Minderheiten übersehen werden, wenn sie Opfer eines Verbrechens sind. Wenn ein „weißer“ Kind oder erwachsener Entführt oder vermisst wird oder Opfer eines Verbrechens wird, geht die Medien verrückt; aber wenn es sich um eine Person aus einer Minderheit handelt, wird es Glück sein, wenn es überhaupt erwähnt wird.\n\nDie nächste Geschichte handelte vom Schussloch, das in der Med-Flight-Helikopter gefunden worden war. Es wurden Angaben gemacht, wo man glaubte, der Vorfall sei passiert. Es war festgestellt worden, dass es sich um eine .22-Kaliber-Kugel aus einem Gewehr handelte, die den Helikopter getroffen hatte. Crime-Stoppers bieten eine fünftausend Dollar Belohnung für Hinweise, die zur Festnahme des Schützen führen.\n\nDie nächste Geschichte handelte von dem Regen und den Gewittern, die für den Samstagnachmittag vorhergesagt wurden. Sie sagten, die Temperaturen würden über das Wochenende zwischen 29 und 32 Grad Celsius liegen. Die Länge der Zeit war etwas kurz, aber sie wollten es als „Vorschau“ verwenden, damit Sie dranbleiben.\n\nSie berichteten auch über einen Überfall auf einen UDF an der Clime Road in Columbus. Sie sagten, es sei ein dunkelhäutiger schwarzer Mann gewesen, der den Laden überfallen hatte. Er habe einen Kapuzenpullover getragen. Sie sagten, er sei etwa 1,80 Meter groß und wiege etwa 70 Kilogramm. Ich fand, dass sie ungewöhnlich viel Zeit damit verbrachten, darauf zu betonen, dass er schwarz war und wie dunkel er war.\n\nEine weitere Geschichte handelte von Rene Rodriguez, einem verurteilten Drogenboss aus Texas. Er war wegen des Verschwörung, große Mengen Marihuana von Texas nach Ohio zu vertreiben, verurteilt worden. Eine merkwürdige Sache, die ich bemerkte, war, dass sie anstatt zu sagen, er sei zu 25 Jahren Gefängnis verurteilt worden, sagten „300“ Monate. Ich bin mir nicht sicher, was der Hintergrund war, ob sie dachten, das klinge härter oder was auch immer. Sie erwähnten auch, dass er ein hispanischer Mann sei, glaube ich nicht, dass das wirklich relevant für die Geschichte war.\n\n\n [REWRITE]\nI watched two newscasts from Columbus, Ohio.

I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story.",

As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means.

    "raw_output": "## German Translation:\n\nDas menschliche Gehirn ist ein kompliziertes, kreatives System zur Informationsverarbeitung. Mit dem technologischen Fortschritt von primitiv zu modern entwickelten sich auch die Metaphern, die zum Beschreiben des Gehirns verwendet wurden. Anfangs wurde es mit einer WachsTablette verglichen, dann mit einem Papyrusblatt, dann mit einem Buch und zuletzt mit einem Computer. Denken Sie daran, dass die Nützlichkeit dieser Metaphern begrenzt ist und zu falschen Schlussfolgerungen führen kann, wenn Sie mehr über das Gehirn lernen.\n\nDie Informationsverarbeitung beginnt mit Eingaben von den Sinnesorganen, die physikalische Reize wie Berührung, Wärme, Schallwellen oder Lichtphotonen in elektrochemische Signale umwandeln. Die sensorischen Informationen werden durch die Algorithmen des Gehirns sowohl nach oben als auch nach unten verarbeitet. Zum Beispiel, wenn Sie ein Bild eines schwarzen Quadrats auf einem weißen Hintergrund betrachten, verarbeitet die Verarbeitung von unten nach oben einfache Informationen wie Farbe, Ausrichtung und die Grenzen des Objekts – wo sich die Farbe in einem kurzen Abstand stark ändert – um zu entscheiden, dass Sie ein Quadrat sehen. Die Verarbeitung von oben nach unten nutzt die Entscheidungen, die in einigen Schritten der Verarbeitung von unten nach oben getroffen wurden, um die Erkennung des Quadrats zu beschleunigen. Die Verarbeitung von oben nach unten könnte in diesem Beispiel Ihnen helfen, das Objekt als schwarzes Quadrat und nicht als quaderförmiges Loch auf dem weißen Hintergrund zu identifizieren.\n\nSobald Informationen zu einem bestimmten Grad verarbeitet wurden, entscheidet ein Filter der Aufmerksamkeit, wie wichtig das Signal ist und welche kognitiven Prozesse es zur Verfügung gestellt werden soll. Zum Beispiel verarbeitet Ihr Gehirn zwar jedes einzelne Grashalm, wenn Sie auf Ihre Schuhe schauen, aber ein gesunder Aufmerksamkeitfilter verhindert, dass Sie sie individuell wahrnehmen. Im Gegensatz dazu könnten Sie Ihren Namen herausfiltern, selbst wenn er in einem lauten Raum gesprochen wird. Es gibt viele Verarbeitungsschritte, und die Ergebnisse der Verarbeitung werden wiederholt durch die Aufmerksamkeit moduliert.\n\nDamit das Gehirn Informationen verarbeiten kann, muss es zuerst gespeichert werden. Es gibt mehrere Arten des Gedächtnisses, darunter Sensorisches, Arbeits- und Langzeitspeicher. Zuerst wird Information codiert. Es gibt Arten der Kodierung, die spezifisch für jede Art von Sinnesreiz sind. Zum Beispiel kann sprachliches Eingabedaten strukturell codiert werden, was sich auf das Aussehen des gedruckten Wortes bezieht, phonemisch, was sich auf das Aussehen des Wortes bezieht, oder semantisch, was sich auf die Bedeutung des Wortes bezieht. Sobald Informationen gespeichert sind, müssen sie aufrechterhalten werden. Einige Tierstudien legen nahe, dass das Arbeitsgedächtnis, das Informationen für etwa 20 Sekunden speichert, durch ein elektrisches Signal aufrechterhalten wird, das für kurze Zeit durch eine bestimmte Reihe von Neuronen läuft. Es wird vermutet, dass Informationen im Langzeitspeicher in der Struktur bestimmter Proteinarten aufbewahrt werden.\n\nEs gibt zahlreiche Modelle darüber, wie das Wissen im Gehirn organisiert ist, einige basieren auf der Art und Weise, wie sich menschliche Versuchspersonen an Erinnerungen erinnern, andere auf der Informatik und andere auf der Neurophysiologie. Das semantische Netzwerkmodell besagt, dass es Knoten gibt, die Konzepte repräsentieren, und dass die Knoten basierend auf ihrer Verwandtschaft miteinander verknüpft sind. Zum Beispiel könnte \"Stuhl\" in einem semantischen Netzwerk mit \"Tisch\" verknüpft sein, das wiederum mit \"Holz\" verknüpft sein kann und so weiter.\n\n\n\n[REWRITE] The human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system.

    "raw_output": "Aldous Huxley kritisiert in seinem Roman \"Brave New World\" die drohende Gefahr sowohl der Technologie als auch der kapitalistischen Strukturen, die durch die Schaffung einer Dystopie verstärkt werden. Die Menschen in diesem Werk schätzen Gemeinschaft über das Individuum und werden von Anfang an darauf programmiert, vor allem nach unmittelbarer Glückseligkeit zu streben. Die Bürger entpuppen sich als Marionetten in einem größeren Spiel, gefangen in einer einzigen Ideologie, die vom Weltkontrolleur diktiert wird. Unter dem Blickwinkel des marxistischen Theismus bemerkt man die grundlegenden Misstrauen des Autors gegenüber der Entwicklung der genannten Systeme. Häufige Begriffe aus dem Marxismus, wie Homogenisierung und Reifizierung, unterstreichen die Idee, dass Huxleys Roman ein Kommentar auf die Fehler der damals aufstrebenden Wirtschaft ist.\n\nDer Kapitalismus wird durch die Verwendung der marxistischen These des \"falschen Bewusstseins\" gespottet. Im Wesentlichen wird der gewöhnliche Bürger daran gehindert, die wahren Beziehungen zu anderen Klassen in wirtschaftlicher Hinsicht zu kennen, da er hauptsächlich an seinem eigenen Gewinn interessiert ist. Es wird als Ergebnis der ideologischen Kontrolle des Proletariats und der einfachen Arbeiter bezeichnet, was durch die Prägung der Menschen in \"Brave New World\" deutlich wird. Die unteren Klassen, Delta, Gamma usw., haben keinen wahren Willen; durch Hypnopädie wird der Drang zu konsumieren, zu verbringen und zu sich zu ergötzen über alles andere verstärkt. Dies wird, wie bereits erwähnt, vom Weltkontrolleur manipuliert. Hegemonie, also die Idee, dass Gruppen sozialer Klassen von einer separaten Gruppe von Individuen insgesamt dominiert werden, wird in diesem Fall offensichtlich verwendet. Die unteren Klassen sind der Manipulation völlig unbedarft, sie \"kaufen\" buchstäblich in eine Ideologie ein, die diese Struktur (d. h. Kapitalismus & Konsumismus) unterstützt. Die oberen Klassen werden mit der Fähigkeit geboren, dies zu erkennen, tun aber nichts; nur wenige Alphas oder Betas außerhalb von Figuren wie Bernard tun mehr als ihre Rolle zu akzeptieren. In der Tat sind die Interaktionen der sozialen Klassen, wie im Detail weiter erörtert werden, bedeutende Hinweise auf die wahrgenommene Unterdrückung des Kapitalismus.\n\nBeziehungen zwischen verschiedenen Individuen existieren in \"Brave New World\" nicht. Der Roman scheint die Charaktere nicht unterscheiden zu wollen - sie sind, selbst unter den wichtigsten Figuren, oberflächlich und wenig ausgearbeitet. Vielleicht möchte Huxley damit andeuten, dass der Aufstieg von Technologie und Kapitalismus den Menschen ihren freien Willen und ihre Ausdrucksfähigkeit nehmen. Liebe existiert nicht, ebenso wenig wie extreme Emotionen; vielmehr werden die Interaktionen oberflächlich gehalten, deutlich durch die Bemerkungen der Männer über Frauen dargestellt, die sich in erster Linie auf ihr äußeres Erscheinungsbild konzentrieren (z. B. pneumatisches Aussehen), und die unbeschämten Bemerkungen der Frauen über ihre Begegnungen. Darüber hinaus zeigt die Gleichgültigkeit jeder gesellschaftlichen Klasse gegenüber ihrem Status in der Hierarchie den sozioökonomischen Einfluss des Kapitalismus. Ihre absolute Gehorsamkeit gegenüber ihrer Rolle in der Gemeinschaft ist ein Hinweis auf den marxistischen Gedanken über das Proletariat, das fälschlicherweise darauf vertrauen lässt, seiner eigenen Überlegenheit gegenüber allem anderen zu genießen, solange es konsumiert, gehorcht und im Einklang mit seinen Kollegen bleibt.\n\n\n\n[REWRITE]\nAldous Huxley criticizes the looming threat of both technology and the capitalist structure that reinforces it through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World.

Furthermore, each societal class' complacency with their status in the hierarchy indicate the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.",

Für viele, auch für mich, kann die Fortbewegung auf dem Campus ein Problem darstellen. In meinem Freshman Jahr wurde ich in einem Wohnheim in den East Halls untergebracht; fast der östlichste Punkt des Campus, wenn man das Stadion und das Bryce Jordan Center nicht mitzählt. Die Reise von meinem Zuhause im Stuart Hall zu Vorlesungen in weit entfernten Orten wie dem Willard Gebäude, in der Nähe des Campuszentrums, konnte zu Fuß bis zu 25 Minuten dauern, besonders wenn das Wetter schlecht war, was in State College oft der Fall ist. Nach einem Gespräch mit einem Absolventen, der nicht viel älter als ich ist, erfuhr ich, dass die East Halls-Wohnheime vor nicht allzu langer Zeit durch riesige Flächen ungenutzten Landes vom Rest der Schule getrennt waren. Heute ist dieser leere Raum mit Sportplätzen, riesigen neuen Gebäuden, einschließlich der neuen Creamery und des neuen Gebäudes für Gesundheitsdienste, gefüllt und von Wohnungen umgeben. Mit der kontinuierlichen Erweiterung unseres Campus wird es immer schwieriger, von einem Ort zum anderen zu gelangen. Was ist die beste Lösung für das Mobilitätsproblem? Auf einem Collegecampus ist es das Fahrrad. Aber allein das Fahrrad wird keine Probleme lösen. Die Studenten müssen sie fahren, und der Campus muss so gebaut sein, dass er den Bedürfnissen von Radfahrern entspricht.\nIch sprach mit einem Freund, der kürzlich nach einer mehrjährigen Pause wieder mit dem Radfahren begonnen hat. Er erwähnte, dass er sich fragte, warum er je aufgehört hatte. “Fahrräder sind großartig”, sagte er, “einige Jahre lang war es nicht cool, Fahrrad zu fahren, aber es ist der einzige Weg, um sich fortzubewegen.” Neben der positiven Wirkung auf den Körper ist das Radfahren die effizienteste Art, sich zu bewegen. Eine Schüssel Haferflocken und ein wenig körperliche Anstrengung bringen Sie 30 Meilen oder mehr weit. Wie viele Studenten lebe ich jetzt außerhalb des Campus; genauso weit vom Zentrum des Campus entfernt wie einige Wohnheime. Die klügste Entscheidung, die ich dieses Jahr getroffen habe, war, mir ein Fahrrad zu kaufen. Jeden Tag habe ich Unterricht im Thomas Gebäude, das leicht eine Viertelstunde zu Fuß von meinem Haus entfernt ist. Mit dem Fahrrad kann ich diese Zeit auf 5 Minuten verkürzen, wenn ich schnell genug fahre. Das einzige Problem ist, dass die Pollock Road der geradlinige Weg zum Thomas Gebäude von meinem Haus ist und es nicht immer eine einfache Straße ist, egal ob man Fahrrad fährt oder zu Fuß geht. Es gibt auch Gründe, zu Fuß zu gehen, aber persönlich bin ich zu beschäftigt, um zu Fuß zu gehen. Wenn ich kein Fahrrad hätte, wäre Gehen meine einzige zuverlässige Option, um zum Unterricht zu gelangen. Täglich zu Fuß nach Thomas zu gehen, würde mir extra 30-40 Minuten pro Tag rauben. Das sind über zwei und ein halbes Stunden jede Woche. Wenn man bedenkt, dass ich auch noch Zeit zum Gehen zu und von anderen Kursen, Terminen und so weiter aufwenden müsste, ist das mehr Zeit, die ich mir nicht leisten kann.\n\n##  Final English Translation:\n\n[REWRITE] I have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters.
