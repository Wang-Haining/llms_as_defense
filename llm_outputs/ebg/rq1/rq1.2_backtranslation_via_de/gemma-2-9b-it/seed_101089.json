The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time.

Die soziokulturellen Modelle betrachten die Umweltbeziehungen und deren Anwendung auf Rasse, Ethnizität, Demografie und sozioökonomischen Status. Die folgende Rezension von Schlaflosigkeit untersucht diese Modelle und erläutert jedes Forschungsstück, das ausgewählt wurde, um sie in Beziehung zu setzen und besser zu erklären. Die Erläuterung der Forschungsergebnisse und deren Ergebnisse werden dann kritisch betrachtet, um ihre spezifischen Stärken und Schwächen zu erwähnen.\n\nEine Schlafstörung kann als primäre Schlafstörung, eine Schlafstörung im Zusammenhang mit einer anderen psychischen Erkrankung oder eine Schlafstörung aufgrund anderer Probleme charakterisiert werden. Die primären Schlafstörungen sind Dyssomnien oder Parasomnien, während Schlafstörungen im Zusammenhang mit einer anderen psychischen Erkrankung mit einer Störung der Achse I oder Achse II zusammenhängen. Andere Kategorien von Schlafstörungen können auf medizinische Komplikationen oder den Konsum einer Substanz zurückzuführen sein. Die Dyssomnien sind: Primäre Insomnia, Primäre Hypersomnie, Narcolepsie, Atmungsbedingte Schlafstörung, zirkadianer Rhythmus Schlafstörung und Dyssomnie nicht anders spezifiziert (NOS). Während die primäre Insomnia eine Komplikation bei ausreichender oder erhaltener Schlaf ist, ist die primäre Hypersomnie Schwierigkeiten, wach zu bleiben, sowohl für mindestens einen Monat. Narcolepsie beinhaltet Kataplexie und/oder automatisches REM. Während Dyssomnien sich auf die Einleitung und Aufrechterhaltung des Schlafs konzentrieren, sind Parasomnien Schlafstörungen, die mit Verhaltensabnormitäten und/oder physiologischen Ereignissen verbunden sind. Parasomnien sind Albtraumstörung, Schlafängstlichkeit, Schlafwandeln und Parasomnien nicht anderweitig spezifiziert. Die Schlafstörungen im Zusammenhang mit einer anderen psychischen Erkrankung betreffen Schlafstörungen aufgrund von Achse I (klinischen Störungen) oder Achse II (Persönlichkeitsstörungen oder geistige Behinderung). Die folgende Rezension konzentriert sich auf Insomnia und etwas auf primäre Schlafstörungen im Allgemeinen in Bezug auf die biologischen und soziokulturellen Modelle.\n\nDas biologische Modell von Schlafstörungen konzentriert sich auf Gene, vererbte Faktoren und physiologisch erworbene Aspekte von Schlafstörungen. Neuronen im Hypothalamus, die Orexin enthalten, sind für die Regulierung des Schlafes und der Wachheit verantwortlich. Diese Studie experimentierten an Mäusen und fanden heraus, dass es phänotypische GABAB-Rezeptoren auf den Orexin-Neuronen gibt, die spezifisch für Schlaf-/ Wachzustände verantwortlich sind. Die Aktivierung des GABAA-Rezeptors induziert Antworten, die den Schlaf fördern. Wenn es daran gehindert wird, zu feuern, kann dies zu einer Verringerung der Angst führen und den Schlaf induzieren. Das GABAB-Agonist (Baclofen) erhöhte die Schlafzeit (Matsuki et al., 2009). Solche Ergebnisse implizieren, dass die Tiermodelle von Mäusen auf Studien an Menschen übertragen werden können. Dies zeigt, dass es eine genetische und umweltbedingte Grundlage für den physikalischen GABAB-Rezeptor beim Menschen gibt. Ein Problem oder Fehlen dieses Rezeptors könnte die Fähigkeit einer Person beeinträchtigen, ohne Medikamente ausreichend zu schlafen. Die soziokulturelle Implikation dieser Studie ist, dass das Phänotyp wäre vererbt, könnte dies den Schlaf regulieren und eine Veränderung des Rezeptors würde den Schlaf eines Individuums natürlich stören.

Anschließend wird die Diagnose erläutert, einschließlich der häufigen Merkmale oder „Warnsignale“. Abschließend fasst das Papier zusammen, wie ein Lehrer in einem integrativen Klassenzimmer Schülern mit CAPD helfen kann.\n\nDas zentrale auditive Verarbeitung Disorder (CAPD) oder das auditive Verarbeitung Disorder (APD) „bezieht sich auf die Effizienz und Wirksamkeit, mit der das zentrale Nervensystem (ZNS) auditive Informationen nutzt. Eng definiert bezieht sich (C)AP auf die Wahrnehmung und Verarbeitung auditiver Informationen im ZNS und die neurobiologischen Aktivitäten, die dieser Verarbeitung zugrunde liegen und zu elektrophysiologischen Hörpotentialen führen“ (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), was bedeutet, dass es sich um eine Störung handelt, bei der das zentrale Nervensystem (d. h. das Gehirn) Dinge, die man hört, nicht richtig verarbeiten kann. Menschen mit CAPD hören normal und gelten daher nicht als „Gehörlos\"; stattdessen funktioniert der Bereich des Gehirns, der das Interpretieren dessen, was wir hören, trennt, Wörter voneinander unterscheidet oder Gespräche von Hintergrundgeräuschen abgrenzt, nicht so wie es normalerweise sollte.\n\nDie früheste Erwähnung der Störung, die zum CAPD wurde, stammt aus der Mitte der 1950er Jahre und wurde als „Auditive Imperzeption“ (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) bezeichnet, als Forscher Kinder mit kommunikativen Störungen untersuchten. Das italienische Forscherteam Bocca, Calearo und Cassinari begann 1954 mit der Entwicklung von Tests für diese Kinder; 1961 führte Kimura „dichototische Tests ein und formulierte ein Modell, um die Physiologie der CANS zu erklären, die der dichototischen Wahrnehmung zugrunde liegt“ (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). 1977 fand eine nationale Konferenz statt, die die Forschung an Kindern mit CAPD anregte.\n\nCAPD manifestiert sich in vielfältiger Weise: Die betroffene Person kann möglicherweise den Schall im Raum nicht lokalisieren oder hören; Schwierigkeiten haben, zwischen zwei oder mehr „akustischen Ereignissen“ (Schallereignissen) zu unterscheiden; kann keine Lautmuster erkennen; kann Veränderungen in der Sprache nicht unterscheiden (z. B. Sarkasmus basierend auf Stimmänderung); ein Sound kann durch einen nachfolgenden Sound blockiert werden; kann die Fähigkeit, Schallhinweise zu synthetisieren (d. h. so zu interpretieren, dass sie dann darauf reagieren können), nicht haben; und kann die Reihenfolge, in der auditive Informationen präsentiert werden, nicht feststellen (Ferre).\n\nZur Diagnose von CAPD muss der Patient mit „systematischer Beobachtung des Hörverhaltens und/oder Leistung auf Tests der Hörfunktion“ untersucht werden, die von „Audiologen, Sprachtherapeuten, Psychologen und anderen Personen unter Verwendung einer Vielzahl von Messungen durchgeführt werden können, die hörverbände Fähigkeiten bewerten“ (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Dazu können Fragebögen und Umfragen, die Beobachtung von Hörverhalten einschließlich der Reaktion des Patienten auf bestimmte Reize gehören. Es gibt derzeit kein einziges Werkzeug oder Test, der konsequent mit hoher diagnostischer Erfolgsrate eingesetzt wird, und es gibt keinen bekannten Auslöser für die Störung. Viele verwendete Tests präsentieren dem Patienten mehrere, gleichzeitige auditive Reize und fordern dann auf, bestimmte Elemente zu unterscheiden, z. B. eine Reihe von Wörtern oder Zahlen. Fortgeschrittenere Tests umfassen die Aufnahme akustischer Signale im Ohr und die Messung der Reaktionen auf diese Signale.\n\n[REWRITE]\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD).

A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more \"acoustic events\" (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\nIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with \"systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function\", which may be conducted by \"audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals.",

    "original": "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",

    "raw_output": "Die Komödie \"Twelfth Night\" scheint zu sagen, dass zwar Verkleidung in der Tat nützlich ist, um lange Zeit Betrug zu perpetrieren, aber letztendlich muss eine Person diese neu gebildete Maske ablehnen, um sich nicht für immer im Prozess zu verlieren. Ein großes Problem beim Beenden einer Täuschung ist jedoch, dass man sich dabei möglicherweise entfremdet fühlt. Daher muss man am Ende zwischen der Selbstbewahrung oder der Erhaltung der Beziehungen zu den Menschen um einen selbst entscheiden. Denn obwohl einige neutral reagieren, wenn sie feststellen, dass sie getäuscht wurden, werden andere die Täuschung nicht so leicht nehmen und werden wahrscheinlich von dem ganzen Theater beleidigt sein.\n\nDas Thema der Täuschung bei der Rollenumkehr ist besonders problematisch, weil es viele Nebenthemen aufwirft, das wichtigste davon vielleicht ist: Warum? Warum fühlt sich die Person zum Bedürfnis, ihre eigene Identität zu verweigern und eine Verkleidung in Form des anderen Geschlechts anzunehmen? In Violas Fall ist es offensichtlich eine Form des Selbstschutzes: \"Ich werde dich einem Hauptmann in dieser Stadt bringen / Wo meine Jungfrauenkleider liegen, mit deren sanfter Hilfe / ich bewahrt wurde, um diesem edlen Grafen zu dienen ...\" (5.1.247-249)\n\nNeu in einem fremden Land angekommen, fühlt sich Viola gezwungen, sich als Mann auszugeben, um sich vor möglichen Angreifern zu schützen. Violas Plan funktioniert, entfremdet sie aber auch von den Frauen um sie herum und schneidet sie von einem wichtigen Unterstützungssystem ab. Um die Sache noch schlimmer zu machen, ist sie anscheinend so überzeugend als Mann, dass Olivia sie mit Sebastian verwechselt und sich tatsächlich in sie verliebt: \"Whither, mein Lord? Cesario, Ehemann, bleibe.\" (5.1.138) Darüber hinaus muss sie auch mit unterdrückten romantischen Gefühlen zwischen ihr und Orsino umgehen: \"Junge, du hast mir tausendmal gesagt / dass du nie eine Frau wie mich lieben solltest.\" (5.1. 260-261)\n\nObwohl dies vielleicht eine etwas fortschrittliche Einstellung ist, kann \"Twelfth Night\" für den modernen Leser als eine Illustration dafür dienen, wie Täuschung dazu beitragen kann, unterdrückte Emotionen aufzudecken, insbesondere bei Olivia und Orsino. Bestimmte Passagen scheinen darauf hinzuweisen, dass die genannten Charaktere möglicherweise ungesagte, unterbewusste Wünsche haben, die das Aussehen von Viola/Cesario sie dazu zwingen, damit umzugehen. Zum Beispiel ist Olivia angezogen von Cesario, weil Cesario wie ein Mann aussieht, oder verbirgt Olivia wirklich heimlich Gefühle für Frauen? Man könnte argumentieren, dass dies wahrscheinlich nicht der Fall ist, weil Shakespeares Charakter Olivia eher diejenigen seiner Zeit parodiert, die andere nur an ihrem Aussehen beurteilen. \n\nDies wird durch die Leichtigkeit, mit der Olivia ihre romantische Leidenschaft von Cesario zu Sebastian wechselt und Cesario/Viola als Familie statt als Liebesinteresse betrachtet, belegt: \"Schwester, du bist sie.\" (5.1.315)\n\n[REWRITE] Although disguise is indeed useful for perpetuating long-lasting deception, in the end, a person must reject that newly formed guise, or risk losing themselves forever. Ending a deception, however, presents a challenge because it can lead to alienation. Consequently, one must choose between self-preservation and preserving relationships. While some might react neutrally to discovering they've been tricked, others may be deeply offended.

Natürlich lässt sich ein ganzes Kolonialreich wie dieses nicht durch eine so einfache Beschreibung erklären. Das deutsche Kolonialreich war genauso vielfältig in seinen politischen Ansätzen und Herrschaftsformen wie in seiner Geographie. Die Bildungsangebote in den Kolonien waren ähnlich vielfältig. Als die Briten 1919 Deutsch-Ostafrika (Tanganjika) eroberten, fanden sie eine große Bevölkerung von gebildeten und lesenden Afrikanern. Die deutschen Bildungsinitiativen in Kamerun und anderen Kolonien wurden auch von zeitgenössischen Autoren gelobt.\n\nDie Situation in Südwestafrika (heute Namibia) stellte einen klaren Kontrast dar. Im Gegensatz zu Ostafrika, wo die Regierung staatliche Schulen gründete und eine führende Rolle bei der Bildung der Eingeborenen spielte, wurde die Aufgabe der indigenen Bildung in Südwestafrika fast vollständig den Missionarengsellschaften überlassen, die nur begrenzte staatliche Unterstützung erhielten. Die Regierung investierte jedoch erhebliche Ressourcen in die Bildung von Europäern in der Kolonie und errichtete ein System staatlicher Schulen sowie unterstützte und regelte die Missionarschulen stärker. Diese Bildungspolitik hatte langfristige Auswirkungen auf Südwestafrika, selbst nach dem Ende der deutschen Herrschaft. Während andere deutsche Kolonien mit erheblichen Zahlen von gebildeten und lesenden Afrikanern aufwarten konnten, blieb in Südwestafrika \"die überwältigende Mehrheit der Bevölkerung unberührt, ungebildet und analphabetisch.\"\n\nVerschiedene soziale, politische und wirtschaftliche Faktoren führten zu der abweichenden Erfahrung Südwestafricas. Diese Arbeit möchte die Diskussion erweitern, indem sie diese Faktoren identifiziert und besonderen Wert auf neue Forschungsergebnisse über die Einstellung der Siedler und der Kolonialbehörden gegenüber den einheimischen Afrikanern legt.\n\nEs gibt eine Fülle von Literatur zum Thema Bildung im deutschen Kolonialreich. Die meisten dieser Quellen sind in deutscher Sprache und wurden im frühen 20. Jahrhundert verfasst, während oder kurz nach der Zeit der deutschen Kolonialherrschaft. Ziel der frühen Arbeiten war es hauptsächlich, die Merkmale der Bildungssysteme in diesen Kolonien darzustellen. Spätere Arbeiten auf Englisch erweiterten die Debatte durch vergleichende Studien zur Bildung in den verschiedenen deutschen Kolonien und detailliertere Analysen spezifischer Aspekte der Bildung. Diese Studien zeigten erhebliche Unterschiede in den Bildungssystemen der verschiedenen Kolonien auf. Die bedeutendste Arbeit, die sich ausdrücklich mit dem Thema dieser Arbeit befasst, ist Cohens Studie zur Bildung in Südwestafrika und Ostafrika. Cohen vergleicht die Bildungssysteme der beiden Kolonien und diskutiert die Faktoren, die die Unterschiede zwischen ihnen erklären. Laut Cohen erklärt die große Siedlerbevölkerung Südwestafricas viele der charakteristischen Merkmale des Bildungssystems der Kolonie.\n\nIm Vergleich zu den anderen kolonialen Besitzungen Deutschlands hatte Südwestafrika ein gemäßigt temperiertes Klima, obwohl ein Großteil des Territoriums von aridem Wüstenland bedeckt ist. Die europäische Bevölkerung Südwestafricas spiegelte die relativ günstigen Bedingungen wider.

Die Sache wird dadurch kompliziert, dass die meisten, wenn nicht sogar alle Genres - Rap, Rock, Country, Jazz, Folk, nur um einige zu nennen - innerhalb ihres Bereichs mehrere Unter- und Untergenres hervorgebracht haben. Arguabel ist das Untergenre Heavy Metal Rock in den letzten 40 Jahren zu einem der vielfältigsten und ausdrucksstärksten Genres der gesamten Popmusik geworden. Es ist ausdrucksstark, da es eine breite Palette an Emotionen zeigt, obwohl diese sich tendenziell auf die dunklere Seite des Spektrums konzentrieren. Es ist vielfältig, da die Leute schon bald nach Beginn des Genres bemerkten, dass es eine echte Flexibilität hatte, und diese ausnutzten, um ihre eigenen Untergenres zu kreieren, die dann von Unteruntergenres gefolgt wurden, und die Kette setzt sich bis heute fort.\n\nHeute haben wir einen Punkt im Heavy-Metal-Bewegung erreicht, an dem es so viele Nischen von Gruppen gibt, dass es schwer ist zu bestimmen, was genau Heavy Metal ist. Es hat so viele Themen aus anderen Genres aufgenommen, aber wie alles andere ist es irgendwoher entstanden. Um die heute überall existierende Metal-Musik richtig zu verstehen, muss man zuerst verstehen, was die Metal-Bewegung ist und warum sie eine Bewegung ist und nicht einfach nur ein Genre.\n\nMetal ist in vielerlei Hinsicht eine Bewegung, die durch Dunkelheit definiert ist. Metal kann als „Musik des Mehrs“ betrachtet werden – mehr Bass, mehr Lautstärke, mehr Gewalt, mehr Theatralik. Weniger Primitivismus, mehr Technik; die Leute in Metal-Bands wissen wirklich, wie man sein Instrument spielt, und das merkt man in der Musik. Metal ist auch – obwohl es vielleicht nicht überraschend kommt – eine Bewegung, die stark von Drogen beeinflusst ist. Es gab in den späten 70er Jahren einen Boom an psychedelischen Drogen, der dazu führte, dass die Leute verrückter wurden und verrückte, anderewöhltiche Platten machten, indem sie die Drogen als Sündenbock für ihre Schöpfung nutzten. Es besitzt viele dunkle, viszerale Qualitäten, was für die Musikszene sehr neu war, da ein Großteil der populären Musik Eigenschaften hatte, die nicht der dunkleren Seite des emotionalen Spektrums treu waren. Auch spätere Generationen von Metal haben sich von den dunklen, viszeralen Qualitäten, die so präsent waren in der Romantik, beeinflussen lassen. \n\nLieder wie die folgende drücken die Dunkelheit aus, die so ein Grundpfeiler der Bewegung ist: (Byrne)\n\n\n   \nDiese Zeilen aus \"Helter Skelter\" zeigen die dunklere Seite der Beatles. Es zeigt einen Auf und Ab, angeblich von Drogen. Dieses Lied gilt von einigen als eines der ersten Heavy-Metal-Lieder. Es war eine Reaktion auf ein Rolling Stones Lied, das ebenfalls auf der schwereren, dunkleren Seite lag. Die Beatles wollten beweisen, dass sie genauso schwer wie die Stones sein konnten, also legten sie dieses Lied auf \"The White Album\".\n\n\n\n\n**[REWRITE]\n\nThe classification of popular music has grown over the past 100 years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all.

Complicating matters, most if not all genres—rap, rock, country, jazz, folk, just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain. Arguably, the subgenre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past 40 years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions, although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre, people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own subgenre, which then was followed by sub-subgenres, and the chain continues until today.\n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres, but like everything else, it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today, one must first understand what the metal movement is, and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\nMetal is, in many ways, a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a “music of more”—more bass, more volume, more violence, more theatricality. Less primitivism, more chops; people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument, and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70s that led to people getting crazier, leading to them to make crazy, other-worldly records, using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark, visceral qualities, which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also, later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark, visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement: (Byrne)\n\n\n   \nThese lyrics from \"Helter Skelter\" display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down, supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier, darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones, so they put that song on \"The White Album\".",

The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",

    "raw_output": "Several Jahrzehnte bevor die Surrealisten damit begannen, ihre traumhaften Werke zu bemalen, schuf der Künstler Henri Rousseau sorgfältig seine eigenen Träume, wörtlich wie bildlich. „Der Traum“, ein Gemälde von 1910 des berühmten postimpressionistischen Künstlers, verkörpert nicht nur eine Frau, die von den Wundern des Landes staunt, das sie in einem Traum besucht, sondern auch Rousseaus eigene persönliche Träume und Ziele als Maler. Seit Beginn seiner Arbeit träumte er von Anerkennung, Akzeptanz und Lob von anderen Künstlern und Kunstliebhabern, und fand heraus, dass er mit einem schwierigen inneren Dilemma konfrontiert war, um dieses Streben zu erreichen. „Der Traum“ ist das Werk von Henri Rousseau, das seinen lebenslangen inneren Kampf am besten widerspiegelt: entweder sich bestimmten Maltechniken anpassen oder nachahmen, um von der kritischen Kunstwelt, die er so verehrte, akzeptiert zu werden, oder sich kreativ unabhängig und einzigartig zu erlauben und seinen eigenen Weg zu gehen.\n\nBevor man „Der Traum“ aus dieser Perspektive analysieren kann, muss man zunächst etwas mit Rousseaus biographischer Geschichte vertraut sein. Henri Rousseau wurde am 21. Mai 1844 in der Stadt Laval im nordwestlichen Frankreich geboren. Sein Vater war ein Blechsmit und Eisenwarenhändler, der „bürgerlichen Wohlstand genoss“ (Shattuck 47). In seiner Jugend erhielt er keine formellen künstlerischen Ausbildungen; stattdessen arbeitete er bis zum Alter von vierzig Jahren für Frankreich als gabelou, also Mitarbeiter des Gemeindetolldienstes, obwohl er den irreführenden Beinamen Douanier, ein Zollinspektor (Shattuck 46), erhielt. Der Tod seiner ersten Frau, Clémence, der auf den Tod von acht Säuglingen folgte, hinterließ Rousseau nur ein Kind, eine Tochter namens Julia, und immenses Trauer (Shattuck 49). Er hoffte daher, in einem neuen Leben Zuflucht zu finden und malte, um ihm Trost und neue Anfänge zu bieten. Im Gegensatz zu zeitgenössischen Kollegen von Rousseau, die in der Malerei den Bauern sentimentalisieren und romantisieren, ist er im Wesentlichen ein Volkskünstler und hat die Hoffnungen und Träume des durchschnittlichen Mitglieds seiner Klasse.\n\nRousseaus Besessenheit von der Akzeptanz durch die Kunstwelt ist in diesem Kontext etwas verständlich: wie bereits erwähnt, war er nicht nur in den Weisen der formalen Malerei unerfahren und begann seine Karriere in einem viel höheren Alter, sondern er produzierte Werke zur gleichen Zeit wie viele andere talentierte und bekannteren moderne Künstler. Obwohl Rousseau bereits viele Jahre arbeitete, erhielt er erst gegen die Zeit, als Matisse einen Ruf als Künstler erlangte, die richtige Anerkennung für seine Kunst. Im Buch „Moderne französische Maler“ behauptet die Autorin Jan Gordon, dass die beiden, obwohl sie technisch gesehen Konkurrenten in der Kunstszene waren, sich nicht nur in Stil und Motiv, sondern auch in ihren Gründen für das Malen unterschieden: „Matisse war ein Maler, der Angst vor der Darstellung in triefender Weise hatte, während Rousseaus Wunsch darin bestand, ein so konventionelles Bild zu malen, dass er in die Artiste Français aufgenommen würde“ (92).\n\n\n\n[REWRITE]\nSeveral decades before the Surrealists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau carefully crafted his own dreams, both literally and figuratively. \"The Dream,\" a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter.

    "raw_output": "## German Translation:\n\nViele große Denker haben eine enge Verbindung zwischen Ethik und Ästhetik, zwischen Wahrheit und Schönheit postuliert. Ich glaube, dass es auf fundamentaler Ebene einen Grund dafür gibt. Wie John Keats in seiner „Ode an einen griechischen Vasen“ sagt: „Schönheit ist Wahrheit, Wahrheit Schönheit - Das ist alles, / Was ihr auf Erden wisst, und alles, was ihr wissen müsst.“ Ein Großteil dessen, was wir im Leben lernen, geschieht durch Bildung oder Erfahrung. Es scheint jedoch, als würden wir Ethik und Ästhetik, wie Keats andeutet, ohne dass wir auf diese erwarteten Weise unterrichtet werden, schätzen. Sowohl Ethik als auch Ästhetik sind ein Versuch, zu beschreiben, anstatt zu verschreiben. Unsere Studien über Moral und Schönheit sind größtenteils Versuche, zu erklären, warum ein Kunstwerk oder eine Literatur ein schön ist oder warum eine Handlung moralisch ist, anstatt eine Reihe von Regeln für die Beurteilung oder die Schaffung guter Kunst oder moralisches Verhalten.\n\nWas noch wichtiger ist, die Kritik an Kunst oder Moral kann niemals die Essenz dessen erfassen, was gut oder schön ist. Ein Gespräch über den Wert von Leonardo da Vincis Mona Lisa z. B. kann sich beispielsweise um Konzepte wie Vordergrund, Hintergrund, Kontrast oder kulturellen Kontext drehen, aber am Ende beschreiben diese nicht, warum es gute Kunst ist. Wenn man jemanden fragt, nach seinem Lieblingswerk der Kunst oder Literatur, hört man oft einen Satz wie „Da ist einfach etwas dran“, bevor eine komplexere oder kritischere Erklärung folgt. Ich glaube, dass sowohl Kunst als auch Moral niemals vollständig auf eine Beschreibung ihrer Eigenschaften reduziert werden können. Wie Flannery O'Connor sagt: „Eine Geschichte ist eine Möglichkeit, etwas auszudrücken, was nicht anders gesagt werden kann... du erzählst eine Geschichte, weil eine Aussage unzureichend wäre.“ Egal wie vollständig wir die Eigenschaften eines literarischen Werkes beschreiben, es bleibt etwas Transzendentes zurück. Ich glaube, dass die Ethik dieses gleiche Eigenschaft besitzt. Wie Wittgenstein sagt: „Es ist klar, dass Ethik nicht ausgedrückt werden kann. / Ethik ist transzendent. /“ Ich schlage vor, dass es dieses „etwas“, dieses „je ne sais quoi“ ist, das die mächtigste Eigenschaft von Kunst und Moral ist, und dass diese transzendente Natur von Ethik und Ästhetik einen Verbindungspunkt zwischen ihnen bildet.\n\nIch glaube, dass Moral und Kunst so eng miteinander verbunden sind, weil wir beide auf einer noumenalen Ebene, um einen Begriff aus der Kant’schen Philosophie zu verwenden, am intensivsten erleben. Sie wirken auf uns auf einer Ebene ein, die erlebt, aber nicht vollständig erklärt werden kann. Diese Verbindung ist noch stärker, wenn es um die Kunst der Literatur geht. Wie McKean sagt: „Was Literatur von den anderen Künsten am meisten unterscheidet, was ihr eigentlich einzigartig ist, ist ihre moralische Qualität. Es mag sein, dass moralische Maßstäbe für andere Kunstformen, z. B. Musik, unangemessen sind, aber sie scheinen für Literatur so relevant zu sein wie für das Leben selbst. Leben beinhaltet notwendigerweise Werte... Literatur ist für uns wichtig gerade wegen der Werte, die wir dort finden.“\n\n\n[REWRITE]\nMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty.

Julius Caesar verwendete den Begriff „Germanus“ erstmals in seinem Kommentar zu den gallischen Kriegen, in dem er die Galliern besiegte und mit germanischen Stämmen kämpfte, die oft unter hinterlistreichen Vorwänden den Rhein überquerten. Er nahm dieses Wort von den Galliern selbst und verwendete es, um diejenigen zu unterscheiden, die er erobert hatte (die Galliern), und diejenigen, die er nicht erobert hatte. Während die Herkunft ungewiss ist, glauben einige, dass es sich auf einen Nachbarn in der gallischen Sprache bezog. Im ersten Kapitel seines ersten Buches über diese Kriege bemerkt Julius Caesar: „Die Germanen, die jenseits des Rheins wohnen, mit denen sie (die Galliern) ständig Krieg führen.....Sie kämpfen mit den Germanen in fast täglichen Schlachten.“ (Julius Caesar, 50-40 v. Chr.) Andere behaupten, dass die Bedeutung von der Lanze stammt, die sie im Krieg benutzten und die als „ger“ bekannt war (O.E.D, 2010), oder vielleicht vom alten irischen Wort „garim“, was „rufen“ bedeutet, was darauf hindeutete, dass die Germanen laut oder lautstark waren. (Namen von Deutschland)\n\nDer frühe römische Historiker Tacitus beschrieb in seinem Werk „De Origine et situ Germanorum“ aus dem Jahr 98 n. Chr., in dem es um die Ursprünge der Germanen ging, dass „ich sie (die Germanen) als ursprunglich betrachten würde und nicht vermischt mit anderen Völkern durch Einwanderung oder Verkehr. Denn früher kamen diejenigen, die emigrieren wollten, nicht über Land, sondern auf Schiffen an.......Wer würde aus Asien oder Afrika nach Italien oder nach Deutschland, mit seinem wilden Land, seinem unmildlichen Himmel, seinen düsteren Sitten und seinem Ausdruck, ziehen, es sei denn, es wäre seine Heimat?“ (Tacitus, 98)\n\nUnd wer würde Rom für Germania verlassen? Sicher nicht die Römer, jedenfalls nicht noch nicht. Sie würden ihre Eroberungen in die Länder Germanias schicken, um Waren zu erhalten, und gelegentlich Landkampagnen führen, aber letztendlich würden sie hauptsächlich zurück in ihr weitläufiges Reich kehren. Als die germanischen Stämme sich also im ersten Jahrhundert in Erscheinung brachten, lebten sie an der Grenze des Römischen Reiches und handelten mit den Waren, die sie aus dem Land stahlen, und mit ihren Fähigkeiten, indem sie in den Reihen der römischen Armee dienten (Ozment, 2005 S. 17).\n\n\n[REWRITE]\nGermany is considered a strong force today, a united country with its own blend of culture, from the shadows of the Alps in Munich, all the way to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel.

    "transformed": "Germany is considered a strong force today, a united country with its own blend of culture, from the shadows of the Alps in Munich, all the way to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. The same culture can be felt from Cologne on the Rhine River, through the center of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe.  With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we know it comes from several different sources and tribes.\n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic tribe known then as the Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gallic forces (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar first used the word \"Germanus\" in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he subdued the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which frequently crossed the Rhine under mischievous pretenses. He took this word from the Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (the Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: \"Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.\" (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning \"to shout\", which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany)\n\nThe early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\", which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?” (Tacitus, 98)\n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania?

Unbekümmert, still, mit einem geübten Bewusstsein, das das Objekt des Studiums studierte, aber sich weigerte, es mit einem abstrakten Verständnis in Verbindung zu bringen, das mein Geist analysierte, analysierte ich das Bild vor meinen Augen. Gedanken schlüpften in meinen Geist und schlüpften fast so schnell wieder aus, wie sie erschienen waren. So glatt und so sauber arbeitete mein Bewusstsein, dass es schien, als hätte ich keine eigenen Gedanken, sondern nur ein aktives und flüssiges Erlebnis dessen, was ich betrachtete.\nEinst, auf Empfehlung eines Künstlers, mit dem ich arbeitete, kaufte ich ein Kunstbuch namens \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\". Ich wollte schon seit meinem sechsten Lebensjahr lernen, zu zeichnen, und dieses Buch lehrt alles, von dem Verständnis dessen, was ein Bleistift ist, bis hin zu den Prozessen, die das Gehirn verwendet, um Linien zu interpretieren. Eine Technik, die das Buch lehrt, ist es, einen quadratischen Rahmen um jedes Bild zu legen, das der Künstler studieren möchte.  Dadurch wird ein überwältigend detailliertes Bild, zum Beispiel eine Schale mit Früchten auf einem Tisch, der sich in einem Esszimmer befindet, das mit einer Küche verbunden ist, in ein leicht zu fassendes Bild verwandelt, diese Schale mit Früchten, die auf einer einfachen Ebene ruht.\nZu diesem Zeitpunkt konnte ich, während ich auf die Schale vor mir starrte, den Rahmen des Künstlers nicht mental projizieren. Ich war so überwältigt, so beeindruckt, dass ich nur stehen und staunen konnte. Picasso ging durch seine blaue Phase, Monet liebte Grün, die italienischen Renaissance-Meister zeigten ein Regenbogen an Farben. Wenn ich irgendwelche Anspruchsansprüche hatte, meine Perspektive als künstlerisch zu bezeichnen, dann waren hier die Anfänge meines Bildes, der Beginn meiner Geschichte, \"Arbeit in Braun\".\nDie Fingerkuppen landeten auf meinem gewählten Instrument der Kunst, die Muskeln spannten sich an und entspannten sich, als meine Hand durch den Raum bewegte, der Wille meines Geistes in Form und Gestalt gebracht, was in dem, was hätte sein können, dem kreativsten Moment meines Lebens. Wasser wirbelte, seren und glatt, kristallklar und sauber.  Partikelbröckchen lösten sich von der Ganzheit und wurden in die Leere getragen. Die Muskeln spannte sich an, zuckten und zuckten etwas schneller und ängstlicher zum zweiten Mal, meine Hand schlug heftig gegen den Toilettendeckel. Das offensive braune Paket weigerte sich zu bewegen, steckte wie ein Schnecke auf dem Boden der Toilette fest.\nDie Schrubber fest umklammert, die Füße einen Fuß auseinander gestellt, die grüne Krawatte unwohl um den Hals gebunden, runzelte ich leicht die Stirn, während ich auf das unhöfliche Bündel aus verarbeitetem Tier- und Pflanzenmaterial starrte, das jemand als Botschaft für die Dummköpfe hinterlassen hatte, die in den Toiletten von Rite Aid arbeiteten.  Ein paar weitere Spülungen, ein paar weitere ruhige, introvertierte Momente für mich, dann bewegte sich meine Hand in Richtung der Wand rechts neben mir, griff das Papiertuch am Ende des Toilettenpapierrollen und begann, sich selbst wie einen Ofenhandschuh zu mumifizieren.

Die National Institutes of Health erklären, dass ein Aspekt des Problems darin liegt, dass das Teenagerhirn buchstäblich nicht für die Gefahren des Fahrens bereit ist. Auch die einfache Unerfahrung liegt im Herzen des Problems. Diese Unerfahrung verursacht nicht nur mehr tödliche Unfälle, sondern auch eine höhere Rate von Fahrzeug-Kippungen, Geschwindigkeitsüberschreitungen und Fahrten von der Straße.\nTeens haben es auch deutlich schlechter, wenn sie mit ihren Altersgenossen unterwegs sind - was jeder mit einem Hauch von Verstand weiß, dass sie regelmäßig tun. Das Südkalifornische Zentrum für Unfallprävention und Forschung führte eine Studie durch, die die folgende Korrelation zeigte: zwischen dem Alter der Passagiere und der Anzahl der Verkehrsunfälle.\nKalifornien und andere Bundesstaaten haben versucht, die Sicherheit junger Fahrer zu erhöhen, indem sie temporäre, vorläufige Führerscheine erlassen, die die Stunden begrenzen, die Jugendliche fahren dürfen, und das Mitfahren anderer Minderjähriger untersagen.\nAber vorläufige Führerscheine sind meiner Meinung nach nur Notlösungen. Das eigentliche Problem ist, dass die jüngsten Fahrer als Gruppe statistisch gesehen einfach nicht in der Lage sind, die Risiken und Verantwortlichkeiten ausreichend zu bewältigen. Psychologe Marvin Zuckerman glaubt sogar, dass 18 Jahre zu jung für einen normalen Führerschein ist. Die USA Today berichtet, dass Zuckerman Forschung durchgeführt hat, die darauf hindeutet, dass es bei Menschen unter 19-20 Jahren einen gemeinsamen Wunsch gibt, Risiken einzugehen, nur für den reinen Nervenkitzel. Es ist dann sinnvoll, das Fahren mindestens bis zum Abflauen der Neigung zum Nervenkitzel zu verschieben. Wenn wir weiterhin Führerscheine an junge Teenager ausgeben, werden wir nicht nur weiterhin tödliche Unfälle sehen, sondern die Zahl der Todesopfer wird in den nächsten Jahren wahrscheinlich alarmierend steigen. Bis 2010 werden die Kinder der Baby-Boomer fahrenberechtigt sein und Millionen neuer junger Fahrer werden bereit sein, auf die Straße zu fahren.\nDie Gesetzgebung zu diesem Thema wäre verhältnismäßig einfach. Schulen könnten weiterhin Fahrschulklassen anbieten, um den Lernprozess für zukünftige Fahrer zu beginnen, aber niemand unter 18 Jahren darf ein Kraftfahrzeug führen. Ein vorläufiges Permit könnte noch vor der Erteilung eines vollen Führerscheins ausgestellt werden, und es wären immer noch eine bestimmte Anzahl von praktischen Fahrstunden erforderlich. Die spezifische Anzahl der Stunden könnte auf die Anzahl der Stunden basieren, die bereits von den meisten Bundesstaaten gefordert werden (in Kalifornien sind es beispielsweise derzeit 6 Stunden Fahrstunden hinter dem Steuer und 50 Stunden Übung mit einem Erwachsenen). Da die tödlichen Statistiken für junge Fahrer aus einem Querschnitt aller Bundesstaaten stammen, wäre eine einheitliche, nationale Gesetzgebung zu diesem Thema ein angemessenes - und meiner Meinung nach wirksames - Mittel, um Jugendliche im ganzen Land zu schützen. \nDie von mir vorgeschlagene Gesetzgebung ist keineswegs eine neue Idee.\n\n[REWRITE] Teenagers are dying behind the wheel.

These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",

    "raw_output": "Bei der Durchsicht der Bibliothek des Kongresses' Filmsammlung früh Edison, beschloss ich, alle Trickfilme anzusehen, von denen es 15 von 1895 bis 1901 gab. Diese Filme nutzen im Allgemeinen kreatives Editieren, um Illusionen zu erzeugen. Meine Filmanalyse konzentrierte sich hauptsächlich darauf, die Poetik der meisten Trickfilme zu beschreiben und die evolutionsbiologischen Abweichungsmerkmale zu untersuchen, die in einigen der späteren Filme vorhanden sind.  Im Großen und Ganzen ist der Trickfilm gegen Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts an einen Ort gebunden, innerhalb eines vorderen Proszeniums komponiert, weist keine Kamerabewegungen auf, verwendet lange und mittlere Aufnahmen und hält sich an die strenge Methode \"ein Aufnahme = ein Film\". Es gibt jedoch einige Filme zu Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts, die diese Richtlinien in Frage stellen, indem sie Aspekte wie Mehrfachaufnahmen einführen.\n\nEin der auffälligsten gemeinsamen Aspekte der Trickfilme ist ihre Aufnahme in einem Innenauftritt innerhalb des Rahmens eines vorderen Proszeniums. Die Kamera bewegt sich nicht von ihrer Proszeniumsposition, um Figuren oder Objekte zu verfolgen. Diese Komposition war im frühen Film sehr verbreitet und zog ihre Wurzel aus dem Theater und, für Trickfilme, aus Varieté und Zauberkunst. Eine der inhärenten Einschränkungen bei der Verwendung der Bühne ist, dass sich die Figuren in Trickfilmen im Allgemeinen nur von Seite zu Seite bewegen und nicht auf oder weg von der Kamera zugehen. Nehmen wir zum Beispiel die Handlung des Films \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900). Die Schauspieler treten von rechts ein und bewegen sich hin und her auf der horizontalen Achse. Auch wenn sie den Rahmen verlassen, folgt ihnen die Kamera nicht.\n\nDer frontale Proszeniums-Stil der Komposition bedeutet auch, dass Aufnahmen tendenziell lange Aufnahmen und, seltener, mittlere Aufnahmen sind. Nahaufnahmen werden in keinem der Trickfilme aus dem Edison-Katalog verwendet. Dies geht auf die Theater- und Variet Tradition zurück, in der das Publikum die gesamte Aufführung zu jedem bestimmten Zeitpunkt sehen konnte, eingefasst durch die Grenzen der Bühne. Wie in den meisten frühen Filmen bewegen sich die Schauspieler nicht vom mittleren Grund zum Kameravordergrund, daher treten Nahaufnahmen nicht auf.\n\nIm Allgemeinen folgen die meisten frühen Trickfilme dem Muster, dass eine konzeptionelle Aufnahme einem Film entspricht. Dies begrenzt die Länge der meisten Trickfilme auf etwa eine Minute oder weniger, abhängig von den Bildern pro Sekunde. Es begrenzt auch die dramatische oder narrative Verwendung der Trickfilme; die meisten von ihnen konzentrieren sich auf kurze, vaudeville-ähnliche Tricks, wie Magie, Verschwinden und Schalt-Aktionen mit wenig Geschichte. Beachten Sie jedoch, dass in einem Trickfilm eine konzeptionelle Aufnahme aus Sicht des Zuschauers nicht tatsächlich einer physischen Aufnahme entspricht. Eine einzelne \"Aufnahme\" kann tatsächlich mehrere Aufnahmen sein, die zusammengefügt werden, um den Eindruck von Erscheinung oder Verschwinden zu erzeugen. Schauen Sie sich \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), einen der früheren Trickfilme, genau an. Eine gründlichere Untersuchung zeigt den Moment, in dem die physische Aufnahme mit Marys abgetrennter \"Kopf\" beginnt, obwohl der ganze Film konzeptionell für den Zuschauer eine Aufnahme ist.\n\n[REWRITE]\nIn looking through the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901.

Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot.

    "transformed": "In looking through the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium.

Obwohl er hauptsächlich ein Agrarwissenschaftler war, prägte ihn genau dieser Beruf zusammen mit seiner kurzen politischen Laufbahn zu einem Mann, der für seine Hingabe und seine offene Meinung in Fragen der persönlichen Freiheit und der Regierung bekannt war. Seine Hingabe an ein agrarisches System bildete die Grundlage für fast alle seine Meinungen über die Regierung. Es war sein Versuch, das zu bewahren und zu fördern, was er für die vorzüglichste aller Berufe hielt, der seine Argumente über Souveränität, Verfassungsmäßigkeit und sogar das Justizsystem färbte.\n\nJohn Taylor glaubte, dass die Vereinigten Staaten eine große Chance hatten, ein ideales System zu schaffen, weil es keine einheimische Tradition gab, die die Urheber der Regierung behindern konnte, was die Errichtung eines Systems der Selbstverwaltung ermöglichte. Er glaubte stark an die natürlichen Rechte des Menschen und daran, dass sie alle voneinander abhängig sind – was bedeutet, dass wenn einer verweigert wird, dann alle scheitern, und der Wert der verbleibenden verringert wird. Diese Rechte sollten daher außerhalb der Reichweite der Regierung liegen. Er behauptete, dass das, was manche als \"Naturzustand\" bezeichneten, bedeutete, dass diejenigen, die physische Stärke und bösartige Intelligenz besaßen, die größten Vorteile daraus zog, aber dass dies in einer Zivilisation nicht der Fall sein dürfe.\n\nUm diese ideale Gesellschaft zu schaffen, glaubte Taylor, müsse eine Regierung geschaffen werden, die die angeborene Güte und das angeborene Böse im Menschen berücksichtigt. Taylor war sehr dogmatisch in seinen Ansichten über eine dualistische Moral. Er behauptete: \"Da die Regierung von Menschen ausgeübt wird, müssen alle ihre Tugenden und Laster menschlich sein\" (ebd., S. 167). Er definierte gute Prinzipien als solche, die das Privateigentum schützen, die Landwirtschaft verbessern und den Kapitalismus entmutigen, und glaubte, dass eine Regierung, die auf guten Prinzipien gegründet ist, unabhängig von ihrer Verwaltung gerecht funktionieren würde, die unweigerlich von Habgier und Eigennutz geleitet würde. Eigennutz sei nach seiner Überzeugung die Motivation des Menschen in allen Dingen, aber dieses Merkmal werde nur dann als böse betrachtet, wenn es über die Schaffung einer Gesellschaft, die auf dem Gemeinwohl beruht, hinausgeht und Untergesellschaften entstehen, die auf Kosten anderer leben. Eine gute Regierung sei notwendig, um das natürliche Böse des Menschen einzudämmen, und selbst dann müsse sie unter sorgfältiger Beobachtung stehen, um die Hinzufügung schlechter Prinzipien zu vermeiden.\n\nTaylor, wie viele andere entschiedene Republikaner seiner Zeit, forderte eine strenge Auslegung der Verfassung. Er wünschte sich eine äußerst begrenzte Bundesregierung, mit keinen mehr Rechten oder Befugnissen, als in der Verfassung explizit angegeben waren. Er wusste, dass eine weitreichende Bundesregierung teuer wäre und daher wahrscheinlich despotisch werden würde. Er glaubte jedoch, dass eine einfache, wörtliche Interpretation gefährlich sei und dass ohne Bezugnahme auf die Absicht der Urheber diese Methode leicht korrumpiert werden könnte. Darüber hinaus betrachtete er die Unabhängigkeitserklärung als das wahre Gründungsdokument der Vereinigten Staaten, weil sie das Land expliziter als eine Gruppe souveräner Staaten und nicht als eine Nation beschreibt.\n\n\n\n[REWRITE] John Taylor of Caroline was an early and fervent supporter of Republicanism.

Das war etwas enttäuschend, und es ist schwer zu sagen, warum das passiert sein könnte. Mit dem Einsetzen des Winters an einem Campus in Neuengland sinkt die Zahl der Menschen, die mit dem Fahrrad oder zu Fuß zur Arbeit pendeln, was möglicherweise einen Teil des Rückgangs erklären könnte. Dezember markiert auch das Ende des Herbstsemesters, in dem jeder sehr beschäftigt ist, mit den Hausarbeiten fertig zu werden, die Noten zu bearbeiten und so weiter. Das Ausfüllen des Pendlerprotokolls ist für viele vielleicht einfach von der Radar-Anzeige verschwunden. Darüber hinaus bringt Dezember mit sich den Beginn der geschäftigen Weihnachtszeit und die sich daraus ergebende einmonatige Pause für Studenten und Fakultät, in der viele nicht einmal zum Campus kommen müssen. Die Vorlesungen beginnen dann im späten Januar für das Frühlingssemester, was möglicherweise auch ein Hinweis auf die geringe Anzahl der Protokolle für diesen Monat ist. Nichts davon erklärt jedoch wirklich die geringe Anzahl der Einreichungen für Februar. Man könnte auch annehmen, dass jedes Projekt dieser Art zu Beginn einen anfänglichen Schub an Energie und Begeisterung erlebt, der dann natürlich nachlässt. Um diesem Trend entgegenzuwirken, haben wir die \"Carpool Challenge Week\" entwickelt, eine spezielle Blitzaktion im März, um die Initiative wiederzubeleben, was zu einer Steigerung der Einreichungen von Protokollen für diesen Monat führte. Eine der Herausforderungen, die wir erlebt haben, war also, den Projektfortschritt aufrechtzuerhalten angesichts sowohl des natürlichen Rückgangs der Beteiligung als auch des spezifischen Problems der Ferien- und Semesterferien in der Hochschulbildung.\n\nEine weitere Herausforderung für dieses Projekt (oder jedes Projekt zur alternativen Fortbewegung) ist die einfache Tatsache, dass Menschen die Freiheit, Unabhängigkeit und Flexibilität genießen, mit ihrem Auto zu fahren. Dies ist tief in unserer Kultur verwurzelt. Daher ist es wichtig, Anreize für die Nutzung alternativer Verkehrsmittel zu schaffen. Wir haben viele Preise in Form von Gutscheinen für lokale Restaurants, Cafés, Massagesalons, den lokalen unabhängigen Buchladen und sogar einige größere nationale Kettengeschäfte vergeben. Es wäre jedoch interessant gewesen zu sehen, wie sich einige noch größere Preise auf die Teilnahme ausgewirkt hätten – wie die Verlosung eines schönen Fahrrads, eines Hybridautos oder eines Elektroautos. Dies hätte auch dazu beitragen können, den Rückgang der Beteiligung zu bekämpfen, den das Projekt erlebt hat. Die Art der Preise hat sich im Laufe des Projekts nicht wirklich geändert. Wenn die Preise im Laufe des Projekts jedoch an Wert gewonnen hätten, hätte dies möglicherweise geholfen. Die Geschenkgutscheine schienen zu Beginn des Projekts mehr als ausreichend zu sein, aber wenn wir im Dezember die Hinzufügung von ein paar Fahrrädern angekündigt hätten und dann im Januar die Hinzufügung eines Hybrid- oder Elektroautos, kann man nur vermuten, dass die Teilnahme und die Beteiligung anstelle des Rückgangs gestiegen wären.\n\n\n## English Translation:\n\n[REWRITE] Referring back to Figure 17, there was a steep drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project.

Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

Obwohl diese Vorteile äußerst attraktiv sind, sind die Verwaltungsgebühren von ETFs deutlich niedriger als die der durchschnittlichen Investmentfonds.  Leider gibt es einige Nachteile, wie zum Beispiel die Notwendigkeit, für jeden Handel mit ETFs eine Provision zu zahlen, genau wie für einen Aktienauftrag. Ein weiterer Vorteil von ETFs ist die große Auswahl an Fonds.  Obwohl diese Vorteile klar dargelegt sind, ist es immer ein guter Übung für den erfahrenen Finanzinvestor, zu bewerten, ob die genannten Vorteile, wie die Diversifikation, tatsächlich existieren und in welchem Umfang.  Zum Zweck dieses Unterfangens werden wir den ETF IHF untersuchen und ihn mit den zehn wichtigsten Positionen vergleichen, die den ETF bilden, um festzustellen, ob die Vorteile des Besitzes eines einzelnen ETFs denen eines diversifizierten Portfolios der zehn Aktien entsprechen und ob es bessere Konfigurationen derselben Aktien gibt, die einen besseren Sharp-Ratio oder eine höhere Rendite erzielen würden.\nUm den ETF zu bewerten, würde es sehr umständlich sein, alle Positionen einzubeziehen, daher haben wir beschlossen, nur die zehn wichtigsten Positionen einzubeziehen, die 63,58 % aller Vermögenswerte des ETFs ausmachen.

An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership, like the ability to sell short, buy on margin, and purchase as few as one share in any transaction. Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund. Unfortunately, there are some downsides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.

In \"Traumland\" verwendet Poe den Begriff \"Thulé\" in den Zeilen 6 und 56, den Mabbott auf Virgil zurückführt. Virgil verwendete den Begriff in Bezug auf eine Insel nördlich von Britannien, die die Griechen als den Rand der bekannten Welt betrachteten. Es ist sicher, dass Virgil den Begriff verwendete, aber es gibt eine aktuellere Quelle, der man einige Anerkennung zollen muss. Poe interessierte sich sehr für deutsche Autoren.\n\nDieser Zitat ist wichtig, weil es Poes Vertrautheit mit Goethes Werk zeigt. Karl J. Arndt, in seinem Buch \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon\", kommentiert die Ähnlichkeit seiner beiden Gedichte und kommt zu dem Schluss, dass Poe Goethe imitierte. \n\nDer Oxford Companion to English Literature sagt von Goethe, er sei ein gefeierter Autor des poetischen Dramas Faust, das in zwei Teilen veröffentlicht wurde, der erste 1808 und der zweite im Jahr Goethes Todesjahres 1832. In den poetischen Versen des zweiten Teils von Faust befindet sich ein kurzes Gedicht mit dem Titel \"Der König von Thulé\". Das Gedicht handelt von einem König, dessen Frau stirbt, nachdem sie ihm das Geschenk eines Kelches gemacht hat. Nachdem seine Frau gestorben ist, beginnt er stark zu trinken und weint aus Erinnerung an seine verstorbene Königin. Dann beschließt er, es ist Zeit für ihn zu sterben, und gibt seine Besitztümer seinen Kindern, bis auf den Kelch. Dann geht er zu einer Klippe, wirft den Kelch ins Meer, schließt die Augen und stirbt. Die Haltung des Königs von Thulé und die Beschreibung des Königs in Traumland sind sehr ähnlich, vielleicht ein dunkler Doppelgänger von Poes Verlust und seinem Trinksucht-Halt. Faust wurde auch 1842 von H. P. Grattan in ein romantisches Drama umgewandelt, weniger als ein Jahr vor Poes Verwendung des Begriffs Thule in \"Die Folter und das Pendel\". \n\nPoe erwähnt Thule zweimal in seinen gesammelten Schriften. Einmal erwähnt Poe „ultma Thule“ in „Die Folter und das Pendel“, aber er verwendet diesen Ausdruck in „Traumland“ zweimal, als Buchschlusspunkte des Gedichts. „Der König von Thulé“ und „Traumland“ können als Begleitstücke gelesen werden. In „Traumland“ sagt der Sprecher: „Ich bin im Land der ständigen Nacht“  Er beschreibt dann die Landschaft Thules und wie sie dunkel und einsam ist, wie er von toten Freunden verfolgt wird und wie er eine schattige Welt ohne Farbe sieht. All diese Szenen würden in „Der König von Thulé“ von Goethe gelesen werden, da er gerade seine Frau verloren hat, er ist einsam und er hat seinen Willen zur Herrschaft oder sogar zum Leben verloren. Das ganze Gedicht ist eine Beschreibung, als wäre der Sprecher in Goethes Gedicht eingetreten.\n\nGoethe war ein bedeutender Autor, den Poe hätte kennen müssen, wenn es auch nur aus Respekt vor Tennyson. Poe sagte dies, als man ihn fragte, ob er Tennyson bewunderte:  [ ]  Neben der Verbindung zu Tennyson wäre Poe Goethes Werk durch die vielen Reproduktionen, die nach der ursprünglichen Veröffentlichung stattfanden, ausgesetzt gewesen.\n\n\n\n[REWRITE]\n\nDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems.

Palmer wird argumentieren können, dass Martin hätte wissen müssen, welche wahrscheinlich Gefahr damit verbunden ist, eine Pfütze nicht zu reinigen, da in den Monaten vor Palmers Unfall bereits mehrere Kunden von D&D aufgrund von Rutschunfällen verletzt wurden; und trotz dieses Wissens hat er die Pfütze immer noch nicht beseitigen lassen. Palmers Argument, dass Martins Handlungen verabscheuungswürdig waren, ist weniger überzeugend, aber immer noch vertretbar angesichts der Tatsache, dass 2009 sechs Fälle von Rutschunfällen aufgetreten waren und Martin dennoch keine angemessenen Maßnahmen ergriffen hatte, um die Sicherheit seines Ladens zu gewährleisten.\n\nAm 13.

    "original": "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",

    "raw_output": "Fast vier Jahre her habe ich an der CBC einen Kurs über Islam belegt. Eines der Hauptthemen der hitzigen Diskussionen in dem Kurs war, ob Islam eine feindselige Religion ist oder nicht. Ich glaube, dass die Frage heute relevanter denn je ist. \n\nWenn ich an die Ereignisse seit dem 11. September zurückdenke, habe ich persönlich beobachtet, wie die Massenmedien von einer feindseligen Haltung gegenüber Islam und Extremisten zu einer extremen Form der Toleranz gegenüber Islam in Amerika übergegangen sind. Ich glaube nicht, dass es 2001 je einen Präsidentschaftskandidaten mit dem Namen Barack Obama gegeben hätte, der einen offensichtlichen muslimischen Hintergrund in seiner Familie hat.\n\nDie Biographie des Propheten fasziniert mich, weil sie meiner Kenntnis nach der Geschichte Muhammads widerspricht. Aus dem, was ich wusste und gelernt hatte, glaubte ich, dass Muhammad Konvertiten zum Islam zwang. Er eroberte Stämme und zwang sie dann, die islamische Religion anzunehmen. Aber laut der Biographie wurde Muhammad als eine Art Märtyrer dargestellt, der missverstanden wurde und sich sogar anderen unterwarf. Danach kamen die Menschen nacheinander und sahen die \"Wahrheit\" in seinem Lehren und suchten ihn auf.\n\nEs gibt außerdem einige erstaunliche Ähnlichkeiten zwischen den Diensten Jesu und den \"Wundern\" Muhammads. Das offensichtlichste ist, als er Schaf und Milch nahm und sie so vervielfachte, dass es mehr als genug für vierzig Männer gab. Es ist dieser Schreibstil, der mich glauben lässt, dass die Autoren wollten, dass Muhammad als bescheidener Prophet wahrgenommen wird, der nichts beweisen musste, sondern einfach in Wahrheit und Wundern lebte. Diese Art von Fehlschluss ist die schlimmste, weil sie das Wunder und das Leben Jesu Christi verharmlost. Es ist, als würden sie stehlen und versuch, sich das Leben und die Person Jesu durch Muhammad anzueignen.\n\nEs gibt auch viele Geschichten in der Biographie, die den Eindruck erwecken, dass Teil ihrer Agenda darin besteht, Beweise für \"Zeugnis\" oder dafür zu liefern, wie Menschen \"eigenständig\" zum Islam konvertierten. Das Problem ist jedoch, dass viele der Geschichten zumindest aus dritter Hand stammen. Das heißt, der Autor illustriert in der Geschichte, dass er von so und so gehört hat, der von so und so gehört hat usw. Das gefiel mir nicht so gut, denn obwohl ihre Idee war, dass es den Beweis für die Wahrheit der Geschichten lieferte, fand ich, dass es die Geschichten vermindert und sie viel verdächtig erscheinen ließ.\n\nDas, was mich an diesem Werk am meisten stört, ist, dass sie versuchen, Muhammad als einen gottähnlichen Mann zu erheben und zu verherrlichen, der bescheiden, liebenswert, weise und sanft war. Aber die Geschichte widerspricht der Idee, dass Muhammad ein sanfter und bescheidener Mann war, und ich kann nicht anders, als zu denken, ob die Muslime heute die wahre Geschichte hinter Muhammads Aufstieg zur Macht kennen.\n\n\n\n[REWRITE]Almost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC. One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion. I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before. Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme form of tolerance for Islam in America. I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Barack Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\nThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad. From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion. But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others. After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\nAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad. The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men. It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles. This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ. To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.\n\nThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam. But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective. That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc. I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\nI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle. But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. \n\n\n[/REWRITE]\n",

Schauen wir uns diese Geschichte in breiten Strichen an, erkennen wir einen Trend, wie das Christentum immer weiter von seinen Wurzeln abweicht.  Es scheint, als zeige die heutige Welt ein wachsendes Bewusstsein und eine beispiellose progressive Tendenz. Während traditionelle Menschen verbleiben und sich jedem Denken widersetzen werden, das über das hinausgeht, was ihnen beigebracht wurde, mag dieser Teil der Bevölkerung nicht prominent genug sein, um den ganzen Verlauf zu beeinflussen. Unter Christen wird in den kommenden Jahren ein historisches Bewusstsein enorm wachsen. Ein Sehnen nach dem Unterscheiden der in das Christentum im Laufe der Zeit eingefügten Lehren von der eigentlichen Intention des Namensgebers der Religion wird sich verbreiten. Es kann Jahrzehnte oder sogar Jahrhunderte dauern, aber das Ergebnis wird unvermeidlich sein: Es wird eine große Kehrtwende im Verlauf der christlichen Geschichte geben. Es wird ein Fortschritt zurück zu seiner ursprünglichen Form geben. Eine Bewegung wird an Stärke gewinnen, die Schicht für Schicht dogmatische Schichten entfernt, so als ob die Uhr rückwärts laufen würde, bis nichts übrig bleibt als ein Verständnis dessen, was Jesus der Menschheit im Namen Gottes eingebracht hat, bevor andere Denker solche Behauptungen aufstellten. Wenn dieser Trend durch die Vereinigten Staaten und Europa zieht und Massen in seinem Gefolge beeinflusst, die so beten, als ob wir in der Zeit Jesu lebten und nur seine Ideen befolgen würden, wird die Kirche als Institution stark bleiben, um den Weg zu weisen.  Da sich die theologische Uhr jedoch rückwärts bewegt hat, wird die extreme Vielfältigkeit in der Christenheit in immer mehr Einheitlichkeit von Glauben und Praxis zurückkehren. Zwischen Regionen, zwischen Konfessionen, zwischen allen Arten von Spaltungen werden wir stattdessen von Unterschieden zunehmend Ähnlichkeiten sehen. Die Menschheitsgeschichte ist voller großer Rückkehrungen. Ein Beispiel dafür ist, wie Christen einst vom Römischen Reich verfolgt, gemieden und getötet wurden. Aber später wurde dieses Reich zu einer christlichen Institution. Unser Land ist von der afrikanisch-amerikanischen Sklaverei zur afrikanisch-amerikanischen Führung gelangt. Die große Rückkehr, die in unserer Zukunft bevorsteht, wird sich in der Arena der christlichen Religion abspielen, die Geschichte auf der Suche nach der Quelle rückgängig machen und dabei die Vielfalt aufheben. Es ist wichtig zu beachten, dass Teil dessen, was diesen Prozess möglich machen wird, eine Methode sein wird, Jesu Worte metaphorisch zu lesen, und nicht als wörtliche Aussagen. Also, was geschah seit Jesu Lebenszeit? Wenn wir weit genug zurück in die Geschichte blicken, finden wir nur Judentum, den theologischen Beginn der christlichen Religion. Monotheismus, die Vorstellung einer von Gott offenbarten Religion und die Autorität der hebräischen Schriften waren allesamt im Kern der Religion, als die Römer 63 v. Chr. die Kontrolle über Jerusalem übernahmen. Die jüdische Bevölkerung teilte nicht einen Geist. Sie teilte sich in Sadduzäer, Pharisäer, Essener, Zeloten und die Mehrheit der einfachen Leute auf. \n\n[REWRITE] \nThe teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.

They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",

Sie wollen nur auf sich selbst schauen und ihr Leben so gut wie möglich gestalten, aber nie auf andere, die unter ihnen stehen. \"The Jungle\" zeigt dies auf viele Arten. Der offensichtlichste Bereich ist der der Besitzer und Manager der großen Fabriken.  Alles, was sie wollen, ist, ihre Unternehmen und Fabriken so groß und bedeutend wie möglich zu machen. Sie kümmern sich nicht um jemanden oder etwas, das ihnen im Weg steht oder verletzt wird, weil sie Fortschritte erzielen. Nach Upton Sinclairs Werk heißt es: \"Die Gebäude reihten sich deutlich und schwarz gegen den Himmel; hier und da erhob sich aus der Masse die großen Schornsteine, mit dem Rauchfluss, der bis zum Ende der Welt floss\". Sinclair versucht, ein Bild vom großen Schaden zu zeichnen, den diese Verschmutzung verursacht. Er zeigt, dass die Besitzer keine Rücksicht auf eine Person oder ein Tier nehmen, das verletzt werden könnte. Sie kümmern sich nicht um die großen Rauchwolken, die aus den Fabriken steigen, oder das Abwasser aus Tierkot und Urin aus den Tausenden von Ställen rund um Packingtown.\n\nDie Besitzer und Manager kümmerten sich auch nicht um ihre Angestellten, die ihnen zum Reichtum verholfen. Sie würden alles tun, um einen zusätzlichen Dollar zu verdienen oder zu sparen: \"Von oben bis unten ist der Ort einfach ein brodelnder Kessel aus Neid und Hass; es gibt nirgendwo Loyalität oder Anstand, es gibt keinen Ort, an dem ein Mensch etwas wert ist gegen einen Dollar\". Sie zwingen ihre Angestellten, schreckliche Stunden zu arbeiten, und ohne vorherige Ankündigung können sie jederzeit ganze Gruppen von Menschen entlassen, ohne Entschädigung oder Hilfe bei der Arbeitssuche. In der Zeit, in der \"The Jungle\" spielt, gab es nicht viele, wenn überhaupt, Gesetze oder Vorschriften, die den Arbeitsschutz oder das Wohlergehen der Arbeitnehmer schützten. Dies erlaubte den Managern und Besitzern, sich wild zu entfalten und ihre Mitarbeiter zu zwingen, den Fortschritt zu beschleunigen und unter schrecklichen Bedingungen zu arbeiten. Obwohl das Buch es nicht direkt sagt, wird vorausgesetzt, dass die Menschen, die in Packingtown lebten und sich selbst in den Tod arbeiteten, einfach mit den schrecklichen Bedingungen fertig werden sollten, sowohl bei der Arbeit in den Fabriken als auch in ihrer Umgebung. Es gab keine Agenturen oder Organisationen, die den Arbeitern Informationen oder Hilfe boten. Es gab Gewerkschaften, die gegründet wurden, aber diese taten oft mehr Schaden als nützlich, da sie von den armen Arbeitern profitierten. Die Arbeiter wurden so schlecht behandelt und hatten keinen Ausweg aus dem System von Packingtown, dass sie als Sklaven beschrieben wurden: \"Hier ist eine Bevölkerung, niedriggestellte und hauptsächlich ausländische Menschen, die immer am Rande des Hungers leben und für ihre Lebensmöglichkeiten auf den Whim von Männern angewiesen sind, die genauso brutal und unehrlich sind wie die alten Sklavenhalter; unter solchen Umständen ist Immoralität genau so unvermeidlich und weit verbreitet, wie es unter dem System der Sklaverei der Fall ist.\"\n\n\n## Rewritten English:\n\n[REWRITE]I believe that \"The Jungle\" demonstrates how inherently greedy and self-centered human beings are.

This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter. \n\n[REWRITE] Many authors use different ways to convey a particular feeling or attitude toward important subjects to their readers. Some techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald employs many of these diverse techniques in his novel *The Great Gatsby*. Sometimes, he pairs adjectives and nouns in unconventional ways to create a specific aura around a subject. Other times, he imbues a symbol with meaning and then uses it for the same purpose. Fitzgerald uses this latter technique with numerous colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In his novel *The Great Gatsby*, he builds up meaning for the colors white/gray and red/pink, which he then uses later to evoke a particular feeling associated with important objects.\n\nThe meaning Fitzgerald constructs and utilizes for white/gray is uniformity, with white representing a more refined and elevated class, while gray suggests something older and faded. He establishes this meaning early in the novel through frequent use of both colors. Daisy and Jordan are constantly \"in white\" (8) – in fact, everyone seems to be wearing white: Nick wears \"white flannels\" (41) to Gatsby's party, Tom sports a \"white shirt\" (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is \"powdered milky white\" (30). The only exception to this white uniformity occurs when Nick observes Gatsby's party: \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors by applying them to numerous common, seemingly insignificant subjects. For instance, as Nick commutes to work, he travels \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" (56). The names of the guests at Gatsby's parties appear as \"gray names\" (61) on Nick's timetable. Catherine's apartment is described as \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\" – a visual representation of uniformity (28).

The \"Italian child\" on the railroad is \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is \"a gray old man\" (27).\n\nAfter Fitzgerald has imbued white/gray with sufficient meaning, he uses them to signify insignificance or uniformity in relation to certain subjects. This technique of employing colors to subtly convey meaning initially manifests itself through Daisy. After a prolonged absence of either color, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in a \"little white roadster.\" Readers begin to perceive Daisy as less of a fully realized character and more like a uniform appendage, something Gatsby desires and yearns for (74). Fitzgerald reinforces this impression of Daisy as a more uniform figure by continuing to use these colors around her. For example, there's a \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" (18), and she is once again in a \"white\" (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby's confrontation.\n\n[/REWRITE]  \n\n\n",

Es gibt einen bedeutenden Markt für biologisch-regionalen Anbau in der Gegend von San Diego, wobei viele lokale Organisationen lange Wartellisten haben. Bio-Eier und -milch sind ebenfalls beliebt. Viele Bio-Farmen bieten auch Führungen durch ihren landwirtschaftlichen Betrieb sowie Zugang zu Wanderungen, Vogelbeobachtungen und anderen Freizeitaktivitäten an. Dies ist die Art von Betrieb, die es dem Grundeigentümer ermöglichen würde, die Vorteile von Regierungsprogrammen zu nutzen und gleichzeitig Lebensräume zu verbessern, was die Nutzungsmöglichkeiten für Freizeitaktivitäten ermöglicht und Möglichkeiten für Farm-Touren und andere Programme zur Gewinnung von Geld oder zu Bildungszwecken schafft. \n\nDarüber hinaus trägt der biologische Anbau neben der Erschließung eines potenziell lukrativen Nischenmarktes oft zu einer größeren Biodiversität von Pflanzen und Wildtieren in der Region bei, da Chemikalien im Boden und im Wasser fehlen. Allerdings hat der biologische Anbau in einigen Aspekten höhere Kosten als der konventionelle Anbau. Er erfordert mehr intensive Arbeitskraft und Management, um Schädlinge und Unkraut zu entfernen und den Boden ohne Chemikalien zu düngen, und die Verluste sind oft höher als bei konventionellen Methoden, während ein kleiner Bio-Betrieb auch die Effizienz der Skalierung großer Betriebe nicht erreicht. Praktiken, die nicht zum ökologischen Anbau gehören, aber für die Tierwelt vorteilhaft sind, können ebenfalls zu höheren Arbeitskosten führen, einschließlich der Aussaat von Zwischenfrüchten, strategischer Weidewirtschaft, Entfernung invasiver Arten und aktiver Steuerung des Pflanzenwachstums, um spezifische Bedingungen wie Randlebensräume oder Flächen mit offenem Boden zu schaffen. Daher gibt es viele Gründe, warum der Grundstücksbesitzer in diesem Beispiel finanzielle Hilfe oder Fachwissen suchen könnte, um sowohl Gewinne als auch die Lebensraumqualität zu maximieren.\n\nDas für dieses Szenario gewählte Land ist ein Grundstück neben der Stadt Potrero im nicht eingemeindeten San Diego County, Kalifornien.

Sie ist auch nicht singular oder einheitlich. Aussagen wie \"alle Russen sind hartnäckig\" oder \"alle Japaner sind entgegenkommend\" sind von Natur aus breit gefächert und zu vereinfachend. Während das Verständnis von kulturellen Verallgemeinerungen angebracht ist, ist es für einen Verhandlungspartner viel produktiver, die Bedeutung einer Kultur für die jeweilige Angelegenheit zu verstehen und wie die Einstellung dieser Kultur die Verhandlungen beeinflussen kann und wird. Wenn man einer Fremdkultur begegnet, erlebt man sie auf eine Weise, die mit der eigenen Kultur vergleichbar ist, und Vergleiche entstehen zwangsläufig.\n\nDas Verstehen einer fremden Kultur oder Denkweise kann alles umfassen, von der Erforschung ihrer Geschichte bis zur Erkenntnis ihrer Vorurteile. Anstatt eine Kultur zu beurteilen oder zu versuchen, sie zu ändern, muss man sie einfach so akzeptieren, wie sie ist, und innerhalb ihrer Grenzen arbeiten, insbesondere im Rahmen von Verhandlungen, und besonders, wenn man mit einer schwächeren Verhandlungsposition an den Tisch kommt. Ebenso kann Respekt vor Traditionen und Überzeugungen dazu beitragen, kulturelle Barrieren zu überwinden und die Verhandlungen voranzutreiben, wenn ein Verhandlungspartner sich in einem \"fremden\" Gebiet befindet.\n\nEs ist wichtig zu beachten, dass Kultur sich nicht unbedingt auf eine nationale/internationale Dichotomie beschränkt. Die meisten Unternehmen innerhalb eines Landes etablieren ihre eigene Unternehmenskultur. Zum Beispiel kann eine Unternehmenskultur lange Arbeitszeiten im Büro oder einen entspannteren Stundenplan betonen. Beweise für eine Unternehmenskultur sind in Dresscodes der Mitarbeiter, im Kommunikationsstil (direkt vs. indirekt, Delegation von Aufgaben) und in den Einstellungspraktiken zu finden. Einige Unternehmen fördern die Philanthropie auf allen Ebenen der Mitarbeiter, während andere sie auf \"von Unternehmen genehmigte\" Wohltätigkeitsorganisationen oder Fundraising-Aktionen beschränken. Man braucht nur die Unterschiede in der amerikanischen Unternehmenskultur von Unternehmen zu Unternehmen (und tatsächlich gibt es auch innerhalb eines Unternehmens Diversität von Region zu Region, von städtischen zu suburbanen Umgebungen) zu betrachten, um die Vielfalt der Gedanken zu schätzen, die in einer bestimmten gesellschaftlichen Kultur existieren kann. Bestimmte Kulturen sind nicht annähernd so stratifiziert wie die amerikanische Kultur und können für Außenstehende homogener erscheinen, aber ein ähnliches Äußeres ist nur ein Zeichen dafür, tiefer zu graben.\n\nWerte sind noch wichtiger zu verstehen, weil sie den \"Warum\" einer Kultur liefern. Wenn beispielsweise Gesichtserhaltung oder gemeinschaftliche Harmonie in einer Kultur geschätzt werden, ist es sicher, dass ein Verhandlungspartner seine Firma und seinen Vorgesetzten nicht öffentlich beschämen wird, um am Verhandlungstisch erfolgreich zu sein. Ebenso wird ein Verhandlungspartner aus einer Kultur, die dem harten Geschäft mehr Gewicht verleiht, nicht unbedingt gezwungen sein, so schnell wie möglich zu einer Einigung zu kommen. Die Berücksichtigung dieser Verallgemeinerungen ist wichtig, bevor man an den Verhandlungstisch kommt.

    "original": "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",

Da beide Argumente sich auf dasselbe Konzept beziehen und unsere Herausforderung darin besteht, festzustellen, welches die bessere der beiden ist, müssen wir, aus Gründen der Kürze, von der Prämisse ausgehen, dass beide in ihrer Überzeugung von der Existenz Gottes, insbesondere des Gottes der Bibel, richtig liegen.

Anslems Passage spiegelt einen Weg wider, Erkenntnis durch Glauben zu gewinnen, indem man in sich selbst sucht, um Beweise für Gott zu finden. Er erklärt, dass, weil Gott in unserem Verständnis existiert, wir seine Nichtexistenz nicht effektiv begreifen können. Während dieses Konzept, wenn es in seiner Terminologie formuliert wird, etwas mühsam und stellenweise unklar ist, ist das grundlegende Anliegen, dass der Beweis für Gott im eigenen Geist liegt. St. Anselm schlägt uns vor, dass wir nicht über die Grenzen unserer eigenen Seele hinausgehen müssen, um Wahrheit über Gott zu finden, sondern dass die Existenz dieses Wesens durch die Untersuchung dessen, was wir in unseren eigenen Gedanken als wahr wissen, als wahr erkannt wird. Fremde Beweise sind mutmaßlich überflüssig. Dieses Konzept, die Annahme dessen, für das es keinen unbestreitbaren Körper empirischer Beweise gibt, wird in christlichen Texten oft als Glaube bezeichnet.\n\nDiese Idee unterscheidet sich stark von der von St. Thomas von Aquin. Thomas argumentiert, dass die Existenz Gottes vollständig durch Vernunft und empirische Beweise bewiesen werden kann, ohne jeglichen Glaubensbedarf. Eine solche Idee wäre im Evangelisten, einem wichtigen Element des Christentums, vorteilhaft, da sie die Gewinnung neuer Anhänger ohne Abhängigkeit von ihrer Bereitschaft ermöglichen würde, etwas zu akzeptieren, das nicht bewiesen werden kann. Sie könnten stattdessen allein durch Logik überzeugt werden. St. Thomas erläutert fünf verschiedene logische Argumente, die die Existenz Gottes stützen: Veränderung, Kausalität, Kontingenz, Grade der Vollkommenheit und Harmonie. In jedem von ihnen demonstriert er im Wesentlichen, dass der Beweis für Gott in der logischen Notwendigkeit für Gott liegt. Wenn man einem erzählt wird, dass man ein fehlendes Puzzlestein fehlt, und man den Rest des Puzzles zusammensetzt, diktier die Logik, dass man die Merkmale und die Existenz des fehlenden Steins kennen kann, ohne ihn zu sehen. \n\n\n[REWRITE]\nThe fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.' This quotation first appears in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm's argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to be held by the other author we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas as well. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine whose is better, we must, for brevity's sake, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not allow us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God. \n\nTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm's passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within oneself to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one's own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn't go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\nThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it. \n[/REWRITE] \n\n\n\n",

    "raw_output": "## German Translation:\n\nIrgendwann im 5. oder 6. Jahrhundert v. Chr. wurde ein Prinz geboren, der eines Tages Buddha genannt werden sollte. Im Laufe seines Lebens gab er der Welt den Rücken und wurde erleuchtet, und seine Lehren führten zur Entstehung des Buddhismus - der orthodoxeste Zweig davon ist bekannt als Theravada-Buddhismus. Die Religion ist etwa zweitausendfünfhundert Jahre alt; sie sieht heute anders aus als zu Buddha's Lebzeiten. Das lässt sich überall beobachten, zum Beispiel in der Theravada-Nation Sri Lanka, wo jährlich die Wasser-Schnitt-Zeremonie begangen wird. Mönche und Laien nehmen an dieser Zeremonie teil, und sie hat religiöse Bedeutung, obwohl Buddha nie über eine solche Feier lehrte. Diese Unterschiede reichen von den oberflächlichen Traditionen bis zum soteriologischen Kern der Religion. Die Theravada-Buddhistische Gemeinschaft, sowohl aus monastischer als auch aus weltlicher Sicht, musste ihre Lehren im Laufe der Zeit ändern. Dies ist auf sowohl äußere als auch innere Kräfte, sowohl feindliche als auch wohlwollende, zurückzuführen.\n\nEs gibt eine Reihe von präqualifizierenden Begriffen, die in diesem Diskurs häufig verwendet werden. Es gibt das Konzept von innen versus außen. Hier wird eine innere Kraft als Kraft definiert, die von Mitgliedern des Buddhasasana ausgeht, unabhängig vom Mönchstatus. Eine äußere Kraft ist jede Kraft von Nicht-Buddhisten. Eine feindliche Kraft ist jede Kraft, die der buddhistischen Gemeinschaft schaden will oder verursacht - eine Kraft, die aus einer negativen Wahrnehmung des Buddhismus entspringt. Eine wohlwollende Kraft ist eine Kraft, die der buddhistischen Gemeinschaft weder schaden noch helfen will - obwohl sie möglicherweise als Nebenprodukt eines oder das andere tut. Diese Begriffe werden im Laufe dieses Diskussionsverlaufs immer wieder auftreten.\n\nEs ist zunächst wichtig, die Grundlagen der Religion zu untersuchen - die Lehren, die im Kern des Theravada-Buddhismus liegen. Buddhisten suchen Zuflucht im Dreifaltigkeitsjuwel aus Buddha, Dhamma und Sangha. Das Dhamma besteht im Wesentlichen aus dem Tripitaka - den drei Körben - buddhistischer Texte. Der Sutta Pitaka enthält alle Suttas, der Vinaya Pitaka enthält die Disziplinregeln und der Abhidhamma Pitaka enthält die metaphysischen Bestandteile des Buddhismus. Die metaphysischen Vorstellungen umfassen Dinge wie Anatta - keine Seele, Dukkha - innewohnendes Leid im Leben und Anicca - die Unbeständigkeit von allem. Nur durch die Anerkennung dieser Konzepte kann man Sansara, den Kreislauf von Tod und Wiedergeburt, beenden, der ständig stattfindet. Zusammen mit Sansara wird Lobha - Begierde, Dosa - Hass und Moha - Verwirrung enden, wenn man erhellt wird. Im Vinaya Pitaka werden Lebensregeln festgelegt. Für Laien gibt es fünf Gebote (Ich werde nicht töten, ich werde nicht lügen, ich werde nicht stehlen, ich werde mich nicht unmoralisch verhalten und ich werde keine berauschenden Substanzen konsumieren). Für Mönche gibt es viele weitere zu befolgende Disziplinregeln. Das grundlegendere doctrinale Konzept im Buddhismus ist das Konzept der vier edlen Wahrheiten. Erstens Dukkha; die Wahrheit, dass das Leben Leiden ist. Zweitens, dass Bindung Leid verursacht. Drittens, dass Leid überwunden werden kann.\n\n[REWRITE]\n\nSometime in the 5th or 6th century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born.

(Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).

Der Höhepunkt dieses Rivalitäten war der mexikanisch-amerikanische Krieg von 1846-1848, in dem die Vereinigten Staaten Mexiko angriffen und besiegten und sich Texas und den amerikanischen Südwesten als neues Gebiet sicherte. Viele weitere Zusammenstöße ereigneten sich zwischen den beiden Nationen, die kurz vor dem Ersten Weltkrieg schließlich abnahmen.  Die Rivalität begann, als Amerikaner und Mexikaner über wichtige Fragen wie Religion, Kultur und Traditionen aneinander stießen und einen großen Interessenkonflikt hatten (Schmitt 1974 S. 30-31).\n\nDies ähnelt vielen anderen Nationen, die eine anhaltende Rivalität mit einem Nachbarn haben. Nationen, die eine Grenze teilen, neigen dazu, Interessenkonflikte zu haben, die zur Entstehung rivalisierender Positionen zwischen den Nationen führen. Die Vereinigten Staaten und Mexiko ähneln vielen anderen anhaltenden Rivalitäten zwischen Nationen, die eine gemeinsame Grenze teilen. David M. Pletcher (1977) stellt fest: „Nur in Mexiko und Kuba kann man langwierige übergreifende amerikanische diplomatische Probleme finden“ (S. 41). Tatsächlich sind beide Nationen geografisch nahe an den Vereinigten Staaten und waren Rivalen der Vereinigten Staaten, während andere Nationen in Lateinamerika gute Beziehungen zu den Vereinigten Staaten pflegten und pflegen. \n\nReligiöse Fragen schufen einen Riss zwischen den beiden Nationen, ein Problem, das viele Nationen im Laufe der Geschichte belastet hat. Sally Frahm (2001) schreibt: „Wenn Amerikaner im 20. Jahrhundert gegen Faschismus und Kommunismus waren, waren sie im 18. und 19. Jahrhundert gegen Katholizismus und Monarchie“ (S.86). Ähnlich wie die Rivalität zwischen den Vereinigten Staaten und der Sowjetunion während des Kalten Krieges war zum Teil ein ideologischer Kampf und zum Teil ein Wettbewerb um Interessen, die jede Nation für lebenswichtig hielt. In diesem Fall basierten die ideologischen Auseinandersetzungen jedoch nicht auf der politischen Struktur, sondern auf den religiösen Präferenzen der Vereinigten Staaten und Mexikos. Dieses Misstrauen entstand aus dem Misstrauen zwischen den Engländern und den Spaniern. Die Vererbung dieser Gefühle des Misstrauens von ihren ehemaligen Kolonialherren war ein großes Hindernis bei der Begründung freundschaftlicher Außenbeziehungen zwischen den Vereinigten Staaten und Mexiko.\n\n\nDiehl und Goerts (2000) listen 17 Streitigkeiten zwischen Mexiko und den Vereinigten Staaten im 57-jährigen Rivalitätenzeitraum auf. Die Mehrheit der Streitigkeiten aus der Rivalitätenzeit, die von Diehl und Goerts beschrieben werden, sind territoriale Probleme im Zusammenhang mit Grenzüberschreitungen von mexikanischem Gebiet nach Mexiko und anderen Grenzproblemen. Grenzüberschreitungen durch Banditen und Gesetzesbrecher aus amerikanischen Grenzstädten waren ein großes Problem, das bis zu dem Zeitpunkt anhielt, als sowohl die Vereinigten Staaten als auch Mexiko militärische Kräfte an ihren Grenzen einsetzten (Schmitt 1974 S. 97). Schmitt (1974) erklärt, dass die Rivalität zwischen den beiden Nationen abnahm, als „Mexiko in erheblichem Umfang von den Vereinigten Staaten abhängig wurde“ (S. 109) und schließlich endete, als sich die amerikanischen Ambitionen „von der territorialen Expansion zur wirtschaftlichen Intervention in Mexiko“ (S.110) in der zweiten Hälfte des 19.

Gibt es Einschränkungen oder Beschränkungen, die die Richtung des evolutionären Wandels beeinflussen? Obwohl D'Arcy Thompson bereits 1917 feststellte: „Selbst jetzt hat der Zoologe kaum begonnen, die einfachsten organischen Formen in mathematischer Sprache zu definieren“, lässt sich dasselbe heute noch sagen. In jüngerer Zeit wurde mathematisches Modellieren auf allgemeine Aspekte der Mollusken-Skeletogenese sowohl durch Ontogenese als auch durch Phylogenie angewendet (z. B. Raup und Stanley, 1981). Unsere Studie untersucht, wie mathematisches Modellieren von ontogenetischen und phylogenetischen Veränderungen bei Prunum, in Kombination mit experimentellen Studien, zur Aufklärung der Mechanismen genutzt werden kann, die die Richtung und das Ausmaß evolutionärer-entwicklungsbedingter Veränderungen bestimmen. \n\nWir nutzten Röntgenaufnahmen von Prunum-Arten, um quantitative Parameter zu bestimmen, die ihrerseits zur Modellierung hypothetischer und tatsächlicher Skelettmorphologien eingesetzt werden konnten. Diese Parameter wurden in das Softwareprogramm CerioShell (Stone, 1995) eingegeben. Wir modellierten hypothetische Schalenmorphologien, die zur Interpretation der Grenzen möglicher morphologischer Veränderungen bei Prunum verwendet werden können. Diese Ergebnisse werden mit experimentellen und deskriptiven Studien kombiniert, um makroevolutionäre Ereignisse in dieser Klade besser zu verstehen.\n\nEine Schale kann als eine Struktur betrachtet werden, die sich im Laufe der Zeit durch 360 Grad Raum bewegt. Diese Umdrehungen oder Wendungen einer gekrümmten Schale werden Windungen genannt und werden als um eine imaginäre zentrale Achse spiraling betrachtet. Diese Achse verläuft durch die zentrale Säule der Schale und wird als Kolumnella bezeichnet. Die Geschwindigkeit, mit der sich die Windungen vergrößern, kann variieren, und eine kontinuierliche Linie trennt jede Windung und wird als Naht bezeichnet. Bei den meisten Schalen ist die größte Windung einer Schale die letzte Windung (Körperwindung). Die Spirale wird als alle Windungen außer der letzten betrachtet. Die Spitze ist die Spitze der Spirale und die gegenüberliegende Seite wird als Basis bezeichnet. Das Tier erstreckt sich durch eine Öffnung namens Apertur aus seiner Schale.\n\nSchalen können in apikaler, basal, apertural und abaperturaler Ansicht betrachtet werden. (Die „übliche“ Ausrichtung einer Schale ist eine apertural Ansicht, mit der Apertur zum Betrachter und mit der Spitze nach oben.)\n\nEine Methode zum Zählen von Windungen ist unten dargestellt. Zuerst sollte die Schale aus apikaler Sicht betrachtet werden, und dann sollte ermittelt werden, wo die erste Naht beginnt. Eine Linie kann dann gezogen werden, um die Schale in zwei Teile zu teilen. Windungen werden von dieser Linie gezählt und auf ein Viertel einer Windung geschätzt.\n\nEine Schale kann als eine Reihe von Apertur betrachtet werden, die sich im Laufe der Zeit und im Raum bewegen, während sich das Tier seine Schale aufbaut (d. h. baut). Es ist möglich, den Weg der Apertur mithilfe der Koordinaten des Zentrums der Apertur jeder Windung sowie des horizontalen und vertikalen Radius der Apertur zu verfolgen.\n\nDiese Trajektorie kann grafisch und mathematisch dargestellt werden. Sobald eine mathematische Formulierung erstellt wurde, ist es dann möglich, Parameter zu variieren und die Skeletogenese des Mollusken zu modifizieren. \n\n\n\n [REWRITE] Why do organisms evolve in the way they do?

Während das Land auf dem Weg ist, viele der Millenniumsentwicklungsziele zu erreichen, wie z. B. die Ziele für Wasser und Sanitär, liegen die Verbesserungsraten für die Gesundheit von Kindern und Müttern weit unter den notwendigen Verbesserungen, um die Zielvorgaben bis 2015 zu erfüllen. Die vielfältigen Gründe für diese Mängel werden im Folgenden erläutert und weisen auf die Notwendigkeit hin, das Gesundheitssystem zu stärken anstatt den Fokus auf programmatische Interventionen zu legen.\n\nIndonesien hat Fortschritte bei der Anzahl der Geburten mit einem qualifizierten Gesundheitspersonal erzielt, wobei 72% der Geburten dieses Ziel nun erfüllen. Das bedeutet jedoch nicht, dass alle Geburtshelfer qualifizierte medizinische Fachkräfte sind.  Zu dieser Kategorie zählen auch traditionelle Helfer wie Hebammen, die bei Komplikationen während der Schwangerschaft keine medizinischen Eingriffe durchführen können (daher der hohe Prozentsatz der durch Blutungen verursachten Todesfälle bei Schwangeren). Mit anderen Worten, die erzielten Verbesserungen bei diesem speziellen Indikator sind irreführend und es gibt noch viel zu tun. Darüber hinaus ist der Anteil der durch ein Gesundheitspersonal behandelten Durchfallfälle bei Kindern unter fünf Jahren zurückgegangen. Obwohl die Daten zur postnatalen Versorgung unvollständig sind, ist klar, dass auch dieser Bereich besorgniserregend ist, da die Raten landesweit niedrig sind.\n\nDie Kaiserschnittquoten liegen immer noch niedriger als erwartet, bei etwa 4%. Die Kaiserschnittquoten verdeutlichen außerdem ein weiteres Problem. Während die Rate von Kaiserschnitten in städtischen Gebieten bei 7% liegt, liegt sie in ländlichen Gebieten bei nur 2%. Dies zeigt das Problem der gleichmäßigen Versorgung im ganzen Land. Es ist klar, dass der Zugang zu medizinischen Versorgungssystemen in städtischen Gebieten konzentriert ist. Ein weiteres Problem im Zusammenhang mit dem Zugang betrifft die vertikale Gerechtigkeit. Es besteht eine 27-prozentige Lücke in der Nutzung von Dienstleistungen zwischen den ärmsten und reichsten Quintilen. Es ist klar, dass die Armen es schwieriger haben, Zugang zu medizinischen Versorgungssystemen zu erhalten, wahrscheinlich aufgrund der hohen Selbstzahlerkosten.\n\nBei der Diskussion über die nächsten Schritte zur Verbesserung der Indikatoren für die neonatale und maternale Versorgung stellt sich die grundlegendste Frage, wie man den Mangel an Dienstleistungen am effektivsten angehen kann. Konkret: Sollte Indonesien spezifische Programme entwickeln oder das gesamte Gesundheitssystem stärken, ohne sich auf die vor- und postnatale Versorgung der Mutter und des Kindes zu konzentrieren? Es besteht kein Zweifel daran, dass programmatische Ansätze, um die oben genannten Probleme zu lösen, attraktiv sind. Nicht nur „vertikale Ansätze“, die einen Sektor von Verbesserungen zielen, haben viel genauere, überschaubare Ziele, sie erzielen auch im Allgemeinen schnellere Ergebnisse. Es gibt jedoch einige Nachteile, die man beachten sollte. Ein großer Nachteil ist, dass eine hohe Investition in Programme für einen bestimmten Bereich des Gesundheitswesens oft bedeutet, dass die Finanzierung anderer Bereiche leidet und dass Fachkräfte zu den Bereichen strömen, in denen mehr Ressourcen vorhanden sind (das Beispiel der internationalen Finanzierung von HIV/AIDS und ihre Auswirkungen auf den Sektor der Familienplanung ist ein Beispiel dafür). Darüber hinaus führt die Durchführung mehrerer paralleler Programme für einen Bereich zu einer Verdopplung der Dienstleistungen, die zwischen den Programmen auch nicht koordiniert sind. Dies führt zu einem Anstieg von Formularen und Papierkram für Lieferungen und Finanzierung.\n\n## English Translation:\n\n[REWRITE]\nThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia has remained relatively stable over the last ten years.

This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country. Clearly, access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas. Another issue of access concerns vertical equity. There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles. Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\n\nIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service. Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child? There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive. Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results. There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however. One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example). In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs. This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding.",

    "raw_output": "Victorian Novels sind durch ihr überwältigendes Augenmerk auf Details und ihren Fokus auf die Aristokratie der Zeit gekennzeichnet. Zwei Romane, die als viktorianisch gelten, aber von dieser Tradition abweichen, sind Oliver Twist und Wuthering Heights. Beide Romane verwenden ein Element des Geheimnisvollen und eine Vorliebe für das Bizarre, was für die Romane aus dieser Zeit atypisch ist, und stärkt die Charaktere in jedem Werk; es bietet Einblicke, die ihre Motive und Emotionen erweitern.\n\n„Und jetzt strömten ihm Gastgeber von verwirrenden und verwirrenden Ideen auf den Verstand. Er schien immer noch zwischen Sikes und Crackit zu gehen, die wütend stritten: denn die Worte, die sie sagten, hallten in seinen Ohren wider; und als er seine eigene Aufmerksamkeit ergriff, ... fand er, dass er mit ihnen sprach.... Plötzlich sprang er zurück vor dem Knall der Schusswaffen zurück; und es erhoben sich laute Rufe und Geschrei in die Luft; Lichter funkelten vor seinen Augen, und alles war Lärm und Tumult, als eine unsichtbare Hand ihn hastig wegtrug. Durch all diese schnellen Visionen floss ein undefiniertes, unruhiges Bewusstsein von Schmerz, das ihn unaufhörlich quälte.“\n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\nDie beiden Romane nutzen dieses Geheimnis oft durch Traumsequenzen oder traumähnliche Zustände, obwohl Inhalt und Funktion in jedem spezifischen Fall variieren. Bei Oliver Twist offenbaren diese seltsamen Ereignisse oft Einblicke in Olivers inneren Schichten, was ihn quält, und sein Bewusstsein für die wahre Natur der um ihn herum geschehenen Dinge. Wenn die Schießerei von Oliver endlich im Kapitel 28 revisited wird, erlebt Oliver die Schießerei lebendig wieder, als wäre er im Traum, während er darum kämpft, Hilfe zu finden (siehe links). Der Abschnitt betont den Mangel an Kontrolle, den Oliver über die sich entfaltenden Ereignisse hatte, sowie die prekären Zustände, in denen sich seine Gesundheit befand, was stark durch Olivers Halluzinationen von Sikes und Crackit zum Ausdruck kam. Die Schießerei selbst überwältigt ihn, alle seine Sinne werden stumpf, da er die „unsichtbare Hand“ nicht bemerkt, die ihn wegträgt; er erlebt seine Verzweiflung wieder, entfernt vom Schock des Schmerzes, da der Schmerz jetzt ständig ist und mit Angst, anstatt mit Überraschung, verbunden ist. Da Oliver überwältigt ist, stellt sich die Frage, wessen Wille seinen Unglück gebracht hat, denn es war sicherlich nicht sein eigener. Diese Schießerei verstärkt die Vorstellung, dass Oliver wenig Kontrolle über irgendetwas hat, denn er kann sich nicht einmal dazu bringen, versuchen, das Ergebnis eines Ereignisses zu kontrollieren, selbst wenn sein Leben in Gefahr ist. Ein wachsendes Gefühl der Niederlage bei Oliver wird auch durch diesen Ausschnitt angedeutet, als wäre alter Fagin damit begonnen hat, ihn zu brechen, ihn dazu zu zwingen, diese Verzweiflung anzunehmen und seine Fähigkeit zu beeinflussen, zu reagieren. Denn andernfalls kann man annehmen, dass Oliver zumindest aus eigenem Interesse zumindest einen Versuch unternommen hätte.\n\n\n„Der Tag verging – Tag! Es gab keinen Tag; er war sogleich wieder verschwunden – und die Nacht kam wieder; eine Nacht, so lang und doch so kurz; lang in ihrer schrecklichen Stille und kurz in ihren flüchtigen Stunden.\n\n\n\n[REWRITE]\n\nVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.

Ich habe mein Bestes getan, um ihnen bei allen Fächern zu helfen, in denen sie Schwierigkeiten hatten, aber meine Stärken lagen in Englisch und Lesen. Eine der Lehrerinnen fragte mich, ob ich einem kleinen Jungen namens Adrian helfen könnte (ich glaube, er war in der dritten oder vierten Klasse), der zahlreiche Probleme beim Lesen hatte. Mir wurde klar, dass etwas nicht stimmte; er hatte die ungewöhnlichsten Probleme. Einige Buchstaben konnte er perfekt aussprechen, andere überhaupt nicht, es war das Seltsamste. \n\nMan muss wissen, er war lateinamerikanischer Abstammung, das war mir sicher, aber der Junge sprach perfekt Englisch. Wir hatten Probleme, bis zum Tag, an dem ich seine Mutter traf. Ich betreute einige Kinder, während der Rest der Nachmittagsgruppe auf einem Schulausflug war, als seine Mutter hereinkam. Seine Mutter sprach kein Wort Englisch, nur Spanisch. Mit meinen sehr schlechten Spanischkenntnissen (ich lernte gerade erst) konnten wir uns verständigen. Aber in diesem Moment wurde mir klar wie ein Schlag: Adrian konnte lesen, er kannte nur das englische Alphabet nicht so gut. Ich weiß nicht, ob diese Erkenntnis ihm wirklich viel half, aber ich hoffe, dass es ihm heute besser geht.\n\nIch erzähle diese Geschichte, um das Problem der Sprachbarriere in Schulen, insbesondere hier in Kalifornien, zu beleuchten. Ich erzähle sie auch, um zu beweisen, dass es nicht immer so offensichtlich ist, wie wir denken. Selbst für ein Kind, das perfekt Englisch spricht, kann Lesen eine große Herausforderung sein. Ich denke, jeder kann sich einig sein, dass dieses Problem existiert, also was tun wir? In Adrians Fall war die Lösung relativ einfach: Nachhilfe im englischen Lesen, insbesondere im Alphabet und in der Aussprache. Aber für viele Kinder, die kaum Englisch sprechen, ist die Lösung viel komplexer. Es gibt keine einfache Antwort. Das bilinguale System, die Immersion in den Mainstream, Privatlehrer, Englischkurse, nichts von diesen Dingen allein wird dieses Problem lösen. Der Schlüssel liegt in der Kombination all dieser Dinge!\n\nZunächst einmal ist das bilinguale System eine großartige Idee. Nicht nur für Kinder, deren Muttersprache Spanisch ist, sondern für alle Kinder. \"Kinder in zweisprachigen Bildungsprogrammen haben herausragende akademische Leistungen im Vergleich zu ihren Altersgenossen erzielt\". Viele Ängste ranken sich um diese Idee, dass es eine Verschwendung von Ressourcen ist und dass die Mehrheit der Kinder in den Schulen keinen Nutzen davon ziehen wird. Aber das ist falsch. Wenn wir diese Art von Programmen in den Klassenzimmern als Regel, anstatt als Ausnahme einführen würden, würden alle Kinder davon profitieren. Aber wie gehen wir vor? Sollten wir alle Lehrer zweisprachig machen? Nein, das wäre unvernünftig und etwas unrealistisch. Ich denke jedoch, dass es keinen Grund gibt, warum wir keine speziellen Assistenten, Tutoren, wie man sie auch nennen möchte, mit zweisprachiger Kompetenz haben könnten.\n\n## Rewritten English Text:\n\n[REWRITE]A couple years ago, I worked in an after school program tutoring elementary students.

    "transformed": "From the time we are children, most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend. Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers. Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents. However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality. We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was. We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch. He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering. He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too. He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact. I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us. I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\nMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers. If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\nI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one. So I had not.

The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies.

Der Begriff Supply Chain Management wurde 1982 von Keith Oliver, einem Berater, erfunden. Keith Oliver beschrieb den Gesamtprozess der Planung, Implementierung und Kontrolle dessen, was in der Lieferkette geschieht, um die Kundenbedürfnisse schnell und effizient zu erfüllen. Es gibt sechs Schlüsselbestandteile einer Lieferkette: Produktion, Versorgung, Lagerhaltung, Standort, Transport und Information. Manager von Unternehmen nutzen diese sechs Schlüsselbestandteile, um den Kunden den bestmöglichen Service zu bieten. \n\nDie Produktion ist der erste Schritt im Lieferkettenprozess. Die Produktion bildet die Grundlage für den gesamten Lieferkettenprozess. Die Produktionsphase definiert, wann, warum, wo und wie alles produziert wird. Manager müssen wissen, was die Kunden wollen. Damit Manager wissen, was die Kunden wollen, können sie den Markt betrachten. Der Markt ist der größte Indikator, um die Kundennachfrage zu bestimmen. Sobald die Manager den Markt analysiert haben und die Kundennachfrage verstehen, sind sie bereit, zu entscheiden, welche Produkte produziert werden sollen und wie viele davon. Nachdem das Management entschieden hat, was produziert und in welcher Menge, sind sie bereit, zu entscheiden, wo die Produkte produziert werden sollen und welches Werk am besten für die Volumen- und Qualitätsstandards geeignet ist, wobei die Kundenzufriedenheit berücksichtigt werden muss. \n\nNachdem der Produktionsort für die Produkte festgelegt wurde, konzentriert sich das nächste Schritt der Manager auf die Planung der Arbeitslasten und die Wartung der Geräte. Die Produktion ist ein sehr wichtiger Schritt im Lieferkettenprozess. Jedes Detail ist im gesamten Prozess von Bedeutung. Wenn nicht jedes Detail entsprechend geplant ist, kann dies dem Unternehmen langfristig viel Zeit und Geld kosten. Zum Beispiel, ich habe früher in den Einzelhandelsgeschäften von Walmart und Target gearbeitet. Beide Unternehmen haben ein Design, ein Handbuch und einen Prozess für jede Einheit des Geschäfts. Es gibt einen festgelegten Layout, wie das Erscheinungsbild der Arbeitskleidung eines Mitarbeiters aussieht, bis hin zum Empfang der Sendungen von LKWs. Die Festlegung von Prozessabläufen ermöglicht es einem Unternehmen, reibungslos zu arbeiten, ohne dass es zu Verwirrung über Richtung und Erwartungen kommt. \n\nDas zweite Schlüsselelement im Supply Chain Management ist die Versorgung. Versorgung bezeichnet die strategischen Entscheidungen, die getroffen werden sollten, um die Kernkompetenzen eines Standorts und die Partnerschaften im Bereich Outsourcing zu bestimmen. Ein Unternehmen kann viele verschiedene Produktionsabteilungen für ein einzelnes Produkt haben. Alle Divisionen bestehen aus unterschiedlichen Geräten, Arbeitskräften und Spezialisierungen. Der Manager muss entscheiden, welche Abteilung am besten für die verschiedenen Produktionsschritte des Produkts geeignet ist.  Das Management kann auch entscheiden, die Arbeit an andere Unternehmen auszulagern. Der Hauptgrund, warum ein Manager die Arbeit an andere Unternehmen auslagert, ist die Steigerung der Geschwindigkeit. Geschwindigkeit ist die Fähigkeit, Qualität und Flexibilität zu bieten, gleichzeitig aber die Kosten zu senken oder kostengünstig zu bleiben.\n\n\n\n[REWRITE] Supply chain management is the flow of processes that move goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer.

Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",

Burma, auch bekannt als Myanmar, ist ein südöstasiatisches Land, das von einer tyrannischen militanten Junta regiert wird, die 1962 durch einen Staatsstreich an die Macht kam. Im Jahr 2007 fanden eine Reihe von Straßenprotesten statt, die ersten öffentlichen Proteste seit einem Jahrzehnt. Geleitet von einer großen Anzahl burmesischer Mönche, erhielten diese Proteste den Namen „Saffron Revolution“, benannt nach der Farbe der Gewänder, die die Mönche trugen. Nachdem die ersten Aufstände stattfanden, interessierte sich die breite Öffentlichkeit für die Proteste und während die burmesische Regierung zunächst geduldet hatte, dass die Mönche friedliche Versammlungen abhalten konnten, eskalierte die Gewalt bald in einen, was einige für einen Bürgerkrieg zwischen den Mönchen und der Militärjunta hielten, mit der aktiven Invasion und Plünderung von Klöstern im ganzen Land durch die Armee. Ausländische Journalisten wurden sofort verhaftet und inhaftiert, wobei ein japanischer Fotojournalist namens Kenji Nagai am 27. September 2007 getötet wurde, einfach nur weil er an einem Straßenprotest anwesend war. Während die offizielle Todesbilanz bei 13 Toten liegt, wird Colonel Hla Win, der einige Tage vor dem offiziellen Bericht aus der Armee desertierte, zitiert: „In den letzten Tagen wurden weit mehr Menschen getötet, als Sie gehört haben. Die Leichen lassen sich in mehreren tausend zählen.“\n\nDas ist nichts Neues. Während dies einige der jüngsten Beispiele für Gräueltaten in unserer Welt sind, besteht der Wunsch einer Regierung, Widerspruch zu unterdrücken und die vollständige Kontrolle über ihre Bürger zu behalten, so lange wie die Zivilisation selbst. Frühe römische Kaiser erklärten sich für von den Göttern auserwählt, die vollständige Exekutivgewalt über alle Aspekte ihrer Gesellschaft auszuüben. Es wird angenommen, dass japanische Kaiser tatsächlich Götter sind, die von unserer Welt gesandt wurden, um ihr Volk durch die Erfindung von Motorola-Mobiltelefonen und Hara-Kiri zum Wohlstand zu führen, und unser aktueller Präsident, George W. Bush, hat wöchentliche Telefonkonferenzen mit Ted Haggard, dem Leiter von Stupid People Worldwide, einer Tochtergesellschaft der Republikanischen Partei.\n\nEinige der bekanntesten Beispiele für diese Handlungen sind Ereignisse wie der Protest am 4. Juni 1989 auf dem Tiananmen-Platz, bei dem Intellektuelle, Arbeiteraktivisten und Studenten versammelten sich, um gegen die autoritäre Herrschaft der Regierung zu protestieren. Die Todesopfer in diesem speziellen Fall variieren stark, wobei offizielle Berichte der chinesischen Regierung 200-300 Tote angeben, während Berichte des chinesischen Roten Kreuzes zwischen 2.000 und 3.000 Toten melden. Ein weiteres Beispiel ist der Völkermord in Ruanda in den 1990er Jahren, bei dem huthische Milizen, unterstützt von der ruandischen Regierung, mit einem systematischen Vorgehen alle Tutsi sowie politische Moderate, unabhängig von ihren ethnischen Hintergründen, ermordeten. Hitlers „Drittes Reich“, eine Periode, die mehrere Jahre und mehrere Länder umfasste, in der alle Personen jüdischer Herkunft zusammengetrieben und ermordet wurden, ist ein weiteres extremes Beispiel.\n\n\n\n[REWRITE] Hitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign.

Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through a coup d'état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, named after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest.

    "raw_output": "## German Translation:\n\nDuke Ellingsons Erbe im Jazz stammt zum großen Teil aus seiner langen Karriere und seiner damit verbundenen Fähigkeit, sein Orchester zu formen. Ellingsons Präsenz am Klavier ist in vielen der für diese Aufgabe ausgewählten Kompositionen subtil, aber als Komponist übertraf er sich darin, reichhaltige und komplexe Stücke zu kreieren, die die individuellen Fähigkeiten der Bandmitglieder in den Vordergrund rücken. Ellington schuf den Rahmen, in dem ein Solist frei improvisieren konnte, zusätzlich zu eng orchestrierten Stücken und Phrasen, die auf den jeweiligen Stil der Bandmitglieder zurückgriffen, um musikalische Ideen hervorzuheben. Dabei betonte er auch den Ton des Orchesters im Allgemeinen und schuf kohärente und originelle Klänge, die zu jedem Stück passten. Ellingsons Meisterschaft im Umgang mit dem individuellen Klang der Spieler sowie ihrer Einbindung in ein wachsendes Ensemble ermöglichte es ihm, einige der innovativsten und brillantesten Stücke der Jazzgeschichte zu schreiben.\n\nDas Grove Music Dictionary erwähnt in seiner Betrachtung von Ellingsons Klang und Innovation \"Creole Love Call\" und bezieht sich dabei auf die Verwendung der Stimme \"als Jazz-Instrument\" während seiner gesamten Karriere.  Dies ist ein frühes Beispiel für Ellingsons Einsatz der Stimme, um Textur und Farbe hinzuzufügen, ohne durch Texte eingeschränkt zu werden. \"Creole Love Call\" zeigt auch Ellingsons Fähigkeit, den Stil seiner Solisten zu ergänzen, was sich in seiner gesamten Karriere zeigt. Dieses langsame, bewusste zwölftaktige Blues-Stück enthält sechs Strophen:\n\nStrophe 1: Call-and-Response zwischen Stimme und Holzbläsern, wobei die Stimme zunächst glatt und melodisch beginnt und gegen Ende zu einem rauheren Klang übergeht.\nStrophe 2: Gedämpfter Trompetensolo, der die Grundmelodie ausbaut und mehrere verlängerte Bluesnoten betont.\nStrophe 3: Schwepfendes Klarinettensolo in hoher Lage, begleitet von einer subtilen, synkopierten Klavierphrase.\nStrophe 4: Das gesamte Orchester wiederholt die erste Strophe mit einem Call-and-Response der Blech- und Holzbläsersätze.\nStrophe 5: Die klimatische Strophe des Stücks, da die Holzbläser nun den Call-and-Response in hoher Lage beginnen, begleitet von synkopierter Stop-Time der Blech- und Rhythmussektionen.\nStrophe 6: Rückkehr zur Struktur der ersten Strophe mit Call-and-Response zwischen Stimme und Holzbläsern. In dieser Strophe nimmt die Stimme den Klang der \"Growl\"-Technik an und spielt als Instrument solo.\nTag: Kurzes Tag mit einem Gesangspassagenlauf und einem dissonanten, neuen Ende durch ein Trombon.\n\nEllingsons Verwendung der Stimme, um dieser Komposition eine Dimension des Tonschatz hinzuzufügen, ist ein Beispiel für ein stilistisches Merkmal, das sich durch seine Arbeit zieht. \nIn \"Hot and Bothered\", aufgenommen ein Jahr später, kombiniert Ellington seinen Geschick bei der engen Orchesterarbeit mit seinem Gespür für den Tonschatz. Ein Call-and-Response-Phrase zwischen \"Bubber\" Miley am gedämpften Flügelhorn und Baby Cox's Scat-Gesang nutzt die stimmlichen Elemente von Mileys Spiel und die instrumentalen Aspekte von Cox's Stimme, um einen reichen und ergänzenden Klang zu erzeugen. \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\" erweitert diese Ideen, da Ellington Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, einen Stammgast in Ellingsons Orchester, effektiv einsetzt, um die Melodie am gedämpften Trombon einzuführen.\n\n[REWRITE] Duke Ellington's legacy in jazz stems largely from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra.

Oft fragte sie sich mit dieser seltsamen Vorstellung und versuchte zu überlegen, was diese seltsame Sache mit einem jungen Mädchen auslösen könnte.

Sie stritten nie miteinander und seltsamerweise waren Streitigkeiten mit ihrer Tochter sehr selten.

Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified.

Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found.

    "raw_output": "## German Translation:\n\nIm Jahr 2007 stürzte die Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika in eine verheerende Finanzkrise. Die Arbeitslosigkeit stieg, der Immobilienmarkt krachte zusammen und viele der größten und wichtigsten Unternehmen Amerikas wurden ruiniert. Diese Rezession hält bis heute an, daher müssen wir uns die Frage stellen: Wie kam es zu dieser Krise und wie können wir sie stoppen? Kurz gesagt, die Finanzkrise wurde durch egoistisches und naives politisches Entscheiden verursacht, das Banken und Unternehmen dazu drängte, subprime-Kredite in eine bereits unreife und unzureichende finanzielle Infrastruktur zu vergeben. Währenddessen wurden Fannie Mae (FNMA) und Freddie Mac (FHLMC) unter Druck gesetzt, diese Hypotheken in CDOs und CDSs zu unterzeichnen und zu verpacken. Als die Schuldner diese Kredite nicht zurückzahlen konnten, fehlten den Banken Kapitalreserven, und sie übertrugen dieses Chaos auf die neu verpackten Hypotheken, die sie verkauft hatten, und auf den Rest der Wirtschaft.\n\nDie Finanzkrise hatte ihre Wurzeln im Jahr 1999 der Clinton-Ära, als der Präsident auf eine zweite Amtszeit hoffte. Um seine Präsidentschaft zu verlängern, suchte er nach einer Steigerung seiner Popularität. Um dies zu erreichen, lockerte die Clinton-Administration die Kreditbestimmungen, was die Bühne für die subprime-Krise sieben Jahre später bereitete. Steven Holmes vom New York Times berichtete 1999: „Fannie Mae, der größte Vermittler von Hypotheken in den USA, befindet sich unter increasingem Druck von der Clinton-Administration, Hypothekenkredite für Menschen mit niedrigem und mittlerem Einkommen zu erweitern, und spürt Druck von Aktionären, sein außergewöhnliches Wachstum im Gewinn zu erhalten.“ Holmes sah die Konsequenzen dieser Maßnahmen später korrekt vorher: „Die staatlich subventionierte Körperschaft könnte in einer Wirtschaftskrise in Schwierigkeiten geraten und eine staatliche Rettung benötigen, ähnlich wie in der Sparkassen- und Bausparkassenkrise in den 1980er Jahren.“ Wie in der Einleitung und wie Holmes vorhergesehen, würden unglückliche Kreditvergaben sicherlich zu einem Zusammenbruch der Wirtschaft führen.\n\nViele Faktoren trugen dazu bei, die Wirtschaft in eine Talfahrt zu stürzen, darunter die neue und komplexe Struktur der Hypotheken. Variable Zinssätze, hypothekenbesicherte Wertpapiere und Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs) wurden in den Jahren vor der Krise weit verbreitet eingesetzt und trugen dazu bei, immer mehr Sektoren der Wirtschaft an den Immobilienmarkt zu knüpfen. Dies führte dazu, dass US-Haushalte und Finanzmärkte im Allgemeinen überzeichnete in den Immobilienmarkt investiert waren, was sie extrem anfällig für selbst kleine Preisschwankungen machte.\n\nIn der Tat platzte die Immobilienblase, und die Finanzinstitute, die diese hypothekenbesicherten Wertpapiere gekauft hatten, wurden getroffen. Die fünf größten US-Investmentbanken meldeten zusammen im Jahr 2007 Hypothekenkredite in Höhe von 4,1 Billionen US-Dollar, was etwa 30% des BIP der USA ausmachte. Am Ende wurden Bear Sterns und Merrill Lynch zu außergewöhnlich niedrigen Preisen verkauft, Lehman Brothers wurde zerlegt und Goldman Sachs und Morgan Stanley wurden gezwungen, zu kommerziellen Banken zu werden, die strenger Regulierung unterlagen. Fannie und Freddie hatten Schulden in Höhe von 5 Billionen US-Dollar in Form von Hypotheken und wurden im September 2008 unter staatliche Kontrolle gestellt.\n\n\n\n[REWRITE]\nIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a devastating financial crisis.

Im Film passiert die Exposition, wenn ein Charakter dem anderen eine Kern-Dump Information à la \"Das Lied des alten Seefahrers\" erzählt. In der Fiktion tut es der Autor.\n\nEin Beispiel ist hier angebracht.  Während du eine Geschichte liest, wirst du erfahren, dass die Heldin ihren Geliebten an einem bestimmten Ort und zu einer bestimmten Zeit traf, dass sie auf einen galanten Weg heirateten und dass ihr Ehemann vor ihren Augen ermordet wurde. Du würdest nicht erwarten, dass diese ganze Sequenz zwei Seiten in Anspruch nimmt, währenddessen er und sie jeweils nur zwei Zeilen Dialoge haben. Du würdest erwarten, dass der Autor etwas Zeit für die Charakterisierung des Ehemanns aufbringt, indem er durch seine Rede und seinen Auftreten deutlich macht, wie sehr er seine Frau liebt, und du würdest gleichfalls erwarten, dass die Heldin auf große und kleine Weise zeigt, wie sehr ihr Leben durch seine Präsenz verändert und bereichert wurde (insbesondere wenn die Geschichte dir später unumwunden erzählen würde, dass dies der Fall war). Eine angemessene Einführung in den Charakter des Ehemanns würde dir ermöglichen, dich emotional mit seinem Schicksal zu verbinden und dir Einblicke in die Charakterisierung der Heldin geben: was sie an ihm sah, wie tief ihre Bindung war, Hinweise auf ihre Gedanken, Überzeugungen und Träume, die sich im Spiegel seiner Augen widerspiegeln, und so weiter. Du würdest mit ihr um sein Leben trauern und dadurch stärker mit der Heldin selbst verbunden sein.\n\nKurz gesagt, du würdest erwarten, dass es mehr gibt als die einfache Knochenstruktur der Handlung: \"Sie trafen sich, sie heirateten, er starb.\"\n\nAls Autor musst du genau dieses \"Fleisch\" liefern. (*blickt auf die Metapher, seufzt, stürzt weiter*) Manchmal ist es verlockend, bestimmte Dinge zu übergehen. Vielleicht stellst du einen neuen Charakter vor und weißt, dass er früher in der Luftwaffe war, jetzt Nachtmanager an einer Tankstelle ist, zweimal verheiratet war, keine Kinder hat, am Wochenende gerne angelt und heimlich davon träumt, eines Tages die Tankstelle zu besitzen, und am Morgen Rührei mit Lachs gegessen hat.\n\n[REWRITE]\nAh, Exposition.

    "original": "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus.

    "raw_output": "Ich habe zwei Nachrichten aus Columbus, Ohio gesehen. Die erste, die „live“ war, war NBC 4 heute Morgen (13. August 2011). Die Hauptnachricht handelte von einem Mann aus Ashley, Ohio, der seine Frau erstochen hatte. Sein Name wurde genannt, Shad Hostettler, aber der Name der Frau wurde nicht genannt. Sie zeigten sein Tatfoto und er sah aus wie pure Bosheit. Sie widmeten dieser Geschichte nur etwa zwei Minuten, da sie sich noch entwickelte. Die einzigen Details, die sie lieferten, waren, dass er sie mehrmals erstochen hatte und festgenommen worden war. Ich denke, sie haben angemessen viel Zeit für diese Geschichte aufgewendet.\n\tDie zweite Geschichte handelte von einer Schussverletzung von Travis Buyers, 18, in der Früh. Er wurde in der Gegend von Sharon Woods angeschossen und schwer verletzt; zum Zeitpunkt der Nachricht gab es noch keine Festnahme oder Verdächtige. Das SWAT-Team ermittelte an dem Verbrechen. Diese Geschichte schien kurz zu sein, und ich glaube, das lag daran, dass es sich um einen „schwarzen“ Mann oder eine „schwarze“ Nachbarschaft handelte. Ich habe bemerkt (und das schon seit Jahren), dass Minderheiten übersehen werden, wenn sie Opfer eines Verbrechens sind. Wenn ein „weißer“ Kind oder Erwachsener entführt oder vermisst wird oder Opfer eines Verbrechens wird, gehen die Medien durch die Decke; aber wenn es sich um eine Minderheit handelt, ist es Glückssache, wenn es überhaupt erwähnt wird.\n\tDie nächste Geschichte handelte vom Einschussloch, das in der Med-Flight-Hubschrauber gefunden worden war. Es wurden Details darüber gegeben, wo sie vermuteten, dass der Vorfall stattgefunden hatte. Es war festgestellt worden, dass es sich um eine .22-Kaliber-Kugel aus einem Gewehr handelte, die den Hubschrauber getroffen hatte. Crime-Stoppers bieten eine Belohnung von fünftausend Dollar für Hinweise an, die zu der Festnahme des Schützen führen.\n\tDie nächste Geschichte handelte von dem Regen und dem Gewitter, das für Samstagnachmittag vorhergesagt wurde. Sie sagten, die Temperaturen würden über das Wochenende zwischen 29 und 32 Grad Celsius liegen. Die Länge war etwas kurz, aber sie wollten es als „Vorschau“ nutzen, damit Sie dranbleiben.\n\tSie berichteten auch über einen Überfall auf einen UDF an der Clime Road in Columbus. Sie sagten, es sei ein dunkelhäutiger schwarzer Mann gewesen, der den Laden überfallen hatte und einen Kapuzenpullover trug. Sie sagten, er sei etwa 1,80 Meter groß und wiege etwa 70 Kilogramm. Ich fand, dass sie ungewöhnlich viel Zeit damit verbrachten, zu betonen, dass er schwarz und wie dunkel er war.\n\tEine weitere Geschichte handelte von einem Rene Rodriguez, der ein verurteilter Drogenboss aus Texas war. Er war wegen Verschwörung zur großangelegten Verteilung von Marihuana von Texas nach Ohio verurteilt worden. Ein kurioses Detail, das ich bemerkt habe, war, dass sie statt zu sagen, er sei zu 25 Jahren Gefängnis verurteilt worden, sagten „300“ Monate. Ich bin mir nicht sicher, was der Hintergrund war, ob sie dachten, das klinge härter oder so. Sie erwähnten auch, dass er ein hispanischer Mann sei, ich glaube nicht, dass das wirklich für die Geschichte relevant war.\n\n\n[REWRITE]I watched two newscasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was a dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds.

    "raw_output": "## German Translation:\n\nDas menschliche Gehirn ist ein kompliziertes, kreatives System zur Informationsverarbeitung. Mit dem technologischen Fortschritt von primitiv zu modern entwickelten sich auch die Metaphern, die verwendet werden, um das Gehirn zu beschreiben. Anfangs wurde es mit einer Wachstafel verglichen, dann mit einem Papyrusblatt, dann mit einem Buch und zuletzt mit einem Computer. Während Sie mehr über das Gehirn lernen, denken Sie daran, dass die Nützlichkeit dieser Metaphern begrenzt ist und zu falschen Schlussfolgerungen führen kann.\nDie Informationsverarbeitung beginnt mit Eingaben von Sinnesorganen, die physikalische Reize wie Berührung, Wärme, Schallwellen oder Lichtphotone in elektrochemische Signale umwandeln. Die sensorischen Informationen werden von den Algorithmen des Gehirns sowohl nach oben als auch nach unten verarbeitet. Zum Beispiel, wenn Sie ein Bild eines schwarzen Kasten auf einem weißen Hintergrund betrachten, setzt die Verarbeitung von unten nach oben sehr einfache Informationen wie Farbe, Orientierung und die Grenzen des Objekts zusammen – wo sich die Farbe über einen kurzen Abstand deutlich ändert – um zu entscheiden, dass Sie einen Kasten sehen. Die Verarbeitung von oben nach unten nutzt die Entscheidungen, die in einigen Schritten der Verarbeitung von unten nach oben getroffen wurden, um Ihre Erkennung des Kastens zu beschleunigen. Die Verarbeitung von oben nach unten in diesem Beispiel könnte Ihnen helfen, das Objekt als schwarzen Kasten zu identifizieren, anstatt als kastenförmige Lücke auf dem weißen Hintergrund.\nSobald Informationen zu einem gewissen Grad verarbeitet wurden, entscheidet ein Filter der Aufmerksamkeit, wie wichtig das Signal ist und welchen kognitiven Prozessen es zur Verfügung gestellt werden soll. Zum Beispiel verarbeitet Ihr Gehirn zwar jedes einzelne Grashalm, wenn Sie auf Ihre Schuhe schauen, aber ein gesundes Aufmerksamkeitssystem verhindert, dass Sie sie einzeln wahrnehmen. Im Gegensatz dazu könnten Sie Ihren Namen heraushören, selbst wenn er in einem lauten Raum gesprochen wird. Es gibt viele Verarbeitungsschritte, und die Ergebnisse der Verarbeitung werden wiederholt durch die Aufmerksamkeit moduliert.\nDamit das Gehirn Informationen verarbeiten kann, müssen diese zuerst gespeichert werden. Es gibt verschiedene Arten von Gedächtnis, darunter sensorisches, Arbeitsgedächtnis und Langzeitgedächtnis. Zuerst wird Information kodiert. Es gibt Arten der Kodierung, die spezifisch für jede Art von Sinnesreizen sind. Zum Beispiel kann sprachliche Eingabe strukturell kodiert werden, was sich auf das Aussehen des gedruckten Wortes bezieht, phonetisch, was sich auf den Klang des Wortes bezieht, oder semantisch, was sich auf die Bedeutung des Wortes bezieht. Sobald Informationen gespeichert sind, müssen sie aufbewahrt werden. Einige Tierstudien legen nahe, dass das Arbeitsgedächtnis, das Informationen für etwa 20 Sekunden speichert, durch ein elektrisches Signal, das für einen kurzen Zeitraum durch eine bestimmte Reihe von Neuronen läuft, aufrechterhalten wird. Es wird angenommen, dass Informationen im Langzeitgedächtnis in der Struktur bestimmter Proteintypen gespeichert werden.\nEs gibt zahlreiche Modelle darüber, wie das Wissen im Gehirn organisiert ist, einige basieren auf der Art und Weise, wie menschliche Probanden Erinnerungen abrufen, andere auf Informatik und wieder andere auf Neurophysiologie. Das semantische Netzwerkmodell besagt, dass es Knoten gibt, die Konzepte repräsentieren, und dass die Knoten aufgrund ihrer Beziehung zueinander miteinander verbunden sind. Zum Beispiel könnte in einem semantischen Netzwerk \"Stuhl\" mit \"Tisch\" verknüpft sein, das wiederum mit \"Holz\" verknüpft sein kann, und so weiter.\n\n\n[REWRITE]\nThe human brain is a complex, creative information processing system.

    "original": "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.

    "raw_output": "Aldous Huxley kritisiert in seinem Roman \"Brave New World\" die bevorstehende Bedrohung sowohl durch Technologie als auch durch die kapitalistische Struktur, die sie durch die Schaffung einer Dystopie verstärkt. Seine Bewohner schätzen Gemeinschaft über das Individuum und werden von Anfang an daraufhin konditioniert, oberstes Gebot ist das unmittelbare Glück. Die Bürger entpuppen sich als Bauern im großen Spiel, eingesperrt in einer einzigen Ideologie, wie vom Weltkontrolleur diktiert. Durch Betrachtung des Werkes unter den Gesichtspunkten des marxistischen Theismus fällt dem Leser der zugrunde liegende Misstrauen des Autors gegenüber der Entwicklung der genannten Systeme auf. Häufige Terminologie aus dem Marxismus, wie Homogenität und Reifikation, unterstreichen die Idee, dass Huxleys Roman ein Kommentar zu den Fehlern der sich entwickelnden Wirtschaft seiner Zeit ist.\n\nDer Kapitalismus wird durch die Verwendung der marxistischen These des falschen Bewusstseins satirisiert. Im Wesentlichen wird der gewöhnliche Bürger daran gehindert, die wahren Beziehungen zu anderen Klassen in wirtschaftlicher Hinsicht zu kennen, da er hauptsächlich an seinem eigenen Gewinn interessiert ist. Es wird als Ergebnis der ideologischen Kontrolle des Proletariats und der einfachen Arbeiter betrachtet, was durch die Konditionierung der Menschen in \"Brave New World\" deutlich wird. Die unteren Klassen, Delta, Gamma usw., haben keinen wahren Willen; durch Hypnopädie wird der Drang zu Konsum, Ausgaben und Genuss über alles andere gestärkt. Dies wird, wie bereits erwähnt, vom Weltkontrolleur manipuliert. Hegemonie, also die Idee, dass Gruppen sozialer Klassen von einer separaten Gruppe von Individuen vollständig dominiert werden, wird in diesem Fall offensichtlich eingesetzt. Die unteren Klassen sind völlig uninformiert über die Manipulation und \"kaufen\" buchstäblich in eine Ideologie ein, die diese Struktur unterstützt (d. h. Kapitalismus und Konsumismus). Die oberen Klassen werden mit der Fähigkeit geboren, es wahrzunehmen, tun aber nichts; nur wenige Alphas oder Betas, abgesehen von Charakteren wie Bernard, tun im Wesentlichen nicht viel mehr als ihren Platz zu akzeptieren. Tatsächlich sind die Interaktionen der sozialen Klassen, wie sie im weiteren Verlauf besprochen werden, signifikante Hinweise auf die wahrgenommene Unterdrückung des Kapitalismus.\n\nBeziehungen zwischen verschiedenen Individuen existieren in \"Brave New World\" nicht. Der Roman scheint die Charaktere nicht zu unterscheiden - sie sind selbst unter den Hauptfiguren mangelhaft. Vielleicht schlägt Huxley vor, dass der Aufstieg von Technologie und Kapitalismus zusammen den Menschen ihren freien Willen und ihre Ausdruckskraft rauben. Liebe existiert nicht, ebenso wenig wie die Extreme einer jeden Emotion; stattdessen bleiben die Interaktionen oberflächlich, deutlich durch die Bemerkungen der Männer über Frauen, die sich hauptsächlich auf ihr ästhetisches Erscheinungsbild konzentrieren (z. B. pneumatische Qualität), und die unverhohlene Kommentare der Frauen über ihre Begegnungen dargestellt. Darüber hinaus zeigt die Gleichgültigkeit jeder sozialen Klasse gegenüber ihrem Status in der Hierarchie die sozioökonomischen Auswirkungen des Kapitalismus. Ihre absolute Gehorsam gegenüber ihrer Rolle in der Gemeinschaft ist ein Hinweis auf den marxistischen Gedanken über das Proletariat, das falsch davon überzeugt wird, seiner eigenen Überlegenheit gegenüber allem anderen zu entsprechen, solange es konsumiert, gehorcht und im Einklang mit seinen Peers bleibt. \n\n[REWRITE]\nAldous Huxley criticizes the impending threat of both technology and the capitalist structure that reinforces it through the creation of a dystopia in the novel \"Brave New World.\" Its people value community above the individual and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work through the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the author's underlying suspicions regarding the development of the aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeneity and reification, among others, reinforces the idea that Huxley's novel is a commentary on the flaws in the emerging economy from his time.\n\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in \"Brave New World.\" The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else. This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller. Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally '[buying] into an ideology that supports that structure' (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place. In fact, the interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\n\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in \"Brave New World.\" The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even among major characters, lacking depth.

    "raw_output": "## German Translation:\n\nIch bin jetzt seit etwa zweieinhalb Jahren, oder vierhälb Semestern, Student hier am University Park. Für viele, einschließlich mir, kann die Fortbewegung auf dem Campus ein Problem sein. Im ersten Studienjahr wurde ich in einem Studentenwohnheim in den East Halls untergebracht; ziemlich genau an der östlichsten Grenze des Campus, wenn man den Stadion und das Bryce Jordan Center nicht mitzählt. Die Anreise von meinem Zuhause im Stuart Hall zu Vorlesungen an weit entfernten Orten wie dem Willard Building, nahe dem Zentrum des Campus, konnte bis zu 25 Minuten zu Fuß dauern, besonders wenn das Wetter schlecht war, was in State College oft der Fall ist. In einem Gespräch mit einem Alumni, der nicht viel älter als ich ist, erfuhr ich, dass die East Halls-Studentenwohnheime vor langer Zeit durch riesige, brachliegende Landstriche vom Rest der Schule getrennt waren. Heute ist dieser leere Raum mit Sportplätzen, riesigen Neubauten, einschließlich der neuen Creamery und des neuen Gesundheitszentrumgebäudes, bebaut und von Wohnungen umgeben. Da sich unser Campus weiter ausdehnt, wird es immer schwieriger, von einem Ort zum anderen zu gelangen. Was ist die beste Lösung für das Mobilitätsproblem? Auf einem College-Campus ist es das Fahrrad. Aber allein das Fahrrad löst keine Probleme. Studenten müssen sie benutzen, und der Campus muss an die Bedürfnisse der Radfahrer angepasst werden.\n\nIch sprach mit einem Freund, der kürzlich nach einer mehrmonatigen Pause wieder mit dem Radfahren begonnen hat. Er erwähnte, dass er sich fragte, warum er je aufgehört hatte. \"Fahrräder sind großartig\", sagte er, \"einige Jahre lang war es nicht cool, mit dem Fahrrad zu fahren, aber es ist der einzige Weg, um sich fortzubewegen.\" Neben der Vorteile für die Gesundheit ist Radfahren der effizienteste Weg, um sich fortzubewegen. Eine Schüssel Haferflocken und ein wenig körperliche Betätigung bringen Sie 30 Meilen oder mehr weit. Wie viele Studenten lebe ich jetzt außerhalb des Campus; genauso weit vom Zentrum des Campus entfernt wie einige Studentenwohnheime. Die klügste Entscheidung, die ich dieses Jahr getroffen habe, war es, mir ein Fahrrad zu kaufen. Jeden Tag habe ich Unterricht im Thomas Building, der leicht eine 25-minütige Gehdistanz von meinem Zuhause entfernt ist. Mit dem Fahrrad kann ich die Zeit auf 5 Minuten reduzieren, wenn ich schnell genug fahre. Das einzige Problem ist, dass die Pollock Road der geradeste Weg zum Thomas Building von meinem Haus ist und es nicht immer ein einfacher Weg ist, Fahrrad oder ohne Fahrrad zu fahren. Es gibt auch Gründe, zu Fuß zu gehen, aber persönlich bin ich zu beschäftigt, um zu Fuß zu gehen. Wenn ich kein Fahrrad hätte, wäre Gehen meine einzige zuverlässige Option, um zum Unterricht zu gelangen. Täglich zum Thomas zu gehen würde mir jeden Tag weitere 30-40 Minuten abnehmen. Das sind mehr als zwei Stunden und eine halbe Stunde jede Woche. Dazu kommt die gesamte Zeit, die ich für Fahrten zu und von anderen Kursen, Terminen und so weiter aufwenden müsste. Das ist mehr Zeit, als ich mir leisten kann.\n\n\n\n## English Translation:\n\n[REWRITE]\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years, or four and a half semesters.
