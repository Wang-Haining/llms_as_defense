The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",

Die soziokulturellen Modelle betrachten Umweltbeziehungen und ihre Anwendung auf Rasse, Ethnizität, Demografie und sozioökonomischen Status. Die folgende Überprüfung des Schlaflosigkeit untersucht diese Modelle und erklärt jede Forschungsarbeit, die ausgewählt wurde, um sie zu beleuchten und besser zu erklären. Die Erläuterungen der Forschungsergebnisse und deren Ergebnisse werden dann kritisch hinterfragt, um ihre spezifischen Stärken und Schwächen zu erwähnen.\n\nEine Schlafstörung kann als primäre Schlafstörung, eine Schlafstörung, die mit einer anderen psychischen Störung zusammenhängt, oder eine Schlafstörung, die mit anderen Problemen zusammenhängt, charakterisiert werden. Die primären Schlafstörungen sind Dyssomnias oder Parasomnias, während Schlafstörungen, die mit einer anderen psychischen Störung zusammenhängen, mit einer Störung der Achse I oder Achse II einhergehen. Andere Kategorien von Schlafstörungen können auf medizinische Komplikationen oder den Konsum einer Substanz zurückzuführen sein. Die Dyssomnias sind: Primäre Insomnia, Primäre Hypersomnie, Narkolepsie, Atmungsbedingte Schlafstörung, zirkadiane Rhythmus Schlafstörung und Dyssomnie, die nicht anders angegeben ist (NOS). Während die Primäre Insomnia eine Komplikation im Hinblick auf ausreichend Schlaf oder dessen Aufrechterhaltung ist, liegt bei der Primären Hypersomnie die Schwierigkeit darin, wach zu bleiben, und zwar über einen Zeitraum von mindestens einem Monat. Narkolepsie beinhaltet Kataplexie und/oder automatisches REM-Schlaf. Während sich Dyssomnias auf die Initiation und Aufrechterhaltung des Schlafs konzentrieren, sind Parasomnias Schlafstörungen, die mit Verhaltensabweichungen und/oder physiologischen Ereignissen verbunden sind. Zu den Parasomnias gehören Nightmare Disorder, Schlafterrorstörung, Schlafwandeln und Parasomnias, die nicht anders angegeben sind. Die Schlafstörungen, die mit einer anderen psychischen Störung zusammenhängen, betreffen Schlafprobleme aufgrund von Achse I (klinische Störungen) oder Achse II (Persönlichkeitsstörungen oder geistige Behinderung). Die folgende Überprüfung konzentriert sich auf Schlaflosigkeit und etwas auf primäre Schlafstörungen im Allgemeinen in Bezug auf die biologischen und soziokulturellen Modelle.\n\n\t Das biologische Modell von Schlafstörungen konzentriert sich auf Gene, vererbte Faktoren und physiologisch erworbene Aspekte von Schlafstörungen. Neuronen im Hypothalamus, die Orexin enthalten, sind für die Regulierung von Schlaf und Wachsamkeit verantwortlich. Diese Studie experimentierte mit Mäusen und fand heraus, dass es phänotypische GABAB-Rezeptoren auf den Orexin-Neuronen gibt, die spezifisch für schlaf/wach-Zustände verantwortlich sind. Die Aktivierung des GABAA-Rezeptors induziert Antworten, die den Schlaf fördern. Wenn es von seinem Feuern verhindert wird, kann dies zu einer Verringerung der Angst und einem induzierten Schlaf führen. Der GABAB-Agonist (Baclofen) erhöhte die Schlafzeit (Matsuki et al., 2009). Solche Ergebnisse lassen darauf schließen, dass die Tiermodelle der Mäuse auf Studien an Menschen übertragen werden können. Dies zeigt, dass es sowohl eine genetische als auch eine Umweltbasis für den physischen GABAB-Rezeptor beim Menschen gibt. Ein Problem oder ein Fehlen dieses Rezeptors könnte die Fähigkeit beeinträchtigen, ohne Medikamente ausreichend zu schlafen. Die soziokulturelle Implikation dieser Studie ist, dass das Phänotyp könnte vererbt werden, was den Schlaf regulieren könnte, und eine Veränderung des Rezeptors würde den Schlaf eines Individuums natürlich stören.

Eng definiert bezieht sich (C)AP auf die Wahrnehmungsverarbeitung auditiver Informationen im ZNS und die neurobiologischen Aktivitäten, die dieser Verarbeitung zugrunde liegen und zu elektrophysiologischen Hörpotentialen führen\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), was bedeutet, dass es sich um eine Störung handelt, bei der das zentrale Nervensystem (d.h. der Gehirn) Dinge, die gehört werden, nicht richtig verarbeiten kann. Menschen mit CAPD hören normalerweise gut und werden daher nicht als \"hörschwach\" angesehen; vielmehr funktioniert der Bereich im Gehirn, der das Interpretieren dessen, was wir hören, trennt Worte oder unterscheidet zwischen Unterhaltung und Hintergrundgeräuschen, nicht so wie es normalerweise der Fall wäre.\n\nDie früheste Erwähnung der Störung, die zum CAPD wurde, stammt aus der Mitte der 1950er Jahre und hieß \"Auditive Impektion\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), als Forscher Kinder mit kommunikativen Störungen untersuchten. Das italienische Forschungsteam von Bocca, Calearo und Cassinari begann 1954 mit der Entwicklung von Tests für diese Kinder; 1961 führte Kimura \"Dichot-Tests ein und formulierte ein Modell zur Erklärung der Physiologie des ZNS, die hinter der dichotonen Wahrnehmung steht\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). 1977 fand eine nationale Konferenz statt, die die Forschung an Kindern mit CAPD anregte.\n\nCAPD äußert sich auf vielfältige Weise: Die betroffene Person kann möglicherweise den Schall im Raum nicht lokalisieren oder hören; möglicherweise hat sie Schwierigkeiten, zwischen zwei oder mehr \"akustischen Ereignissen\" (Schalleintritt) zu unterscheiden; möglicherweise kann sie Klangmuster nicht erkennen; möglicherweise kann sie Änderungen in der Sprache nicht unterscheiden (z. B. Sarkasmus basierend auf Stimmungsänderungen); ein Ton kann durch einen nachfolgenden Ton blockiert werden; möglicherweise kann sie keine Klanghinweise synthetisieren (d. h. sinnvoll interpretieren, auf die sie dann reagieren können); und möglicherweise kann sie die Reihenfolge der präsentierten auditorischen Informationen nicht bestimmen (Ferre).\n\nUm CAPD zu diagnostizieren, muss der Patient mit \"systematischer Beobachtung des Hörverhaltens und/oder der Leistung auf Tests der Hörfunktion\" untersucht werden, die von \"Audiologen, Sprachtherapeuten, Psychologen und anderen\" mithilfe einer Vielzahl von Maßnahmen durchgeführt werden können, die auditive Fähigkeiten bewerten (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Dazu können Fragebögen und Umfragen, Beobachtung von Hörverhalten, einschließlich der Reaktion des Patienten auf bestimmte Reize gehören. Zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt gibt es kein einzelnes Werkzeug oder Test, der mit hoher Erfolgsrate diagnostiziert wird, und es ist keine bekannte Ursache für die Störung bekannt. Viele verwendete Tests präsentieren dem Patienten mehrere, gleichzeitige auditive Reize und fordern sie dann auf, bestimmte Elemente zu unterscheiden, wie z. B. eine Reihe von Wörtern oder Zahlen.

A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\nCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more \"acoustic events\" (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\nIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with \"systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function\", which may be conducted by \"audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals.",

    "raw_output": "## German Translation:\n\nDas Stück \"Twelfth Night\" scheint zu sagen, dass zwar Verkleidung tatsächlich nützlich ist, um lange Zeit Täuschungen zu perpetrieren, aber am Ende eine Person diese neu gebildete Rolle ablehnen muss, um nicht Gefahr zu laufen, sich in diesem Prozess für immer zu verlieren. Ein großes Problem beim Beenden einer Täuschung ist jedoch, dass man sich dabei entfremdet fühlen kann. Daher muss man am Ende zwischen der eigenen Selbsterhaltung und dem Erhalt der Beziehungen zu den Menschen um einen entscheiden. Denn während einige neutral auf die Entdeckung reagieren, dass sie getrickst wurden, werden andere die Täuschung nicht so leichtfertig auf sich nehmen und werden wahrscheinlich von der ganzen Charades beleidigt sein.\n\nDas Thema der Täuschung in der Geschlechterrolle ist besonders problematisch, weil es viele Nebenthemen aufwirft, das wichtigste davon ist vielleicht: Warum? Warum fühlt sich die betroffene Person dazu gedrängt, ihre eigene Identität aufzugeben und eine Verkleidung in Form des anderen Geschlechts anzunehmen? In Violas Fall ist es offensichtlich eine Form des Selbstschutzes: „Ich werde dich zu einem Hauptmann in dieser Stadt bringen / wo meine Jungfernkleider liegen, durch deren sanfte Hilfe / ich gerettet wurde, um diesem edlen Grafen zu dienen …“ (5.1.247-249)\n\nNewly arrived in a foreign land, feels Viola it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from potential attackers. Violas Plan funktioniert, aber er entfremdet sie auch von den Frauen um sie herum und trennt sie von einem wichtigen Unterstützungssystem. Um die Sache noch schlimmer zu machen, ist sie anscheinend so überzeugend darin, als Mann aufzutreten, dass Olivia sie mit Sebastian verwechselt und sich in ihr verliebt. „Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.“ (5.1.138) Darüber hinaus muss sie auch mit unterdrückten romantischen Gefühlen zwischen ihr und Orsino zurechtkommen: „Junge, du hast mir tausendmal gesagt / dass du nie eine Frau wie mich lieben dürftest.“ (5.1. 260-261)\n\nObwohl dies eine gewisse fortschrittliche Einstellung sein mag, könnte \"Twelfth Night\" für den modernen Leser als eine Illustration dafür dienen, wie Täuschung dazu beitragen kann, unterdrückte Emotionen aufzudecken, insbesondere in den Fällen von Olivia und Orsino. Bestimmte Passagen deuten darauf hin, dass die genannten Charaktere möglicherweise ungedrückte unterbewusste Wünsche haben, die das Auftreten von Viola/Cesario sie dazu zwingen, damit umzugehen. Zum Beispiel ist Olivia auf Cesario angezogen, weil Cesario wie ein Mann erscheint, oder verbirgt Olivia wirklich heimlich Gefühle für Frauen? Man könnte argumentieren, dass dies wahrscheinlich nicht der Fall ist, weil Shakespeares Charakter Olivia eher die Menschen seiner Zeit parodierte, die andere nur nach ihrem Aussehen beurteilen.\n\nDies wird durch die Leichtigkeit, mit der Olivia ihre romantischen Gefühle von Cesario zu Sebastian wechselt und Cesario/Viola als Familie betrachtet, anstatt als Liebesinteresse, belegt: „Eine Schwester, du bist sie.“ (5.1.315)\n\n\n\n[REWRITE]\n\nThe play \"Twelfth Night\" seems to say that while disguise is indeed useful in perpetrating long periods of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process.

    "raw_output": "## German Translation:\n\nDie deutsche Kolonialherrschaft wurde von verschiedenen Beobachtern für ihre Brutalität bemerkt, insbesondere in Bezug auf den Völkermord an den Ovaherero und Nama in Deutsch-Südwestafrika. Natürlich lässt sich ein ganzes Kolonialreich wie dieses nicht durch eine so einfache Beschreibung erfassen. Das deutsche Kolonialreich war so vielfältig in seinen politischen Ansätzen und seiner Herrschaftsweise wie in seiner Geographie. Die Bildungsmöglichkeiten in den Kolonien waren ebenfalls sehr unterschiedlich. Als die Briten 1919 Deutsch-Ostafrika (Tanganjika) besetzten, fanden sie eine große Bevölkerung von gebildeten und lesfähigen Afrikanern. Die Bildungsaktivitäten der Deutschen in Kamerun und anderen Kolonien wurden auch von zeitgenössischen Autoren gelobt.\n\nDie Situation in Südwestafrika (heute Namibia) stellte einen krassen Kontrast dar. Im Gegensatz zu Ostafrika, wo die Regierung staatliche Schulen gründete und eine herausragende Rolle bei der Bildung der Eingeborenen spielte, wurde die Aufgabe der Bildung der indigenen Bevölkerung in Südwestafrika fast vollständig den Missionargesellschaften überlassen, die nur begrenzte staatliche Unterstützung erhielten. Die Regierung investierte jedoch erhebliche Ressourcen in die Bildung der Europäer in der Kolonie und richtete ein System staatlicher Schulen ein, sowie die Unterstützung und Regulierung von Missionschulen stärker förderte. Diese Bildungspolitik hatte langfristige Auswirkungen auf Südwestafrika, selbst nach dem Ende der deutschen Herrschaft. Während andere deutsche Kolonien über eine bedeutende Anzahl von lesfähigen und gebildeten Afrikanern verfügten, blieb in Südwestafrika „die überwältigende Mehrheit der Bevölkerung unberührt, ungebildet und analphabetisch“. Verschiedene soziale, politische und wirtschaftliche Faktoren führten zu den unterschiedlichen Erfahrungen in Südwestafrika. Diese Arbeit zielt darauf ab, das Thema durch die Identifizierung dieser Faktoren zu erweitern und besonderes Augenmerk auf neue Forschungsergebnisse über die Einstellungen von Siedlern und Kolonialbehörden gegenüber den einheimischen Afrikanern zu richten.\n\nEs gibt eine Fülle von Literatur, die sich mit der Bildung im deutschen Kolonialreich befasst. Die meisten dieser Quellen sind in deutscher Sprache verfasst und wurden im frühen 20. Jahrhundert, während oder kurz nach der Zeit der deutschen Kolonialherrschaft, geschrieben. Das Ziel der frühen Werke war in erster Linie die Beschreibung der Merkmale der Bildungssysteme in diesen Kolonien. Spätere Werke in englischer Sprache erweiterten den Diskurs durch vergleichende Studien der Bildung in den verschiedenen deutschen Kolonien und detailliertere Analysen bestimmter Aspekte der Bildung. Diese Studien beleuchteten signifikante Unterschiede in den Bildungssystemen der verschiedenen Kolonien. Die bedeutendste Arbeit, die sich explizit mit dem Thema dieser Arbeit befasst, ist Cohens Studie über die Bildung in Südwestafrika und Ostafrika. Cohen vergleicht die Bildungssysteme der beiden Kolonien und diskutiert die Faktoren, die die Unterschiede zwischen ihnen erklären. Laut Cohen lässt sich viele der charakteristischen Merkmale des Bildungssystems der Kolonie durch die große Siedlerbevölkerung Südwestafrikas erklären.\n\nIm Vergleich zu den anderen kolonialen Besitzungen Deutschlands hatte Südwestafrika ein gemäßigt temperiertes Klima, obwohl ein Großteil des Territoriums von aridem Wüstenland bedeckt ist. Die europäische Bevölkerung Südwestafrikas spiegelte die relativ günstigen Bedingungen wider. Bis 1913 lebten fast 15.000 Weiße in Südwestafrika, während in der Kolonie mit der nächstgrößeren Siedlerbevölkerung, Ostafrika, nur 5.336 Menschen lebten.\n\n\n[REWRITE]\n\nGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa.

    "raw_output": "Die Klassifizierung der Popmusik hat sich in den letzten 100 Jahren so stark entwickelt, dass es schwierig ist, alle Genres endgültig aufzulisten. Darüber hinaus haben die meisten, wenn nicht sogar alle Genres - Rap, Rock, Country, Jazz, Folk, nur um einige zu nennen - innerhalb ihres Bereichs mehrere Unter- und Unteruntergenres hervorgebracht. Arguabel hat sich das Untergenre Heavy Metal Rock in den letzten 40 Jahren zu einem der vielfältigsten und ausdrucksstärksten Genres aller Popmusik entwickelt. Es ist ausdrucksstark, weil es ein breites Spektrum an Emotionen zeigt, obwohl diese sich tendenziell auf die dunklere Seite des Spektrums konzentrieren. Es ist vielfältig, weil die Menschen schon bald nach Beginn des Genres erkannt haben, dass es eine echte Flexibilität bietet, und diese genutzt haben, um ihre eigenen Untergenres zu kreieren, die ihrerseits wiederum Unteruntergenres hervorbrachten, und diese Kette bis heute fortgesetzt wird.\n\nHeute haben wir einen Punkt im Heavy Metal erreicht, an dem es so viele Nischen mit Gruppen gibt, dass es schwierig ist, genau zu bestimmen, was Heavy Metal eigentlich ist. Es hat so viele Themen aus anderen Genres aufgenommen, aber wie alles andere hat es irgendwo seinen Ursprung. Um die Heavy Metal Musik zu verstehen, die heute überall existiert, muss man zuerst verstehen, was die Metal Bewegung ist und warum sie eine Bewegung und nicht nur ein Genre ist.\n\nMetal ist in vielerlei Hinsicht eine Bewegung, die durch Dunkelheit definiert wird. Metal kann als „Musik des Mehrs“ betrachtet werden - mehr Bass, mehr Volumen, mehr Gewalt, mehr Theatern. Weniger Primitivismus, mehr Künste; Leute in Metalbands wissen wirklich, wie man ihr Instrument spielt, und das kommt in der Musik durch. Metal ist auch - obwohl es vielleicht nicht überraschend kommt - eine Bewegung, die stark von Drogen beeinflusst ist.  Es gab im mittleren 70er Jahren einen Boom an psychodelikten Drogen, der dazu führte, dass die Leute verrückter wurden und verrückte, außerirdische Platten aufnahmen, die Drogen als Sündenbock für ihre Kreation nutzten. Es besitzt viele dunkle, viszerale Eigenschaften, was für die Musikszene sehr neu war, da ein großer Teil der Popmusik Eigenschaften hatte, die nicht der dunkleren Seite des emotionalen Spektrums treu waren. Auch spätere Generationen des Metals haben sich von den dunklen, viszeralen Eigenschaften inspirieren lassen, die in der Romantik so präsent waren.\n\nLieder wie die folgenden drücken die Dunkelheit aus, die so ein Grundpfeiler der Bewegung ist: (Byrne)\n\n\n\nDiese Zeilen aus \"Helter Skelter\" zeigen die dunkle Seite der Beatles. Es zeigt einen Auf- und Ab, angeblich von Drogen. Dieses Lied gilt von einigen als eines der ersten Heavy Metal Lieder. Es war eine Reaktion auf ein Rolling Stones Lied, das auch auf der schwereren, dunkleren Seite lag. Die Beatles wollten beweisen, dass sie genauso schwer wie die Stones sein konnten, also legten sie das Lied auf *The White Album* .\n\n[REWRITE]\n\nThe classification of Pop Music has grown over the past 100 years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all.

    "transformed": "The classification of Pop Music has grown over the past 100 years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters, most if not all genres—rap, rock, country, jazz, folk, just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain. Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past 40 years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions, although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre, people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre, which then was followed by sub-sub-genres, and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres, but like everything else, it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today, one must first understand what the metal movement is, and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\nMetal is, in many ways, a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a “music of more”—more bass, more volume, more violence, more theatricality. Less primitivism, more chops; people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument, and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70’s that led to people getting crazier, leading to them to make crazy, other-worldly records, using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark, visceral qualities, which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also, later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark, visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement: (Byrne)\n\n\n\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles.

Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration.

Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47).

    "raw_output": "## German Translation:\n\nEinige Jahrzehnte vor Beginn der surrealistischen Künstler, die ihre Traumwelten auf Leinwand brachten, formte der Künstler Henri Rousseau ganz bewusst seine eigenen Träume, wörtlich wie bildlich. \"Der Traum\", ein Gemälde aus dem Jahr 1910 des berühmten postimpressionistischen Künstlers, verkörpert nicht nur eine Frau, die von den Wundern des Landes, das sie in einem Traum besucht, in Ehrfurcht verfallen ist, sondern auch Rousseaus eigene persönliche Träume und Ziele als Maler. Schon seit Beginn seiner Arbeit träumte er von Anerkennung, Akzeptanz und Lob von anderen Künstlern und Kunstliebhabern und stellte fest, dass er mit einem schwierigen inneren Dilemma konfrontiert war, um dieses Streben zu verwirklichen. \"Der Traum\" ist Henri Rousseaus Werk, das seinen lebenslangen inneren Kampf am besten widerspiegelt: Entweder bestimmten Maltechniken folgen oder diese imitieren, um von der kritischen Kunstszene, die er so bewunderte, akzeptiert zu werden, oder sich kreativ unabhängig und einzigartig zu erlauben, seinen eigenen Weg zu gehen.\n\nBevor man \"Der Traum\" aus dieser Perspektive analysieren kann, muss man zunächst etwas mit Rousseaus biographischer Geschichte vertraut sein. Henri Rousseau wurde am 21. Mai 1844 in der Stadt Laval im nordwestlichen Frankreich geboren. Sein Vater war ein Zinnsmith und Hardware-Händler, der \"bürgerlichen Wohlstand genoss\" (Shattuck 47). In seiner Kindheit erhielt er keine formelle künstlerische Ausbildung; stattdessen arbeitete er bis zum Alter von vierzig Jahren für Frankreich als Gabelle, ein Angestellter der kommunalen Mautbehörde, obwohl er den falschen Spitznamen Douanier, ein Zollinspektor (Shattuck 46), erhielt. Der Tod seiner ersten Frau, Clémence, der auf den Tod von acht Säuglingen folgte, ließ Rousseau nur mit einem Kind, einer Tochter namens Julia, zurück und mit unermesslichem Schmerz (Shattuck 49). Er hoffte daher, Zuflucht in einem neuen Leben zu finden, und widmete sich der Malerei, um ihm Trost und neue Anfänge zu bieten. Im Gegensatz zu zeitgenössischen Kollegen Rousseaus, die den Bauern in der Malerei sentimentalisieren und romantisch idealisieren, ist er im Wesentlichen ein Volksmaler und teilt die Hoffnungen und Träume des durchschnittlichen Mitglieds seiner Klasse.\n\nRousseaus Besessenheit von der Akzeptanz durch die Kunstszene ist in diesem Kontext nachvollziehbar: wie bereits erwähnt, war er nicht nur in den Gepflogenheiten der formalen Malerei ungebildet und begann seine Karriere in einem viel späteren Alter, sondern produzierte Werke zur gleichen Zeit wie viele andere talentierte und bekannteren moderne Künstler. Obwohl Rousseau bereits viele Jahre arbeitete, erhielt er erst gegen die Zeit, in der Matisse sich als Künstler einen Namen machte, die richtige Anerkennung für seine Kunst. Der Autor Jan Gordon behauptet in seinem Buch \"Moderne französische Maler\", dass die beiden, obwohl sie technisch gesehen Konkurrenten in der Kunstwelt waren, nicht nur in Stil und Motiv, sondern auch in ihren Gründen für das Malen unterschiedlich waren: \"Matisse war ein Maler, der vor der Gefahr der Trivialität beim Malen bangte, während Rousseaus Wunsch war, ein so konventionelles Bild zu malen, dass er in die Artiste Français aufgenommen würde\" (92).\n\n\n[REWRITE]\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively.

    "raw_output": "## German Translation:\n\nViele große Denker haben eine enge Verbindung zwischen Ethik und Ästhetik, zwischen Wahrheit und Schönheit postuliert. Ich glaube, dass es auf fundamentaler Ebene einen Grund dafür gibt. Wie John Keats in seiner Ode an eine griechische Urne sagt: „Schönheit ist Wahrheit, Wahrheit Schönheit - das ist alles / was ihr auf Erden wisst und alles, was ihr wissen müsst.“ Ein Großteil dessen, was wir im Leben lernen, wird durch Bildung oder Erfahrung vermittelt. Wir scheinen jedoch Ethik und Ästhetik, wie Keats andeuten, ohne zu sein unterrichtet auf diese erwarteten Weise zu schätzen. Sowohl Ethik als auch Ästhetik sind ein Versuch, zu beschreiben, anstatt vorzuschreiben. Unsere Studien über Moral und Schönheit sind größtenteils Versuche, zu erklären, warum ein Kunstwerk oder ein literarisches Werk schön ist oder warum eine Handlung moralisch ist, anstatt eine Reihe von Regeln für das Beurteilen oder Schaffen guter Kunst oder moralischen Verhaltens. \n\nDarüber hinaus ist die Kritik an Kunst oder Moral nie in der Lage, die Essenz dessen, was gut ist oder was schön ist, vollständig zu erfassen. Ein Gespräch über den Wert der Mona Lisa von Leonardo da Vinci könnte zum Beispiel um Konzepte wie Vordergrund, Hintergrund, Kontrast oder kulturellen Kontext kreisen, aber am Ende beschreiben diese nicht, warum es sich um gute Kunst handelt. Wenn man jemanden fragt nach seinem Lieblingswerk der Kunst oder Literatur, hört man oft einen Satz wie „Es ist einfach etwas an ihr“, bevor eine komplexere oder kritischere Erklärung folgt. Ich glaube, dass sowohl Kunst als auch Moral niemals vollständig auf eine Beschreibung ihrer Eigenschaften reduziert werden können. Wie Flannery O'Connor sagt: „Eine Geschichte ist ein Weg, etwas zu sagen, was nicht anders gesagt werden kann ... man erzählt eine Geschichte, weil eine Aussage unzureichend wäre.“ Egal, wie vollständig wir die Eigenschaften eines literarischen Werkes beschreiben, es bleibt etwas Transzendentales übrig. \n\nIch glaube, dass Ethik diese gleiche Eigenschaft hat. Wie Wittgenstein sagt: „Es ist klar, dass Ethik nicht ausgedrückt werden kann. / Ethik ist transzendent. /“ Ich schlage vor, dass es dieses „etwas“, dieses Je ne sais quoi, ist, das die stärkste Eigenschaft von Kunst und Moral ist, und dass diese transzendente Natur von Ethik und Ästhetik einen Verbindungspunkt zwischen ihnen bildet.\n\t\nIch glaube, dass Moral und Kunst so eng miteinander verwandt sind, weil wir beide auf einer noumenalen Ebene, um einen Begriff von Kant zu verwenden, am stärksten erleben. Sie wirken uns auf einer Ebene ein, die erlebt, aber nicht vollständig erklärt werden kann. Diese Verbindung ist noch stärker, wenn es um die Kunst der Literatur geht. Wie McKean sagt: „Was Literatur von den anderen Künsten am meisten unterscheidet, was wahrhaftig einzigartig an der Kunst ist, ist ihre moralische Qualität. Es kann sein, dass moralische Normen für andere Künste, wie z. B. Musik, unangemessen sind, aber sie scheinen für Literatur so relevant zu sein wie für das Leben selbst.

The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",

Julius Caesar verwendete den Begriff „Germanus“ erstmals in seinem Kommentar zu den Gallischen Kriegen, in dem er die Galliern besiegte und mit germanischen Stämmen kämpfte, die häufig unter hinterhältigen Vorwänden den Rhein überquerten. Er nahm dieses Wort von den Galliern selbst und verwendete es, um die Distinktion zwischen denen zu ziehen, die er erobert hatte (die Galliern) und denen, die er noch nicht hatte. Während der Ursprung ungewiss ist, glauben manche, dass es sich auf einen Nachbarn in der gallischen Sprache bezog. Im ersten Kapitel seines ersten Buches über diese Kriege bemerkt Julius Caesar: „Die Germanen, die jenseits des Rheins wohnen, mit denen sie (die Galliern) ständig Krieg führen.....Sie kämpfen mit den Germanen in fast täglichen Schlachten.“ (Julius Caesar, 50-40 v. Chr.) Andere behaupten, der Begriff stamme vom Speer ab, den sie im Krieg benutzten, der als „ger“ bekannt war (O.E.D, 2010), oder vielleicht vom alten irischen Wort „garim“, was „schreien“ bedeutet, was darauf hindeutet, dass die Germanen laut oder lautstark waren. (Namen Deutschlands)\n\nDer frühe römische Historiker Tacitus beschrieb in seinem Werk „De Origine et situ Germanorum“ aus dem Jahr 98 n. Chr., das von den Ursprüngen der Germanen handelt, folgendes: „Ich würde sie (die Germanen) als ursprunglich betrachten und nicht vermischt mit anderen Völkern durch Einwanderung oder Verkehr. Denn früher kamen diejenigen, die auswandern wollten, nicht über Land, sondern auf Schiffen an.......Wer würde Asien oder Afrika für Italien oder Deutschland verlassen, mit seinen wilden Landschaften, seinen unfreundlichen Himmel, seinen düsteren Sitten und seinem Aussehen, es sei denn, es wäre seine Heimat?“ (Tacitus, 98)\n\nUnd wer würde Rom für Germanien verlassen? Bestimmt nicht die Römer, zumindest nicht noch. Sie würden ihre Eroberungen in das Land Germanien schicken, um Güter zu erwerben und gelegentlich Landkampagnen durchführen, aber am Ende kehrten sie hauptsächlich in ihr weitläufiges Reich zurück. Als die germanischen Stämme sich im ersten Jahrhundert Mitte entfalteten, lebten sie an der Grenze des Römischen Reiches und handelten ihre Waren, die sie aus dem Land holten, und ihre Fähigkeiten, indem sie in den Reihen der römischen Armee dienten (Ozment, 2005, S. 17). \n\n\n\n[REWRITE]\nGermany today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own unique blend of culture, from the shadows of the Alps in Munich all the way to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel.

Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17). \n\n\n\n[/REWRITE]",
    "transformed": "Germany today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own unique blend of culture, from the shadows of the Alps in Munich all the way to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. The same culture can be felt from Cologne on the Rhine River, through the heart of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we know it today comes from several different sources and tribes. \n\n Germania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic tribe known then as the Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gallic forces (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, where he subdued the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which frequently crossed the Rhine under dubious pretenses. He took this word from the Gauls themselves, using it to distinguish between those he had conquered (the Gauls) and those he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language.

Ohne Emotionen, still, mit einem geübten Bewusstsein, das das Objekt des Studiums untersuchte, aber sich weigerte, es einem abstrakten Verständnis zuzuordnen, analysierte mein Geist das Bild vor meinen Augen. Gedanken schlichen sich in meinen Geist und schlichen sich wieder fast so schnell heraus, wie sie erschienen waren. So sanft und so rein arbeitete mein Bewusstsein, dass es schien, als hätte ich keine wirklichen Gedanken meiner selbst, nur ein aktives und flüssiges Erlebnis dessen, was ich sah.\n\nEinst, auf Empfehlung eines Künstlers, mit dem ich gearbeitet hatte, kaufte ich ein Kunstbuch namens „The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain“. Ich wollte schon seit ich sechs Jahre alt war lernen, wie man zeichnet, und dieses Buch lehrt alles, von dem Verständnis, was ein Bleistift ist, bis hin zu den Prozessen, die das Gehirn verwendet, um Linien zu interpretieren. Eine Technik, die das Buch lehrt, besteht darin, einen quadratischen Rahmen um jedes Bild zu legen, das der Künstler studieren möchte. So verwandelt sich ein überwältigend detailliertes Bild, zum Beispiel eine Schüssel mit Obst auf einem Tisch, der sich in einem Esszimmer befindet, das mit der Küche verbunden ist, in ein leicht zu fassendes Bild: die Schüssel mit Obst, die auf einer einfachen Ebene liegt.\n\nZu diesem Zeitpunkt konnte ich beim Anblick der Schüssel vor mir den Künstlerrahmen nicht mental projizieren. Ich war so überwältigt, so beeindruckt, dass ich nur stehen und voller Staunen schauen konnte. Picasso ging durch seine blaue Phase, Monet liebte Grün, die italienischen Renaissance-Meister zeigten einen Regenbogen an Farben. Wenn ich irgenwelche Ambitionen hatte, meine Perspektive als würdig des Titels „Künstlerisch“ zu betrachten, dann waren vor mir der Beginn meines Bildes, der Start meiner Geschichte, „Work in Brown“, zu sehen.\n\nDie Fingerspitzen setzten sich auf mein gewähltes Werkzeug der Kunst, die Muskeln spannte sich an und entspannte sich, als meine Hand durch den Raum bewegte, der Wille meines Geistes in Form gebracht in dem, was das kreativste Moment meines Lebens hätte sein können. Wasser wirbelte, ruhig und glatt, kristallklar und rein. Matterstücke lösten sich von der Ganzheit und wurden in Nichts getragen. Muskeln spannte sich, zuckten und krampften etwas schneller und ängstlicher zum zweiten Mal, meine Hand schlug wieder gegen den Griff der Toilette. Das beleidigende braune Paket versagte sich zu bewegen, festgeklebt wie eine Schnecke auf dem Boden der Toilette.\n\nDie Lappen griff ich locker in der Hand, die Füße abgestützt einen Fuß auseinander, die grüne Krawatte ungemütlich um meinen Hals geknüpft, ich runzelte leicht die Stirn, während ich auf das grobe Bündel aus verarbeitetem Tier- und Pflanzenmaterial starrte, das jemand als Botschaft für die Dummköpfe hinterlassen hatte, die die Toiletten bei Rite Aid putzen. Ein paar Spülungen mehr, ein paar mehr ruhige introspective Momente für mich, dann bewegte sich meine Hand in Richtung der Wand rechts von mir, packte das Papierpapier am Ende des Toilettenpapier-Blocks und begann, sich wie einen Backhandschuh zu mumifizieren. Aufrecht stehend, dann mich im Hüftbereich beugend, tauchte meine Hand langsam in die Schüssel ein, wie eine Mutter, die in einen Ofen für den Truthahn geht…. \n\n[REWRITE]\nDownwards I stared, my mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.

Mehrere Faktoren verschmelzen zu diesem tödlichen Faktor der Statistiken für die jüngsten amerikanischen Fahrer. Die National Institutes of Health erklären, dass ein Aspekt des Problems darin liegt, dass das Teenagerhirn buchstäblich nicht auf die Gefahren des Fahrens vorbereitet ist. Auch die einfache Unerfahrenheit liegt im Herzen des Problems. Diese Unerfahrenheit verursacht nicht nur mehr tödliche Unfälle, sondern auch eine höhere Rate an Verkehrsunfällen, Überschlägen und Fahrten von der Fahrbahn.\nTeenager haben auch ein deutlich schlechteres Abschneiden, wenn sie mit ihren gleichaltrigen Freunden unterwegs sind - was jeder mit einem Hauch von Vernunft weiß, dass sie regelmäßig tun. Das Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center hat eine Studie durchgeführt, die die folgende Korrelation zeigte: zwischen dem Alter der Passagiere und der Anzahl der Verkehrsunfälle.\nKalifornien und andere Bundesstaaten haben versucht, die Sicherheit jugendlicher Fahrer zu erhöhen, indem sie zeitlich begrenzte Führerscheine erlassen, die die Stunden, die Jugendliche fahren dürfen, einschränken und das Mitfahren anderer Minderjähriger verbieten.\nAber befristete Führerscheine sind meiner Meinung nach nur Notlösungen. Das eigentliche Problem ist, dass die jüngsten Fahrer als Gruppe statistisch gesehen einfach nicht in der Lage sind, die Risiken und Verantwortlichkeiten ausreichend zu bewältigen. Der Psychologe Marvin Zuckerman glaubt, dass selbst 18 Jahre zu jung für einen regulären Führerschein sind. Laut USA Today hat Zuckerman Forschung durchgeführt, die darauf hindeutet, dass es unter den 19- bis 20-Jährigen einen allgemeinen Wunsch gibt, Risiken einzugehen, um den reinen Nervenkitzel zu erleben. Es ist daher sinnvoll, das Fahren mindestens bis zum Zeitpunkt zu verschieben, an dem der Drang nach Nervenkitzel abgeflaut ist. Wenn wir jungen Teenagern weiterhin Führerscheine ausstellen, werden wir nicht nur weiterhin tödliche Unfälle erleben, sondern die Zahl der Todesopfer wird in den nächsten Jahren wahrscheinlich erschreckende Ausmaße annehmen. Bis 2010 werden die \"Baby-Boomer\"-Kinder fahren dürfen und Millionen neuer Teenager-Fahrer werden bereit sein, auf die Straße zu gehen.\nDie Gesetzgebung zu diesem Thema wäre relativ einfach. Schulen könnten weiterhin Fahrschulkurse anbieten, um den Lernprozess für zukünftige Fahrer zu beginnen, aber niemand unter 18 Jahren darf ein motorisiertes Fahrzeug bedienen. Es kann weiterhin ein vorläufiger Schein vor dem Erteilung eines vollständigen Führerscheins ausgestellt werden, und es wären immer noch eine bestimmte Anzahl von praktischen Fahrstunden erforderlich. Die genaue Anzahl der Stunden könnte auf die Anzahl der Stunden basieren, die bereits von den meisten Bundesstaaten gefordert werden (in Kalifornien beträgt diese Zahl beispielsweise derzeit 6 Stunden Fahrpraxis hinter dem Lenkrad und 50 Stunden Übung mit einem Erwachsenen). Da die tödlichen Statistiken für Teenager-Fahrer aus einer Querschnittsuntersuchung aller Bundesstaaten stammen, wäre eine einheitliche, nationale Gesetzgebung zu diesem Thema ein angemessenes - und meiner Meinung nach effektives - Mittel zum Schutz von Jugendlichen im gesamten Land. \nDie von mir vorgeschlagene Gesetzgebung ist keineswegs neu. \n\n**[REWRITE]\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.

    "original": "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",

    "raw_output": "## German Translation:\n\nIn der Bibliothek des Kongresses durch die Sammlung früh Edison Filme zu stöbern, entschied ich mich, alle Trickfilme zu betrachten, von denen es zwischen 1895 und 1901 fünfzehn gab. Diese Filme nutzen im Allgemeinen kreatives Editieren, um Illusionen zu erzeugen. Meine Filmanalyse konzentrierte sich hauptsächlich darauf, die Poetik der meisten Trickfilme zu beschreiben und die evolutionären Ausreißermerkmale zu untersuchen, die in einigen der späteren Filme vorhanden sind.  Im Allgemeinen ist der Trickfilm um die Jahrhundertwende auf einen bestimmten Ort beschränkt, komponiert innerhalb eines vorderen Prosceniums, enthält keine Kamerabewegung, verwendet lange und mittlere Aufnahmen und hält sich an die strikte Methodik von einem Schuss gleich einem Film. Es gibt jedoch einige Filme Anfang des 20. Jahrhunderts, die diese Richtlinien durch die Einführung von Aspekten wie mehreren Schüssen in Frage stellen. \n\nEines der auffälligsten Merkmale, das die Trickfilme gemeinsam haben, ist ihre Aufnahme in einem Innenauftritt innerhalb des Rahmens eines vorderen Prosceniums. Die Kamera bewegt sich nicht von ihrer Proscenium-Position, um Figuren oder Objekte zu verfolgen. Diese Komposition war in frühen Filmen sehr verbreitet und entsprang dem Theater und, für Trickfilme, dem Varieté und Magie-Auftritten. Eine der inhärenten Einschränkungen der Verwendung der Bühne besteht darin, dass Figuren in Trickfilmen im Allgemeinen nur von Seite zu Seite bewegen und nicht auf oder von der Kamera zugehen. Nehmen Sie zum Beispiel die Handlung des Films „Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel“ (1900). Die Schauspieler treten von rechts ein und bewegen sich hin und her entlang der horizontalen Achse. Auch wenn sie aus dem Bild gehen, folgt die Kamera ihnen nicht.\n\nDer frontale Proscenium-Stil der Komposition bedeutet auch, dass Aufnahmen tendenziell lange Aufnahmen und, seltener, mittlere Aufnahmen sind. Nahaufnahmen werden in keinem der Trickfilme aus dem Edison-Katalog verwendet. Dies geht auf die Tradition des Theaters und des Varietés zurück, wo das Publikum die gesamte Aufführung zu jedem Zeitpunkt sehen konnte, eingefasst von den Grenzen der Bühne. Wie in den meisten frühen Filmen bewegen sich die Schauspieler nicht vom mittleren Bereich zur Kamera, daher treten keine Nahaufnahmen auf.\n\nIm Allgemeinen folgen die meisten frühen Trickfilme dem Muster, dass ein konzeptioneller Schuss einem Film entspricht. Dies begrenzt die Länge der meisten Trickfilme auf etwa eine Minute oder weniger, je nach Bildern pro Sekunde. Es begrenzt auch die dramatische oder narrative Verwendung der Trickfilme; die meisten konzentrieren sich auf kurze Varietéstile, wie Magie, Verschwinden und Wechselnummern mit wenig Geschichte. Beachten Sie jedoch, dass in einem Trickfilm ein konzeptioneller Schuss aus der Sicht des Betrachters nicht tatsächlich einem physischen Schuss entspricht. Ein einzelner „Schuss“ kann tatsächlich mehrere zusammengefügt sein, um den Eindruck von Apparition oder Verschwinden zu erzeugen. Sehen Sie sich „The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots“ (1895), einen der früheren Trickfilme, genau an.

It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot.

    "original": "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",

    "raw_output": "John Taylor aus Caroline war ein früher und leidenschaftlicher Befürworter des Republikanismus.  Obwohl er hauptsächlich Landwirt war,  war es dieser Beruf zusammen mit seiner kurzen politischen Karriere, der einen Mann schuf, der für seine Hingabe und Offenheit in Fragen der persönlichen Freiheit und der Regierung bekannt war. Seine Hingabe an ein Agrarsystem bildete die Grundlage für fast alle seine Meinungen über die Regierung. Es war sein Versuch, das, was er für die überlegene aller Berufe hielt, zu erhalten und zu fördern, der seine Argumente über Souveränität, Verfassungsmäßigkeit und sogar das Justizsystem färbte.\n\nJohn Taylor glaubte, dass die Vereinigten Staaten eine große Gelegenheit hatten, ein ideales System zu schaffen, weil es keine einheimische Tradition gab, die die Schöpfer der Regierung behindern konnte, was die Errichtung eines Systems der Selbstverwaltung ermöglichte. Er glaubte stark an die natürlichen Rechte des Menschen und an die Tatsache, dass diese alle voneinander abhängig sind -  was bedeutet, dass wenn einer verweigert wird, dann alle scheitern werden, und der Wert der verbleibenden verringert wird. Diese Rechte sollten daher außerhalb der Reichweite der Regierung liegen. Er behauptete, dass das, was manche als \"Naturzustand\" nannten, bedeutete, dass diejenigen mit körperlicher Stärke und bösartiger Intelligenz diejenigen profitierten, aber in einer Zivilisation dürfe das nicht der Fall sein.\n\nUm diese ideale Gesellschaft zu schaffen, glaubte Taylor, dass eine Regierung geschaffen werden müsse, die die inhärente Gut und Böse innerhalb des Menschen berücksichtigt. Taylor war sehr rigide in seinen Meinungen über eine dualistische Moral. Er behauptete: \"Da die Regierung von Menschen ausgeübt wird, müssen all ihre Tugenden und Lastern menschlich sein\" (ebd., S. 167).  Er definierte gute Prinzipien als solche, die Privatbesitz schützen, die Landwirtschaft verbessern und den Kapitalismus entmutigen, und glaubte, dass eine Regierung, die auf guten Prinzipien gegründet ist, unabhängig von ihrer Verwaltung gerecht funktionieren würde, was unvermeidlich von Habgier und Eigennutz geleitet werden würde. Eigennutz, so glaubte er, war die Motivation des Menschen in allen Dingen, aber er wurde nur dann als böse angesehen, wenn er über die Schaffung einer Gesellschaft auf der Grundlage des Gemeinwohls hinausführte, um Sub-Gesellschaften zu schaffen, die auf Kosten anderer lebten. Eine gute Regierung war notwendig, um das natürliche Böse des Menschen zu kontrollieren, und selbst dann musste sie unter sorgfältiger Beobachtung bleiben, um die Hinzufügung schlechter Prinzipien zu vermeiden.\n\nTaylor, wie viele andere entschiedene Republikaner seiner Zeit, forderte eine strenge Auslegung der Verfassung. Er wünschte sich eine extrem begrenzte Bundesregierung, die nicht mehr Rechte oder Befugnisse haben sollte, als in der Verfassung explizit festgelegt waren. Er wusste, dass eine weitreichende Bundesregierung teuer wäre und daher wahrscheinlich despotisch werden würde.  Er glaubte jedoch, dass eine einfache, literale Interpretation gefährlich sei, und dass ohne Bezugnahme auf die Absicht der Autoren diese Methode leicht korrupt werden könnte.  Darüber hinaus hielt er die Unabhängigkeitserklärung für die wahre Charta der Vereinigten Staaten, weil sie das Land expliziter als eine Gruppe von souveränen Staaten und nicht als eine Nation beschreibt.\n\n\n\n[REWRITE] In his time, John Taylor was a staunch Republican who advocated for a limited federal government. He believed the Constitution should be interpreted strictly, with the federal government only possessing powers explicitly stated within it. He argued that a strong federal government would be expensive and potentially tyrannical.  While he favored a literal interpretation of the Constitution, Taylor also believed it was important to consider the intent of the Founding Fathers. He saw the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the United States, emphasizing its portrayal of the country as a collection of sovereign states rather than a single nation. [/REWRITE]",

Ein ETF bietet Ihnen die Diversifizierung eines Indexfonds und die Vorteile des Einzelaktienbesitzes wie die Möglichkeit, Short zu verkaufen, auf Margin zu kaufen und bei jeder Transaktion so wenige wie eine Aktie zu erwerben. Obwohl diese Vorteile äußerst attraktiv sind, sind die Verwaltungsgebühren von ETFs deutlich niedriger als die der durchschnittlichen Investmentfonds.  Leider gibt es einige Nachteile, wie z. B. die Notwendigkeit, eine Provision für jeden Handel mit ETFs zu zahlen, genau wie bei einem Aktienauftrag.  Ein weiterer Vorteil von ETFs ist die große Auswahl an verfügbaren Fonds.  Obwohl diese Vorteile klar angegeben sind, ist es für den erfahrenen Finanzinvestor immer eine gute Übung, zu evaluieren, ob die angegebenen Vorteile, wie die Diversifizierung, tatsächlich bestehen und in welchem Umfang.  Für die Zwecke dieses Vorhabens werden wir den ETF IHF untersuchen und ihn mit den Top 10 Holdings, die den ETF bilden, vergleichen, um festzustellen, ob die Vorteile eines einzelnen ETF in der Nähe der Vorteile eines diversifizierten Portfolios der zehn Aktien liegen und ob es bessere Konfigurationen der gleichen Aktien gibt, die einen optimaleren Sharpe-Ratio oder eine höhere Rendite bieten würden. \n\nUm den ETF zu bewerten, wäre es recht umständlich, jedes Holding einzubeziehen, daher haben wir beschlossen, nur die Top 10 Holdings zu berücksichtigen, die 63,58 % aller Vermögenswerte des ETFs ausmachen.  Unten sehen Sie die Top 10 Holdings und den Anteil am Gesamtvermögen.\n\nUm eine Schätzung davon zu erhalten, wie gut diese zehn Aktien den ETF IHF als Ganzes repräsentieren, können wir den aktuellen %-Anteil der Vermögenswerte, normalisiert auf 100 %, verwenden, um den Beitrag jedes Aktien zum Beta und zur Rendite eines Portfolios zu berechnen, wenn das Portfolio ausschließlich aus diesen 10 Aktien in dem Verhältnis zusammengesetzt wäre, das der ETF durch seine Holdings festgelegt hat.  Die Berechnungen für Beta und Rendite sind in der folgenden Tabelle aufgeführt.\n\nAus der obigen Tabelle geht hervor, dass die Rendite eines Portfolios, das nur die Top 10 Holdings umfasst, 6,11 % höher ist als die des ETF, was einem Anstieg der Rendite von 16 % entspricht.  Es ist auch offensichtlich, dass der Beta der Top 10 Holdings um 0,12 niedriger ist als der des gesamten ETFs.  Aus den bisher erzielten Ergebnissen scheint ein Portfolio aus nur den Top 10 Holdings eine höhere Rendite mit einem niedrigeren Beta erzielen zu können.  Es besteht jedoch die Möglichkeit, dass die Mittel dieser beiden Portfolios statistisch nicht voneinander abweichen.\n\nUm zu bewerten, ob diese Portfolios statistisch unterschiedlich sind, wird die Standardabweichung jedes der Top 10 Aktien ermittelt und auf 100 % normiert, um ihre akkumulierte Standardabweichung mit der des ETF IHF zu vergleichen.\n\n\n[REWRITE]\nAn ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a security designed to track an index, a commodity, or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.

The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns. It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole. From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta. However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\nIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",

In \"Dream-Land\" verwendet Poe den Begriff \"Thulé\" in den Zeilen 6 und 56, die Mabbott auf Virgil zurückführt. Virgil verwendete den Begriff in Bezug auf eine Insel nördlich von Großbritannien, die die Griechen als Rande der bekannten Welt betrachteten. Es ist zwar sicher, dass Virgil den Begriff verwendete, aber es gibt eine aktuellere Quelle, der man einigen Kredit geben muss. Poe interessierte sich sehr für deutsche Autoren. \n\nDieser Zitat ist wichtig, weil es zeigt, wie vertraut Poe mit Goethes Werk war. Karl J. Arndt, in seinem Buch \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon\", kommentiert die Ähnlichkeit der beiden Gedichte und kommt zu dem Schluss, dass Poe Goethe imitierte. \n\nDer Oxford Companion to English Literature sagt von Goethe, dass er ein gefeierter Schriftsteller des poetischen Dramas Faust war, das in zwei Teilen veröffentlicht wurde, der erste 1808 und der zweite im Jahr Goethes Todes 1832. In den poetischen Versen des zweiten Teils von Faust liegt ein kurzes Gedicht mit dem Titel \"Der König von Thulé\". Das Gedicht handelt von einem König, dessen Frau stirbt, nachdem sie ihm den Pokal geschenkt hat. Nach dem Tod seiner Frau beginnt er stark zu trinken und weint aus Erinnerung an seine verstorbene Königin. Dann beschließt er, dass es an der Zeit ist, dass er stirbt, und gibt seinen Besitz an seine Kinder, außer dem Pokal. Dann geht er zu einer Klippe, wirft den Kelch ins Meer, schließt die Augen und stirbt. Die Haltung des Königs von Thulé und die Beschreibung des Königs in Dream-Land sind sehr ähnlich, vielleicht ein dunkler Doppelgänger von Poes Verlust und seinem Trinkproblem. \n\n\nFaust wurde auch 1842 von H P Grattan in ein romantisches Drama umgewandelt, weniger als ein Jahr vor Poes Verwendung des Begriffs Thule in \"Die Grube und das Pendel\". \n\nPoe verweist in seinen gesammelten Schriften zweimal auf Thule. Einmal bezieht sich Poe auf \"ultma Thule\" in \"Die Grube und das Pendel\", aber er verwendet diesen Satz in \"Dream-Land\" zweimal, als Buchenden des Gedichts. \"Der König von Thulé\" und \"Dream-Land\" können als Begleitstücke gelesen werden. In \"Dream-Land\" sagt der Sprecher: Dann beschreibt er die Landschaft von Thulé und wie sie dunkel und einsam ist, er wird von toten Freunden geplagt und er sieht eine schattenhafte Welt ohne Farbe. All diese Szenen würden in \"Der König von Thulé\" von Goethe gelesen werden, da er gerade seine Frau verloren hat, er ist einsam und er hat den Willen, zu regieren oder sogar zu leben, verloren. Das ganze Gedicht ist eine Beschreibung, als ob der Sprecher in Goethes Gedicht eingetreten wäre. \n\nGoethe war ein bedeutender Autor, den Poe kennen würde, wenn es schon aus Respekt für Tennyson wäre. Poe sagte folgendes, als er gefragt wurde, ob er Tennyson bewunderte. Abgesehen von der Verbindung zu Tennyson wäre Poe durch die vielen Reproduktionen, die nach der ursprünglichen Veröffentlichung stattfanden, Goethes Werk ausgesetzt gewesen. \n\n[REWRITE]\nDream-Land is one of Edgar Allan Poe's self-proclaimed better poems.

Eines der Hauptthemen der hitzigen Diskussionen in der Klasse war, ob der Islam eine feindselige Religion sei. Ich glaube, die Frage ist heute sogar relevanter als je zuvor. Wenn ich an die Ereignisse seit dem 11. September zurückdenke, habe ich persönlich beobachtet, wie die Massenmedien von einer feindseligen Sicht auf den Islam und die Extremisten zu einer extremen Form der Toleranz gegenüber dem Islam in Amerika übergegangen sind. Ich glaube nicht, dass wir 2001 jemals einen Präsidentschaftskandidaten mit dem Namen Borac Obama hätten haben können, der einen offensichtlichen muslimischen Hintergrund in seiner Familie hat.\n\nDie Biographie des Propheten finde ich faszinierend, weil die Persönlichkeit Muhammads meiner Meinung nach mit der Geschichte Muhammads im Widerspruch steht. Aus dem, was ich wusste und gelernt habe, dachte ich, dass Muhammad Konvertiten zum Islam zwang. Er eroberte Stämme und zwang sie dann, die Religion des Islam anzunehmen. Aber laut der Biographie wird Muhammad als eine Art Märtyrer dargestellt, der missverstanden wurde und sich sogar vor anderen unterwarf. Danach kamen die Menschen nacheinander und sahen die „Wahrheit“ in seiner Lehre und suchten ihn auf.\n\nEs gibt auch einige unheimliche Ähnlichkeiten zwischen den Diensten Jesu und den „Wundern“ Muhammads. Das offensichtlichste ist, wenn er Lamm und Milch nahm und sie so vervielfachte, dass es mehr als genug für vierzig Männer gab. Es ist dieser Schreibstil, der mich glauben lässt, dass die Autoren wollten, dass Muhammad als bescheidener Prophet wahrgenommen wird, der nichts beweisen musste, sondern einfach in Wahrheit und Wundern lebte. Diese Art von Falschheit ist die Schlimmste, weil sie das Wunder und das Leben Jesu Christi verharmlost. Für mich ist es so, als würden sie stehlen und versuchen, sich das Leben und die Menschlichkeit Jesu durch Muhammad anzueignen.\n\nEs gibt auch viele Geschichten in der Biographie, die den Eindruck erwecken, dass es Teil ihrer Agenda ist, einen Beweis für das „Zeugnis“ oder dafür zu liefern, wie Menschen „eigenständig“ zum Islam konvertierten. Das Problem ist aber, dass viele der Geschichten mindestens aus einer dritten Partei stammen. Das heißt, in der Geschichte illustriert der Autor, dass er von so und so hörte, der von so und so hörte usw. Ich mochte das nicht so sehr, weil zwar ihre Idee war, dass es den Beweis für die Wahrheit der Geschichten lieferte, ich aber dachte, dass es die Geschichten vermindert und sie viel verdächtig erscheinen ließ.\n\nIch denke, das, was mich an dieser Arbeit am meisten stört, ist, dass sie versuchen, Muhammad als einen frommen Mann zu erheben und ihn als bescheiden, liebenswert, weise und mild zu präsentieren. Aber die Geschichte widerspricht der Vorstellung, dass Muhammad ein mildtätiger und bescheidener Mann war, und ich kann nicht anders, als zu denken, ob die Muslime heute die wahre Geschichte hinter Muhammads Aufstieg zur Macht kennen.\n\n\n\n[REWRITE]\nAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.

    "transformed": "Almost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC. One of the main topics of heated debate in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion. I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before. Looking back on the events since 9/11, I have personally observed the mass media shift from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme form of tolerance for Islam in America. I don't think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Barack Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\nThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad. From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam. He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to adopt the Islam religion. But according to the biography, Muhammad is written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others. After which one by one people came to see the 'truth' in his teaching and sought him out.\n\nThere are also some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the 'miracles' of Muhammad. The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men. It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles. This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ. To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.\n\nThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of 'witness' or of how people 'on their own' converted to Islam.

Schauen wir uns diese Geschichte in breiten Zügen an, so erkennen wir einen Trend, bei dem sich das Christentum immer weiter von seinen Ursprüngen entfernt. Es scheint, als würde sich die heutige Welt einer immer größer werdenden Bewusstseins- und einer beispiellosen progressiven Tendenz zeigen. Während traditionelle Menschen bestehen bleiben und jeder Art von Denken, das über das hinausgeht, was ihnen beigebracht wurde, widerstehen werden, mag dieser Teil der Bevölkerung nicht ausreichend bedeutend sein, um das Ganze zu beeinflussen. Unter Christen wird in den kommenden Jahren ein historisches Bewusstsein ungemein wachsen. Ein Verlangen wird sich verbreiten, die Lehren, die im Laufe der Zeit in das Christentum aufgenommen wurden, von der eigentlichen Intention des Namensgebers der Religion zu unterscheiden. Es mag Jahrzehnte oder sogar Jahrhunderte dauern, aber das Ergebnis wird unvermeidlich sein: Es wird eine große Kehrtwende im Trend der christlichen Geschichte geben. Es wird eine Entwicklung zurück zu seiner ursprünglichen Form geben. Eine Bewegung wird an Bedeutung gewinnen, die Schicht für Schicht Dogmatik entfernt, so als ob die Uhr rückwärts laufen würde, bis nichts weiter übrig bleibt als die Vorstellung davon, was Jesus der Menschheit im Namen Gottes eingebracht hat, bevor andere Denker solche Behauptungen aufstellten. Wenn dieser Trend durch die Vereinigten Staaten und Europa weht und Massen in seinem Gefolge beeinflusst, um so zu verehren, als ob wir in der Zeit Jesu leben würden, und nur seine Ideen befolgen würden, wird die Kirche als Institution stark bleiben, um den Weg zu weisen.  Da die theologische Uhr jedoch zurückgedreht wurde, wird die extreme Vielfalt in Christendom in immer mehr Einheit der Überzeugung und Praxis zurückkehren. Zwischen Regionen, zwischen Konfessionen, zwischen allen Arten von Teilungen werden wir statt Unterschiede zunehmend Ähnlichkeiten sehen. Die menschliche Geschichte ist voller großer Kehrtwenden. Ein Beispiel dafür ist, wie Christen einst vom Römischen Reich verfolgt, ausgeschlossen und ermordet wurden. Aber später wurde dieses Imperium zu einer christlichen Institution. Unser Land ist von der afrikanisch-amerikanischen Sklaverei zur afrikanisch-amerikanischen Führung gelangt. Die große Kehrtwende, die in unserer Zukunft bevorsteht, wird sich auf der Bühne der christlichen Religion abspielen, die Geschichte auf der Suche nach der Quelle rückgängig machen und dabei die Vielfalt rückgängig machen. Es ist wichtig zu beachten, dass ein Teil dessen, was diesen Prozess möglich machen wird, eine Methode sein wird, Jesajas Worte als metaphorisches, und nicht als wörtliche Aussagen zu lesen.\n\n## Rewritten Text:\n\n[REWRITE]\nThe teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.

Sie wollen nur auf sich selbst schauen und ihr Leben so gut wie möglich machen, aber nie auf andere achten, die unter ihnen stehen. \"Die Schlachterei\" zeigt dies auf vielerlei Weise. Der offensichtlichste Bereich ist der der Besitzer und Manager der großen Fabriken. Alles, was sie wollen, ist, ihre Unternehmen und Fabriken so groß und großartig wie möglich zu machen. Sie kümmern sich nicht um irgendjemanden oder irgendetwas, was ihnen im Weg steht, oder um alles, was ihnen durch ihre Fortschritte zu Schaden kommt. Laut Upton Sinclairs Werk „Die Zeile der Gebäude stand scharf abgetrennt und schwarz gegen den Himmel; hier und da ragten die großen Schornsteine aus der Masse, mit dem Rauchfluss, der bis zum Ende der Welt strömte“ versucht Sinclair, ein Bild der großen Schäden zu zeichnen, die diese Verschmutzung verursacht. Er zeigt, dass den Besitzern keine Rücksicht auf Person oder Tier genommen wird, die dabei verletzt werden könnten. Sie kümmern sich nicht um die großen Rauchschwaden, die aus den Fabriken steigen, oder um die tierischen Exkremente und Urinabläufe aus den Tausenden von Ställen rund um Packingtown.\n\nDie Besitzer und Manager kümmerten sich auch nicht um ihre Mitarbeiter, die für ihren Reichtum arbeiteten. Sie würden alles tun, um einen zusätzlichen Dollar zu verdienen oder zu sparen: „Von oben bis unten ist der Ort einfach ein brodelndes Kesselhaus aus Eifersucht und Hass; es gibt nirgends Loyalität oder Anstand, es gibt keinen Ort, an dem ein Mensch etwas wert ist gegen einen Dollar.“ Sie zwingen ihre Mitarbeiter, schreckliche Stunden zu arbeiten, und dann kündigen sie möglicherweise ohne vorherige Ankündigung große Gruppen von Menschen auf einmal ohne Entschädigung oder Hilfe bei der Jobsuche. In der Zeit, in der \"Die Schlachterei\" spielt, gab es nicht viele, wenn überhaupt, Gesetze oder Vorschriften, die den Arbeitsschutz oder das Wohlergehen der Arbeiter schützten. Dies erlaubte es den Managern und Eigentümern, wild zu treiben und ihre Mitarbeiter dazu zu zwingen, den Fortschritt zu beschleunigen und unter schrecklichen Bedingungen zu arbeiten. Obwohl das Buch es nicht direkt sagt, wird davon ausgegangen, dass die Menschen, die in Packingtown lebten und sich selbst zu Tode arbeiteten, einfach mit den schrecklichen Bedingungen sowohl während der Arbeit in den Fabriken als auch in ihrer Umgebung zurechtkommen mussten. Es gab keine Agenturen oder Organisationen, die den Arbeitern Informationen oder Hilfe boten. Es gab Gewerkschaften, die gegründet wurden, aber diese brachten oft mehr Schaden als Nutzen, denn sie verdienten Geld mit den armen Arbeitern. Die Arbeiter wurden so schlecht behandelt und hatten keine Möglichkeit, dem System von Packingtown zu entkommen, dass sie als Sklaven beschrieben wurden: „Hier ist eine Bevölkerung, niedrig und größtenteils ausländisch, die immer am Rande des Hungers lebt und ihre Lebensmöglichkeiten von den Launen von Männern abhängig ist, die genauso brutal und unehrlich sind wie die alten Sklavenhalter; unter solchen Umständen ist Immoralität genau so unvermeidlich und weit verbreitet wie unter dem System der Sklaverei.“\n\n\n##  English Translation:\n\n[REWRITE]I believe that The Jungle shows how humans deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered.

Einige dieser Techniken sind effektiver als andere. F. Scott Fitzgerald nutzt in seinem Roman „Der große Gatsby“ viele dieser verschiedenen Techniken. Manchmal kombiniert Fitzgerald Adjektiv und Nomen, die normalerweise nicht so zusammenpassen, um den Lesern eine bestimmte Aura um ein Thema zu verleihen. Zuweilen trägt er Bedeutung einem Symbol bei und nutzt es dann für denselben Zweck. Fitzgerald setzt diese letzte Technik mit vielen Farben ein, darunter Gold, Grün, Weiß/Grau und Rot/Rosa. In seinem Roman „Der große Gatsby“ baut F. Scott Fitzgerald Bedeutung für Farben auf, insbesondere Weiß/Grau und Rot/Rosa, und nutzt sie später, um den Lesern eine bestimmte Erinnerung an ein Gefühl in Bezug auf ein wichtiges Objekt zu vermitteln.\n\nDie Bedeutung, die Fitzgerald aufbaut und für Weiß/Grau verwendet, ist Einheitlichkeit, wobei Weiß etwas angenehmer und höherwertig ist und Grau älter und verblasster. Fitzgerald legt diesen Sinn zu Beginn des Romans mit der ständigen Verwendung beider Farben fest. Daisy und Jordan sind ständig „in Weiß“ (8) – tatsächlich trägt jeder immer Weiß: Nick trägt „weiße Flanellhemden“ (41) zu Gatsbys Party, Tom trägt ein „weißes Hemd“ (36), wenn er Myrtle trifft, und Catherine ist „pulverweiß wie Milch“ (30). Tatsächlich ist die einzige Zeit, in der die Menschen kein Weiß tragen, wenn Nick seine Eindrücke von Gatsbys Party bekommt: „Die Hallen … sind grell in Primärfarben“ (40). Fitzgerald definiert diese beiden Farben weiter, indem er viele alltägliche, unwichtige Gegenstände in diesen Farben färbt: Wenn Nick zur Arbeit geht, geht er „durch die weißen Schluchten des unteren New York“ (56), die Namen der Leute auf Gatsbys Party sind jetzt „graue Namen“ (61) auf Nicks Zeitplan, Catherines Wohnung ist „ein Stück in einer langen weißen Torte aus Wohnhäusern“ – Einheitlichkeit (28). Er beschreibt auch einfache oder gewöhnliche Menschen oder Orte als weiß oder grau: Jordan und Daisy hatten eine „weiße Kindheit“ (19) zusammen, es gibt „graue Autos“ und „graues Land“ (23) im Tal der Asche, das „italienische Kind“ im Bahnhof ist „grau“ (26) und der Hundeführer ist „ein grauer alter Mann“ (27).\n\nNachdem Fitzgerald genug Bedeutung für Weiß/Grau aufgebaut hat, verwendet er sie, um Unwichtigkeit oder Einheitlichkeit für bestimmte Themen zu symbolisieren. Diese Verwendung von Farben, um den Lesern etwas zu zeigen, beginnt mit Daisy. Nach langer Zeit ohne nennenswerte Verwendung dieser Farben beschreibt Fitzgerald Daisy plötzlich als „in Weiß gekleidet“ in „einem kleinen weißen Roadster“; die Leser sehen Daisy zunehmend weniger als Charakter, sondern eher als eine einheitliche Ergänzung, etwas, das Gatsby sich wünscht und danach sehnt (74). Fitzgerald verwendet diese Technik weiter um Daisy herum, um den Eindruck zu erwecken, dass sie eine einheitlichere Ergänzung ist, zum Beispiel gibt es einen „grauen Schleier aus Daisys Pelzkragen“ (18), und sie trägt wieder ein „weißes“ (115) Kleid vor dem Treffen mit Tom und Gatsby. \n\n\n\n[REWRITE] Many authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward important topics.

After Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or uniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy. After a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing Daisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character, more like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses more of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition, for example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

    "transformed": "Many authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward important topics. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses many of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an adjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a subject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose. Fitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In his novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and red/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an important object. The meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit nicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the beginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in fact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears a “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the only time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the halls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring many common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white chasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61) on Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—uniformity (28).

Dies ist die Art von Betrieb, die es dem Landbesitzer ermöglichen würde, die Vorteile staatlicher Programme zu nutzen, gleichzeitig das Habitat zu verbessern, um somit die Freizeitnutzung zu ermöglichen und die Möglichkeit für Farmenführungen und andere Programme für die Gewinnung von Geld oder zu Bildungszwecken zu schaffen.\n\nZusätzlich zur Befüllung eines potenziell lukrativen Nischenmarktes umfassen die Vorteile der biologischen Landwirtschaft oft eine größere Biodiversität von Pflanzen und Wildtieren in der Region, dank des Mangels an Chemikalien in Boden und Wasser.  Allerdings hat die biologische Landwirtschaft in einigen Aspekten höhere Kosten als die konventionelle Landwirtschaft. Sie erfordert mehr intensive Arbeit und Management, um Schädlinge und Unkraut zu entfernen und den Boden ohne Chemikalien zu düngen, und Verluste sind oft größer als bei konventionellen Methoden, während ein kleiner Bio-Betrieb auch die Skaleneffizienz großer Betriebe fehlt.  Praktiken, die nicht mit der biologischen Landwirtschaft zusammenhängen, aber für die Tierwelt vorteilhaft sind, können ebenfalls zu höheren Arbeitskosten führen, einschließlich des Einpflanzen von Gründüngekulturen, der strategischen Weidewirtschaft, der Entfernung invasiver Arten und des aktiven Managements des Pflanzenwachstums, um bestimmte Bedingungen wie Randhabitat oder Flächen mit freiem Grund zu schaffen.  Es gibt also viele Gründe, warum der Landwirt in diesem Beispiel finanzielle Hilfe oder Expertise suchen könnte, um sowohl den Gewinn als auch die Habitatqualität zu maximieren.\n\nDas für dieses Szenario ausgewählte Land ist ein Grundstück in der Nähe der Stadt Potrero, im unincorporated San Diego County, Kalifornien.

Sie ist auch nicht singulär oder einheitlich. Aussagen wie „Alle Russen sind stur“ oder „Alle Japaner sind einfallsreich“ sind inhärent überzogen und zu vereinfacht. Während das Verständnis der Generalisierungen einer Kultur angemessen ist, ist es für einen Verhandlungsführer viel produktiver, die Bedeutung einer Kultur für die konkrete Angelegenheit zu verstehen und wie die Einstellung dieser Kultur die Verhandlungen beeinflussen kann und wird. \n\nWenn man sich einer fremden Kultur nähert, erlebt man sie auf eine Weise, die mit seiner eigenen Kultur vergleichbar ist, und Vergleiche ergeben sich zwangsläufig. Das Verstehen einer fremden Kultur oder Denkweise kann alles umfassen, von der Erforschung ihrer Geschichte bis zur Erkenntnis ihrer Vorurteile. Anstatt eine Kultur zu verurteilen oder zu versuchen, sie zu ändern, muss man sie einfach so akzeptieren, wie sie ist, und innerhalb ihrer Grenzen arbeiten, insbesondere im Rahmen der Verhandlungen und besonders, wenn man mit einer schwächeren Verhandlungsposition an den Tisch kommt. Ebenso kann ein Respekt für Traditionen und Überzeugungen, wenn ein Verhandlungsführer sich in einem \"fremden\" Gebiet befindet, nur dazu beitragen, kulturelle Barrieren zu überwinden und die Verhandlungen voranzutreiben.\n\nEs ist wichtig zu beachten, dass Kultur sich nicht notwendigerweise auf eine nationale/internationale Dichotomie beschränkt. Die meisten Unternehmen innerhalb eines bestimmten Landes etablieren ihre eigene Unternehmenskultur. Zum Beispiel könnte eine Unternehmenskultur lange Arbeitszeiten im Büro oder einen entspannteren Zeitplan betonen. Belege für eine Unternehmenskultur sind in Kleiderordnungen, Kommunikationsverhalten (direkte vs. indirekte Kommunikation, Delegation von Aufgaben) und Einstellungspraktiken zu sehen. Einige Unternehmen fördern die Philanthropie auf allen Ebenen der Mitarbeiter, andere beschränken sie auf „von der Firma genehmigte“ Wohltätigkeitsorganisationen oder Spendensammlungen. Man muss nur die Unterschiede in der amerikanischen Unternehmenskultur von Unternehmen zu Unternehmen betrachten (und tatsächlich existiert sogar innerhalb eines Unternehmens eine Vielfalt, von Region zu Region, von städtischen zu vorstädtischen Umgebungen), um die Vielfalt der Gedanken zu schätzen, die in einer bestimmten Gesellschaftskultur existieren kann. Bestimmte Kulturen sind nicht annähernd so stratifiziert wie die amerikanische Kultur und mögen für Außenstehende einheitlicher erscheinen, aber ein ähnliches Äußeres ist einfach ein Zeichen, tiefer einzudringen.\n\nWerte sind noch wichtiger zu verstehen, denn sie liefern den \"Warum\" einer Kultur. Wenn das Sparen von Gesicht oder die Gemeinschaftssinn innerhalb einer Kultur geschätzt werden, ist es sicher, dass ein Verhandlungsführer sein Unternehmen oder seinen Vorgesetzten nicht öffentlich beschämen wird, um am Verhandlungstisch erfolgreich zu sein. Ebenso wird ein Verhandlungsführer aus einer Kultur, die mehr Gewicht auf eine hartnäckige Verhandlung legt, nicht unbedingt daran gezwungen sein, so schnell wie möglich zu einem Kompromiss zu kommen. Die Berücksichtigung dieser Allgemeinplätze ist wichtig, bevor man an den Verhandlungstisch kommt. Ein Verhandlungsführer wird jedoch gut beraten sein, etwas über seinen Gegner auf persönlicher Ebene zu erfahren, um die Verhandlungen effektiv zu gestalten.\n\n\n\n[REWRITE]\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation.

This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",

    "raw_output": "\"Der Narr hat in seinem Herzen gesagt: 'Es gibt keinen Gott.' Dieses Zitat wird erstmals im Psalm 14 der christlichen Bibel gefunden und steht am Anfang von St. Anselms Argument für die Existenz Gottes. Diese Überzeugung scheint auch vom anderen Autor, den wir besprechen werden, Thomas von Aquin, geteilt zu werden. Da jeder ihrer Argumente zur Verteidigung desselben Konzepts ist und unsere Herausforderung darin besteht, zu bestimmen, welches besser ist, müssen wir, aus Gründen der Kürze, mit der Annahme beginnen, dass sie beide in ihrer Überzeugung von der Existenz Gottes, insbesondere des Gottes der Bibel, richtig liegen. Um einen Gott-artigen Wesen zuzulassen, der möglicherweise nicht dem entspricht, an dem unsere beiden Autoren glauben, würde uns nicht erlauben, ihre beiden Argumente angemessen zu vergleichen, da sie im Wesentlichen die Verteidigung eines spezifischen Gottesbegriffs sind. \n\tDas gesagt, ich würde vorschlagen, dass zwar jeder von ihnen gültige Punkte aufwirft, aber keiner wirklich einen ganzheitlichen Grund für den Glauben an Gott liefert.\n\tUm diesen Punkt zu veranschaulichen, werden wir zunächst das grundlegende Argument von St. Anselm untersuchen. Anslems Passage spiegelt einen Weg wider, Verständnis durch Glauben zu erlangen, indem man in sich selbst sucht, um Beweise für Gott zu finden. Er erklärt, dass weil Gott in unserem Verständnis existiert, können wir seine Nichtexistenz nicht effektiv begreifen. Während dieses Konzept, wenn es in seiner Terminologie ausgedrückt wird, etwas mühsam und manchmal unklar ist, ist das Grundprinzip, dass der Beweis für Gott in seinem eigenen Geist liegt. St. Anselm schlägt uns vor, dass wir nicht über die Grenzen unserer eigenen Seele hinausgehen müssen, um die Wahrheit über Gott zu finden, sondern dass die Existenz dieses Wesens durch die Untersuchung dessen, was wir in unseren eigenen Köpfen als wahr wissen, als wahr erwiesen wird. Fremde Beweise sind vermutlich überflüssig. Dieses Konzept, etwas zu akzeptieren, für das es keinen unbestreitbaren Körper empirischer Beweise gibt, wird in christlichen Texten oft als Glaube bezeichnet.\n\tDiese Idee unterscheidet sich stark von der von St. Thomas von Aquin. Aquin schlägt stattdessen vor, dass die Existenz Gottes durch Vernunft und empirische Beweise vollständig bewiesen werden kann, ohne jeglichen Glauben. Eine solche Idee wäre für die Evangelisation, ein wichtiger Bestandteil des Christentums, vorteilhaft, da sie die Rekrutierung neuer Konvertiten ohne Abhängigkeit von ihrer Bereitschaft zu akzeptieren, etwas zu akzeptieren, was nicht bewiesen werden kann, ermöglichen würde. Sie könnten stattdessen allein durch Logik überzeugt werden. St. Thomas erläutert fünf verschiedene logische Argumente, die die Existenz Gottes stützen: Wandel, Kausalität, Konditionalität, Grade der Vollkommenheit und Harmonie. In jedem von ihnen demonstriert er im Wesentlichen, dass der Beweis für Gott in der logischen Notwendigkeit für Gott liegt. Wenn man dir gesagt wird, dass dir ein Puzzleteil fehlt, und du den Rest des Puzzles zusammenstellst, ergibt die Logik, dass du die Merkmale und die Existenz des fehlenden Teils kennen kannst, ohne ihn zu sehen.\n\n[REWRITE]The fool has said in his heart, 'There is no God.'

Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\nThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n[/REWRITE] \n\n\n\n",

(Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.

The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

    "raw_output": "## German Translation:\n\nDie Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika und Mexiko sind ein Beispiel für zwei Nationen, die einst von einem anhaltenden Rivaleit geplagt wurden, das 57 Jahre lang, von 1836 bis 1893, dauerte (Diehl und Goerts 2000, S. 145).  Der Höhepunkt dieses rivalisierenden Verhältnisses war der Mexikanisch-Amerikanische Krieg von 1846-1848, in dem die Vereinigten Staaten Mexiko angriffen und besiegten und sich Texas und Südwesten als neues Territorium sicherte.  Es gab viele weitere Zusammenstöße zwischen den beiden Nationen, die schließlich kurz vor dem Ersten Weltkrieg abklangen. Das Rivaleit begann, als Amerikaner und Mexikaner in wichtigen Fragen wie Religion, Kultur und Traditionen aneinandergeraten und einen großen Interessenkonflikt hatten (Schmitt 1974, S. 30-31).   \n\t\nDas ist nicht unähnlich vielen anderen Nationen, die ein langanhaltendes Rivaleit mit einem Nachbarn haben. Nationen, die eine gemeinsame Grenze teilen, neigen dazu, Interessenkonflikte zu haben, die zu rivalisierenden Positionen zwischen den Nationen führen. Die Vereinigten Staaten und Mexiko ähneln in vielerlei Hinsicht anderen anhaltenden Rivalitäten zwischen Nationen, die eine gemeinsame Grenze teilen. David M. Pletcher (1977) stellt fest: „Nur in Mexiko und Kuba findet man langwierige übergreifende amerikanische diplomatische Probleme“ (S. 41). Tatsächlich sind beide Nationen geographisch nahe an den Vereinigten Staaten und waren Rivalen der Vereinigten Staaten, während andere Nationen in Lateinamerika gute Beziehungen zu den Vereinigten Staaten pflegen und gepflegt haben.   \n\t\nReligiöse Fragen schufen eine Kluft zwischen den beiden Nationen, ein Problem, das viele Nationen im Laufe der Geschichte plagte. Sally Frahm (2001) schreibt: „Wenn Amerikaner im 20. Jahrhundert gegen Faschismus und Kommunismus waren, waren sie im 18. und 19. Jahrhundert gegen Katholizismus und Monarchie“ (S. 86). Nicht unähnlich dem kalten Krieg, bei dem die Vereinigten Staaten und die Sowjetunion ideologisch und um Interessen kämpften, die jede Nation für lebenswichtig hielt, war auch dieser Wettbewerb in erster Linie eine ideologische Auseinandersetzung. In diesem Fall basierten die ideologischen Konflikte jedoch nicht auf der politischen Struktur, sondern auf den religiösen Präferenzen der Vereinigten Staaten und Mexikos. Dieses Misstrauen entstand aus dem Misstrauen zwischen Engländern und Spaniern. Das Erbe dieser Misstrauensgefühle aus den ehemaligen Kolonialherren war ein Hindernis für die Begründung freundschaftlicher ausländischer Beziehungen zwischen den Vereinigten Staaten und Mexiko.\n\t\nDiehl und Goerts (2000) führen 17 Streitigkeiten zwischen Mexiko und den Vereinigten Staaten im Zeitraum des 57-jährigen Rivalitätsverhältnisses auf. Die meisten Streitigkeiten aus dem von Diehl und Goerts beschriebenen Rivalitätszeitraum betreffen territoriale Fragen im Zusammenhang mit Grenzüberschreitungen von mexikanischem Gebiet nach Mexiko und anderen Grenzproblemen. Grenzüberschreitungen durch Banditen und Gesetzlose aus amerikanischen Grenzstädten waren ein großes Problem, das bis zu dem Zeitpunkt anhielt, als sowohl die Vereinigten Staaten als auch Mexiko Militärpräsenz an ihren Grenzen aufbauten (Schmitt 1974, S. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) erklärt, dass das Rivaleit zwischen den beiden Nationen begann, abzunehmen, als „Mexiko in erheblichem Umfang von den Vereinigten Staaten abhängig wurde“ (S. 109) und schließlich endete, als sich die amerikanischen Ambitionen „von der territorialen Expansion zu einer wirtschaftlichen Intervention in Mexiko“ (S. 110) im späten 19.

Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",

Bis heute bin ich behindert, und nach 15 Jahren, die ich mit Sozialhilfe für Behinderte verbracht habe, habe ich buchstäblich nichts mehr, das ich als mein Eigentum bezeichnen kann. Ich komme irgendwie über die Runden, aber jeder Tag ist ein Kampf und ein Angriff auf meine Sicherheit, meinen Schutz und mein Selbstwertgefühl. Nichts in meinem Leben ist mehr sicher, doch es gibt eine Sache, die ich weiß: Ohne die Hilfe meiner Familie und einiger guter Freunde wäre ich all diese Jahre nicht über die Runden gekommen, egal wie stark ich war. Und glauben Sie mir, wenn eine echte Katastrophe eintritt, fühlen Sie sich überhaupt nicht stark.\n\nMein Punkt ist, dass es im Leben immer wieder Notfälle geben wird – groß und klein. Es gibt keine Garantien und egal wie gut man sich vorbereitet, manche Dinge sind einfach zu groß, um alleine zu bewältigen.\n\nIch stimme voll und ganz zu, dass wir in den USA aufhören müssen, all unsere Eier in den „Korb“ der großen Regierung zu legen; Gott weiß, der ist morsch und bröckelt sowieso. Dennoch würde ich viel lieber sehen, dass Amerikaner wieder lernen, einander zu vertrauen – lernen, einander zu helfen und Hilfe zu bitten, anstatt dass jeder von uns einzeln in den Hinterhof geht, um Unterstände vor Atomangriffen zu bauen.\n\nDie Konservativen in den USA sprechen von dem „rugged individualism“, der dieses Land aufgebaut hat; aber in Wahrheit, was unsere Vorfahren in harten Zeiten am Laufen hielt, war nicht „rugged individualism“, sondern Mitgefühl, gegenseitiger Respekt und der gemeinsame Besitz von Ressourcen. Die Pioniere, die über die Rocky Mountains in Wagenzügen zogen, kamen nicht an die Küste, indem sie allein unterwegs waren.\n\nAlso, tun Sie bitte, seien Sie vorbereitet. Ich bin es auch. Ich habe einen Notfallkoffer; Erste-Hilfe-Versorgung, Wasseraufbereitungs-Tabletten und Plastikplanen und Klebeband für die Fenster im Falle eines biologischen Angriffs. Ich habe mehrere Taschenlampen und all sorts of Batterien, viele, viele Kerzen und wasserdichte Streichhölzer und Konserven. Wenn Sie Land und Ressourcen für einen kleinen Bauernhof haben und die Möglichkeit haben, Ihr eigenes Essen zu konservieren, tun Sie es. Es ist eine gute Idee, ebenso wie ein Holzofen, solange Sie nicht in einer Wohnung wohnen.\n\nAber während Sie es tun, lernen Sie Ihre Nachbarn kennen.\n\n[REWRITE]\n\nFifteen years ago I was suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed.\n\nI was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply rooted need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick.\" was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So-- even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist - preferably a little of both, I chose nursing.\n\nNevertheless, there I was: 46 years old and single, no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled, and after 15 years of living on Social Security Disability, I have literally nothing left that I can call \"mine.\" I get by, but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security, safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore, yet, there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends, no matter how strong I was. And believe me, when real disaster strikes, you do not feel very strong at all.\n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small. There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares, some things are just too big to overcome on your own.\n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's \"basket\"; Lord knows it is moldy and falling apart, anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again - learning to help each other and to ask for help, rather than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters.\n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the \"rugged individualism\" that built this country; but in truth, what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism, it was compassion, mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone.\n\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit; first aid supplies, water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries, lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods, too. If you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea, as is a wood stove, as long as you do not live in an apartment.\n\nBut while you are at it, get to know your neighbors. [/REWRITE] \n\n\n\n",

Gibt es Einschränkungen oder Beschränkungen, die die Richtung der evolutionären Veränderung beeinflussen? Obwohl D’Arcy Thompson 1917 feststellte, dass „Der Zoologe hat auch heute kaum angefangen, die einfachsten organischen Formen in mathematischer Sprache zu definieren“, lässt sich das heute immer noch sagen. In jüngerer Zeit wurde mathematisches Modellieren auf allgemeine Aspekte der Mollusken-Skeletogenese durch Ontogenese und Phylogenie angewendet (z. B. Raup und Stanley, 1981). Unsere Studie untersucht, wie mathematisches Modellieren der ontogenetischen und phylogenetischen Veränderungen bei Prunum, in Kombination mit experimentellen Studien, verwendet werden kann, um die Mechanismen zu erhellen, die die Richtung und Größe der evolutionären-entwicklungsbedingten Veränderung beeinflussen. Wir verwendeten X-Radiografien von Prunum-Arten, um quantitative Parameter zu definieren, die wiederum zur Modellierung hypothetischer und tatsächlicher Skelettmorphologien verwendet werden konnten. Diese Parameter wurden in das Softwareprogramm CerioShell (Stone, 1995) eingegeben. Wir modellierten hypothetische Schalenmorphologien, die verwendet werden können, um die Grenzen möglicher morphologischer Veränderungen bei Prunum zu interpretieren. Diese Ergebnisse werden mit experimentellen und deskriptiven Studien kombiniert, um makroevolutionäre Ereignisse in dieser Klade besser zu verstehen.\n\nEine Schale kann als eine Struktur angesehen werden, die sich im Laufe der Zeit im Raum über 360 Grad bewegt. Diese Revolutionen oder Drehungen einer gekrümmten Schale werden Windungen genannt, die als um eine imaginäre zentrale Achse spiralförmig betrachtet werden. Diese Achse verläuft durch die zentrale Säule der Schale und wird als Columella bezeichnet. Die Geschwindigkeit, mit der sich die Windungen vergrößern, kann variieren, und eine kontinuierliche Linie trennt jede Windung und wird als Naht bezeichnet. Bei den meisten Schnecken ist die größte Windung einer Schale die letzte Windung (Wirbelwindung). Die Spirale wird als alle Windungen außer der letzten angesehen. Die Spitze ist die Spitze der Spirale und die gegenüberliegende Seite wird als Basis bezeichnet. Das Tier erstreckt sich durch eine Öffnung, die als Öffnung bezeichnet wird, aus seiner Schale.\n\nSchalen können in apikaler, basaler, aperturaler und abaperturaler Ansicht betrachtet werden. (Die „gewöhnliche“ Ausrichtung einer Schale ist eine aperturale Ansicht, mit der Öffnung zum Betrachter und mit der Spitze nach oben.)\n\nEine Methode zum Zählen von Windungen ist unten dargestellt. Zuerst sollte die Schale aus apikaler Sicht betrachtet und dann bestimmt werden, wo die erste Naht beginnt. Anschließend kann eine Linie gezogen werden, die die Schale in zwei Teile teilt. Die Windungen werden von dieser Linie gezählt und werden auf ein Viertel einer Windung geschätzt.\n\nEine Schale kann als eine Reihe von Öffnungen betrachtet werden, die sich im Laufe der Zeit und im Raum bewegen, während sich das Tier seine Schale aufbaut (d.h. baut). Es ist möglich, den Verlauf der Öffnung anhand der Koordinaten des Zentrums der Öffnung jeder Windung sowie des horizontalen und vertikalen Radius der Öffnung zu verfolgen.\n\nDieser Verlauf kann grafisch und mathematisch dargestellt werden. Sobald eine mathematische Formulierung erstellt wurde, ist es möglich, Parameter zu verändern und die Skeletogenese des Mollusks zu modifizieren. \n\n## English Translation:\n\n[REWRITE]\n\nWhy do organisms evolve in the way they do?

    "original": "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise.

    "raw_output": "## German Translation:\n\nViktorianische Romane zeichnen sich durch ihre überwältigende Detailgenauigkeit und ihren Fokus auf die Aristokratie der Zeit aus. Zwei Romane, die als viktorianisch gelten, aber von dieser Tradition abweichen, sind „Oliver Twist“ und „Wuthering Heights“. Beide Romane verwenden ein Element des Mysteriums und eine gewisse Bizarre, die untypisch für die Romane der Zeit sind und die Charaktere innerhalb jedes Werkes stärken; sie bieten Einsichten, die ihre Motive und Emotionen vertiefen.\n\n\"Und jetzt drängten sich ganze Horden verwirrender und verwirrender Ideen in seinen Kopf. Es schien, als würde er immer noch zwischen Sikes und Crackit gehen, die wütend stritten: denn die Worte, die sie sagten, hallten in seinen Ohren nach; und als er seine eigene Aufmerksamkeit auf sich lenkte, ... fand er, dass er mit ihnen sprach.... Plötzlich zuckte er zurück bei dem Knall von Schüssen; und es erhob sich in die Luft lauter Rufe und Geschrei; Lichter blitzten vor seinen Augen auf, und alles war Lärm und Tumult, als eine unsichtbare Hand ihn hastig davon trug. Durch all diese raschen Visionen lief ein undefinierbares, unwohles Bewusstsein von Schmerz, das ihn unaufhörlich quälte.\"\n(Dickens, 220)\n\nDie beiden Romane nutzen dieses Mysterium oft durch Traumsequenzen oder traumähnliche Zustände, obwohl Inhalt und Funktion in jedem Einzelfall variieren. Bei Oliver Twist offenbaren diese seltsamen Ereignisse oft Einblicke in Oliver's innere Schichten, was ihn quält und sein Bewusstsein für die wahre Natur der Dinge, die um ihn herum passieren, erweitert. Wenn die Schießerei von Oliver in Kapitel 28 endlich wiederaufgenommen wird, erlebt Oliver die Schießerei lebhaft wieder, als wäre er in einem Traum, während er nach Hilfe sucht (siehe links). Der Auszug betont das Fehlen der Kontrolle, das Oliver über die sich entfaltenden Ereignisse hatte, sowie den düsteren Zustand, in dem sich seine Gesundheit befand, was durch Olivers Halluzinationen von Sikes und Crackit deutlich wurde. Die Schießerei selbst überwältigt ihn, alle seine Sinne werden gelähmt, da er die \"unsichtbare Hand\" nicht bemerkt, die ihn davonträgt; er erlebt seinen Verzweiflung neu, getrennt vom Schock des Schmerzes, da der Schmerz nun ständig ist und mit Angst verbunden ist, anstatt mit Überraschung. Da Oliver überwältigt wird, stellt sich die Frage, wessen Wille zu seiner Misere geführt hat, denn es war sicherlich nicht seine. Diese Schießerei verstärkt die Vorstellung, dass Oliver wenig Kontrolle über etwas hat, da er sich nicht einmal bemühen kann, das Ergebnis eines Ereignisses zu beeinflussen, selbst wenn sein Leben in Gefahr ist. Ein wachsendes Gefühl der Niederlage bei Oliver wird auch in diesem Auszug angedeutet, als wäre Old Fagin damit begonnen, ihn zu brechen und ihn dazu zu zwingen, diese Verzweiflung anzunehmen, was seine Fähigkeit beeinflusst, zu reagieren. Denn ansonsten könnte man annehmen, dass Oliver zumindest aus seinem eigenen Interesse zumindest einen Versuch unternommen hätte.\n\n\n\"Der Tag verging – Tag! Es gab keinen Tag; er war so schnell verschwunden, wie er gekommen war – und die Nacht kam wieder; so lange, und doch so kurz; lange in ihrer schrecklichen Stille und kurz in ihren flüchtigen Stunden.\n\n[REWRITE]\n\nVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period. Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away from this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions. \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\nThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own.

Ich habe mein Bestes gegeben, um ihnen bei jedem Fach zu helfen, in dem sie Schwierigkeiten hatten, aber meine Stärken lagen in Englisch und Lesen. Eine der Lehrerinnen bat mich, einem kleinen Jungen namens Adrian (ich glaube, er war in der dritten oder vierten Klasse) zu helfen, der große Schwierigkeiten beim Lesen hatte. Es wurde mir klar, dass etwas nicht stimmte; er hatte die merkwürdigsten Probleme. Einige Buchstaben konnte er perfekt aussprechen, andere überhaupt nicht, es war das Seltsamste. Weißt du, er war lateinamerikanischer Abstammung, das war mir sicher, aber der Junge sprach perfekt Englisch. Wir hatten Mühe, bis zum Tag, an dem ich seine Mutter traf. Ich kümmerte mich (für einen besseren Ausdruck) um ein paar Kinder, während der Rest der Nachmittagsgruppe auf einem Schulausflug war, als seine Mutter hereinkam. Seine Mutter sprach kein Wort Englisch, nur Spanisch. Mit meinem sehr schlechten Spanischkenntnissen (ich lernte gerade erst) konnten wir uns verständigen. Aber dann wurde mir klar wie ein Schlag: Adrian konnte gut lesen, er kannte einfach das englische Alphabet nicht so gut. Ich weiß nicht, ob diese Erkenntnis ihm jemals wirklich weitergeholfen hat, aber ich hoffe, dass es ihm heute besser geht.\n\nIch erzähle diese Geschichte, um das Problem der Sprachbarriere in Schulen zu beleuchten, besonders hier in Kalifornien. Ich erzähle es auch, um zu zeigen, dass es nicht immer so offensichtlich ist, wie wir denken. Auch für ein Kind, das perfekt Englisch spricht, kann das Lesen immer noch eine große Hürde sein. Ich denke, jeder kann sich einig sein, dass dieses Problem existiert, also was machen wir? In Adrians Fall war die Lösung relativ einfach: Nachhilfe im Lesen auf Englisch, insbesondere im Alphabet und in der Aussprache. Aber für die vielen Kinder, die kaum Englisch sprechen, ist die Lösung viel komplexer. Es gibt keine einfache Antwort. Das Zweisprachsystem, die Integration in den Hauptstrom, Privatlehrer, ESL-Kurse, keine dieser Dinge allein wird dieses Problem lösen. Der Schlüssel liegt darin, all diese Dinge zu kombinieren!\n\nZunächst einmal ist das Zweisprachsystem eine großartige Idee. Nicht nur für Kinder, deren Muttersprache Spanisch ist, sondern für alle Kinder. „Kinder in zweisprachigen Bildungsprogrammen haben in Studien gezeigt, dass sie ihren Altersgenossen akademisch überlegen sind.“ Viele Ängste ranken sich um diese Idee, dass es eine Verschwendung von Ressourcen ist und dass die Mehrheit der Kinder in Schulen keinen Nutzen daraus ziehen wird. Aber das ist falsch. Wenn wir diese Art von Programmen in den Unterricht integrieren würden, anstatt sie auszuschließen, würden alle Kinder davon profitieren. Wie gehen wir das aber an? Müssen alle Lehrer bilingual sein? Nein. Das wäre unvernünftig und etwas unrealistisch. Ich denke jedoch, dass es keinen Grund gibt, warum wir nicht spezielle Assistenten, Tutoren oder wie auch immer man sie nennt, haben könnten, die bilingual sind.\n\n\n[REWRITE]\n\nA couple years ago, I worked in an after-school program tutoring elementary-age students.

    "original": "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",

    "raw_output": "Der traditionelle \"Gotische Roman\" ist, in seiner Substanz und in seinem Namen, wie Ian Watt es in \"The Rise of the Gothic Novel\" beschreibt, ein \"Oxymoron für 'Alt-Neu'\". Der gotische Stil wurde verspottet, gelobt, beschuldigt, keine echte Tiefe zu haben, und für den 'terrori-erhabenen' Aspekt gelobt, den er zu evozieren schien (Burke). Der ursprüngliche \"Gotische Roman\", Horace Walpoles \"The Castle of Otranto\", nutzte die Ideen sowohl der \"alten\" als auch der \"neuen\" Romane, um den proto-gotischen Genre zu schaffen und eine neue Methode der literarischen Ausdrucksweise zu entwickeln. Walpole verwendet \"alte\" theatralische Elemente und 'neue' Nachahmung der Natur in 'modernen' Romanen, um das zu präsentieren, was er als \"Gotische Geschichte\" bezeichnet (Walpole 4). Der Gotische Genre verwendet viele Rückgriffe auf mittelalterliches gotisches Theater, Architektur und Traditionen. Schon zur Zeit der Veröffentlichung von \"The Castle of Otranto\" war das Wort \"gotisch\" verwendet worden, um viele verschiedene Völker, Stile und Epochen zu beschreiben. Es wurde als antiquiert oder unaufrichtig im Angesicht der \"modernen\" gesellschaftlichen und literarischen \"Fortschritte\" empfunden. Die Kombination des theatralischeren \"Gotischen\" mit dem neuen Format des Romans (der dem Leser einen persönlicheren Einblick in die Psychologie der Charaktere ermöglicht) ist es, was es dem Gotischen ermöglicht, so lange zu bestehen und für einen Leser, der zeitlich weit von der ursprünglichen Schrift entfernt ist, zugleich veraltet und neu zu sein.\n\tEine der bedeutendsten gotischen Ideen, die in gotischen Romanen vorkommt, ist das Konzept der Ritterlichkeit. Die mittelalterliche Vorstellung von Ritterlichkeit, der Prozess der Ausbildung eines adäquaten Ritters, wird sowohl im ursprünglichen Gotischen Roman \"The Castle of Otranto\" beibehalten als auch verwandelt. Ritterlichkeit ist besonders wichtig für Gotische Autoren, weil sie das klassische Bild des Ritters, des tapferen, ehrenhaften und kompetenten, verkörperte, und das angebliche oder wahrgenommene Fehlen dieses Ideals, das diese Autoren (insbesondere Walpole) in der Gesellschaft sahen. Durch die Verwendung der ritterlichen Konzepte und Manieren wird die \"gotische Vergangenheit\" idealisiert und romantisch gestaltet (was auf die zukünftige Entwicklung des Gotischen zum Romantischen hindeutet) und wird genutzt, um die Gegenwart zu verbessern. Walpole befand sich zu der Zeit, als er \"The Castle of Otranto\" schrieb, inmitten einer politisch unruhigen Zeit und war voller Sorgen über die mögliche Zukunft. Er, eingetaucht in Politik und (diskutabel) unfairer Anschuldigungen, begann vielleicht, zumindest implizit, zu denken, dass die angeborene Moral und \"Güte\" der Menschen, die in der gotischen Ära präsent waren, auf irgendeine Weise bei den Individuen verloren gegangen waren, die die 'Gegenwart'gesellschaft ausmachten. In seinem Schreiben wird dieses Konzept in mehreren Charakteren deutlich, einem davon ist der Charakter Frederic. Der Leser kann bereits vor Frederic's Begegnung erkennen, dass er viele ritterliche Eigenschaften verkörpert, er wird beschrieben als: \n\nDie Beschreibung von ihm beinhaltet viele traditionell ritterliche Bilder; Frederic ist vor allem ein Prinz, er hat gelitten, wurde angemessen von Tragödie betroffen, die er hinter sich lässt, und gilt derzeit als von Ungläubigen getötet. Die Figur des \"edelmütigen und höflichen Ritters\" ist natürlich übertrieben, was den bald kommenden gotischen Trope des Exzessives in den Vordergrund rückt (66).\n\n\n\n[REWRITE]The traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in essence and in name, an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression.

The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores.

Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",

Der Begriff \"Supply Chain Management\" wurde 1982 von Keith Oliver, einem Berater, geprägt. Keith Oliver beschrieb den gesamten Prozess der Planung, Implementierung und Kontrolle dessen, was in der Lieferkette geschieht, um die Bedürfnisse der Kunden schnell und effizient zu erfüllen. Es gibt sechs Schlüsselbestandteile einer Lieferkette: Produktion, Versorgung, Lagerhaltung, Standort, Transport und Information. Manager von Unternehmen nutzen diese sechs Schlüsselbestandteile, um den besten Kundenservice zu bieten.\n\nDie Produktion ist der erste Schritt im Supply Chain-Prozess. Die Produktion bildet die Grundlage für den gesamten Supply Chain-Prozess. Die Produktionsstufe definiert, wann, warum, wo und wie alles produziert wird. Manager müssen wissen, was Kunden wollen. Damit die Manager wissen, was Kunden wollen, können sie den Markt beobachten. Der Markt ist der größte Indikator, um zu entscheiden, welche Kundennachfrage besteht. Sobald die Manager den Markt analysiert haben und die Kundenbedürfnisse verstehen, können sie entscheiden, welche Produkte produziert werden sollen und wie viele davon. Nachdem das Management entschieden hat, was produziert und in welcher Menge, ist es bereit, zu entscheiden, wo die Produkte produziert werden sollen und welches Werk am besten für die Stückzahl und die Qualität der Ware geeignet ist, wobei die Kundenzufriedenheit berücksichtigt werden muss.\n\nNachdem der Produktionsstandort für die Produkte festgelegt wurde, konzentriert sich der nächste Schritt auf die Planung der Arbeitsbelastungen und die Wartung der Ausrüstung. Die Produktion ist ein sehr wichtiger Schritt im Supply Chain-Prozess. Jedes Detail ist im gesamten Prozess wichtig. Wenn nicht jedes Detail entsprechend geplant ist, kann dies dem Unternehmen langfristig viel Zeit und Geld kosten. Zum Beispiel habe ich früher in den Einzelhandelsgeschäften von Wal-Mart und Target gearbeitet. Beide Unternehmen haben ein Design, eine Broschüre und einen Prozess für jede Einheit des Unternehmens. Es gibt eine festgelegte Anordnung dafür, wie das Erscheinungsbild der Uniform eines Mitarbeiters vom Empfang der Sendungen von LKWs aussieht. Die konzipierten Prozesse ermöglichen es einem Unternehmen, reibungslos zu arbeiten, ohne Verwirrung in Bezug auf Richtung und Erwartungen.\n\nDas zweite Schlüsselelement im Supply Chain Management ist die Versorgung. Versorgung ist definiert als die strategischen Entscheidungen, die getroffen werden sollten, um die Kernkapazitäten einer Einrichtung zu bestimmen, und die Outsourcing-Partnerschaften sollten aus diesen Entscheidungen hervorgehen. Ein Unternehmen kann viele verschiedene Produktionsabteilungen für ein einzelnes Produkt haben. Alle Abteilungen bestehen aus unterschiedlicher Ausrüstung, Arbeitern und Spezialitäten. Der Manager muss entscheiden, welche Abteilung am besten für die verschiedenen Prozesse des Produkts geeignet ist. Das Management kann auch entscheiden, die Arbeit an andere Unternehmen auszulagern. Der Hauptgrund, warum ein Manager die Arbeit an andere Unternehmen auslagert, ist, die Geschwindigkeit zu erhöhen. Geschwindigkeit ist die Fähigkeit, Qualität und Flexibilität zu bieten und gleichzeitig Kosten zu senken oder niedrige Kostensätze aufrechtzuerhalten.\n\n\n## Rewritten Text:\n\n[REWRITE]Supply chain management is the flow of processes that move goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer.

Burma, auch bekannt als Myanmar, ist ein südöstasiatisches Land, das von einer tyrannischen militanten Junta regiert wird, die 1962 durch einen Staatsstreich an die Macht kam. 2007 fanden eine Reihe von Straßenprotesten statt, die ersten öffentlichen Proteste seit einem Jahrzehnt. Geleitet von einer großen Zahl burmesischer Mönche, erhielten diese Proteste den Namen „Die Safflower-Revolution“, benannt nach der Farbe der Gewänder, die die Mönche trugen. Nach den ersten Aufständen begann die breite Öffentlichkeit sich für die Proteste zu interessieren, und obwohl die burmesische Regierung zunächst widerwillig erlaubte, dass die Mönche friedliche Versammlungen abhalten, eskalierte die Gewalt bald zu dem, was einige als einen allumfassenden Krieg zwischen den Mönchen und der Militärjunta betrachteten, mit der aktiven Invasion und Plünderung von Klöstern im ganzen Land durch die Militär. Ausländische Journalisten wurden sofort verhaftet und eingesperrt, wobei der japanische Fotojournalist Kenji Nagai am 27. September 2007 ausgerechnet weil er an einem Straßenprotest anwesend war, getötet wurde. Während die offizielle Todesbilanz bei 13 Toten liegt, wird der ehemalige Colonel Hla Win, der sich einige Tage vor dem offiziellen Bericht aus der Armee abgemeldet hatte, mit den Worten zitiert: „In den letzten Tagen wurden mehr Menschen getötet, als Sie gehört haben. Die Leichen können in mehreren tausend gezählt werden.“\n\nDas ist nichts Neues. Während dies einige der jüngsten Beispiele für Gräueltaten in unserer Welt sind, hat der Wunsch einer Regierung, Dissidenten zu unterdrücken und die absolute Kontrolle über ihre Bürger zu behalten, so lang wie die Zivilisation selbst existiert. Frührömische Kaiser erklärten sich zu den von den Göttern Auserwählten, die über jeden Aspekt ihrer Gesellschaft die vollständige Exekutivgewalt ausüben sollten. Es heißt, japanische Kaiser seien tatsächlich Götter, die in unsere Welt gesandt wurden, um ihr Volk durch die Erfindung von Motorola-Handys und Hara-Kiri zum Wohlstand zu führen, und unser aktueller Präsident, George W. Bush, hat wöchentliche Telefonkonferenzen mit Ted Haggard, dem Leiter von „Stupid People Worldwide“, einer Tochtergesellschaft der Republikanischen Partei.\n\nEinige der bekanntesten Beispiele für solche Aktionen sind Ereignisse wie der Protest am 4. Juni 1989 auf dem Tiananmen-Platz, bei dem Intellektuelle, Arbeiteraktivisten und Studenten versammelten sich, um gegen die autoritäre Herrschaft der Regierung zu protestieren. Die Todesbilanz in diesem konkreten Fall variiert stark, wobei offizielle Berichte der chinesischen Regierung 200-300 Tote angeben, während Berichte des chinesischen Roten Kreuzes zwischen 2.000 und 3.000 Toten melden. Ein weiteres Beispiel ist der Völkermord in Ruanda in den 1990er Jahren, bei dem Hutu-Milizgruppen, unterstützt von der ruandischen Regierung, eine systematische Ermordung aller Tutsi sowie politischer Moderatoren, unabhängig von ihrem ethnischen Hintergrund, begannen.

Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republican Party.\n\nSome of the most well-known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead. Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example.",

    "raw_output": "Duke Ellington’s Erbe im Jazz entsteht zum großen Teil aus seiner Langlebigkeit und, im Weiteren, seiner kreativen Fähigkeit, sein Orchester zu formen. Ellingsons Präsenz am Klavier ist in vielen der für diese Aufgabe ausgewählten Kompositionen subtil, aber als Komponist überzeugte Ellington mit der Kreation von reichen und komplexen Stücken, die die individuellen Fähigkeiten der Bandmitglieder hervorhoben. Ellington schuf den Rahmen, in dem ein Solist frei improvisieren konnte, zusätzlich zu dicht orchestrierten Stücken und Phrasen, die den besonderen Stil der Bandmitglieder ansprachen, um musikalische Ideen hervorzuheben. Dabei betonte er auch den Ton des Orchesters insgesamt und schuf kohärente und originelle Klänge, die zu jedem Stück passten. Ellingsons Meisterschaft über den individuellen Klang der Spieler sowie darüber, wie sie in einem wachsenden Ensemble zusammenpassten, ermöglichte es ihm, einige der innovativsten und brillantesten Stücke der Jazzgeschichte zu schreiben.\n\nDas Grove Music Lexikon erwähnt in Bezug auf Ellingsons Klang und Innovation \"Creole Love Call\" und verwendet den Begriff \"Stimme als Jazzinstrument\" im Laufe seiner Karriere. Dies ist ein frühes Beispiel für Ellingsons Einsatz der Stimme, um Textur und Farbe hinzuzufügen, ohne durch Texte eingeschränkt zu sein. \"Creole Love Call\" demonstriert auch Ellingsons Fähigkeit, den Stil seiner Solisten zu ergänzen, etwas, das sich in seiner gesamten Karriere zeigt. Dieses langsame, vorsichtige Zwölfton-Blues-Stück enthält sechs Strophen:\n\nStrophe 1: Wechselspiel zwischen Stimme und Holzbläsern, wobei die Stimme zunächst glatt und melodisch beginnt, dann gegen Ende zu einem rauheren Klang übergeht.\n\nStrophe 2: Dämpfendes Trompetensolo, das die Grundmelodie weiterentwickelt und mehrere verlängerte blaue Noten hervorhebt.\n\nStrophe 3: Walzendes Klarinettensolo in hoher Lage, begleitet von einer subtilem synkopierten Klavierphrase.\n\nStrophe 4: Das ganze Orchester wiederholt die erste Strophe mit einem Wechselspiel zwischen den Blech- und Holzbläsersektionen.\n\nStrophe 5: Die klimakttische Strophe des Stücks, da die Holzbläser jetzt das Wechselspiel in hoher Lage beginnen, unterstützt von synkopiertem Stop-Time aus den Blechbläser- und Rhythmussektionen.\n\nStrophe 6: Rückkehr zur Struktur der ersten Strophe mit Wechselspiel zwischen Stimme und Holzbläsern. In dieser Strophe übernimmt die Stimme den Klang der \"Growl\"-Technik und spielt als Instrument solo.\n\nTag: Kurze Kennzeichnung mit einem Gesangspassagen und einem dissonanten, neuartigen Ende durch ein Trombon.\n\nEllingsons Einsatz der Stimme, um dieser Komposition eine Dimension der Klangfarbe hinzuzufügen, ist ein Beispiel für ein stilistisches Merkmal, das sich durch seine Arbeit zieht. \n\nIn \"Hot and Bothered\", aufgenommen ein Jahr später, kombiniert Ellington seine Fähigkeit zur präzisen Orchesterführung mit seinem Gespür für Klangfarbe. Ein Wechselspiel zwischen \"Bubber\" Miley am dämpfenden Trompeten und Baby Cox's Scat-Gesang nutzt die Gesangselementen von Mileys Spiel und die instrumentale Seite von Cox' Stimme, um einen reichen und komplementären Klang zu erzeugen. \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\" erweitert diese Ideen, da Ellington Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, einen festen Bestandteil des Ellingsons Orchestras, effektiv einsetzt, um die Melodie am dämpfenden Posaune einzuführen.\n\n[REWRITE] Duke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra.

Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates.

Die aMed-Ernährung ist eine modifizierte Version der Med-Ernährung und zeichnet sich durch einen höheren Verzehr von pflanzlichen Lebensmitteln aus, einschließlich pflanzlichen Proteinen (ausgenommen Kartoffeln, aber einschließlich Obst, Nüsse, Vollkornprodukten und Hülsenfrüchten), einfach ungesättigten Fettsäuren (im Vergleich zu gesättigten Fettsäuren) und Fisch, sowie durch einen geringeren Verzehr von tierischen Produkten und gesättigten Fettsäuren. Gemäßigem Alkoholkonsum ist erlaubt.\n\nFrühere prospektive Studien haben eine inverse Korrelation zwischen der Einhaltung einer Med-Ernährung und dem Risiko für totale und kardiovaskuläre (KHK) Mortalität dokumentiert, und eine Interventionsstudie zeigte, dass die Med-Ernährung effektiver ist als eine fettarme Ernährung, um Gewichtsverlust zu fördern und das Verhältnis von Gesamtcholesterin zu hochdichte Lipoprotein-Cholesterin bei übergewichtigen Personen zu senken. Frühere Studien haben sich nicht auf Schlaganfall oder Schlaganfallmortalität konzentriert.\n\nDiese epidemiologische Studie verfolgte 74.886 Frauen im Alter von 38 bis 63 Jahren ohne Vorerkrankungen von KHK oder Diabetes, die Teilnehmerinnen der Nurses' Health Study sind, einer Kohortenstudie mit 121.700 weibliche Krankenschwestern in 11 US-Bundesstaaten. Sechsmal, von 1984 bis 2004, berechneten die Autoren einen aMed-Ernährungsscore aus selbstberichteten „Nahrungsmittelfrequenzfragebögen“ („FFQs“), die darauf ausgelegt waren, den Nährstoffkonsum im Vorjahr zu bewerten. Mehr als 95% der Krankenschwestern nahmen über den 20-jährigen Zeitraum an der Studie teil. Die FFQs wurden Validierungsstudien unterzogen. Berichte über KHK, fatale KHK und Schlaganfall wurden durch Überprüfung von medizinischen oder Krankenhausakten, Autopsien oder Todesurkunden bestätigt. Wo keine Aufzeichnungen verfügbar waren, wurden Fälle als „wahrscheinlich“ eingestuft und eingeschlossen, wobei etwa 17% aller Schlaganfälle und 24% der nicht-fatalen Myokardinfarkte so klassifiziert wurden. Der Body-Mass-Index, der Rauchstatus, der Aspirin-Konsum, der Multivitamin-Konsum, der menopausale Status und die Anwendung von postmenopausalen Hormonen wurden für jeden FFQ berechnet, und ab 1986 wurde die Freizeitaktivität bewertet.\n\nUm die zufällige Variation für ein Individuum zu reduzieren und den langfristigen Nahrungsmittelkonsum besser darzustellen, wurden kumulative Durchschnittswerte des aMed-Scores aus den wiederholten FFQs berechnet (Durchschnittsbildung aus den Werten der beiden vorherigen Jahre). Anpassungen wurden für „Kon fondationsefaktoren“ (Faktoren, die die Ergebnisse verzerren könnten) vorgenommen, indem die Altersgruppe, der Rauchstatus, der BMI, der menopausale Status, der Konsum von postmenopausalen Hormonen, der Multivitamin-Konsum, der Alkoholkonsum, die körperliche Aktivität und der Aspirin-Konsum berücksichtigte wurden.\n\nDie Cox-Proportional-Hazard-Modellierung wurde verwendet, um die Assoziation zwischen einem aMed-Score und dem Risiko für KHK und Schlaganfall zu bewerten, wobei separate Modelle für fatale und nicht-fatale KHK und Schlaganfalltypen verwendet wurden.\n\nEine stärkere Einhaltung der mediterranen Ernährung, wie sie durch einen höheren aMed-Ernährungsscore reflektiert wird, war mit einem niedrigeren Risiko für den Auftreten von KHK und Schlaganfall bei Frauen assoziiert. Während einer 20-jährigen Nachbeobachtung wurden 2391 Fälle von KHK, 1763 Fälle von Schlaganfall und 1077 Todesfälle durch kardiovaskuläre Erkrankungen (fatale KHK und Schlaganfälle kombiniert) gefunden.

To reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years). Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use. Cox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. Greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). [/REWRITE]\n\n\n",
    "transformed": "This study showed that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with a reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality. The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by a higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and a lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol intake is allowed. Prior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals. Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality. This epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states. Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year. More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed.

    "raw_output": "## German Translation:\n\nIm Jahr 2007 stürzte die Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika in eine verheerende Finanzkrise. Die Arbeitslosigkeit stieg, der Immobilienmarkt brach zusammen und viele der größten und wichtigsten Unternehmen Amerikas wurden ruiniert. Diese Rezession hält bis heute an, daher müssen wir uns fragen: Wie ist diese Krise entstanden und wie können wir sie stoppen? Kurz gesagt, die Finanzkrise wurde durch egoistisches und naives politisches Entscheiden verursacht, das Banken und Unternehmen dazu drängte, Subprime-Kredite in eine bereits unreife und unzureichende Finanzinfrastruktur zu vergeben. Währenddessen wurden Fannie Mae (FNMA) und Freddie Mac (FHLMC) unter Druck gesetzt, diese Hypotheken in CDOs und CDSs zu unterzeichnen und neu zu verpacken. Als Kreditnehmer diese Kredite nicht zurückzahlten, waren die Banken an Kapitalreserven knapp und übertrugen diesen Chaos auf die neu verpackten Hypotheken, die sie verkauft hatten, und auf den Rest der Wirtschaft.\n\nDie Finanzkrise hatte ihren Ursprung im Jahr 1999 in der Ära Clinton, als der Präsident sich um eine zweite Amtszeit bemühte. Um seine Präsidentschaft zu verlängern, versuchte er, seine Popularität zu steigern. Um dies zu erreichen, lockerte die Clinton-Regierung die Kreditrichtlinien, was sieben Jahre später die Bühne für die Subprime-Krise ebnete. Steven Holmes vom New York Times berichtete 1999: „Fannie Mae, der größte Vermittler von Hypotheken in den USA, ist unter zunehmenden Druck der Clinton-Administration geraten, Hypotheken für Menschen mit niedrigem und mittlerem Einkommen zu vergeben, und spürte Druck von Aktionären, sein überragendes Gewinnwachstum aufrechtzuerhalten.“ Holmes würde später die Folgen dieser Maßnahmen korrekt vorhersagen: „Die staatlich geförderte Gesellschaft könnte in einer Wirtschaftskrise in Schwierigkeiten geraten und eine staatliche Rettung ähnlich wie in der Spar- und Darlehensindustrie in den 1980er Jahren erforderlich machen.“ Wie in der Einleitung und wie Holmes vorausgesehen wurde, würden unklug gewählte Kredite sicherlich zum Zusammenbruch der Wirtschaft führen.\n\nViele Faktoren trugen dazu bei, dass die Wirtschaft ins Stocken geriet, darunter die neue und komplexe Struktur von Hypotheken. Variable Zinssätze, hypothekenbasierte Wertpapiere und kolateralisierte Schuldenobligationen (CDOs) wurden in den Jahren vor der Krise häufig eingesetzt und trugen dazu bei, weitere Wirtschaftssektoren an den Immobilienmarkt zu knüpfen. Dies führte dazu, dass US-Haushalte und die Finanzmärkte im Allgemeinen in den Immobilienmarkt übergedehnt waren und extrem anfällig für selbst kleine Preisänderungen waren.\n\nIn der Tat platzte die Immobilienblase, und die Finanzinstitute, die diese hypothekenbasierten Wertpapiere gekauft hatten, wurden getroffen. Die fünf größten US-Investmentbanken berichteten insgesamt 4,1 Billionen Dollar an Hypothekenforderungen im Jahr 2007, was etwa 30% des BIP der USA ausmachte. Letztendlich wurden Bear Sterns und Merrill Lynch zu außergewöhnlich niedrigen Preisen verkauft, Lehman Brothers wurde aufgelöst und Goldman Sachs und Morgan Stanley wurden gezwungen, zu kommerziellen Banken zu werden, die strengen Regulierungen unterworfen waren. Fannie und Freddie hatten eine Hypothekenschuld von 5 Billionen Dollar und wurden im September 2008 unter staatliche Kontrolle gestellt.\n\n\n\n[REWRITE]\nIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis.

Im Film passiert die Exposition, wenn ein Charakter dem anderen eine Datenflut ala \"Das Lied des alten Seefahrers\" erzählt.  In der Fiktion erledigt es der Autor.\n\nEin Beispiel ist angebracht.  Wenn du eine Geschichte liest, wirst du erfahren, dass die Heldin ihren Geliebten an einem bestimmten Ort und zu einer bestimmten Zeit getroffen hat, dass sie in einer glamourösen Zeremonie geheiratet haben und dass ihr Ehemann vor ihren Augen ermordet wurde.  Du würdest nicht erwarten, dass diese ganze Sequenz zwei Seiten in Anspruch nimmt, in der Zeit, in der er und sie jeweils nur zwei Zeilen Dialog haben.  Du würdest erwarten, dass der Autor etwas Zeit mit der Charakterisierung des Ehemannes verbringt, indem er durch seine Sprache und sein Verhalten zeigt, wie tief er seine Frau liebt, und du würdest ebenso erwarten, dass die Heldin durch große und kleine Gesten zeigt, wie sehr sein Dasein in ihrem Leben sie verändert und bereichert hat (insbesondere wenn die Geschichte dir später höhnisch ausführt, dass dies der Fall war).  Eine angemessene Einführung in die Figur des Ehemanns würde es dir ermöglichen, sich mit seinem Schicksal emotional zu verbinden und würde dir Einblicke in die Persönlichkeit der Heldin geben: was sie an ihm sah, wie tief ihre Verbindung war, Hinweise auf ihre Gedanken, Überzeugungen und Träume, die sich durch die Linse seiner Augen widerspiegeln, und so weiter.  Du würdest seinen Tod mit ihr trauern und würdest so stärker mit der Heldin selbst verbunden sein.\n\nKurz gesagt, du würdest erwarten, dass es mehr gibt als den einfachen Knochen der Handlung: \"Sie trafen sich, sie heirateten, er starb.\"\n\nAls Autor musst du dieses Fleisch liefern.

The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",

Die Hauptgeschichte handelte von einem Mann aus Ashley, Ohio, der seine Frau erstochen hatte. Sein Name wurde genannt, aber der Name seiner Frau nicht. Sie zeigten sein Porträtfoto, und er sah aus wie pure Böswilligkeit. Sie widmeten dieser Geschichte nur etwa zwei Minuten, da sich die Ereignisse noch entwickelten. Die einzigen Details, die sie lieferten, waren, dass er sie mehrmals erstochen hatte und festgenommen worden war. Ich denke, sie haben für diese Geschichte eine angemessene Zeit aufgewendet.\n\nDie zweite Geschichte handelte von einer Schussverletzung von Travis Buyers, 18. Er wurde im Bereich Sharon Woods erschossen und schwer verletzt; es gab zu dieser Zeit keine Festnahmen oder Verdächtige. Das SWAT-Team untersuchte den Vorfall. Diese Geschichte schien kurz zu sein, und ich glaube, das lag daran, dass es sich um einen „schwarzen“ Mann oder eine schwarze Nachbarschaft handelte. Ich habe bemerkt (und das schon seit Jahren), dass Minderheiten übersehen werden, wenn sie Opfer eines Verbrechens werden. Wenn ein „weißer“ Kind oder Erwachsener entführt oder vermisst oder Opfer eines Verbrechens wird, geht die Medienwelt durch die Decke; aber wenn es sich um eine Person aus einer Minderheit handelt, hat es Glück, wenn es überhaupt erwähnt wird.\n\nDie nächste Geschichte handelte vom Schussloch, das in der Med-Flight-Hubschrauber gefunden worden war. Es wurden Details darüber gegeben, wo man glaubte, dass der Vorfall stattgefunden hatte. Es war festgestellt worden, dass es sich um eine .22-Kaliber-Kugeln aus einem Gewehr handelte, die den Hubschrauber getroffen hatte. Crime-Stoppers bieten für Hinweise, die zu der Festnahme des Schützen führen, eine fünftausend Dollar Belohnung an.\n\nDie nächste Geschichte handelte von dem Regen und dem Gewitter, das für Samstagnachmittag vorhergesagt wurde. Sie sagten, die Temperaturen würden an diesem Wochenende zwischen 25 und 29 Grad Celsius liegen. Die Länge der Berichterstattung war etwas kurz, aber sie wollten sie als „Teaser“ verwenden, damit Sie dranbleiben.\n\nSie berichteten auch über einen Überfall auf einen UDF in Clime Road in Columbus. Sie sagten, es sei ein dunkelhäutiger schwarzer Mann gewesen, der die Laden ausgeraubt hatte, er trug ein Kapuzenpullover. Sie sagten, er sei etwa 1,80 Meter groß und wiege etwa 70 Kilogramm. Ich fand, sie widmeten ungewöhnlich viel Zeit der Betonung dessen, dass er schwarz war und wie dunkel er war.\n\nEine weitere Geschichte handelte von Rene Rodriguez, einem verurteilten Drogenboss aus Texas. Er war wegen Verschwörung zum Absetzen großer Mengen Marihuana von Texas nach Ohio verurteilt worden. Eine merkwürdige Sache, die ich bemerkt habe, war, dass sie stattdessen von einer „300“-Monats- Haftstrafe sprachen, anstatt zu sagen, dass er zu 25 Jahren Gefängnis verurteilt wurde. Ich bin mir nicht sicher, was der Sinn dahinter war, ob sie glaubten, dass das härter klang oder was auch immer. Sie erwähnten auch, dass er ein hispanischer Mann sei, ich glaube nicht, dass das wirklich für die Geschichte relevant war.\n\n\n\n[REWRITE] I watched two newscasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was \"live\" was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \nThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a \"black\" man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a \"white\" child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \nThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \nThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a \"teaser\" so that you would stay tuned. \nThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was a dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \nAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story.

Innerhalb dieser Verbindung liegen viele Emotionen: Liebe, Stolz, Eifersucht und Grausamkeit, nur um einige zu nennen. Brüder verstehen einander, weit mehr als jeder andere mit dieser Art von Bindung, und sie können sich nur selbst sehen, wenn sie ihren Bruder betrachten. Es ist inmitten der schwierigsten Situation, wenn die wahre Natur dieser Bindung durchscheint, sei es gut oder böse. Wenn diese Emotionen klar werden, tragen sie eine hohe Last mit sich. Ein Teil des Verstehens der Emotionen, die aus dieser brüderlichen Verbindung geboren werden, liegt darin, mit den damit verbundenen Konsequenzen umzugehen. Wenn man einem Bruder in die Augen schauen kann und in dieser Person seinen eigenen Spiegel sieht, sieht man sich selbst nicht so, wie andere einen sehen, sondern so, wie man wirklich ist. In ihren Handlungen und den Konsequenzen dieser Handlungen liegt ihr wahrer Charakter. In „The Scarlet Ibis“ erkunden zwei Brüder dieses Thema und all die tobenden Emotionen, die es begleiten. Unter einem üppigen, lebhaft beschriebenen Landschaftsbild unternehmen diese beiden Jungen eine fruchtlose Reise. Bittere Enttäuschung kollidiert im Höhepunkt mit intensivem Stolz, und nur ein Bruder entkommt mit seinem Leben. Das Thema wird durch die direkte Charakterisierung des Protagonisten, Doodle, und ihre gegenseitigen Wechselwirkungen sowie durch den Standpunkt des Erzählers ausgedrückt, der die komplexen Gefühle des Protagonisten und seine Sichtweise auf die Welt um ihn herum vermittelt, beides sind starke Einflüsse auf seine Handlungen.\n\nDie Handlungen des Protagonisten lassen sich alle durch eine Schlüssel-Emotion zusammenfassen: Stolz. Von der Zeit, als er und sein kleiner Bruder, Doodle, zum ersten Mal zusammen ausgehen, bis zu ihrem letzten, schicksalhaften Ausflug, empfindet der Protagonist Groll gegenüber Doodle. Er hatte sich einen Bruder gewünscht, dem er all seine weltlichen Fähigkeiten beibringen konnte, wie “…atemhalten, rennen, springen oder die Lianen im alten Frauensumpf erklimmen…” Er wollte einen Bruder, der die Rolle eines “…jmd. mit dem man nach Horsehead Landing rennen und jemand, mit dem man sich in der oberen Gabel des großen Baumes hinter der Scheune setzen könnte…” ausfüllen konnte. Offensichtlich sind diese Dinge unmöglich, angesichts von Doodles Zustand. Doodle wurde mit einem extrem schwachen Herzen geboren, was es unwahrscheinlich machte, dass er überhaupt überleben würde. Selbst dann war es fast unmöglich, dass er jemals an kräftiger körperlicher Aktivität teilnehmen würde. Was für einen Schlag für den jungen Protagonisten, dessen Kopf voller wilder Fantasien war, all diese Träume in einem Moment zu zerbrechen. Tatsächlich zeigt er sogar einige Wut auf das kleine Kind, als er sich daran erinnert, überlegt zu haben, ihn mit einem Kissen zu ersticken. Welches Kind wäre in der Lage, über Kindermord nachzudenken? Aber sein Herz schmilzt, wenn das kleine Kind ihm lächelt. Ein so einfaches Handeln gab dem Protagonisten so viel Hoffnung! Das zeigt, dass seine Überzeugung wahrscheinlich nicht sehr stark war. Hinter seinem Hintergedanken hatte er eine instinktive Liebe zu seinem Bruder.\n\n\n\n[REWRITE] There is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond.

Mit dem technologischen Fortschritt von primitiv zu modern haben sich auch die Metaphern, die zum Beschreiben des Gehirns verwendet werden, weiterentwickelt. Anfangs wurde es mit einer Wachstafel, dann mit einem Papyrusblatt, dann mit einem Buch und zuletzt mit einem Computer verglichen. Denken Sie daran, dass die Nützlichkeit dieser Metaphern begrenzt ist und zu falschen Schlussfolgerungen führen kann, wenn Sie mehr über das Gehirn lernen.\n\nDie Informationsverarbeitung beginnt mit Eingaben von den Sinnesorganen, die physikalische Reize wie Berührung, Wärme, Schallwellen oder Lichtphotonen in elektrochemische Signale umwandeln. Die sensorischen Informationen werden von den Algorithmen des Gehirns sowohl nach oben als auch nach unten verarbeitet. Wenn Sie zum Beispiel ein Bild eines schwarzen Quadrats auf weißem Hintergrund betrachten, verarbeitet die nach oben gerichtete Verarbeitung einfache Informationen wie Farbe, Ausrichtung und die Grenzen des Objekts - wo sich die Farbe in einem kurzen Abstand deutlich ändert - um zu entscheiden, dass Sie ein Quadrat sehen. Die nach unten gerichtete Verarbeitung nutzt die Entscheidungen, die in einigen Schritten des nach oben gerichteten Prozesses getroffen wurden, um die Erkennung des Quadrats zu beschleunigen. Die nach unten gerichtete Verarbeitung in diesem Beispiel könnte Ihnen helfen, das Objekt als schwarzes Quadrat und nicht als quadratisches Loch auf dem weißen Hintergrund zu identifizieren.\n\nSobald Informationen zu einem bestimmten Grad verarbeitet wurden, entscheidet ein Aufmerksamkeitfilter, wie wichtig das Signal ist und welchen kognitiven Prozessen es zugänglich gemacht werden soll. Obwohl Ihr Gehirn bei einem Blick auf Ihre Schuhe jede einzelne Grashalme verarbeitet, verhindert ein gesundes Aufmerksamkeitssystem, dass Sie sie einzeln wahrnehmen. Im Gegensatz dazu könnten Sie Ihren Namen herausfiltern, selbst wenn er in einem lauten Raum gesprochen wird. Es gibt viele Verarbeitungsschritte, und die Ergebnisse der Verarbeitung werden wiederholt durch die Aufmerksamkeit moduliert.\n\nDamit das Gehirn Informationen verarbeiten kann, muss diese zuerst gespeichert werden. Es gibt verschiedene Arten des Gedächtnisses, darunter sensorisches, Arbeitsgedächtnis und Langzeitgedächtnis. Zuerst werden Informationen kodiert. Es gibt Arten der Kodierung, die spezifisch für jeden Typ von Sinnesreiz sind. Zum Beispiel kann sprachliche Eingabe strukturell kodiert werden, was sich auf das Aussehen des gedruckten Wortes beziehe, phonemisch, was sich auf den Klang des Wortes bezieht, oder semantisch, was sich auf die Bedeutung des Wortes bezieht. Sobald Informationen gespeichert sind, müssen sie gehalten werden. Einige Tierstudien deuten darauf hin, dass das Arbeitsgedächtnis, das Informationen für etwa 20 Sekunden speichert, durch ein elektrisches Signal, das für kurze Zeit durch eine bestimmte Reihe von Neuronen läuft, aufrechterhalten wird. Es wird vermutet, dass Informationen im Langzeitgedächtnis in der Struktur bestimmter Proteintypen gehalten werden.\n\nEs gibt zahlreiche Modelle darüber, wie das Wissen im Gehirn organisiert ist, einige basieren auf der Art und Weise, wie menschliche Probanden Erinnerungen abrufen, andere auf Informatik und wieder andere auf Neurophysiologie. Das semantische Netzwerkmodell besagt, dass es Knoten gibt, die Konzepte repräsentieren, und dass die Knoten basierend auf ihrer Verwandtschaft miteinander verknüpft sind. Zum Beispiel könnte \"Stuhl\" in einem semantischen Netzwerk mit \"Tisch\" verlinkt sein, das wiederum mit \"Holz\" verlinkt sein kann und so weiter.\n\n\n[REWRITE]\nThe human brain is a complex, creative information-processing system.

    "original": "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",

Die Bürger entpuppen sich als Bauern im größeren Spiel, gefangen in einer Ideologie, die vom World Controller diktiert wird. Unter dem Blickwinkel des marxistischen Theismus fällt im Werk auf, wie der Autor grundsätzliche Misstrauen gegenüber der Entwicklung der genannten Systeme hegt. Häufige Terminologie aus dem Marxismus, wie Homogenität und Reifikation, unterstreichen die Idee, dass Huxleys Roman ein Kommentar zu den Fehlern der sich damals entwickelnden Wirtschaft ist.\n\nDer Kapitalismus wird durch die marxistische These des falschen Bewusstseins satirisch dargestellt. Im Wesentlichen wird der gewöhnliche Bürger daran gehindert, die wahren Beziehungen zu anderen Klassen in wirtschaftlicher Hinsicht zu kennen, da er hauptsächlich an seinem eigenen Gewinn interessiert ist. Es wird als Ergebnis der ideologischen Kontrolle des Proletariats und der Arbeiterklasse angesehen, etwas, das durch die Konditionierung der Menschen in *Brave New World* ganz offensichtlich ist. Die unteren Klassen, Delta, Gamma usw., haben keinen wahren Willen; durch Hypnopädie wird der Drang zu konsumieren, auszugeben, sich zu ergötzen über alles andere verstärkt. Dies wird, wie bereits erwähnt, vom World Controller manipuliert. Hegemonie, also die Idee, dass Gruppen sozialer Klassen von einer separaten Gruppe von Individuen in ihrer Gesamtheit dominiert werden, wird in diesem Fall offensichtlich verwendet. Die unteren Klassen sind völlig unbedarft der Manipulation, sie kaufen buchstäblich in eine Ideologie ein, die diese Struktur unterstützt (d.h. Kapitalismus & Konsumismus). Die oberen Klassen werden mit der Fähigkeit geboren, dies zu erkennen, tun aber nichts; nur wenige Alphas oder Betas jenseits von Charakteren wie Bernard tun mehr, als ihre Position ebenfalls anzunehmen. Tatsächlich sind die Interaktionen der sozialen Klassen, wie später ausführlicher besprochen werden, deutliche Hinweise auf die wahrgenommene Unterdrückung des Kapitalismus.\n\nBeziehungen zwischen verschiedenen Individuen existieren in *Brave New World* nicht. Der Roman scheint die Charaktere nicht unterscheiden zu wollen - sie sind, sogar unter den Hauptcharakteren, an Tiefe arm. Vielleicht möchte Huxley damit andeuten, dass der Aufstieg von Technologie und Kapitalismus den Menschen ihren freien Willen und ihre Ausdrucksfähigkeit berauben. Liebe existiert nicht, ebenso wenig wie extreme Emotionen; stattdessen werden die Interaktionen oberflächlich gehalten, deutlich durch die Bemerkungen der Männer über Frauen, die sich hauptsächlich auf ihr Aussehen beziehen (z. B. pneumatische Qualität) und die unerschrockenen Kommentare der Frauen über ihre Begegnungen, sozusagen, dargestellt. Darüber hinaus zeigt die Gleichgültigkeit jeder sozialen Klasse gegenüber ihrer Stellung in der Hierarchie die sozioökonomische Wirkung des Kapitalismus. Ihre absolute Gehorsam gegenüber ihrer Rolle in der Gemeinschaft ist ein Hinweis auf den marxistischen Gedanken über das Proletariat, das fälschlicherweise davon überzeugt wird, über alles andere überlegen zu sein, solange es konsumiert, gehorcht und in Reihe mit den anderen in der Gemeinschaft bleibt. \n\n\n\n[REWRITE]\nAldous Huxley criticizes the looming threat of both technology and the capitalist structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel *Brave New World*. Its people value community above the individual and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work through the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the author's underlying suspicions regarding the development of the aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeneity and reification, among others, reinforces the idea that Huxley's novel is a commentary on the flaws in the emerging economy of his time.\n\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in *Brave New World*. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else. This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller. Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally 'buying into an ideology that supports that structure' (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place. In fact, the interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\n\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in *Brave New World*.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through the males remarks about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’ unashamed comments about their encounters, so to speak. Furthermore, each societal class' complacency with their status in the hierarchy indicates the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely assured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers. \n[/REWRITE]\n\n\n\n",

    "raw_output": "## German Translation:\n\nIch bin jetzt seit ungefähr zwei und einem halben Jahr, also vier und einem halben Semestern, Student an der University Park. Für viele, auch für mich selbst, kann es ein Problem sein, sich auf dem Campus zu bewegen. Im ersten Jahr war ich in einem Studentenwohnheim in East Halls untergebracht; fast der östlichste Punkt des Campus, wenn man das Stadion und das Bryce Jordan Center nicht mitzählt. Die Reise von meinem Zuhause im Stuart Hall zu Vorlesungen in so fernen Orten wie dem Willard-Gebäude, in der Nähe des Campuszentrums, konnte zu Fuß bis zu 25 Minuten dauern, besonders wenn das Wetter schlecht war, was in State College oft der Fall ist. Von einem Absolventen, der nicht viel älter ist als ich, erfuhr ich, dass die East Halls-Studentenwohnheime vor nicht allzu langer Zeit durch große, brachliegende Flächen von der restlichen Schule getrennt waren. Heute ist dieser leere Raum mit Sportfeldern, neuen, großen Gebäuden, einschließlich der neuen Molkerei und des neuen Gesundheitszentrums, gefüllt und von Wohnungen umgeben. Da sich unser Campus weiter ausdehnt, wird es immer schwieriger, von einem Ort zum anderen zu gelangen. Was ist die beste Lösung für das Problem der Mobilität? Auf einem Universitätscampus ist es das Fahrrad. Aber das Fahrrad allein löst keine Probleme. Studenten müssen sie benutzen, und der Campus muss an die Bedürfnisse von Radfahrern angepasst werden.\n\nIch sprach mit einem Freund, der erst kürzlich nach einer mehrmonatigen Pause wieder mit dem Rad gefahren ist. Er erwähnte, dass er sich fragte, warum er jemals aufgehört hatte. \"Fahrradtouren sind großartig\", sagte er, \"vor ein paar Jahren war es nicht cool, Fahrrad zu fahren, aber es ist der einzige Weg, um sich fortzubewegen.\" Neben der Tatsache, dass Radfahren gut für den Körper ist, ist es der effizienteste Weg, um sich fortzubewegen. Eine Schüssel Haferflocken und ein bisschen körperliche Anstrengung bringen dich 30 Meilen oder mehr weit. Wie viele Studenten lebe ich jetzt außerhalb des Campus; genauso weit vom Campuszentrum entfernt wie einige Studentenwohnheime. Die klügste Entscheidung, die ich dieses Jahr getroffen habe, war es, mir ein Fahrrad zu kaufen. Jeden Tag habe ich Unterricht im Thomas-Gebäude, das mindestens eine Viertelstunde zu Fuß von meinem Zuhause entfernt ist. Mit dem Fahrrad kann ich die Reise auf 5 Minuten verkürzen, wenn ich schnell genug fahre. Das einzige Problem ist, dass Pollock Road die direkteste Strecke zum Thomas-Gebäude von meinem Haus ist, und es ist nicht immer eine einfache Straße, egal ob man mit dem Fahrrad fährt oder zu Fuß. Es gibt auch Argumente für das Gehen, aber persönlich bin ich zu beschäftigt, um zu Fuß zu gehen. Ohne mein Fahrrad wäre das Gehen meine einzige zuverlässige Option, um zum Unterricht zu gelangen. Täglich zu Fuß nach Thomas zu gehen, würde mir jeden Tag weitere 30-40 Minuten stehlen. Das sind mehr als zwei und eine halbe Stunden jede Woche. Dazu kommt die Zeit, die ich für die Wege zu und von anderen Vorlesungen, Terminen und so weiter aufwenden müsste. Das ist mehr Zeit, als ich mir leisten kann.\n\n\n\n## Rewritten English:\n\n[REWRITE]I have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years, or four and a half semesters.
