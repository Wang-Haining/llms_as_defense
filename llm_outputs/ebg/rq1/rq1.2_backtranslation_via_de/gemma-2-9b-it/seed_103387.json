The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness.

The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",

Die folgende Übersicht über Schlaflosigkeit untersucht diese Modelle und erläutert jedes ausgewählte Forschungsstück, um sie in Beziehung zu setzen und die Modelle besser zu erklären. Die Erläuterungen zu den Forschungsarbeiten und ihren Ergebnissen werden dann kritisch hinterfragt, um ihre spezifischen Stärken und Schwächen zu erwähnen.\n\nEine Schlafstörung kann als primäre Schlafstörung, Schlafstörung im Zusammenhang mit einer anderen psychischen Störung oder Schlafstörung im Zusammenhang mit anderen Problemen charakterisiert werden. Die primären Schlafstörungen sind Dyssomnias oder Parasomnias, während Schlafstörungen im Zusammenhang mit einer anderen psychischen Störung mit einer Störung der Achse I oder Achse II zusammenhängen. Andere Kategorien von Schlafstörungen können auf medizinische Komplikationen oder den Konsum einer Substanz zurückzuführen sein. Die Dyssomnias sind: Primäre Insomnia, Primäre Hypersomnie, Narcolepsie, Atemwegbedingte Schlafstörung, zirkadiane Rhythmusstörung und Dyssomnie, nicht anders klassifiziert (NOS). Während die primäre Insomnia eine Komplikation bei ausreichender oder erhaltener Schlaf ist, ist die primäre Hypersomnie eine Schwierigkeit, wach zu bleiben, sowohl für mindestens einen Monat. Narcolepsie beinhaltet Kataplexie und/oder automatisches REM. Während sich Dyssomnias auf die Einleitung und Aufrechterhaltung des Schlafs konzentrieren, sind die Parasomnias Schlafstörungen, die mit Verhaltensabweichungen und/oder physiologischen Ereignissen verbunden sind. Parasomnias sind Albtraumstörung, Schlafterrorstörung, Schlafwandeln und Parasomnias, nicht anders klassifiziert. Schlafstörungen, die mit einer anderen psychischen Störung zusammenhängen, betreffen Schlafprobleme aufgrund von Achse I (klinische Störungen) oder Achse II (Persönlichkeitsstörungen oder geistige Behinderung).

Neuronen im Hypothalamus, die Orexin enthalten, sind für die Regulierung von Schlaf und Wachheit verantwortlich.

Die Aktivierung des GABAA-Rezeptors induziert Antworten, die den Schlaf fördern. Wenn es verhindert wird, dass es feuert, kann dies zu einer Reduzierung der Angstzustände und der Induktion des Schlafs führen. Das GABAB-Agonist (Baclofen) erhöhte die Schlafdauer (Matsuki et al., 2009). Solche Ergebnisse legen nahe, dass die Tiermodelle der Mäuse auf Studien an Menschen übertragen werden können. Dies zeigt, dass es sowohl eine genetische als auch eine Umweltbasis für den physikalischen GABAB-Rezeptor beim Menschen gibt. Ein Problem oder ein Fehlen dieses Rezeptors könnte die Fähigkeit eines Menschen beeinträchtigen, ohne Medikamente ausreichend zu schlafen. Die soziokulturelle Implikation dieser Studie ist, dass der Phänotyp vererbt werden könnte, was den Schlaf regulieren würde, und eine Veränderung des Rezeptors würde den Schlaf eines Einzelnen natürlich stören.

Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder.

Anschließend wird die Diagnose erläutert, inklusive häufige Merkmale oder „Alarmsignale“. Abschließend fasst das Papier die Möglichkeiten zusammen, wie ein Lehrer in einer inklusiven Klassengemeinschaft einem Schüler mit CAPD helfen kann.\n\n\tZentrale Hörverarbeitungsstörung (CAPD) oder Hörverarbeitungsstörung (HVS) „bezieht sich auf die Effizienz und Wirksamkeit, mit der das zentrale Nervensystem (ZNS) auditorische Informationen nutzt. Eng definiert, bezieht sich (C)APD auf die Wahrnehmung und Verarbeitung auditorischer Informationen im ZNS und die neurobiologischen Aktivitäten, die dieser Verarbeitung zugrunde liegen und zu elektrophysiologischen auditorischen Potentialen führen“ (Amerikanische Gesellschaft für Sprach- und Hörtherapie, 2005), was bedeutet, dass es sich um eine Störung handelt, bei der das zentrale Nervensystem (d.h. das Gehirn) Dinge, die gehört werden, nicht richtig verarbeiten kann. Menschen mit CAPD hören normal und werden daher nicht als „høreinschränkt“ betrachtet; stattdessen funktioniert der Bereich des Gehirns, der das Interpretieren dessen, was wir hören, steuert, indem er Wörter trennt oder Konversation von Hintergrundgeräuschen unterscheidet, nicht so wie es normalerweise sollte.\n\n\tDie früheste Erwähnung der Störung, die zu CAPD wurde, stammt aus der Mitte der 1950er Jahre und hieß „auditive Imperzeption“ (Amerikanische Gesellschaft für Sprach- und Hörtherapie, 2005), als Forscher Kinder mit kommunikativen Störungen untersuchten. Das italienische Forschungsteam von Bocca, Calearo und Cassinari begann 1954 mit der Entwicklung von Tests für diese Kinder; 1961 führte Kimura „ditchotische Tests ein und formulierte ein Modell, das die Physiologie des CANS erklärt, die ditchotischen Wahrnehmung zugrunde liegt“ (Amerikanische Gesellschaft für Sprach- und Hörtherapie, 2005). 1977 fand eine nationale Konferenz statt, die die Forschung an Kindern mit CAPD anregte.\n\n\tCAPD zeigt sich in vielfältiger Weise: Die betroffene Person kann möglicherweise den Ort oder den Klang im Raum nicht lokalisieren; Schwierigkeiten haben, zwischen zwei oder mehr „akustischen Ereignissen“ (Klängen) zu unterscheiden; kann nicht die Lautmuster erkennen; kann nicht die Änderungen in der Sprache unterscheiden (z.B. Sarkasmus basierend auf Änderungen in der Stimme erkennen); ein Klang kann von einem nachfolgenden Klang blockiert werden; kann die Fähigkeit, akustische Hinweise zu synthetisieren (d.h. in einer sinnvollen Weise zu interpretieren, auf die dann reagiert werden kann), nicht haben; und kann nicht die Reihenfolge bestimmen, in der auditorische Informationen präsentiert werden (Ferre).\n\n\tZur Diagnose von CAPD muss der Patient mit „systematischer Beobachtung des Hörverhaltens und/oder Leistung auf Tests der Hörfunktion“ untersucht werden, die von „Audiologen, Sprachtherapeuten, Psychologen und anderen mithilfe verschiedener Maßnahmen durchgeführt werden können, die hörnbezogene Fähigkeiten bewerten“ (Amerikanische Gesellschaft für Sprach- und Hörtherapie, 2005). Dazu können Fragebögen und Umfragen, die Beobachtung von Hörverhalten, einschließlich der Reaktion des Patienten auf bestimmte Reize gehören. Es gibt derzeit kein einzelnes Instrument oder Test, der mit hoher diagnostischer Erfolgsrate verwendet wird, und es ist keine bekannte Ursache für die Störung bekannt. Viele verwendete Tests präsentieren dem Patienten mehrere, gleichzeitige auditorische Reize und bitten ihn dann, bestimmte Elemente wie eine Reihe von Wörtern oder Zahlen zu unterscheiden. Fortgeschrittene Tests umfassen die Aufzeichnung akustischer Signale im Ohr und die Messung der Reaktionen auf die Signale.\n\n\n\n[REWRITE] This paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD).

The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura \"introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more \"acoustic events\" (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\nIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with \"systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function\", which may be conducted by \"audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals.",

Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them.

Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers.

    "raw_output": "## German Translation:\n\nDie Komödie \"Twelfth Night\" scheint zu sagen, dass obwohl Verkleidung tatsächlich nützlich ist, um lange Zeit Täuschung zu betreiben, eine Person am Ende diese neu gebildete Gestalt ablehnen muss, um sonst Gefahr zu laufen, sich in diesem Prozess für immer zu verlieren. Ein großes Problem mit dem Beenden einer Täuschung ist jedoch, dass man sich dabei entfremdet fühlen kann. Daher muss man am Ende zwischen der eigenen Selbstbewahrung und der Erhaltung der Beziehungen zu den Menschen in seiner Umgebung wählen. Denn obwohl einige neutral reagieren, wenn sie feststellen, dass sie getäuscht wurden, werden andere die Täuschung nicht so leicht nehmen und werden wahrscheinlich von der ganzen Farce beleidigt sein.\n\nDas Thema der Täuschung bei der Rollenumkehr ist besonders problematisch, weil es viele Nebenthemen aufwirft, das wichtigste davon ist vielleicht: Warum? Warum fühlt sich die betroffene Person dazu genötigt, ihre eigene Identität zu meiden und eine Verkleidung in Form des anderen Geschlechts anzunehmen? In Violas Fall ist es offensichtlich eine Form des Selbstschutzes: „Ich bringe dich zu einem Hauptmann in dieser Stadt/ Wo meine Jungferndüfte liegen, durch deren sanfte Hilfe/ Ich bewahrt wurde, um diesen edlen Grafen zu dienen …“ (5.1.247-249)\n\nAls Neuankömmling in einem fremden Land fühlt sich Viola gezwungen, sich als Mann zu verkleiden, um sich vor möglichen Angreifern zu schützen. Violas Plan funktioniert, aber er entfremdet sie auch von den Frauen um sie herum und trennt sie von einem wichtigen Stützsystem. Um die Situation noch zu verschlimmern, scheint sie so überzeugend als Mann aufzutreten, dass Olivia sie mit Sebastian verwechselt und in der Tat sich in sie verliebt: „Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.“ (5.1.138) Darüber hinaus muss sie auch mit unterdrückten romantischen Gefühlen zwischen ihr und Orsino fertig werden: „Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.“ (5.1. 260-261)\n\nObwohl dies vielleicht eine etwas progressive Einstellung ist, kann \"Twelfth Night\" für den modernen Leser als Illustration dafür dienen, wie Täuschung dazu beitragen kann, unterdrückte Emotionen aufzudecken, insbesondere in den Fällen von Olivia und Orsino. Bestimmte Passagen scheinen darauf hinzudeuten, dass die genannten Charaktere möglicherweise ungesagte unterbewusste Wünsche haben, die das Auftreten von Viola/Cesario sie dazu zwingen, damit umzugehen. Zum Beispiel ist Olivia auf Cesario attraktiv, weil Cesario wie ein Mann aussieht, oder verbirgt Olivia wirklich heimlich Gefühle für Frauen? Man könnte argumentieren, dass dies wahrscheinlich nicht der Fall ist, weil Shakespeares Figur Olivia eher die Menschen seiner Zeit parodierte, die andere nur nach ihrem Aussehen beurteilen. \nDies wird durch die Leichtigkeit, mit der Olivia ihre romantischen Leidenschaft von Cesario zu Sebastian wechselt und Cesario/Viola als Familie betrachtet, statt als Liebesinteresse, deutlich: „A sister, you are she.“ (5.1.315)\n\n## Rewritten English:\n\n[REWRITE] The play \"Twelfth Night\" seems to suggest that while disguise can be useful in perpetuating long periods of deception, a person must ultimately reject that newly formed persona or risk losing themselves in the process.

Natürlich lässt sich ein ganzes Kolonialreich wie dieses durch eine so einfache Beschreibung nicht erklären. Das deutsche Kolonialreich war ebenso vielfältig in seinen politischen Einstellungen und Regierenstilen wie in seiner Geographie. Die Bildungsangebote in den Kolonien waren ebenfalls unterschiedlich. Als die Briten 1919 Deutsch-Ostafrika (Tanganjika) eroberten, fanden sie eine große Bevölkerung von gebildeten und lesenden Afrikanern vor. Die deutschen Bildungsaktivitäten in Kamerun und anderen Kolonien wurden auch von zeitgenössischen Autoren gelobt.\n\nDie Situation in Südwestafrika (heute Namibia) stellte einen krassen Kontrast dar. Im Gegensatz zu Ostafrika, wo die Regierung staatliche Schulen errichtete und eine herausragende Rolle bei der Bildung der Einheimischen spielte, wurde die Aufgabe der Bildung der Einheimischen in Südwestafrika fast ausschließlich an Missionsgesellschaften übertragen, die nur begrenzte staatliche Unterstützung erhielten. Die Regierung investierte jedoch erhebliche Ressourcen in die Bildung von Europäern in der Kolonie und richtete ein System von staatlichen Schulen ein sowie unterstützte und regelte kirchliche Schulen stärker. Diese Bildungspolitik hatte langfristige Auswirkungen auf Südwestafrika, auch nach dem Ende der deutschen Herrschaft. Während andere deutsche Kolonien mit einer bedeutenden Zahl von gebildeten und gebildeten Afrikanern aufwarten konnten, blieb in Südwestafrika \"die überwältigende Mehrheit der Bevölkerung unberührt, ungebildet und analphabetisch\". Verschiedene soziale, politische und wirtschaftliche Faktoren führten zu den unterschiedlichen Erfahrungen in Südwestafrika. Diese Arbeit zielt darauf ab, die Diskussion durch die Identifizierung dieser Faktoren zu erweitern und besondere Aufmerksamkeit auf neue Forschungsergebnisse über die Einstellungen der Siedler und Kolonialbehörden gegenüber den einheimischen Afrikanern zu richten.\n\nEs gibt eine Fülle von Literatur, die sich mit der Bildung im deutschen Kolonialreich befasst. Die meisten dieser Quellen sind auf Deutsch und wurden im frühen 20. Jahrhundert, während oder kurz nach der deutschen Kolonialherrschaft, verfasst. Ziel der frühen Arbeiten war es hauptsächlich, die Merkmale der Bildungssysteme in diesen Kolonien zu beschreiben. Spätere englischsprachige Schriften erweiterten den Diskurs durch vergleichende Studien zum Bildungssystem in den verschiedenen deutschen Kolonien und detailliertere Analysen bestimmter Aspekte der Bildung. Diese Studien zeigten erhebliche Unterschiede in den Bildungssystemen der verschiedenen Kolonien auf. Die wichtigste Arbeit, die sich explizit mit dem Thema dieser Arbeit befasst, ist Cohens Studie über die Bildung in Südwestafrika und Ostafrika. Cohen vergleicht die Bildungssysteme der beiden Kolonien und diskutiert die Faktoren, die die Unterschiede zwischen ihnen erklären. Laut Cohen erklärt die große Zahl der Siedler in Südwestafrika viele der charakteristischen Merkmale des Bildungssystems der Kolonie.\n\nIm Vergleich zu den anderen kolonialen Besitztümern Deutschlands hatte Südwestafrika ein mäßig gemäßigtes Klima, obwohl ein Großteil des Territoriums von aridem Wüstengebiet bedeckt ist. Die europäische Bevölkerung Südwestafrikas spiegelte die relativ milden Bedingungen wider.

    "raw_output": "## German Translation:\n\nDie Klassifizierung der Popmusik hat sich in den vergangenen 100 Jahren so stark entwickelt, dass es schwierig ist, alle Genres definitiv aufzulisten. Die Sache wird durch die Tatsache kompliziert, dass die meisten, wenn nicht sogar alle Genres – Rap, Rock, Country, Jazz, Folk, um nur einige zu nennen – innerhalb ihres Bereichs mehrere Unter- und Unteruntergenres hervorgebracht haben.  Das Subgenre Heavy Metal Rock ist in den letzten 40 Jahren zu einem der vielfältigsten und ausdrucksstärksten Genres aller Popmusik geworden. Es ist ausdrucksstark, weil es eine breite Palette von Emotionen zeigt, wenn auch eher auf der dunkleren Seite des Spektrums. Es ist vielfältig, weil die Menschen schon bald nach Beginn des Genres erkannten, dass es eine echte Flexibilität hatte, und diese nutzten, um ihre eigenen Subgenres zu kreieren, denen wiederum Unteruntergenres folgten, und die Kette setzt sich bis heute fort.\n\nHeute haben wir einen Punkt in der Heavy-Metal-Bewegung erreicht, an dem es so viele Nischen von Gruppen gibt, dass es schwer zu bestimmen ist, was genau Heavy Metal ist. Es hat so viele Themen aus anderen Genres integriert, aber wie alles andere hat es irgendwo seinen Ursprung. Um die heute allgegenwärtige Metalmusik richtig zu verstehen, muss man zunächst verstehen, was die Metal-Bewegung ist und warum sie eine Bewegung und nicht nur ein Genre ist.\n\nMetal ist in vielerlei Hinsicht eine Bewegung, die von Dunkelheit geprägt ist. Metal kann als „Musik des Mehrs“ betrachtet werden – mehr Bass, mehr Lautstärke, mehr Gewalt, mehr Theatralik. Weniger Primitivismus, mehr Virtuosität; die Musiker in Metalbands beherrschen wirklich ihr Instrument, und das kommt in der Musik durch. Metal ist auch – und das mag nicht überraschend sein – eine Bewegung, die stark von Drogen beeinflusst ist. Es gab einen Boom an psychedelischen Drogen in den späten 1970er Jahren, der dazu führte, dass die Menschen verrückter wurden und damit verrückte, außerirdische Platten produzierten, wobei die Drogen als Sündenbock für ihre Kreation dienten. Es besitzt viele dunkle, viszerale Eigenschaften, was in der Musikszene sehr neu war, da ein Großteil der populären Musik Eigenschaften hatte, die nicht der dunkleren Seite des emotionalen Spektrums entsprachen. Auch spätere Generationen des Metalls haben sich von den dunklen, viszeralen Qualitäten, die in der Romantik so präsent waren, beeinflussen lassen. Texte wie der folgende drücken die Dunkelheit aus, die so ein Grundpfeiler der Bewegung ist: (Byrne)\n\nDie Zeilen aus „Helter Skelter“ zeigen die dunkle Seite der Beatles. Es zeigt einen auf und ab, angeblich von Drogen. Dieses Lied gilt von manchen als eines der ersten Heavy-Metal-Lieder. Es war eine Reaktion auf ein Rolling Stones-Lied, das ebenfalls auf der schweren, dunkleren Seite lag. Die Beatles wollten beweisen, dass sie genauso schwer wie die Stones sein konnten, also legten sie dieses Lied auf „The White Album“.\n\n\n## Rewritten English:\n\n[REWRITE]\nThe classification of popular music has grown over the past 100 years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all.

    "transformed": "The classification of popular music has grown over the past 100 years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters, most if not all genres—rap, rock, country, jazz, folk, just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain. Arguably, the subgenre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past 40 years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions, although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre, people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own subgenres, which then were followed by sub-subgenres, and the chain continues until today.\n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres, but like everything else, it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today, one must first understand what the metal movement is, and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\nMetal is, in many ways, a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a “music of more”—more bass, more volume, more violence, more theatricality. Less primitivism, more chops; people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument, and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug-induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70s that led to people getting crazier, leading to them to make crazy, other-worldly records, using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark, visceral qualities, which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also, later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark, visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era.

Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47).

    "raw_output": "Here is the German translation and subsequent retranslation to English:\n\n**German Translation:**\n\nEinige Jahrzehnte bevor die Surrealisten mit ihren traumhaften Gemälden begannen, schuf der Künstler Henri Rousseau ganz genau seine eigenen Träume, wörtlich wie bildlich. „Der Traum“, ein Gemälde aus dem Jahr 1910 des berühmten postimpressionistischen Künstlers, stellt nicht nur eine Frau dar, die vor den Wundern des Landes staunt, das sie in einem Traum besucht, sondern auch Rousseaus eigene persönlichen Träume und Ziele als Maler. Seit Beginn seiner Arbeit träumte er von Anerkennung, Akzeptanz und Lob von anderen Künstlern und Kunstliebhabern und fand heraus, dass er mit einem schwierigen inneren Dilemma konfrontiert war, um dieses Streben zu verwirklichen. „Der Traum“ ist das Werk von Henri Rousseau, das seinen lebenslangen inneren Kampf am besten widerspiegelt: entweder sich bestimmten Maltechniken anpassen oder nachahmen, um von der kritischen Kunstwelt, die er so verehrte, akzeptiert zu werden, oder sich seiner kreativen Unabhängigkeit und Einzigartigkeit hingeben und seinen eigenen Weg gehen.\n\nBevor man „Der Traum“ aus dieser Perspektive analysieren kann, muss man zunächst etwas mit Rousseaus biographischer Geschichte vertraut sein. Henri Rousseau wurde am 21. Mai 1844 in der Stadt Laval im Nordwesten Frankreichs geboren. Sein Vater war ein Blechschlosser und Eisenwarenhändler, der „bürgerlichen Wohlstand“ genoss (Shattuck 47). In seiner Kindheit erhielt er keine formale Ausbildung in den Künsten; stattdessen war er bis zum Alter von vierzig Jahren als gabelou, Angestellter des kommunalen Mautdienstes, für Frankreich tätig, obwohl er den irreführenden Spitznamen Douanier, ein Zollinspektor, erhielt (Shattuck 46). Der Tod seiner ersten Frau, Clémence, der auf den Tod von acht früh gestorbenen Kindern folgte, hinterließ Rousseau mit einem Kind, seiner Tochter Julia, und immensem Trauer (Shattuck 49). Er hoffte daher, in einem neuen Leben Zuflucht zu finden und Malerei zu ergreifen, um ihm Trost und neue Anfänge zu bieten. Im Gegensatz zu zeitgenössischen Kollegen Rousseaus, die den Bauern in der Malerei sentimentalisieren und romantisieren, ist er im Wesentlichen ein Volksschriftsteller und teilt die Hoffnungen und Träume des durchschnittlichen Mitglieds seiner Klasse.\n\nRousseaus Besessenheit von der Akzeptanz durch die Kunstwelt ist in diesem Kontext irgendwie verständlich: wie bereits erwähnt, war er nicht nur in den formalen Kunstrichtungen unerfahren und begann seine Karriere in einem fortgeschrittenen Alter, sondern er produzierte Werke gleichzeitig mit vielen anderen talentierten und bekannteren modernen Künstlern. Obwohl Rousseau bereits viele Jahre arbeitete, erhielt er erst gegen die Zeit, als Matisse sich als Künstler einen Namen machte, die richtige Anerkennung für seine Kunst. Im Buch „Moderne französische Maler“ behauptet der Autor Jan Gordon, dass die beiden, obwohl sie technisch gesehen Konkurrenten in der Kunstszene waren, sich nicht nur in Stil und Thema, sondern auch in ihren Gründen für das Malen unterschieden: „Matisse war ein Maler, der eine Furcht vor dem Malen auf banale Weise hatte, während Rousseaus Wunsch war, ein so konventionelles Bild zu malen, dass er in den „Artiste Français“ aufgenommen würde“ (92).\n\n\n\n**[REWRITE]\n**\nA few decades before the Surrealists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively.

Ich glaube, dass es auf fundamentaler Ebene einen Grund dafür gibt. Wie John Keats in seiner \"Ode an einen griechischen Vasen\" sagt: \"Schönheit ist Wahrheit, Wahrheit Schönheit - Das ist alles / Was ihr auf Erden wisst und alles, was ihr wissen müsst.\" Ein Großteil dessen, was wir im Leben lernen, erwirbt man durch Bildung oder Erfahrung. Wir schätzen Ethik und Ästhetik jedoch, wie Keats andeutet, ohne auf diese erwarteten Weise unterrichtet zu werden. Sowohl Ethik als auch Ästhetik sind ein Versuch, zu beschreiben anstatt vorzuschreiben. Unsere Studien über Moral und Schönheit sind zum größten Teil Versuche, zu erklären, warum ein Kunstwerk oder ein literarisches Werk schön ist oder warum eine Handlung moralisch ist, anstatt eine Reihe von Regeln für die Beurteilung oder Kreation guter Kunst oder moralisches Verhalten. \n\nDarüber hinaus ist die Kritik an Kunst oder Moral niemals in der Lage, die Essenz dessen, was gut ist oder was schön ist, vollständig einzufangen. Ein Gespräch über den Wert von Leonardo da Vincis Mona Lisa zum Beispiel, könnte sich um Begriffe wie Vordergrund, Hintergrund, Kontrast oder kulturellen Kontext drehen, aber letztendlich beschreiben diese nicht, warum es gute Kunst ist. Wenn man nach seinem Lieblingskunstwerk oder -literaturwerk gefragt wird, hört man häufig den Satz \"Es liegt einfach etwas daran\" vor einer komplexeren oder kritischen Erklärung. Ich glaube, dass sowohl Kunst als auch Moral nie vollständig auf eine Beschreibung ihrer Eigenschaften reduziert werden können. Wie Flannery O'Connor sagt: \"Eine Geschichte ist eine Art, etwas auszudrücken, was nicht anders ausgedrückt werden kann ... man erzählt eine Geschichte, weil eine Aussage unzureichend wäre.\" Egal wie vollständig wir die Eigenschaften eines literarischen Werkes beschreiben, es bleibt etwas Transzendentes übrig. Ich glaube, dass die Ethik dieses gleiche Eigenschaft besitzt. Wie Wittgenstein sagt: \"Es ist klar, dass Ethik nicht ausgedrückt werden kann. / Ethik ist transzendent. / Ich schlage vor, dass es dieses \"Etwas\", dieses Je ne sais quoi, ist, das das stärkste Attribut von Kunst und Moral ist, und dass diese transzendente Natur von Ethik und Ästhetik einen Verbindungspunkt zwischen ihnen bildet.\n\nIch glaube, dass Moral und Kunst so eng miteinander verwandt sind, weil wir beide auf einer noumenalen Ebene, um einen kantianschen Begriff zu verwenden, am stärksten erleben. Sie wirken auf uns an einer Ebene ein, die erlebt, aber nicht vollständig erklärt werden kann. Diese Verbindung ist beim literarischen Kunst besonders stark. Wie McKean sagt: \"Was Literatur von den anderen Künsten am meisten unterscheidet, was in Wahrheit einzigartig an der Kunst ist, ist ihre moralische Qualität. Es kann sein, dass moralische Normen für andere Kunstformen, wie beispielsweise Musik, unangemessen sind, aber sie scheinen für Literatur genauso relevant zu sein wie für das Leben selbst.

With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",

Angesichts dieser einzigartigen Kultur ist es nicht überraschend, dass Deutschland, wie wir es heute kennen, aus verschiedenen Quellen und Stämmen stammt.\n\nGermania ist das Urland der Germanen. Die Herkunft des Namens ist unter Historikern und Gelehrten stark umstritten. Tacitus behauptete, der Name stamme von einem germanischen Stamm ab, der damals als Tungri bekannt war, und dass sie zuvor als Germanen bekannt waren, bevor sie den Rhein überquerten und die gallischen Truppen bekämpften (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar verwendete den Begriff „Germanus“ erstmals in seinem Kommentar zu den gallischen Kriegen, in dem er die Gallier unterwarf und mit germanischen Stämmen kämpfte, die häufig unter hinterhältigen Vorwänden den Rhein überquerten. Er übernahm dieses Wort von den Galliern selbst, um die zwischen den von ihm eroberten (den Galliern) und denen, die er nicht erobert hatte, zu unterscheiden.  Obwohl die Herkunft ungewiss ist, glauben einige, dass es sich auf einen Nachbarn in der gallischen Sprache bezog. Im ersten Kapitel seines ersten Buches über diese Kriege schreibt Julius Caesar: „Die Germanen, die jenseits des Rheins leben, mit denen sie (die Gallier) ständig Krieg führen.....Sie kämpfen mit den Germanen in fast täglichen Schlachten.“ (Julius Caesar, 50-40 v. Chr.) Andere behaupten, dass die Bedeutung von der Speer stammt, den sie im Krieg verwendeten, bekannt als Ger (O.E.D, 2010), oder vielleicht vom alten irischen Wort \"garim\" für \"brüllen\", was darauf hindeutet, dass die Germanen laut oder lautstark waren. (Namen Deutschlands)\n\nDer frühe römische Historiker Tacitus beschrieb in seinem Werk „De Origine et situ Germanorum“ aus dem Jahr 98 n. Chr., das von den Ursprüngen der Germanen sprach, dass „ich sie (die Germanen) als ursprungsbegründet betrachten und nicht mit anderen Rassen durch Einwanderung oder Verkehr vermischt haben würde. Denn früher kamen diejenigen, die auswandern wollten, nicht zu Lande, sondern auf Schiffen an.......Wer würde aus Asien oder Afrika nach Italien oder nach Deutschland mit seinen wilden Landschaften, seinen unbeständigen Himmel, seinen düsteren Sitten und seinem gespenstischen Antlitz ziehen, es sei denn, es wäre seine Heimat?“ (Tacitus, 98)\n\nUnd wer würde Rom für Germania verlassen? Bestimmt nicht die Römer, nicht noch nicht. Sie würden ihre Eroberungen in die Länder Germanias schicken, um Waren zu erwerben und gelegentlich Landkampagnen führen, aber letztendlich kehrten sie hauptsächlich in ihr weitläufiges Reich zurück. \n\nSo lebten die germanischen Stämme, als sie im ersten Jahrhundert auftraten, an den Grenzen des Römischen Reiches und handelten Waren, die sie aus dem Land erlangt hatten, und ihre Fähigkeiten, indem sie in den Reihen der römischen Armee dienten.

    "transformed": "Germany is considered a strong force today, a united country with its own blend of culture, from the shadows of the Alps in Munich all the way to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. The same culture can be felt from Cologne on the Rhine River, through the center of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we know it comes from several different sources and tribes.\n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origin of the name is highly debated among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic tribe known then as the Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gallic forces (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar first used the word \"Germanus\" in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he subdued the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which frequently crossed the Rhine under dubious pretenses. He took this word from the Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (the Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: \"Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (the Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.\" (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning \"to shout\", which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy.

Gedanken schlichen sich in meinen Geist und schlichen sich fast so schnell wieder heraus, wie sie erschienen waren.

Eine Technik, die das Buch lehrt, ist es, einen quadratischen Rahmen um jedes Bild zu legen, das der Künstler studieren möchte. Dadurch wird ein überwältigend detailliertes Bild, zum Beispiel eine Schale Obst auf einem Tisch, der sich in einem Esszimmer befindet, das mit einer Küche verbunden ist, in ein leicht zu fassendes Bild umgewandelt, diese Schale Obst, die auf einer einfachen Ebene liegt. \n\nZu der Zeit konnte ich, während ich auf die Schale vor mir starrte, den Rahmen des Künstlers nicht mental projizieren. Ich war so überwältigt, so ergriffen, dass ich nur stehen und voller Staunen schauen konnte. Picasso durchlief seine blaue Phase, Monet liebte Grün, italienische Renaissance-Meister zeigten einen Regenbogen an Farben. Wenn ich irgendwelche Ambitionen hatte, meine Perspektive als würdig des Titels \"Künstlerisch\" zu betrachten, dann waren vor mir der Anfang meines Bildes, der Anfang meiner Geschichte, \"Arbeit in Braun\".\n\nFingerkuppen setzten sich auf mein gewähltes Instrument der Kunstfreiheit, Muskeln spannten sich an und entspannten sich, als meine Hand durch den Raum bewegte sich, der Wille meines Geistes in Form und Gestalt gebracht wurde, in dem was hätte das kreativste Moment meines Lebens sein können.

Die National Institutes of Health erklären, dass eine Facette des Problems darin liegt, dass der Teenagerhirn buchstäblich nicht auf die Gefahren des Fahrens vorbereitet ist. Auch die bloße Unerfahrenheit liegt im Herzen des Problems. Diese Unerfahrenheit verursacht nicht nur mehr tödliche Unfälle, sondern auch eine höhere Rate an Fahrzeugumkippungen, Überholvorgängen und Fahrten von der Fahrbahn ab. \nTeens haben es auch viel schlechter, wenn sie mit ihren Freunden unterwegs sind - was jeder mit einem Hauch von Verstand weiß, dass sie regelmäßig tun. Das Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center führte eine Studie durch, die folgende Korrelation zeigte: zwischen dem Alter des Passagiers und der Anzahl der Verkehrsunfälle.\nKalifornien und andere Bundesstaaten haben versucht, die Sicherheit junger Fahrer zu erhöhen, indem sie zeitlich begrenzte Führerscheine erfordern, die die Stunden einschränken, die Jugendliche fahren dürfen, und das Befördern anderer Minderjähriger als Fahrgäste untersagen.\nDoch befristete Führerscheine sind meiner Meinung nach nur Übergangslösungen. Das eigentliche Problem ist, dass die jüngsten Fahrer als Gruppe nach allen statistischen Kennzahlen einfach nicht in der Lage sind, die Risiken und Verantwortlichkeiten angemessen zu bewältigen. Psychologe Marvin Zuckerman glaubt sogar, dass 18 Jahre für einen regulären Führerschein zu jung ist. Die USA Today berichtet, dass Zuckerman Forschung durchgeführt hat, die einen gemeinsamen Wunsch unter Menschen unter 19-20 Jahren zeigt, Risiken einzugehen, um den reinen Nervenkitzel zu erleben. Es ist deshalb sinnvoll, das Fahren mindestens bis dahin zu verzögern, bis der Drang nach Adrenalinabenteuer nachgelassen hat. Wenn wir junge Teenager weiterhin mit Führerscheinen ausstatten, werden wir nicht nur weiterhin tödliche Unfälle erleben, sondern die Anzahl der Todesopfer wird in den nächsten Jahren wahrscheinlich erschreckende Ausmaße annehmen. Bis 2010 werden die Kinder der Baby-Boomer fahrtüchtig sein und Millionen von neuen jungen Fahrern bereit sein, auf die Straße zu gehen.\n\nEine Gesetzgebung, die sich mit diesem Thema befasst, wäre relativ einfach. Schulen könnten weiterhin Fahrsicherheitsschulen anbieten, um den Lernprozess für zukünftige Fahrer zu beginnen, aber niemand unter 18 Jahren darf ein Kraftfahrzeug bedienen. Es könnte weiterhin vor der Erteilung eines vollen Führerscheins ein befristetes Fahrverbot ausgestellt werden, und eine bestimmte Anzahl von praktischen Fahrstunden würden ebenfalls noch erforderlich sein. Die genaue Anzahl der Stunden könnte auf der Anzahl der Stunden basieren, die bereits von den meisten Bundesstaaten benötigt werden (in Kalifornien sind es beispielsweise derzeit 6 Stunden Fahrtraining hinter dem Steuer und 50 Stunden Übung mit einem Erwachsenen). Da die tödlichen Statistiken für Teenagerfahrer aus einem Querschnitt aller Bundesstaaten stammen, wäre eine einheitliche, nationale Gesetzgebung zu diesem Thema ein vernünftiger - und meiner Meinung nach effektiver - Weg, um Jugendliche im ganzen Land zu schützen.\nDie von mir vorgeschlagene Gesetzgebung ist keineswegs eine neue Idee.\n\n[REWRITE]\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.

    "original": "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",

    "raw_output": "## German Translation:\n\nAuf den Spuren des frühen Edison-Films: Eine Untersuchung der Trickfilme\n\nDurchstöbern der Bibliothek des Kongresses, die eine Sammlung frühzeitiger Edison-Filme beherbergt, beschloss ich, alle Trickfilme zu betrachten. Insgesamt gab es von 1895 bis 1901 fünfzehn dieser Filme. Diese Filme vertrauen im Allgemeinen auf kreative Bearbeitungstechniken, um Illusionen zu erzeugen. Meine Filmstudie konzentrierte sich hauptsächlich auf die Beschreibung der Poetik der meisten Trickfilme und die Untersuchung der evolutionären Ausreißercharakteristika, die in einigen der späteren Filme vorhanden sind. Großteils ist der Trickfilm um die Jahrhundertwende an einen Ort gebunden, innerhalb eines frontal projizierten Vorhangs komponiert, zeigt keine Kamerabewegungen, verwendet lange und mittelnahe Aufnahmen und hält sich an die strenge Methodik \"ein Aufnahme = ein Film\". Es gibt jedoch einige Filme zu Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts, die diese Richtlinien durch die Einführung von Aspekten wie Mehrfachaufnahmen in Frage stellen.\n\nEin der auffälligsten Gemeinsamkeiten der Trickfilme ist ihre Drehorte in einem Innenbereich innerhalb des Rahmens eines frontal projizierten Vorhangs. Die Kamera bewegt sich nicht aus ihrer Vorhangposition, um Figuren oder Objekte zu verfolgen. Diese Komposition war in frühen Filmen sehr verbreitet und zog ihre Wurzeln aus dem Theater und, für Trickfilme, aus Varietés und Zaubershows. Eine der inhärenten Einschränkungen bei der Verwendung der Bühne ist, dass Figuren in Trickfilmen im Allgemeinen nur von Seite zu Seite bewegen und nicht auf die Kamera zu oder von ihr weggehen. Nehmen wir zum Beispiel die Handlung im Film \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900). Die Schauspieler treten von rechts ein und bewegen sich entlang der horizontalen Achse hin und her. Auch wenn sie den Rahmen verlassen, folgt die Kamera ihnen nicht.\n\nDer frontale Vorhang-Stil der Komposition bedeutet auch, dass Aufnahmen eher lange Aufnahmen und seltener mittlere Aufnahmen sind. Nahaufnahmen werden in keinem der Trickfilme aus dem Edison-Katalog verwendet. Dies wurde vom Theater- und Varieté-Brauch übernommen, bei dem das Publikum jederzeit die gesamte Vorstellung sehen konnte, eingefasst von den Grenzen der Bühne. Wie in den meisten frühen Filmen bewegen die Schauspieler sich nicht vom mittleren Grund zur Kamera, daher treten keine Nahaufnahmen auf.\n\nIm Allgemeinen folgen die meisten frühen Trickfilme dem Muster, dass eine konzeptionelle Aufnahme einem Film entspricht. Dies begrenzt die Länge der meisten Trickfilme auf etwa eine Minute oder weniger, abhängig von den Bildern pro Sekunde. Es begrenzt auch die dramatische oder narrative Verwendung der Trickfilme; die meisten konzentrieren sich auf kurze, varietæsartige Tricks wie Magie, Verschwinden und Tauschhandlungen mit wenig Handlung. Beachten Sie jedoch, dass in einem Trickfilm eine konzeptionelle Aufnahme aus der Sicht des Zuschauers nicht tatsächlich einer physischen Aufnahme entspricht. Eine einzelne \"Aufnahme\" kann tatsächlich mehrere Aufnahmen zusammengefügt sein, um die Illusion von Erscheinen oder Verschwinden zu erzeugen. Sehen Sie sich \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), einen der frühesten Trickfilme, genau an. Eine gründlichere Untersuchung enthüllt den Moment, in dem die physische Aufnahme mit dem abgetrennten \"Kopf\" von Mary beginnt, obwohl der gesamte Film konzeptionell eine Aufnahme für den Zuschauer darstellt.\n\n\n\n[REWRITE] In the wake of the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I decided to view all the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots. One of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them. The frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur. Generally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. [/REWRITE]\n",

Obwohl er hauptsächlich Landwirt war,  erhielt er durch diesen Beruf und seine kurze politische Karriere einen Ruf als Mann, der sich für persönliche Freiheit und Regierung  einsetzte und dafür bekannt war.  Seine Hingabe zu einem Agrarsystem bildete die Grundlage für fast alle seine Meinungen über die Regierung.  Es war sein Versuch, das, was er für die beste aller Berufe hielt, zu erhalten und zu fördern, das seine Argumente über Souveränität, Verfassungsmäßigkeit und sogar das Justizsystem färbte.\nJohn Taylor glaubte, dass die Vereinigten Staaten eine große Gelegenheit hatten, ein ideales System zu schaffen,  da es keine einheimische Tradition gab, die die Schöpfer der Regierung behindern konnte, was die Einrichtung eines Systems der Selbstregierung ermöglichte.  Er glaubte stark an die natürlichen Rechte des Menschen und an die Tatsache, dass sie alle voneinander abhängig sind -  bedeuten, dass, wenn einer verweigert wird, alle scheitern werden, und der Wert der verbleibenden nimmt ab. Diese Rechte sollten daher außerhalb der Reichweite der Regierung liegen.  Er behauptete, dass das, was einige als „Naturzustand“ bezeichneten, bedeutete, dass diejenigen mit physischer Stärke und böser Intelligenz diejenigen waren, die davon profitierten,  aber dass dies in einer Zivilisation nicht der Fall sein sollte.\nUm diese ideale Gesellschaft zu schaffen, glaubte Taylor, dass eine Regierung geschaffen werden muss, die die angeborene Gut-Böse-Natur des Menschen berücksichtigt.  Taylor war sehr rigide in seinen Ansichten über eine dualistische Moral.  Er behauptete: „Da die Regierung von Menschen ausgeübt wird, müssen all ihre Tugenden und Laster menschlich sein“ (ebd., S. 167).  Er definierte gute Prinzipien als solche, die privaten Besitz schützen, die Landwirtschaft verbessern und den Kapitalismus entmutigen, und glaubte, dass eine Regierung, die auf guten Prinzipien gegründet ist, unabhängig von ihrer Verwaltung gerecht funktionieren würde,  was unweigerlich von Habsucht und Eigennutz geleitet würde.  Eigennutz, glaubte er, sei die Motivation des Menschen in all seinen Handlungen, aber diese Eigenschaft wurde nur als böse angesehen, wenn sie über die Schaffung einer Gesellschaft, die auf dem Gemeinwohl basiert, hinausging und Untergesellschaften hervorbrachte, die auf Kosten anderer lebten.  Eine gute Regierung war erforderlich, um das natürliche Übel des Menschen einzudämmen, und selbst dann musste sie unter sorgfältiger Beobachtung stehen, um die Hinzufügung schlechter Prinzipien zu vermeiden.\n\nTaylor, wie viele andere entschlossene Republikaner seiner Zeit, forderte eine strenge Auslegung der Verfassung.  Er wünschte sich eine extrem eingeschränkte Bundesregierung, mit nicht mehr Rechten oder Befugnissen, als in der Verfassung ausdrücklich festgelegt waren.  Er wusste, dass eine weitreichende Bundesregierung teuer wäre und daher wahrscheinlich despotisch werden würde.  Er glaubte jedoch, dass eine einfache, wörtliche Interpretation gefährlich sei und dass ohne Bezugnahme auf den Willen der Autoren diese Methode leicht korrumpiert werden könnte.  Darüber hinaus betrachtete er die Unabhängigkeitserklärung als wahren Gründungsakt der Vereinigten Staaten, weil sie das Land expliziter als Gruppe souveräner Staaten und nicht als eine Nation beschrieb.\n\n\n**[REWRITE]\nJohn Taylor of Caroline was an early and passionate advocate for Republicanism.

An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

Ein ETF bietet Ihnen die Diversifikation eines Indexfonds und die Vorteile des Einzelaktienbesitzes wie die Möglichkeit, kurz zu verkaufen, auf Margin zu kaufen und bei jeder Transaktion bereits ab einem einzigen Anteil zu kaufen. Obwohl diese Vorteile äußerst attraktiv sind, liegen die Verwaltungsgebühren von ETFs deutlich unter denen des durchschnittlichen Investmentfonds. Unglücklicherweise gibt es auch einige Nachteile, wie z.B. die Notwendigkeit, bei jedem Handel mit ETFs eine Kommission zu zahlen, genau wie bei einem Aktienauftrag. Ein weiterer Vorteil von ETFs ist die große Auswahl an Fonds.  Obwohl diese Vorteile klar formuliert sind, ist es für den erfahrenen Finanzinvestor immer eine gute Übung, zu prüfen, ob die angegebenen Vorteile, wie Diversifikation, tatsächlich existieren und in welchem Umfang. \nIm Rahmen dieses Projekts werden wir den ETF IHF untersuchen und mit den zehn größten Positionen, die den ETF bilden, vergleichen, um festzustellen, ob die Vorteile des Besitzes eines einzelnen ETFs den Vorteilen eines diversifizierten Portfolios der zehn Aktien entsprechen und ob es bessere Konfigurationen der gleichen Aktien gibt, die ein optimales Sharp-Ratio oder eine höhere Rendite erbringen würden.\n\nUm den ETF zu bewerten, wäre es zu umständlich, alle Positionen einzubeziehen, daher haben wir beschlossen, nur die zehn größten Positionen zu berücksichtigen, die 63,58 % aller Vermögenswerte des ETFs ausmachen.  Unten finden Sie die zehn größten Positionen und den prozentualen Anteil an den Gesamtinvestitionen.\n\nUm eine Einschätzung zu erhalten, inwieweit diese zehn Aktien den gesamten ETF IHF repräsentieren, können wir den aktuellen %-Anteil der Vermögenswerte, normalisiert auf 100 %, verwenden, um den Beitrag jedes Aktien zur Beta und zur Rendite eines Portfolios zu berechnen, wenn das Portfolio vollständig aus diesen 10 Aktien in dem Verhältnis zusammengesetzt wäre, das der ETF durch seine Positionen festgelegt hat. Die Berechnungen von Beta und Rendite sind in der folgenden Tabelle aufgeführt.\n\nAus der obigen Tabelle geht hervor, dass die Rendite eines Portfolios, das nur die zehn größten Positionen enthält, 6,11 % höher ist als die des ETFs, ein 16%iger Anstieg der Renditen.  Es ist auch evident, dass die Beta der zehn größten Positionen um 0,12 niedriger ist als die des gesamten ETFs.

In \"Traumland\" verwendet Poe den Begriff \"Thulé\" in den Zeilen 6 und 56, den Mabbott auf Virgil zurückführt. Virgil verwendete den Begriff in Bezug auf eine Insel nördlich von Großbritannien, die die Griechen als den Rand der bekannten Welt betrachteten. Es ist sicher, dass Virgil den Begriff verwendete, aber es gibt eine aktuellere Quelle, der einige Anerkennung zuteil werden muss. Poe interessierte sich sehr für deutsche Autoren. \nDieser Zitat ist wichtig, weil es Poes Vertrautheit mit Goethes Werk zeigt. Karl J. Arndt kommentiert in seinem Buch \"Poes Politian und Goethes Mignon\" die Ähnlichkeit der beiden Gedichte und kommt zu dem Schluss, dass Poe Goethe imitierte. \n\tDer Oxford Companion to English Literature sagt von Goethe, dass er ein gefeierter Schriftsteller des poetischen Dramas Faust war, das in zwei Teilen veröffentlicht wurde, dem ersten 1808 und dem zweiten im Jahr Goethes Todes im Jahr 1832. Innerhalb des poetischen Verses des zweiten Teils von Faust liegt ein kurzes Gedicht mit dem Titel \"The King of Thulé\". Das Gedicht handelt von einem König, dessen Frau stirbt, nachdem sie ihm das Geschenk eines Kelches gegeben hat. Nachdem seine Frau gestorben ist, beginnt er stark zu trinken und weint aus der Erinnerung an seine verstorbene Königin. Dann beschließt er, dass es seine Zeit ist zu sterben, gibt seine Besitztümer an seine Kinder, bis auf den Kelch. Dann geht er zu einer Klippe, wirft den Kelch in den Ozean, schließt die Augen und stirbt. Die Haltung des Königs von Thulé und die Beschreibung des Königs in Traumland sind sehr ähnlich, vielleicht ein dunkler Doppelgänger von Poes Verlust und seinem Trinken. Faust wurde auch 1842 von H P Grattan zu einem romantischen Drama komponiert, weniger als ein Jahr vor Poes Verwendung des Begriffs Thule in \"Die Schlinge und das Pendel\". \n\tPoe erwähnt Thule zweimal in seinen gesammelten Schriften. Einmal erwähnt Poe \"ultma Thule\" in \"Die Schlinge und das Pendel\", aber er verwendet diesen Ausdruck in \"Traumland\" zweimal, als Buchschluss für das Gedicht. \"The King of Thulé\" und \"Traumland\" können als Begleitstücke gelesen werden. In \"Traumland\" sagt der Sprecher:  Er beschreibt dann die Landschaft von Thulé und wie sie dunkel, einsam ist, er wird von gestorbenen Freunden verfolgt und er sieht eine schattige Welt ohne Farbe. Alle diese Szenen würden in \"The King of Thule\" von Goethe gelesen werden, da er gerade seine Frau verloren hat, er ist einsam und er hat seinen Willen, zu regieren oder sogar zu leben, verloren. Das ganze Gedicht ist eine Beschreibung, als ob der Sprecher in Goethes Gedicht eingetreten wäre. \n\tGoethe war ein bedeutender Autor, den Poe wäre zumindest aus Respekt vor Tennyson gekannt haben. Poe sagte dazu, als man ihn fragte, ob er Tennyson bewunderte. Abgesehen von der Verbindung zu Tennyson wäre Poe Goethes Werk in den vielen Reproduktionen, die nach der ursprünglichen Veröffentlichung stattfanden, ausgesetzt gewesen. \n\n\n\n[REWRITE] Dream-Land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems.

    "original": "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",

Wenn ich auf die Ereignisse seit dem 11.

Ich glaube nicht, dass wir 2001 jemals einen Präsidentschaftskandidaten mit dem Namen Borac Obama gehabt hätten, der einen offensichtlichen muslimischen Hintergrund in seiner Familie hat.\n\nDie Biografie des Propheten fasziniert mich, weil sie meiner Meinung nach der Geschichte Muhammads widerspricht. Aus dem, was ich von der Geschichte Muhammads weiß und gelernt habe, dachte ich, dass er Konvertiten zum Islam zwang. Er eroberte Stämme und zwang sie dann, die Religion des Islam anzunehmen. Aber laut der Biografie wird Muhammad als eine Art Märtyrer dargestellt, der missverstanden wurde und sich sogar anderen unterwarf. Danach kamen die Menschen nacheinander und sahen die „Wahrheit“ in seiner Lehre und suchten ihn auf.\n\nEs gibt auch einige unheimliche Ähnlichkeiten zwischen den Diensten Jesu und den „Wundern“ Muhammads. Das offensichtlichste ist, als er Lamm und Milch nahm und sie so vermehrte, dass es mehr als genug für vierzig Männer gab. In diesem Schreibstil glaube ich, dass die Autoren wollten, dass Muhammad als bescheidener Prophet wahrgenommen wird, der nichts beweisen musste, sondern einfach in Wahrheit und Wundern lebte. Diese Art von Falschheit ist die schlimmste, weil sie das Wunder und das Leben Jesu Christi herunter spielt. Für mich ist es so, als würden sie stehlen und versuchen, sich die Lebens- und Personhaftigkeit Jesu durch Muhammad anzueignen.\n\nEs gibt auch viele Geschichten in der Biografie, die den Eindruck vermitteln, dass es Teil ihrer Agenda ist, Beweise für „Zeugnis“ oder dafür zu liefern, dass Menschen „auf eigene Faust“ zum Islam konvertierten. Das Problem ist aber, dass viele der Geschichten zumindest aus der Perspektive eines Dritten stammen. Das heißt, der Autor erzählt in der Geschichte, dass er von so und so gehört hat, der wiederum von so und so gehört hat usw. Das gefiel mir nicht so gut, denn obwohl ihre Idee war, dass dies den Beweis für die Wahrheit der Geschichten lieferte, fand ich, dass dies die Geschichten schmälerte und sie viel verdächtig erscheinen ließ.\n\nIch denke, das, was mich an dieser Arbeit am meisten stört, ist, dass sie versuchen, Muhammad als einen frommen Mann zu erheben und zu verherrlichen, der bescheiden, liebenswürdig, weise und sanft war. Aber die Geschichte widerspricht der Idee, dass Muhammad ein sanfter und bescheidener Mann war, und ich kann nicht anders, als zu denken, ob muslimische Menschen heute die wahre Geschichte hinter Muhammads Aufstieg zur Macht kennen.\n\n\n## English Translation:\n\n[REWRITE]Almost four years ago I took a course on Islam at CBC. One of the main topics that was hotly debated in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion. I believe the question is even more relevant today than ever before. Looking back on the events since 9/11, I have personally observed the mass media shift from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme form of tolerance for Islam in America. I don't think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Barack Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\nThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because, according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad. From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam. He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to adopt the Islamic religion. But according to the biography, Muhammad is written as a sort of martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others. After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\nThere are also some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad. The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men. It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles. This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ. To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.\n\nThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam. But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective. That is, in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc. I didn't like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all the more suspicious.\n\nI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle. But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can't help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. [/REWRITE] \n\n\n\n",

Wenn wir uns dieses Geschichtsablaufes in großen Zügen ansehen, sehen wir einen Trend, wie sich das Christentum immer weiter von seinen Wurzeln entfernt. Es scheint, dass die heutige Welt ein wachsendes Bewusstsein und eine beispiellose progressive Tendenz zeigt. Während traditionelle Menschen bestehen bleiben und jeder Art von Denken, das über das hinausgeht, was ihnen beigebracht wurde, widerstehen werden, mag dieser Teil der Bevölkerung nicht prominent genug sein, um das Ganze zu beeinflussen. Unter Christen wird in den kommenden Jahren ein historisches Bewusstsein enorm wachsen. Es wird ein Drang breiten sich aus, die Lehren, die im Laufe der Zeit in das Christentum aufgenommen wurden, von der eigentlichen Absicht der Namensgeber der Religion zu unterscheiden. Es kann Jahrzehnte oder sogar Jahrhunderte dauern, aber das Ergebnis wird unvermeidlich sein: Es wird eine große Kehrtwende in der Geschichte des Christentums geben. Es wird ein Fortschritt zu seiner ursprünglichen Form geben. Eine Bewegung wird an Größe gewinnen, die Schicht für Schicht Dogmen entfernt, genau wie wenn die Uhr rückwärts laufen würde, bis nichts mehr übrig bleibt als die Vorstellung davon, was Jesus der Menschheit im Namen Gottes eingebracht hat, bevor andere Denker solche Behauptungen aufstellten. Wenn dieser Trend durch die Vereinigten Staaten und Europa zieht und Massen auf seinem Weg beeinflusst, um wie in der Zeit Jesu zu beten und nur seine Ideen zu befolgen, wird die Kirche als Institution stark bleiben, um den Weg zu weisen.  Da die theologische Uhr jedoch zurückgedreht wurde, wird die extreme Vielfalt im Christentum in immer mehr Einheitlichkeit der Überzeugung und Praxis zurückkehren. Zwischen Regionen, zwischen Konfessionen, zwischen allen Arten von Zweigen werden wir anstatt Unterschiede immer mehr Ähnlichkeiten sehen.  Die menschliche Geschichte ist voller großer Kehrtwenden. Ein Beispiel hierfür ist, wie Christen einst vom Römischen Reich verfolgt, verstoßen und getötet wurden. Später wurde dieses Reich jedoch zu einer christlichen Institution. Unser Land ist von der afrikanisch-amerikanischen Sklaverei zur afrikanisch-amerikanischen Führung übergegangen. Die große Kehrtwende, die uns in Zukunft erwartet, wird sich in der Arena der christlichen Religion abspielen, die Geschichte auf der Suche nach der Quelle rückgängig machen und dabei die Vielfalt rückgängig machen.

Der offensichtlichste Bereich ist der der Eigentümer und Manager der großen Fabriken. Alles, was sie tun wollen, ist, ihre Unternehmen und Fabriken so groß und großartig wie möglich zu machen. Ihnen ist nichts und niemand egal, der ihnen im Weg steht oder durch ihre Fortschritte verletzt wird. \n\nLaut Uptons Sinclair's Werk heißt es: „Die Gebäude standen klar und schwarz gegen den Himmel; hier und da stiegen aus der Masse die großen Schornsteine empor, mit dem Rauchstrom, der bis zum Ende der Welt floss.“ Sinclair versucht, ein Bild von den großen Schäden zu zeichnen, die diese Verschmutzung verursacht. Er zeigt, dass den Besitzern nichts und niemanden daran liegt, der verletzt werden könnte. Sie kümmern sich nicht um die riesigen Rauchwolken, die aus den Fabriken strömen, oder die Tierkot- und Urinabfluss aus den tausenden von Ställen rund um Packingtown.\n\nDie Eigentümer und Manager kümmerten sich auch nicht um ihre Mitarbeiter, die für ihren Reichtum arbeiteten. Sie würden alles tun, um einen zusätzlichen Dollar zu verdienen oder zu sparen: „Von oben bis unten ist der Ort einfach ein brodelnder Kessel aus Eifersüchteleien und Hass; es gibt keine Loyalität oder Anstand, es gibt keinen Ort, an dem ein Mann etwas gegen einen Dollar zählt.“ Sie zwingen ihre Mitarbeiter, schreckliche Stunden zu arbeiten, und dann können sie ohne jegliche Ankündigung Massen von Menschen gleichzeitig entlassen, ohne jegliche Entschädigung oder Unterstützung bei der Arbeitssuche. \n\nIn der Zeit, in der \"The Jungle\" spielt, gab es nicht viele, wenn überhaupt, Gesetze oder Vorschriften, die den Arbeitsschutz oder das Wohlergehen der Arbeiter schützten.

Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40).

Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

Other times, he imbues a symbol with meaning and then uses it for the same purpose. Fitzgerald employs this latter technique with various colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In his novel *The Great Gatsby*, F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, particularly white/gray and red/pink, and later uses this meaning to evoke a specific feeling associated with important objects in the reader's mind.\n\nThe meaning Fitzgerald constructs and utilizes for white/gray is uniformity, with white representing a slightly more refined and elevated status, while gray suggests something older and faded. Fitzgerald establishes this meaning at the beginning of the novel through consistent use of both colors. Daisy and Jordan are constantly \"in white\" (8) - in fact, everyone seems to be wearing white: Nick wears \"white flannels\" (41) to Gatsby's party, Tom sports a \"white shirt\" (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is \"powdered milky white\" (30). The only exception occurs when Nick observes Gatsby's party, where the \"halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors by applying them to numerous common, insignificant subjects. As Nick commutes to work, he travels \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" (56).

After a prolonged period without any significant use of these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white in a little white roadster\" (74).

Fitzgerald further reinforces this impression of Daisy's uniformity through additional instances of this technique.

Häufige Ernten umfassen: Tomaten, Zitrusfrüchte, Blattgemüse, Kürbisse, Brokkoli, Kräuter, Baumfrüchte wie Pfirsiche und Zitronen, Beeren, Honig und Paprika. In der San Diego Gegend gibt es einen großen Markt für biologisch angebautes Gemeinschaftslandwirtschafts-Nahrungsmittel, wobei viele lokale Organisationen lange Wartellisten haben. Auch Bio-Eier und -Milch sind beliebt. Viele Bio-Bauernhöfe bieten außerdem Führungen durch ihre landwirtschaftlichen Betriebe sowie Zugang zu Wanderwegen, Vogelbeobachtungen und anderen Freizeitaktivitäten an. Dies ist der Typ von Betrieb, der es dem Grundeigentümer ermöglichen würde, die Vorteile von staatlichen Programmen zu nutzen, während er das Habitat verbessert, wodurch Freizeitmöglichkeiten geschaffen und eine Möglichkeit für Farmtouren und andere Programme zur Geldgenerierung oder zu Bildungszwecken entsteht.\n\nZusätzlich zur Befüllung eines potenziell lukrativen Nischenmarktes bieten die Vorteile des ökologischen Landbaus oft eine höhere Biodiversität von Pflanzen und Wildtieren in der Region, dank der Abwesenheit von Chemikalien in Boden und Wasser. Der ökologische Landbau hat jedoch in mancher Hinsicht höhere Kosten als der konventionelle Landbau. Es erfordert mehr intensive Arbeit und Management, um Schädlinge und Unkraut zu entfernen und den Boden ohne Chemikalien zu düngen, und die Verluste sind oft höher als bei konventionellen Methoden, während ein kleiner Bio-Bauernhof auch den Skaleneffizienz eines großen Betriebs fehlt. Praktiken, die nicht mit dem ökologischen Landbau zusammenhängen, aber für das Wildleben vorteilhaft sind, können ebenfalls höhere Arbeitskosten verursachen, einschließlich der Aussaat von Gründüngekulturen, der strategischen Weidewirtschaft, der Entfernung invasiver Arten und der aktiven Pflege des Pflanzenwachstums, um bestimmte Bedingungen wie Randlebensräume oder offene Flächen zu schaffen. Es gibt also viele Gründe, warum der Grundeigentümer in diesem Beispiel finanzielle Hilfe oder Fachwissen suchen könnte, um sowohl den Gewinn als auch die Habitatqualität zu maximieren.\n\nDas Land, das für dieses Szenario ausgewählt wurde, ist ein Grundstück neben der Stadt Potrero im nicht eingemeindeten San Diego County, Kalifornien. Es handelt sich um 160 Hektar Chaparral, nicht einheimischem mediterranem Grasland und Eichenwald neben dem Cleveland National Forest. Es liegt in der Ostausläufer-Ökoregion des San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. Der Plan wird derzeit noch überprüft, berücksichtigt aber gegenwärtig über hundert Pflanzen- und Tierarten. Viele davon sind vom Aussterben bedroht, wie zum Beispiel das Stephens' Kangaroo Rat, der berggebirgige gelbe Fröschen, verschiedene Schmetterlingsarten und der Kaliforniensittich; andere sind rückläufig und könnten bald gelistet werden, wie zum Beispiel die Erdhöhlenfüchse.\n\nDiese Gegend war seit Jahrtausenden von indigenen amerikanischen Völkern bewohnt und wurde dann im späten 19. Jahrhundert von Viehzüchtern und Holzhändlern besiedelt. Dieses Stück Land war Teil eines ursprünglichen Grundstücksverleihs und wurde wahrscheinlich lange Jahrzehnte für die Weidewirtschaft und/oder die Holzerzeugung genutzt.\n\nIch habe ein Grundstück von einer Immobilienwebsite ausgewählt und recherchiert, welche staatlichen Programme für einen kleinen Landwirt realistische Möglichkeiten bieten, Kosten zu mindern und tierfreundliche Betriebsformen zu erhalten.

Anstatt eine Kultur zu beurteilen oder versuchen, sie zu ändern, muss man sie einfach so akzeptieren, wie sie ist, und innerhalb ihrer Grenzen arbeiten, besonders im Rahmen einer Verhandlung, und besonders, wenn man mit einer schwächeren Verhandlungsposition an den Tisch kommt. Ebenso kann ein Respekt für Traditionen und Überzeugungen, wenn ein Verhandlungspartner sich in „fremdem“ Gebiet befindet, nur dazu beitragen, kulturelle Barrieren zu überwinden und die Verhandlungen voranzutreiben.\n\nEs ist wichtig zu beachten, dass Kultur sich nicht unbedingt auf eine nationale/internationale Dichotomie beschränkt. Die meisten Unternehmen innerhalb eines bestimmten Landes etablieren ihre eigene Unternehmenskultur. Zum Beispiel könnte eine Unternehmenskultur lange Arbeitszeiten im Büro oder einen entspannteren Stundenplan betonen. Belege für eine Unternehmenskultur lassen sich in Kleiderordnungen der Mitarbeiter, im Kommunikationsstil (direkte vs. indirekte Kommunikation, Delegation von Aufgaben) und in Einstellungspraktiken erkennen. Einige Unternehmen fördern die Philanthropie auf allen Ebenen bei den Mitarbeitern, während andere sie auf „firmeneigene“ Wohltätigkeitsorganisationen oder Spendensammlungen beschränken. Man muss nur die Unterschiede in der amerikanischen Unternehmenskultur von Unternehmen zu Unternehmen betrachten (und es gibt sogar intra-company-Diversität, die von Region zu Region reicht, einschließlich städtischer und suburbaner Umgebungen), um die Vielfalt der Gedanken zu schätzen, die in einer bestimmten gesellschaftlichen Kultur existieren kann. Bestimmte Kulturen sind nicht annähernd so stratifiziert wie die amerikanische Kultur und können für einen Außenstehenden einheitlicher erscheinen, aber ein ähnliches Äußeres ist einfach ein Zeichen dafür, tiefer zu graben.\n\nWerte sind noch wichtiger zu verstehen, weil sie den „Warum“ einer Kultur liefern. Wenn im Rahmen einer Kultur das Sparen von Gesicht oder die Gemeinschaftssinn geschätzt werden, ist es sicher, dass ein Verhandlungspartner seine Firma oder seinen Vorgesetzten nicht öffentlich demütigen wird, um am Verhandlungstisch erfolgreich zu sein. Ebenso wird ein Verhandlungspartner aus einer Kultur, die mehr Wert auf harte Verhandlungsgeschäfte legt, nicht unbedingt davon angetrieben sein, so schnell wie möglich zu einem Vergleich zu gelangen. Die Berücksichtigung dieser allgemeinen Merkmale vor dem Eintritt an den Verhandlungstisch ist wichtig. Ein Verhandlungspartner wird jedoch gut beraten sein, etwas über seinen Gegner auf persönlicher Ebene zu erfahren, um die Verhandlung effektiv zu gestalten.\n\n\n\n[REWRITE]\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation.

    "original": "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",

Um eine Gottheit zuzulassen, die dem nicht ähnelt, an dem unsere beiden Autoren glauben, würde uns nicht erlauben, ihre beiden Argumente angemessen zu vergleichen, da sie im Wesentlichen die Verteidigung eines spezifischen Gotteskonzepts darstellen. \n\nDas gesagt, ich schlage vor, dass jeder von ihnen zwar gültige Punkte anspricht, jedoch weder wirklich eine ganzheitliche Grundlage für den Glauben an Gott bietet. \n\nUm diesen Punkt zu veranschaulichen, werden wir zunächst das grundlegende Argument von St. Anselm untersuchen. Anselms Passage spiegelt einen Weg wider, Verständnis durch Glauben zu erlangen, indem man sich nach innen wendet, um Beweis für Gott zu finden. Er erklärt, dass weil Gott in unserem Verständnis existiert, können wir seine Nicht-Existenz nicht effektiv begreifen. Während dieses Konzept, wenn es in seiner Terminologie ausgedrückt wird, etwas langwierig und zeitweise unklar ist, besteht der grundlegende Kern darin, dass der Beweis für Gott in unserem eigenen Geist liegt. St. Anselm schlägt uns vor, dass wir nicht über die Grenzen unserer eigenen Seele hinausgehen müssen, um die Wahrheit über Gott zu finden, sondern dass die Existenz dieses Wesens durch die Untersuchung dessen, was wir in unseren eigenen Gedanken als wahr kennen, als wahr erkannt wird. Fremde Beweise sind mutmaßlich überflüssig. Dieses Konzept der Annahme dessen, für das es keinen unwiderlegbaren Körper empirischer Beweise gibt, wird in christlichen Texten oft als Glaube bezeichnet.\n\nDiese Idee unterscheidet sich stark von der von St. Thomas von Aquin. Thomas behauptet stattdessen, dass die Existenz Gottes ausschließlich durch Vernunft und empirische Beweise bewiesen werden kann, ohne jeglichen Glauben. Eine solche Idee wäre im Evangeliumsarbeit, einem wichtigen Element des Christentums, vorteilhaft, weil sie die Gewinnung neuer Anhänger ohne Abhängigkeit von ihrer Bereitschaft zu etwas, das nicht bewiesen werden kann, ermöglichen würde. Stattdessen könnten sie allein durch Logik überzeugt werden. St. Thomas erläutert fünf verschiedene logische Argumente, die die Existenz Gottes stützen: Veränderung, Kausalität, Contingenz, Grad der Vollkommenheit und Harmonie. In jedem demonstriert er im Wesentlichen, dass der Beweis für Gott in der logischen Notwendigkeit für Gott liegt. Wenn Ihnen gesagt wird, dass Ihnen ein Puzzleteil fehlt, und Sie den Rest des Puzzles zusammensetzen, besagt die Logik, dass Sie die Merkmale und die Existenz des fehlenden Teils kennen können, ohne ihn zu sehen.\n\n\n\n\n[REWRITE]The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.' This statement appears first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and marks the beginning of St. Anselm's argument concerning the existence of God. This belief seems also to be held by the other author we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine which is better, we must, for brevity's sake, start with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-like figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not allow us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. \n\nThat being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God. To illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm's passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within oneself to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one's own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn't go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\nThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.

    "raw_output": "## German Translation:\n\nIrgendwann im 5. oder 6. Jahrhundert v. Chr. wurde ein Prinz geboren, der eines Tages Buddha genannt werden sollte. Im Laufe seines Lebens gab er der Welt die Stirn und wurde erleuchtet, und seine Lehren führten zur Entstehung des Buddhismus - die orthodoxeste Sekte davon ist der Theravada-Buddhismus. Die Religion ist etwa zweitausendfünfhundert Jahre alt; sie sieht heute anders aus als zu Buddhas Lebzeiten. Dies ist überall zu sehen, zum Beispiel in der Theravada-Nation Sri Lanka, wo die jährliche Wasser-Schnittzeremonie begangen wird. Mönche und Laien nehmen an dieser Zeremonie teil, und sie hat trotz der Tatsache, dass Buddha nie über eine solche Feier gelehrt hat, eine gewisse religiöse Bedeutung. Diese Unterschiede reichen von den oberflächlichen Traditionen bis zu den soteriologischen Grundlagen der Religion. Die Theravada-Buddhistische Gemeinschaft, sowohl aus monastischem als auch aus laienhafter Sicht, musste ihre dogmatischen Prinzipien im Laufe der Zeit ändern. Dies lässt sich sowohl auf äußere als auch innere Kräfte, sowohl feindliche als auch wohlwollende, zurückführen.\n\nEs gibt eine Reihe von Qualifikationsbegriffen, die in diesem Gespräch häufig verwendet werden. Es gibt das Konzept des internen versus externen. Hier wird eine interne Kraft als eine Kraft definiert, die von Mitgliedern des Buddhasasana ausgeht, unabhängig von ihrem monastischen Status. Eine externe Kraft ist jede Kraft von Nicht-Buddhisten. Eine feindliche Kraft ist jede Kraft, die der buddhistischen Gemeinschaft schadet oder schaden möchte - eine Kraft, die aus einer negativen Wahrnehmung des Buddhismus entsteht. Eine wohlwollende Kraft ist eine Kraft, die der buddhistischen Gemeinschaft weder schaden noch helfen möchte - obwohl sie möglicherweise als Nebeneffekt eines oder des anderen tun kann. Diese Begriffe werden in diesem Gespräch immer wieder auftauchen.\n\nZunächst ist es wichtig, die Grundlagen der Religion zu untersuchen - die Lehren, die im Zentrum des Theravada-Buddhismus stehen. Buddhisten suchen Zuflucht in den drei Juwelen des Buddha, des Dhamma und der Sangha. Das Dhamma besteht im Wesentlichen aus den drei Körben - dem Tripitaka - der buddhistischen Texte. Der Sutta Pitaka enthält alle Suttas, der Vinaya Pitaka enthält die Disziplinarregeln und der Abhidhamma Pitaka enthält die metaphysischen Bestandteile des Buddhismus. Die metaphysischen Vorstellungen umfassen Dinge wie Anatta - keine Seele, Dukkha - inhärentes Leiden im Leben und Anicca - die Unbeständigkeit von allem. Nur durch die Erkenntnis dieser Konzepte kann man Sansara, den Kreislauf von Tod und Wiedergeburt, beenden, der kontinuierlich stattfindet. Zusammen mit Sansara wird lobha - Begierde, dosa - Hass und moha - Täuschung - enden, wenn man erleuchtet wird. Im Vinaya Pitaka werden Regeln für das Leben festgelegt. Für Laien gibt es fünf Gebote (Ich werde nicht töten, ich werde nicht lügen, ich werde nicht stehlen, ich werde mich nicht unmoralisch verhalten und ich werde keine berauschenden Substanzen konsumieren). Für Mönche gibt es viele mehr Disziplinarregeln zu befolgen. Die grundlegendste dogmatische Vorstellung im Buddhismus ist die Vorstellung der vier edlen Wahrheiten. Erstens Dukkha; die Wahrheit, dass das Leben Leiden ist. Zweitens, dass Bindung Leid verursacht. Drittens, dass Leiden überwunden werden kann.\n\n[REWRITE]\n\nSometime in the 5th or 6th century BCE, a prince was born who would one day be called Buddha.

The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.

Der Höhepunkt dieser Rivalität war der Mexikanisch-Amerikanische Krieg von 1846-1848, bei dem die Vereinigten Staaten Mexiko angriffen und besiegten und sich Texas und den Amerikanischen Südwesten als neues Territorium sicherte.  Viele andere Zusammenstöße ereigneten sich zwischen den beiden Nationen, die schließlich kurz vor dem Ersten Weltkrieg abnahmen.   Die Rivalität begann, als Amerikaner und Mexikaner sich auf wichtige Fragen wie Religion, Kultur und Tradition prallten und einen großen Interessenkonflikt hatten (Schmitt 1974 S. 30-31).   \n\tDies ist nicht unähnlich vielen anderen Nationen, die eine anhaltende Rivalität mit einem Nachbarn haben.  Nationen, die eine Grenze teilen, neigen dazu, Interessenkonflikte zu haben, die zu der Entstehung von rivalisierenden Positionen zwischen den Nationen beitragen.

Pletcher (1977) stellt fest: „Nur in Mexiko und Kuba findet man langanhaltende übergreifende amerikanische diplomatische Probleme“ (S. 41).

Sally Frahm (2001) sagt: „Wenn die Amerikaner im 20. Jahrhundert gegen Faschismus und Kommunismus waren, waren sie im 18. und 19. Jahrhundert gegen Katholizismus und Monarchie“ (S. 86).  Nicht unähnlich wie die Rivalität zwischen den Vereinigten Staaten und der Sowjetunion im Kalten Krieg war ein Teil ideologischer Kampf und ein Teil ein Wettstreit um Interessen, die jede Nation als lebenswichtig erachtete. In diesem Fall basierten die ideologischen Auseinandersetzungen jedoch nicht auf der politischen Struktur, sondern auf den religiösen Präferenzen der Vereinigten Staaten und Mexikos.  Dieser Misstrauen wuchs aus dem Misstrauen zwischen den Engländern und den Spaniern. Das Erbeißen dieser Gefühle des Misstrauens von ihren ehemaligen Kolonialherren war ein großes Hindernis bei der Etablierung von freundlichen internationalen Beziehungen zwischen den Vereinigten Staaten und Mexiko.\n\tDiehl und Goerts (2000) führen 17 Streitigkeiten zwischen Mexiko und den Vereinigten Staaten im 57-jährigen Rivalitätszeitraum auf.   Die Mehrheit der Streitigkeiten aus dem Rivalitätszeitraum, der von Diehl und Goerts beschrieben wird, sind territoriale Probleme im Zusammenhang mit Grenzüberfällen aus mexikanischem Gebiet nach Mexiko und anderen Grenzproblemen. Grenzüberfälle von Banditen und Gesetzlosen aus amerikanischen Grenzstädtchen waren ein großes Problem, das bis dahin anhielt, als sowohl die Vereinigten Staaten als auch Mexiko militärische Gewalt an ihren Grenzen ausübten (Schmitt 1974 S. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) erklärt, dass die Rivalität zwischen den beiden Nationen begann, abzunehmen, „als Mexiko sich in erheblichem Maße von den Vereinigten Staaten abhängig machte“ (S. 109) und schließlich endete, als sich die amerikanischen Ambitionen „von der territorialen Expansion zu einer ökonomischen Intervention in Mexiko“ (S. 110) im späteren 19.

Obwohl D'Arcy Thompson 1917 feststellte: „Selbst jetzt hat der Zoologe kaum begonnen, die einfachsten organischen Formen in mathematischer Sprache zu definieren“, lässt sich dasselbe heute noch sagen. In jüngerer Zeit wurde mathematisches Modellieren auf allgemeine Aspekte der Mollusken-Skelettogenese durch Ontogenese und Phylogenie angewendet (z. B. Raup und Stanley, 1981). Unsere Studie untersucht, wie das mathematische Modellieren ontogenetischer und phylogenetischer Veränderungen bei Prunum, in Kombination mit experimentellen Studien, verwendet werden kann, um die Mechanismen aufzudecken, die die Richtung und Größe evolutionärer-entwicklungsbedingter Veränderungen bestimmen. Wir verwendeten X-Radiografiebilder von Prunum-Arten, um quantitative Parameter zu definieren, die wiederum zur Modellierung hypothetischer und tatsächlicher Skelettmorphologien verwendet werden konnten. Diese Parameter wurden in das Softwareprogramm CerioShell (Stone, 1995) eingegeben. Wir modellierten hypothetische Schalenmorphologien, die zur Interpretation der Grenzen möglicher morphologischer Veränderungen bei Prunum verwendet werden können. Diese Ergebnisse werden mit experimentellen und deskriptiven Studien kombiniert, um makroevolutionäre Ereignisse in dieser Klade besser zu verstehen.\n\nEine Schale kann als eine Struktur betrachtet werden, die sich im Laufe der Zeit über 360 Grad im Raum bewegt. Diese Revolutionen oder Umdrehungen einer gekrümmten Schale werden Windungen genannt, die als um eine imaginäre zentrale Achse geschlungen betrachtet werden. Diese Achse verläuft durch die zentrale Säule der Schale und wird als Kolumnella bezeichnet. Die Geschwindigkeit, mit der sich die Windungen vergrößern, kann variieren, und eine kontinuierliche Linie trennt jede Windung und wird als Naht bezeichnet. Bei den meisten Schalen ist die größte Windung einer Schale die letzte Windung (Körperwindung). Die Spire wird als alle Windungen außer der letzten angesehen. Die Spitze ist die Spitze der Spire, und die gegenüberliegende Seite wird als Basis bezeichnet. Das Tier erstreckt sich durch eine Öffnung, die als Öffnung bezeichnet wird, aus seiner Schale.\n\nSchalen können in apikalen, basalen, aperturalen und abaperturalen Ansichten betrachtet werden. (Die „übliche“ Ausrichtung einer Schale ist eine aperturale Ansicht, wobei die Öffnung zum Betrachter gerichtet ist und die Spitze nach oben zeigt.)\n\nEine Methode zum Zählen von Windungen ist unten dargestellt. Zuerst sollte die Schale aus der apikalen Ansicht betrachtet und dann bestimmt werden, wo die erste Naht beginnt. Eine Linie kann dann gezogen werden, um die Schale in zwei Teile zu teilen. Windungen werden von dieser Linie gezählt und auf ein Viertel einer Windung geschätzt.\n\nEine Schale kann als eine Reihe von Öffnungen betrachtet werden, die sich durch Zeit und Raum bewegen, während das Tier seine Schale akkumuliert (d. h. aufbaut). Es ist möglich, den Weg der Öffnung über die Koordinaten des Zentrums der Öffnung jeder Windung sowie den horizontalen und vertikalen Radius der Öffnung zu verfolgen.\n\nDiese Trajektorie kann grafisch und mathematisch dargestellt werden. Sobald eine mathematische Formulierung erstellt wurde, können Parameter variiert und die Skeletogenese des Mollusken modifiziert werden.\n\n\n\n[REWRITE] \nWhy do organisms evolve in the manner that they do?

In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.

Obwohl das Land auf dem Weg ist, viele der Millennium-Entwicklungsziele zu erreichen, wie z. B. die Ziele für Wasser und Sanitärversorgung, sind die Verbesserungsraten für die Gesundheit von Kindern und Müttern weit hinter den notwendigen Verbesserungen zurück, um bis 2015 die Zielvorgaben zu erfüllen.  Die vielfältigen Gründe für diese Mängel werden unten erläutert und zeigen die Notwendigkeit, das Gesundheitssystem zu stärken, anstatt sich auf programmatische Interventionen zu konzentrieren.\n\nIndonesien hat Fortschritte bei der Anzahl der Geburten mit anwesenden qualifizierten Gesundheitspersonal erzielt, wobei 72 % der Geburten dieses Ziel jetzt erfüllen.  Das heißt, diese Kategorie umfasst weiterhin traditionelle Arbeiter wie Hebammen, die bei Komplikationen während der Schwangerschaft keine medizinischen Eingriffe durchführen können (daher der hohe Prozentsatz an bei Blutungen verursachten Todesfällen bei Frauen).  Mit anderen Worten, die erzielten Verbesserungen bei diesem speziellen Indikator sind etwas irreführend und es gibt noch viel zu tun.  Darüber hinaus ist der Anteil der bei Kindern unter fünf Jahren behandelten Durchfallfälle durch medizinisches Fachpersonal gesunken.  Obwohl die Daten zur postnatalen Versorgung unvollständig sind, ist klar, dass dies ebenfalls ein Problem darstellt, da die Raten auf nationaler Ebene niedrig sind.\n\nDie Kaiserschnittquoten liegen immer noch niedriger als erwartet, etwa bei 4 %.  Die Kaiserschnittquoten verweisen zudem auf ein weiteres Problem hin.  Während die Rate von Kaiserschnitten in städtischen Gebieten bei 7 % liegt, liegt sie in ländlichen Gebieten bei nur 2 %.  Das zeigt das Problem der Abdeckungseffizienz im ganzen Land.  Es ist klar, dass der Zugang zu Gesundheitsdienstleistungen auf städtische Gebiete konzentriert ist.  Ein weiteres Problem im Zusammenhang mit dem Zugang betrifft die vertikale Gerechtigkeit.  Es besteht ein 27-prozentiger Unterschied in der Nutzung von Dienstleistungen zwischen den ärmeren und reichsten Quintilen.  Es ist klar, dass die Armen es viel schwieriger haben, Zugang zu Gesundheitsdienstleistungen zu erhalten, wahrscheinlich aufgrund der direkten Kosten.\n\nBei der Diskussion über die nächsten Schritte zur Verbesserung der Indikatoren für die Neugeboren- und Mütterversorgung stellt sich die grundlegendste Frage, wie der Mangel an Dienstleistungen am effektivsten angegangen werden kann.  Konkret sollte Indonesien programmspezifische Ansätze entwickeln oder das gesamte Gesundheitssystem stärken, ohne sich auf die vor- und postnatalen Betreuung von Mutter und Kind zu konzentrieren?  Es besteht kein Zweifel daran, dass programmatische Ansätze, um die oben genannten Probleme zu lösen, attraktiv sind.  Nicht nur haben \"vertikale Ansätze\", die einen Sektor von Verbesserungen im Visier haben, viel spezifischere, leichter zu bewirtschaftete Ziele, sie erzielen im Allgemeinen auch schnellere Ergebnisse.  Es gibt jedoch einige Nachteile, die man im Auge behalten sollte.  Ein Hauptnachteil ist, dass eine starke Investition in Programme für einen bestimmten Bereich des Gesundheitssektors oft bedeutet, dass die Finanzierung anderer Bereiche leidet und das menschliche Kapital sich auf den Bereich konzentriert, der über mehr Ressourcen verfügt (das Beispiel der internationalen Finanzierung von HIV/AIDS und ihrer Auswirkungen auf den Bereich der Familienplanung).  Darüber hinaus führen mehrere parallel laufende Programme für einen Bereich zu einer Verdopplung der Dienste, die zwischen den Programmen auch nicht koordiniert sind.  Dies führt zu einem Anstieg von Formularen und Papierkram für Lieferungen und Finanzierung.\n\n[REWRITE]\nThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained relatively stable over the last ten years.

That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words, the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\nCesarean-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural areas.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding.",

    "raw_output": "## German Translation:\n\nViktorianische Romane zeichnen sich durch ihre überbordende Liebe zum Detail und ihren Fokus auf die Aristokratie der Zeit aus. Zwei Romane, die als viktorianisch gelten, aber von dieser Tradition abweichen, sind Oliver Twist und Wuthering Heights. Beide Romane verwenden ein Element des Mysteriums und eine Vorliebe für das Bizarre, was für die Romane der damaligen Zeit untypisch ist und die Charaktere in jedem Werk stärkt; sie geben Einblicke, die ihre Motive und Emotionen erläutern. \n\n„Und nun drängten sich eine Vielzahl verwirrender und verworrener Ideen in seinen Kopf. Er schien noch immer zwischen Sikes und Crackit zu gehen, die wütend stritten; denn die Worte, die sie sprachen, hallten in seinen Ohren wider; und als er seine eigene Aufmerksamkeit auf sich selbst lenkte, ... fand er, dass er mit ihnen sprach.... Plötzlich zuckte er zurück vor dem Knall der Schusswaffen; es erhob sich ein lautes Geschrei und Jubel; Lichter schimmerten vor seinen Augen, und alles war Lärm und Tumult, als eine unsichtbare Hand ihn hastig fortgetragen hatte. Durch all diese raschen Visionen floss ein undefiniertes, unruhiges Bewusstsein von Schmerz, das ihn unaufhörlich quälte und zermürbte.“ (Dickens, 220)\n\nDie beiden Romane nutzen dieses Mysterium oft durch Traumsequenzen oder traumähnliche Zustände, obwohl Inhalt und Funktion in jedem spezifischen Fall variieren. In Oliver Twist offenbaren diese seltsamen Ereignisse oft Einblicke in Olivers innere Schichten, was ihn quält, und sein Bewusstsein für die wahre Natur der um ihn herum stattfindenden Dinge. Wenn die Schießerei von Oliver schließlich im Kapitel 28 erneut beleuchtet wird, erlebt Oliver die Schießerei lebhaft wieder, als wäre er träumend, während er nach Hilfe sucht (siehe links). Der Abschnitt betont das mangelnde Kontrollverhältnis, das Oliver über die sich abspielenden Ereignisse hatte, sowie die düstere Lage, in der sich seine Gesundheit befand, was stark durch Olivers Halluzinationen von Sikes und Crackit zum Ausdruck kam. Die Schießerei selbst überwältigt ihn, alle seine Sinne sind taub, da er die „unsichtbare Hand“ nicht bemerkt, die ihn wegträgt; er erlebt seinen Verzweiflung erneut, getrennt vom Schock des Schmerzes, da der Schmerz nun ständig ist und mit Furcht verbunden ist, anstatt mit Überraschung. Da Oliver überwältigt ist, stellt sich die Frage, wessen Wille seinen Unglück gebracht hat, denn es war sicherlich nicht sein eigener. Diese Schießerei verstärkt die Vorstellung, dass Oliver wenig Kontrolle über irgendetwas hat, da er sich nicht einmal bemüht, den Ausgang eines Ereignisses zu kontrollieren, selbst wenn sein Leben in Gefahr ist. Ein wachsendes Gefühl der Niederlage bei Oliver wird auch durch diese Auswahl impliziert, als ob der alte Fagin ihn gebrochen hätte und ihn zwingen würde, diese Verzweiflung zu akzeptieren und seine Fähigkeit zu beeinflussen, zu reagieren. Denn sonst könnte man annehmen, dass Oliver sich zumindest für sein eigenes Leben bemüht hätte.\n\n\n„Der Tag verging – Tag! Es gab keinen Tag; er war sogleich verschwunden, als er gekommen war – und die Nacht kam wieder; eine so lange, und doch so kurze Nacht; lang in ihrer schrecklichen Stille und kurz in ihren vorüberfliegenden Stunden.“\n\n[REWRITE]\n\nVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.

Ich habe mein Bestes gegeben, um ihnen bei allen Fächern zu helfen, in denen sie Schwierigkeiten hatten, aber meine Stärken lagen in Englisch und Lesen. Eine der Lehrerinnen fragte mich, ob ich einem kleinen Jungen namens Adrian helfen könnte (ich glaube, er war in der dritten oder vierten Klasse), der große Probleme beim Lesen hatte. Mir wurde klar, dass etwas nicht stimmte; er hatte die merkwürdigsten Probleme. Einige Buchstaben konnte er perfekt aussprechen, andere überhaupt nicht, es war das Seltsamste. Du weißt, er war lateinamerikanischer Abstammung, das war mir sicher, aber der Junge sprach perfekt Englisch. Wir hatten Schwierigkeiten, bis ich an dem Tag seine Mutter traf, als ich ein paar Kinder betreute (um es euphemistisch auszudrücken), während der Rest der Nachmittagsgruppe auf einem Ausflug war. Seine Mutter sprach kein Wort Englisch, nur Spanisch. Mit meinem sehr schlechten Spanisch (ich lernte gerade erst) konnten wir uns verständigen. Aber genau in diesem Moment wurde mir klar wie ein Schlag: Adrian konnte gut lesen, er kannte aber das englische Alphabet nicht sehr gut. Ich weiß nicht, ob diese Erkenntnis ihm jemals wirklich weitergeholfen hat, aber ich hoffe wirklich, dass es ihm jetzt besser geht.\n\nIch erzähle diese Geschichte, um das Problem der Sprachbarriere in Schulen, besonders hier in Kalifornien, zu beleuchten. Ich erzähle sie auch, um zu zeigen, dass es nicht immer so offensichtlich ist, wie wir denken. Auch für ein Kind, das perfekt Englisch spricht, kann es beim Lesen eine große Hürde sein. Ich denke, jeder kann sich einig sein, dass dieses Problem besteht, also was können wir tun? In Adrians Fall war die Lösung relativ einfach: Nachhilfe im Lesen auf Englisch, insbesondere im Hinblick auf Alphabet und Aussprache. Aber für viele Kinder, die kaum Englisch sprechen, ist die Lösung viel komplexer. Es gibt keine einfache Lösung. Das zweisprachige System, die Immersion in den Mainstream, private Nachhilfe, ESL-Kurse, keiner dieser Faktoren allein kann dieses Problem lösen. Der Schlüssel liegt darin, all diese Maßnahmen zu kombinieren!\n\nZunächst einmal ist das zweisprachige System eine großartige Idee. Nicht nur für Kinder, deren Muttersprache Spanisch ist, sondern für alle Kinder. „Kinder in zweisprachigen Bildungsprogrammen haben im Vergleich zu ihren Altersgenossen bessere akademische Leistungen erzielt.“ Um dieses Konzept ranken sich viele Ängste, dass es eine Verschwendung von Ressourcen ist und dass die Mehrheit der Schüler in den Schulen keinen Nutzen davon ziehen würde. Aber das ist falsch. Wenn wir diese Art von Programmen in den Klassenzimmern als Regel, anstatt als Ausnahme, einführen würden, würden alle Kinder davon profitieren. Aber wie gehen wir dabei vor? Sollten wir alle Lehrer zweisprachig machen? Nein. Das wäre unvernünftig und etwas unrealistisch. Ich denke jedoch, dass es keinen Grund gibt, warum wir nicht spezielle Assistenten, Tutoren, wie immer man sie nennen möchte, haben können, die zweisprachig sind. \n\n\n\n[REWRITE]\nA couple years ago, I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students.

The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.

If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\nI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one. So I had not. I could not watch the life that created me while it ended. I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died. Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.

Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers. Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents. However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe. We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place. Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality. We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.

The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",

Der Begriff „Lieferkettenmanagement“ wurde 1982 von Keith Oliver, einem Berater, erfunden. Keith Oliver beschrieb den gesamten Prozess der Planung, Implementierung und Kontrolle dessen, was in der Lieferkette passiert, um die Kundenbedürfnisse schnell und effizient zu erfüllen. Es gibt sechs Schlüsselkomponenten einer Lieferkette: Produktion, Versorgung, Lagerhaltung, Standort, Transport und Information. Manager verwenden diese sechs Schlüsselkomponenten, um den besten Kundenservice zu bieten. \n\nDie Produktion ist der erste Schritt im Lieferkettenprozess. Die Produktion bildet die Grundlage für den gesamten Lieferkettenprozess. Die Produktionsstufe legt fest, wann, warum, wo und wie alles produziert werden soll. Manager müssen wissen, was Kunden wollen. Um zu wissen, was Kunden wollen, können Manager den Markt betrachten. Der Markt ist der größte Indikator, um die Kundennachfrage zu bestimmen. Sobald die Manager den Markt analysiert und die Kundennachfrage verstanden haben, sind sie bereit, zu entscheiden, welche Produkte produziert werden sollen und wie viele davon produziert werden sollen. Nachdem die Geschäftsführung entschieden hat, was produziert wird und wie viele Stückzahlen, sind sie bereit, zu entscheiden, wo die Produkte produziert werden sollen und welche Fabrik am besten für das Volumen und die Qualität der Ware geeignet ist, wobei die Kundenzufriedenheit berücksichtigt wird. \n\nNachdem der Produktionsort für die Produkte festgelegt wurde, konzentriert sich der nächste Schritt auf die Planung der Arbeitsbelastung und die Wartung der Geräte. Die Produktion ist ein sehr wichtiger Schritt im Lieferkettenprozess. Jedes Detail ist während des gesamten Prozesses wichtig. Wenn nicht jedes Detail entsprechend geplant wird, kann dies dem Unternehmen langfristig viel Zeit und Geld kosten. Zum Beispiel habe ich früher in den Einzelhandelsketten Wal-Mart und Target gearbeitet. Beide Unternehmen haben ein Design, ein Handbuch und einen Prozess für jede Einheit des Geschäfts. Es gibt eine festgelegte Anordnung, wie das Erscheinungsbild der Arbeitskleidung eines Mitarbeiters von der Annahme der Sendungen von LKWs bis hin zur Präsentation im Geschäft aussieht. Durch die Definition von Prozessen kann ein Unternehmen reibungslos arbeiten, ohne dass es zu Verwirrung hinsichtlich der Richtung und der Erwartungen kommt.\n\nDas zweite Schlüsselprinzip im Lieferkettenmanagement ist die Versorgung. Die Versorgung wird als die strategischen Entscheidungen definiert, die getroffen werden sollten, um die Kernkapazitäten einer Einrichtung zu bestimmen und die Partnerschaften im Bereich der Out Sourcing sollten aus diesen Entscheidungen hervorgehen. Ein Unternehmen kann viele verschiedene Produktionsabteilungen für ein einzelnes Produkt haben. Jede Abteilung besteht aus unterschiedlichen Geräten, Arbeitern und Spezialisierungen. Der Manager muss entscheiden, welche Abteilung am besten zu den verschiedenen Produktionsprozessen des Produkts passt. Die Geschäftsführung kann auch entscheiden, die Arbeit an andere Unternehmen auszulagern. Der Hauptgrund, warum ein Manager die Arbeit an andere Unternehmen auslagert, ist die Steigerung der Geschwindigkeit. Geschwindigkeit ist die Fähigkeit, Qualität und Flexibilität zu gewährleisten, während gleichzeitig die Kosten gesenkt oder niedrige Kostensätze aufrechterhalten werden. \n\n\n[REWRITE] Supply chain management is the process of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer.

Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",

Burma, auch bekannt als Myanmar, ist ein südostasiatisches Land, das von einer tyrannischen militanten Junta regiert wird, die 1962 durch einen Staatsstreich an die Macht kam. 2007 fanden eine Reihe von Straßenprotesten statt, die ersten öffentlichen Proteste seit einem Jahrzehnt. Geleitet von einer großen Anzahl burmesischer Mönche, wurden diese Proteste „Die Safranrevolution“ genannt, benannt nach der Farbe der Roben, die die Mönche trugen. Nach den ersten Aufständen zeigte sich die breite Öffentlichkeit zunehmend an den Protesten interessiert, und während die burmesische Regierung zunächst widerwillig zuließ, dass sich die Mönche an friedlichen Versammlungen beteiligten, eskalierte die Gewalt bald in einen, was einige als einen offenen Krieg zwischen Mönchen und der Militärjunta sahen, wobei die Armee aktiv Mönche und Tempel im ganzen Land angriff und plünderte. Ausländische Journalisten wurden sofort verhaftet und inhaftiert, der japanische Fotojournalist Kenji Nagai wurde am 27. September 2007 getötet, einfach nur weil er an einem Straßenprotest anwesend war. Während die offizielle Todesbilanz bei 13 Toten liegt, wird der desertierte Offizier Hla Win, der einige Tage vor dem offiziellen Bericht aus der Armee desertierte, mit den Worten zitiert: „In den letzten Tagen wurden mehr Menschen getötet, als Sie gehört haben. Die Leichen können in mehreren tausend gezählt werden.“\n\nDas ist nichts Neues. Während dies einige der jüngsten Beispiele für Gräueltaten in unserer Welt sind, hat der Wunsch eines Regimes, Andersdenkende niederzuschlagen und die vollständige Kontrolle über seine Bürger zu behalten, so lange es Zivilisation gibt. Frühere römische Kaiser erklärten sich selbst als vom Gott auserwählt, die absolute Exekutive über jeden Aspekt ihrer Gesellschaft zu führen. Es wird angenommen, dass japanische Kaiser tatsächlich Götter sind, die in unsere Welt gesandt wurden, um ihr Volk durch die Erfindung von Motorola-Handys und Hara-Kiri zum Wohlstand zu führen, und unser aktueller Präsident George W. Bush hat wöchentliche Telefonkonferenzen mit Ted Haggard, dem Leiter von Stupid People Worldwide, einer Tochtergesellschaft der Republikanischen Partei.\n\nEinige der bekanntesten Beispiele für solche Handlungen sind Ereignisse wie der Protest vom 4. Juni 1989 auf dem Platz des Himmlischen Friedens, bei dem Intellektuelle, Arbeitsaktivisten und Studenten zusammenkamen, um gegen die autoritäre Herrschaft der Regierung zu protestieren. Die Todesopferzahlen in diesem Fall weichen stark voneinander ab, wobei offizielle Berichte der chinesischen Regierung 200-300 Tote und Berichte des chinesischen Roten Kreuzes zwischen 2.000 und 3.000 Toten angeben. Ein weiteres Beispiel ist der Völkermord in Ruanda in den 1990er Jahren, bei dem Hutu-Milizen, unterstützt von der ruandischen Regierung, systematisch Tutsis und politische Moderaten, unabhängig von ihren ethnischen Hintergründen, ermordeten. Hitlers „Drittes Reich“, eine mehrere Jahre und mehrere Länder umfassende Periode, in der jeder jüdischen Abstammung zusammengetrieben und getötet wurde, ist ein weiteres extremes Beispiel.\n\n\n\n\n[REWRITE] Hitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign.

Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta that came into power in 1962 through a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest.

Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career.

    "raw_output": "Duke Ellington’s Erbe im Jazz stammt zum großen Teil aus seiner Langlebigkeit und, in Erweiterung, seiner kreativen Fähigkeit, sein Orchester zu formen. Ellingsons Präsenz am Klavier ist in vielen der für diese Aufgabe ausgewählten Kompositionen subtil, aber als Komponist übertraf Ellington sich darin, reichhaltige und komplexe Stücke zu kreieren, die die individuellen Fähigkeiten der Bandmitglieder in den Vordergrund stellten. Ellington schuf den Rahmen, in dem ein Solist frei improvisieren konnte, zusätzlich zu dicht orchestrierten Stücken und Phrasen, die den jeweiligen Stil der Bandmitglieder aufriefen, um musikalische Ideen hervorzuheben. Dabei betonte er auch den Ton des Orchesters im Allgemeinen und schuf kohärente und originelle Klänge, die zu jedem Stück passten. Ellingsons Beherrschung des individuellen Klangs der Musiker sowie ihrer Zusammenspielweise in einem wachsenden Ensemble ermöglichte es ihm, einige der innovativsten und brillantesten Stücke der Jazzgeschichte zu schreiben.\n\nDas Grove Music-Lexikon erwähnt in seiner Betrachtung von Ellingsons Klang und Innovation „Creole Love Call“ in Bezug auf die Verwendung der Stimme „als Jazzinstrument“ im Laufe seiner Karriere. Dies ist ein frühes Beispiel für Ellingsons Verwendung der Stimme, um Textur und Farbe hinzuzufügen, ohne sich von Texten behindern zu lassen. „Creole Love Call“ demonstriert auch Ellingsons Fähigkeit, den Stil seiner Solisten zu ergänzen, was sich in seiner gesamten Karriere zeigt. Dieses langsame, vorsichtige Bluesstück in zwölf Takten enthält sechs Strophen:\n\nStrophen:\nStrophen 1: Call and Response zwischen Stimme und Holzbläsern, wobei die Stimme glatt und melodisch beginnt, dann am Ende zu einem raueren Klang übergeht.\nStrophen 2: Dämpfter Trompetensolo, das die grundlegende Melodie weiterentwickelt und mehrere verlängerte Bluesnoten betont.\nStrophen 3: Weites Klarinettensolo in hoher Lage, unterstützt von einer subtilen synkopierten Begleitung am Klavier.\nStrophen 4: Das ganze Orchester wiederholt die erste Strophe mit einem Call and Response der Bläser- und Holzbläser-Sektionen.\nStrophen 5: Die klimaktürliche Strophe des Stückes, da die Holzbläser nun den Call and Response in hoher Lage beginnen, unterstützt von synkopiertem Stop-Time der Bläser- und Rhythmus-Sektionen.\nStrophen 6: Rückkehr zur Struktur der ersten Strophe mit Call and Response zwischen Stimme und Holzbläsern. In dieser Strophe übernimmt die Stimme den Klang der „Growl“-Technik und spielt als Instrument solo.\nTag: Kurzes Tag-Feature mit einem vokalen Lauf und einem dissonanten, neuartigen Ende durch ein Trombon.\n\nEllingsons Verwendung der Stimme, um der Komposition eine Dimension der Farbigkeit hinzuzufügen, ist ein Beispiel für ein stilistisches Merkmal, das sich durch seine Arbeit zieht. \nIn „Hot and Bothered“, aufgenommen ein Jahr später, kombiniert Ellington seine Fähigkeit zur dichten Orchestration mit seinem Gespür für Klangfarbe. Ein Call and Response-Motiv zwischen „Bubber“ Miley an der dämpfenden Trompete und Baby Cox’s Scatt-Gesang verwendet die vokalen Elemente von Miley’s Spiel und die instrumentalen Aspekte von Cox’s Stimme, um einen reichen und komplementären Klang zu erzeugen. „It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing)“ erweitert diese Ideen, da Ellington Joe „Tricky Sam“ Nanton, einen Stammgast in Ellingsons Orchester, effektiv einsetzt, um die Melodie an der dämpfenden Posaune einzuführen.\n\n\n[REWRITE] Duke Ellington’s legacy in jazz stems largely from his longevity and, by extension, his creative ability to shape his orchestra.

Oft stellte sie sich diese seltsame Vorstellung Fragen und versuchte zu begreifen, was möglicherweise dazu führen konnte, dass ein so seltsames Ding mit einem jungen Mädchen passiert war.

The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",

Der Body-Mass-Index, der Rauchstatus, der Aspirin-Konsum, der Multivitamin-Konsum, der Menopausalstatus und die Verwendung von postmenopausalen Hormonen wurden für jedes FFQ berechnet, und ab 1986 wurde die Freizeitaktivität beurteilt.\n\nUm die zufällige Variation für einen einzelnen zu reduzieren und den langfristigen Nahrungsmittelkonsum besser darzustellen, wurden kumulative Durchschnittswerte des aMed-Scores aus den wiederholten FFQs berechnet (Durchschnittswert der Werte aus den beiden vorhergehenden Jahren). Anpassungen wurden für „Konfundentien“ (Faktoren, die die Ergebnisse verzerren könnten) vorgenommen, indem Alter, Rauchen, BMI, Menopause-Status, Verwendung von postmenopausalen Hormonen, Multivitamin-Einnahme, Alkoholkonsum, körperliche Aktivität und Aspirin-Einnahme berücksichtigt wurden.\n\nDie Cox-Proportional-Hazard-Modellierung wurde verwendet, um die Beziehung zwischen einem aMed-Score und dem Risiko für KHK und Schlaganfall zu bewerten, wobei separate Modelle für tödliche und nicht-tödliche KHK- und Schlaganfalltypen verwendet wurden.\n\nEine höhere Einhaltung der mediterranen Ernährung, wie sie sich in einem höheren aMed-Ernährungsscore widerspiegelt, ging mit einem geringeren Risiko für einen eintrittenden KHK und Schlaganfall bei Frauen einher. Während der 20-jährigen Nachbeobachtung wurden 2391 Fälle von KHK, 1763 Fälle von Schlaganfall und 1077 Todesfälle durch kardiovaskuläre Erkrankungen (tödliche KHK und Schlaganfälle kombiniert) festgestellt. Frauen im oberen aMed-Quintil waren sowohl für KHK als auch für Schlaganfall im Vergleich zu denen im unteren Quintil mit einem geringeren Risiko verbunden ( Relatives Risiko [RR], 0,71).\n\n\n[REWRITE]\nThis study showed that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, was associated with a reduced risk of incident coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke in women. Over 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).

Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.

Die Arbeitslosigkeit stieg, der Immobilienmarkt brach zusammen und viele der größten und wichtigsten Unternehmen Amerikas wurden ruiniert. Diese Rezession hält bis heute an, daher müssen wir uns fragen: Wie kam es zu dieser Krise und wie können wir sie stoppen? Kurz gesagt, die Finanzkrise wurde durch egoistisches und naives politisches Entscheidungsverhalten verursacht, das Banken und Unternehmen unter Druck setzte, Subprime-Kredite in eine bereits unreife und unzureichende Finanzinfrastruktur zu vergeben.  Gleichzeitig wurden Fannie Mae (FNMA) und Freddie Mac (FHLMC) unter Druck gesetzt, diese Hypotheken in CDOs und CDSs zu unterzeichnen und neu zu strukturieren. Als Kreditnehmer diese Kredite nicht zurückzahlen konnten, waren die Banken an Kapitalreserven knapp und übertrugen dieses Chaos auf die neu strukturierten Hypotheken, die sie verkauft hatten, und auf den Rest der Wirtschaft. \n\nDie Finanzkrise hatte ihre Wurzeln im Jahr 1999 der Clinton-Ära, als der Präsident sich auf eine zweite Amtszeit zielte. Er strebte danach, seine Präsidentschaft zu verlängern, indem er seine Popularität erhöhte. Um dies zu erreichen, lockerte die Clinton-Administration die Kreditbeschränkungen, was sieben Jahre später die Bühne für die Subprime-Krise bereitete. Steven Holmes vom New York Times berichtete 1999: „Fannie Mae, der größte Vermittler von Hypotheken in den USA, steht unter increasingem Druck von der Clinton-Administration, Hypotheken für Menschen mit niedrigem und mittlerem Einkommen zu vergeben, und fühlt sich durch Aktionäre unter Druck, das phänomenale Wachstum der Gewinne aufrechtzuerhalten.“ Holmes sollte die Folgen dieser Maßnahmen vorhersagen: „Die staatlich subventionierte Gesellschaft könnte in einer Wirtschaftskrise Schwierigkeiten bekommen und eine staatliche Rettung ähnlich der der Spar- und Darlehensinstitute in den 1980er Jahren erforderlich machen.“ Wie in der Einleitung und wie Holmes vorhergesagt wurde, würden schlecht durchdachte Kredite sicherlich zum Zusammenbruch der Wirtschaft führen.\n\nViele Faktoren trugen dazu bei, die Wirtschaft ins Strudel zu stürzen, darunter die neue und komplexe Struktur der Hypotheken. Variable Zinssätze, hypothekenbesicherte Wertpapiere und kolateralisierte Schuldenobligationen (CDOs) wurden in den Jahren vor der Krise umfassend eingesetzt und dienten nur dazu, mehr Sektoren der Wirtschaft an den Immobilienmarkt zu knüpfen. Dies führte dazu, dass sich US-Haushalte und Finanzmärkte im Allgemeinen im Immobilienmarkt überverliehen, was sie extrem anfällig für selbst kleine Preisänderungen machte. \n\nTatsächlich platzte die Immobilienblase, und die Finanzinstitute, die diese hypothekenbesicherten Wertpapiere gekauft hatten, wurden zurückgewiesen. Die fünf größten US-Investmentbanken meldeten zusammen im Jahr 2007 Hypothekenkredite in Höhe von 4,1 Billionen US-Dollar, was etwa 30 % des BIP der USA ausmachte. Letztendlich wurden Bear Sterns und Merrill Lynch zu äußerst niedrigen Preisen verkauft, Lehman Brothers wurde aufgelöst und Goldman Sachs und Morgan Stanley wurden gezwungen, zu kommerziellen Banken zu werden, die einer intensiven Regulierung unterzogen wurden. Fannie und Freddie hatten eine Schuldenbelastung von 5 Billionen US-Dollar für Hypotheken und wurden im September 2008 unter staatliche Kontrolle gestellt.\n\n\n\n## English Translation:\n\n[REWRITE]\nIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a devastating financial crisis.

    "original": "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon.

    "raw_output": "Ich habe zwei Nachrichten aus Columbus, Ohio, gesehen. Der erste, der „live“ war, war NBC 4 heute Morgen (13. August 2011). Die Hauptgeschichte handelte von einem Mann aus Ashley, Ohio, der seine Frau erstochen hatte. Sein Name wurde genannt, der ihrer nicht, aber sein Name war Shad Hostettler. Sie zeigten sein Tatfoto und er sah aus wie pure Bösewichts. Sie widmeten nur etwa zwei Minuten dieser Geschichte, da sie sich noch entwickelte. Die einzigen Details, die sie nannten, waren, dass er sie mehrmals gestochen hatte und verhaftet worden war. Ich denke, sie haben angemessene Zeit für diese Geschichte aufgewendet.\n\tDie zweite Geschichte handelte von einer Schießerei in den frühen Morgenstunden an Travis Buyers, 18. Er wurde in der Gegend von Sharon Woods erschossen und schwer verletzt; es gab zu diesem Zeitpunkt keine Festnahme oder Verdächtige. Das SWAT-Team ermittelte an der Tat. Diese Geschichte schien kurz zu sein, und ich glaube, das lag daran, dass es sich um einen „schwarzen“ Mann oder eine schwarze Nachbarschaft handelte. Ich habe bemerkt (und das schon seit Jahren), dass Minderheiten übersehen werden, wenn sie Opfer eines Verbrechens sind. Wenn ein „weißer“ Kind oder Erwachsener entführt, vermisst oder Opfer eines Verbrechens wird, explodiert die Medienlandschaft; aber wenn es sich um eine Minderheit handelt, ist es Glück, wenn es überhaupt erwähnt wird.\n\tDie nächste Geschichte handelte vom Schussloch, das in der Med-Flight-Hubschrauber gefunden worden war. Es wurden Details zu dem Ort gegeben, an dem man glaubte, dass die Tat stattfand. Es wurde festgestellt, dass es sich um eine .22-Kaliber-Kugel aus einem Gewehr handelte, die den Hubschrauber getroffen hatte. Crime-Stoppers bieten eine fünfttausend Dollar Prämie für Hinweise an, die zur Festnahme des Schützen führen.\n\tDie nächste Geschichte handelte von dem Regen und den Gewittern, die für Samstagnachmittag vorhergesagt wurden. Sie sagten, die Temperaturen würden über das Wochenende im mittleren bis unteren achtzigern bleiben. Die Länge war etwas kurz, aber sie wollten es als „Trailer“ verwenden, damit Sie dranbleiben.\n\tSie berichteten auch über einen Raubüberfall auf einen UDF in der Clime Road in Columbus. Sie sagten, es sei ein dunkelhäutiger schwarzer Mann gewesen, der den Laden beraubt habe. Er trug einen Kapuzenpullover. Sie sagten, er sei etwa sechs Fuß groß und wog etwa 150 Pfund. Ich fand, sie widmeten ungewöhnlich viel Zeit der Betonung, dass er schwarz war und wie dunkel er war.\n\tEs gab noch eine Geschichte über einen Rene Rodriguez, der ein verurteilter Drogenboss aus Texas war. Er war wegen Verschwörung zur Verteilung großer Mengen Marihuana von Texas nach Ohio verurteilt worden. Eine merkwürdige Sache, die ich bemerkt habe, war, dass sie statt zu sagen, er sei zu 25 Jahren Gefängnis verurteilt worden, „300“ Monate sagten. Ich bin mir nicht sicher, was der Hintergrund war, ob sie dachten, das klinge härter oder so. Sie erwähnten auch, dass er ein hispanischer Mann sei, ich glaube nicht, dass das wirklich für die Geschichte relevant war.\n\n\n\n[REWRITE] I watched two newscasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife; it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provided he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story.\n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus.

The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing.

Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to.

There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli.

    "raw_output": "## German Translation:\n\nDas menschliche Gehirn ist ein kompliziertes, kreatives System zur Informationsverarbeitung. Mit dem technologischen Fortschritt von primitiv zu modern entwickelten sich auch die Metaphern, die verwendet werden, um das Gehirn zu beschreiben. Anfangs wurde es mit einer Wachstafel verglichen, dann mit einem Papyrus, dann mit einem Buch und zuletzt mit einem Computer. Wenn Sie mehr über das Gehirn erfahren, bedenken Sie, dass die Nützlichkeit dieser Metaphern begrenzt ist und zu falschen Schlussfolgerungen führen kann.\nDie Informationsverarbeitung beginnt mit Eingaben von Sinnesorganen, die physikalische Reize wie Berührung, Wärme, Schallwellen oder Photonen des Lichts in elektrochemische Signale umwandeln. Die sensorischen Informationen werden von den Algorithmen des Gehirns sowohl in aufwärtsgerichteter als auch in abwärtsgerichteter Verarbeitung wiederholt umgewandelt. Zum Beispiel, wenn Sie ein Bild einer schwarzen Schachtel auf weißem Hintergrund betrachten, setzt die aufwärtsgerichtete Verarbeitung sehr einfache Informationen wie Farbe, Orientierung und die Grenzen des Objekts zusammen - wo sich die Farbe über einen kurzen Raum signifikant ändert - um zu entscheiden, dass Sie eine Schachtel sehen. Die abwärtsgerichtete Verarbeitung nutzt die Entscheidungen, die in einigen Schritten der aufwärtsgerichteten Verarbeitung getroffen wurden, um die Erkennung der Schachtel zu beschleunigen. Die abwärtsgerichtete Verarbeitung in diesem Beispiel kann Ihnen helfen, das Objekt als schwarze Schachtel und nicht als lochförmige Schachtelform auf weißem Hintergrund zu identifizieren.\nSobald Informationen bis zu einem gewissen Grad verarbeitet wurden, entscheidet ein Filter der Aufmerksamkeit, wie wichtig das Signal ist und welchen kognitiven Prozessen es zur Verfügung gestellt werden soll. Zum Beispiel verarbeitet Ihr Gehirn zwar jedes einzelne Grasbüschel, wenn Sie auf Ihre Schuhe schauen, aber ein gesundes Aufmerksamkeitssystem verhindert, dass Sie sie einzeln wahrnehmen. Im Gegensatz dazu könnten Sie Ihren Namen herausfinden, selbst wenn er in einem lauten Raum gesprochen wird. Es gibt viele Verarbeitungsschritte, und die Ergebnisse der Verarbeitung werden wiederholt durch die Aufmerksamkeit moduliert.\nDamit das Gehirn Informationen verarbeiten kann, muss es zunächst gespeichert werden. Es gibt verschiedene Arten von Gedächtnis, einschließlich sensorischem, Arbeitsgedächtnis und Langzeitgedächtnis. Zunächst werden Informationen kodiert. Es gibt Arten der Kodierung, die spezifisch für jede Art von Sinnesreizen sind. Zum Beispiel kann sprachlicher Input strukturell kodiert werden, was sich auf das Aussehen des gedruckten Wortes bezieht, phonetisch, was sich auf den Klang des Wortes bezieht, oder semantisch, was sich auf die Bedeutung des Wortes bezieht. Sobald Informationen gespeichert sind, müssen sie aufrechterhalten werden. Einige Tierstudien legen nahe, dass das Arbeitsgedächtnis, das Informationen für ungefähr 20 Sekunden speichert, durch ein elektrisches Signal aufrechterhalten wird, das für einen kurzen Zeitraum durch eine bestimmte Reihe von Neuronen läuft. Es wird vermutet, dass Informationen im Langzeitgedächtnis in der Struktur bestimmter Proteinarten aufrechterhalten werden.\nEs gibt zahlreiche Modelle, wie das Wissen im Gehirn organisiert ist, einige basieren auf der Art und Weise, wie menschliche Probanden Erinnerungen abrufen, andere auf Informatik und wieder andere auf Neurophysiologie. Das semantische Netzmodell besagt, dass es Knoten gibt, die Konzepte repräsentieren, und dass die Knoten aufgrund ihrer Verwandtschaft miteinander verbunden sind. Zum Beispiel könnte „Stuhl“ in einem semantischen Netzwerk mit „Tisch“ verknüpft sein, das wiederum mit „holzig“ verknüpft sein kann, und so weiter.\n\n\n[REWRITE]\n\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system.

    "original": "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.

    "raw_output": "## German Translation:\n\nAldous Huxley kritisiert die bevorstehende Bedrohung sowohl durch Technologie als auch durch die kapitalistische Struktur, die sie durch die Schaffung einer Dystopie in seinem Roman „Brave New World“ verstärkt. Seine Menschen schätzen Gemeinschaft über das Individuum und werden von Anfang an darauf konditioniert, oberstes Gut das unmittelbare Glück zu verfolgen. Die Bürger entpuppen sich als Bauern in einem größeren Spiel, eingeschränkt auf eine Ideologie, die vom Weltkontrolleur diktiert wird. Durch die Betrachtung des Werkes unter dem Blickwinkel des marxistischen Theismus bemerkt man die zugrunde liegenden Argwohn des Autors gegenüber der Entwicklung der genannten Systeme. Häufig verwendete Begriffe des Marxismus, wie Homogenität und Reifikation, unterstreichen die Idee, dass Huxleys Roman eine Kommentierung auf die Fehler der sich entwickelnden Wirtschaft seiner Zeit ist.\n\nDer Kapitalismus wird durch die Anwendung der marxistischen These des falschen Bewusstseins satirisiert. Im Wesentlichen wird der gemeine Bürger daran gehindert, die wahren Beziehungen zu anderen Klassen in wirtschaftlicher Hinsicht zu kennen, da er hauptsächlich an seinem eigenen Gewinn interessiert ist. Es wird als Folge der ideologischen Kontrolle des Proletariats und der einfachen Arbeiterklasse angesehen, was durch die Konditionierung der Menschen in „Brave New World“ deutlich wird. Die unteren Klassen, Delta, Gamma usw., haben keinen wahren Willen; durch Hypnopädie wird der Drang nach Konsum, nach Ausgaben und nach Ausschweifung über alles andere verstärkt. \n\nDies wird, wie bereits gesagt, vom Weltkontrolleur manipuliert. Hegemonie, also die Idee, dass Gruppen sozialer Klassen von einer separaten Gruppe von Individuen insgesamt dominiert werden, wird in diesem Fall offensichtlich eingesetzt. Die unteren Klassen sind völlig unkundig über die Manipulation, sie kaufen buchstäblich in eine Ideologie ein, die diese Struktur unterstützt (d.h. Kapitalismus & Konsumismus). Die oberen Klassen werden mit der Fähigkeit geboren, dies zu erkennen, tun es aber nicht; nur wenige Alphas oder Betas, außer Charakteren wie Bernard, tun mehr als ihrem Platz gleich zu stimmen. Tatsächlich sind die Interaktionen der sozialen Klassen, wie im Detail später diskutiert werden, bedeutende Indizien für die wahrgenommene Unterdrückung des Kapitalismus.\n\nBeziehungen zwischen verschiedenen Individuen existieren in „Brave New World“ nicht. Der Roman scheint die Charaktere nicht unterscheiden zu wollen - sie sind sogar bei den Hauptfiguren mangelhaft in ihrer Tiefe. Vielleicht deutet Huxley darauf hin, dass der Aufstieg von Technologie und Kapitalismus den Menschen ihren freien Willen und ihre Ausdrucksfreiheit nehmen. Liebe existiert nicht, ebenso wenig wie die Extreme einer jeden Emotion; stattdessen bleiben die Interaktionen oberflächlich, deutlich in den Bemerkungen der Männer über Frauen dargestellt, die sich hauptsächlich auf ihr äußeres Erscheinungsbild konzentrieren (z. B. pneumatisches Aussehen) und in den unverblümten Bemerkungen der Frauen über ihre Begegnungen. Darüber hinaus zeigt die Zufriedenheit jedes gesellschaftlichen Standes mit seinem Status in der Hierarchie die sozioökonomischen Auswirkungen des Kapitalismus. Ihre absolute Gehorsamkeit gegenüber ihrer Rolle in der Gemeinschaft ist ein Hinweis auf den marxistischen Gedanken über das Proletariat, das fälschlicherweise der Überlegenheit gegenüber allem anderen sicher ist, solange es konsumiert, gehorcht und in einer Reihe mit seinen Mitmenschen bleibt.\n\n## Rewritten English:\n\n[REWRITE]\nAldous Huxley criticizes the looming threat of both technology and the capitalist structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community over the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work through the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the author's underlying suspicions regarding the development of these aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeneity and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley's novel is a commentary on the flaws in the emerging economy of his time.\n\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing the true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite evident by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else. This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller. Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case.

    "raw_output": "## German Translation:\n\nIch bin jetzt schon zweieinhalb Jahre, also vierhälfe Semester, Student hier am University Park. Für viele, einschließlich mir selbst, kann die Fortbewegung auf dem Campus ein Problem sein. Im ersten Studienjahr wurde ich in einem Studentenwohnheim in den East Halls untergebracht; ziemlich genau die östlichste Grenze des Campus, wenn man das Stadion und das Bryce Jordan Center nicht mitzählt. Die Reise von meinem Zuhause im Stuart Hall zu Vorlesungen in so weit entfernten Orten wie dem Willardgebäude, nahe dem Zentrum des Campus, konnte zu Fuß bis zu 25 Minuten dauern, besonders wenn das Wetter schlecht war, was in State College oft der Fall ist. In einem Gespräch mit einem etwas älteren Absolventen erfuhr ich, dass die East Halls-Studentenwohnheime vor langer Zeit von dem Rest der Schule durch riesige, unbenutzte Flächen getrennt waren. Heute wurde dieser leere Platz mit Sportplätzen, riesigen neuen Gebäuden, einschließlich der neuen Creamery und des neuen Gesundheitszentrums, gefüllt und von Wohnungen umgeben. Da sich unser Campus weiter ausdehnt, wird es immer schwieriger, von einem Ort zum anderen zu gelangen. Was ist die beste Lösung für das Mobilitätsproblem? Auf einem College-Campus ist es das Fahrrad. Aber das Fahrrad allein löst keine Probleme. Studenten müssen sie benutzen, und der Campus muss so gebaut sein, dass er den Bedürfnissen von Radfahrern entspricht.\nIch sprach mit einem Freund, der vor kurzem nach einer einjährigen Pause wieder mit dem Fahrradfahren angefangen hat. Er erwähnte, dass er sich fragte, warum er jemals aufgehört hatte. „Fahrräder sind fantastisch“, sagte er, „einige Jahre lang war es nicht cool, Fahrrad zu fahren, aber es ist der einzige Weg, um sich fortzubewegen.“ Neben der Tatsache, dass Radfahren gut für den Körper ist, ist es die effizienteste Art, sich zu bewegen. Eine Schüssel Haferflocken und ein wenig körperliche Anstrengung bringen dich 30 Meilen oder mehr weit. Wie viele Studenten lebe ich jetzt außerhalb des Campus; genauso weit vom Campuszentrum entfernt wie einige Wohnheime. Die klügste Entscheidung, die ich dieses Jahr getroffen habe, war, ein Fahrrad zu kaufen. Jeden Tag habe ich Unterricht im Thomas-Gebäude, was zu Fuß leicht eine Viertelstunde von meinem Zuhause entfernt ist. Mit dem Fahrrad kann ich die Zeit auf 5 Minuten verkürzen, wenn ich schnell genug fahre. Das einzige Problem ist, dass die Pollock Road der direkteste Weg zum Thomas-Gebäude von meinem Haus ist und es nicht immer ein einfacher Weg ist, Fahrrad oder nicht, zu fahren. Es gibt vieles zu sagen für das Gehen, aber persönlich bin ich zu beschäftigt, um zu gehen. Ohne mein Fahrrad wäre Gehen meine einzige zuverlässige Option, um zur Vorlesung zu gelangen. Täglich zu Thomas zu Fuß zu gehen, würde jeden Tag zusätzliche 30 bis 40 Minuten in meinem Tag stehlen. Das sind über zweieinhalb Stunden jede Woche. Wenn man bedenkt, dass ich auch für andere Vorlesungen, Termine und dergleichen zu Fuß unterwegs sein müsste, dann wäre das mehr Zeit, als ich mir leisten kann. \n\n[REWRITE]\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years, or four and a half semesters.
