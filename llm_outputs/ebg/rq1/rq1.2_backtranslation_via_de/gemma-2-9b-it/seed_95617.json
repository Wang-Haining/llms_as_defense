Zu den Werten, die ich in den Bereich der Sozialarbeit einbringen kann, gehören: Dienstbereitschaft, Respekt, ethisches Verhalten, Engagement für die Verbesserung der Beziehungen zwischen Menschen und das Streben nach persönlicher Weiterentwicklung, um in meinem Fachgebiet kompetent zu bleiben. Diese Kernwerte sind nicht nur für Sozialarbeiter wichtig, sondern auch persönlich für mich.\n\nIch habe schon immer anderen helfen wollen, war mir aber unsicher, welchen Karriereweg ich einschlagen sollte. Während meiner Schul- und Studienzeit habe ich viele Menschen gesehen, die vor ihren Problemen in Denunziation flüchteten, und einige nutzten weniger als ideale Bewältigungsmechanismen. Aufgrund der Situationen, die ich erlebt habe, entschied ich mich, einen Bachelorabschluss in Psychologie zu erwerben. Noch immer unsicher über einen Karriereweg, entschied ich mich, nach meinem Abschluss am Piedmont College im Jahr 2009 eine Pause einzulegen. Eines Tages im Sommer besuchte ich einen Freund, der mir einen sechzehnjährigen Jungen auf ihrer Couch nervös beim Sitzen vorstellte. Sie erklärte mir, warum er sie besuchte: um seinen misshandelnden Eltern zu entkommen. Am nächsten Tag erfuhr ich, dass er die Polizei zu seinem elterlichen Haus gerufen hatte. Um zu sehen, wie ich ihm helfen konnte, fuhr ich zu den Eltern des Jungen. Dort erklärte ich meinen Bedenken gegenüber der Polizei und sagte ihnen, dass ich gerade meinen Psychologie-Abschluss am Piedmont College abgeschlossen hatte. Die Polizei bat mich, mit den Eltern zu sprechen, da die Gesetze nichts für den Teenager tun konnten. Als ich die Eltern über die Situation befragte, wirkten sie nervös und nutzten Ausreden, um das „manipulative“ Verhalten ihres Sohnes zu beschreiben, dass er externe Hilfe in Anspruch nahm, um „einfache“ Streitigkeiten zu lösen. Nach diesem Erlebnis begann ich ernsthaft, über eine Karriere in der Sozialarbeit nachzudenken, um Kindern bei „einfachen“ familiären Streitigkeiten zu helfen.\n\nEin weiterer Wert, der für den Bereich der Sozialarbeit wichtig ist, ist soziale Gerechtigkeit. Als Gesellschaft behaupten wir, dass der Einzelne wichtig ist und dass wir diejenigen, die wir verloren haben, trauern. Das Konzept des „Einzelgängers“, das die Gesellschaft vertritt, ist eher ein Anhänger von archaischen Traditionen als ein Ausdruck echter Einzigartigkeit. Wenn die Gesellschaft also verstorbene Individuen beweint, warum streben wir dann danach, uns allen gleich zu sein? Ich bin ein Individuum und genieße es nicht, meine Möglichkeiten einzuschränken, um mich anderen anzupassen. Während meiner Schul- und Studienzeit habe ich mich immer wieder gegen soziale Ungerechtigkeit protestiert, wann immer es mir möglich war: Meine Haare in unnatürlichen Farben färben, Kleidung tragen, die zu meiner Persönlichkeit passt, meine Ohren über die traditionellen Grenzen hinweg durchstechen lassen, meine Mitgliedschaft in der GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance) erklären, gegen Rassismus und Diskriminierung protestieren, wann immer ich sie beobachtete, usw. Ich glaube an soziale Gerechtigkeit und werde mich weiterhin gegen soziale Ungerechtigkeit einsetzen.\n\n[REWRITE]\nIn pursuing a career in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families.

The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified.

Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual.

Das biologische Modell konzentriert sich auf vererbte genetische Informationen sowie medizinische Aspekte der Gesundheit. Die soziokulturellen Modelle betrachten Umweltbeziehungen und ihre Anwendung auf Rasse, Ethnizität, Demografie und sozioökonomischen Status. Die folgende Überprüfung von Schlaflosigkeit betrachtet diese Modelle und erläutert jedes gewählte Forschungsstück, das den Modellen zugrunde liegt und sie besser erklären soll. Die Erklärungen der Forschungsergebnisse und ihre Ergebnisse werden dann kritisch hinterfragt, um ihre spezifischen Stärken und Schwächen zu erwähnen.\n\nEine Schlafstörung kann als primäre Schlafstörung, als Schlafstörung im Zusammenhang mit einer anderen psychischen Störung oder als Schlafstörung, die auf andere Probleme zurückzuführen ist, charakterisiert werden. Die primären Schlafstörungen sind Dyssomnien oder Parasomnien, während Schlafstörungen, die mit einer anderen psychischen Störung in Verbindung stehen, mit einer Störung der Achse I oder Achse II zusammenhängen. Andere Kategorien von Schlafstörungen können auf medizinische Komplikationen oder den Konsum einer Substanz zurückzuführen sein. Die Dyssomnien sind: Primäre Schlaflosigkeit, primäre Hypersomnie, Narkolepsie, schlafbezogene Atemwegstörung, zirkadiane Rhythmus-Schlafstörung und Dyssomnie, die nicht anders spezifiziert sind (NOS). Während die primäre Schlaflosigkeit eine Komplikation bei ausreichender oder erhaltener Schlafqualität ist, besteht die primäre Hypersomnie in Schwierigkeiten, wach zu bleiben, sowohl für mindestens einen Monat. Narkolepsie beinhaltet Kataplexie und/oder automatisches REM. Während sich Dyssomnien auf das Einschlafen und Durchschlafen konzentrieren, sind Parasomnien Schlafstörungen, die mit Verhaltensabweichungen und/oder physiologischen Ereignissen verbunden sind. Parasomnien sind: Albtraumstörung, Schlafterrorstörung, Schlafwandeln und Parasomnien, die nicht anders spezifiziert sind. Schlafstörungen, die mit einer anderen psychischen Störung in Verbindung stehen, betreffen Schlafprobleme aufgrund von Achse I (klinische Störungen) oder Achse II (Persönlichkeitsstörungen oder geistige Behinderung). Die folgende Überprüfung konzentriert sich auf Schlaflosigkeit und etwas auf primäre Schlafstörungen im Allgemeinen in Bezug auf die biologischen und soziokulturellen Modelle.\n\nDas biologische Modell von Schlafstörungen konzentriert sich auf Gene, vererbte Faktoren und physiologische Aspekte von Schlafstörungen. Neuronen im Hypothalamus, die Orexin enthalten, sind für die Regulierung von Schlaf und Wachheit verantwortlich. Diese Studie experimentierte mit Mäusen und fand heraus, dass es phänotypische GABAB-Rezeptoren auf den Orexin-Neuronen gibt, die speziell für Schlaf- und Wachzustände verantwortlich sind. Die Aktivierung des GABAA-Rezeptors induziert Antworten, die den Schlaf fördern. Wenn es verhindert wird, zu feuern, kann dies zu einer Reduzierung der Angstzustände führen und den Schlaf induzieren. Das GABAB-Agonist (Baclofen) erhöhte die Schlafzeit (Matsuki et al., 2009). Solche Ergebnisse implizieren, dass Tiermodelle von Mäusen für Studien an Menschen verallgemeinert werden können. Dies zeigt, dass es sowohl eine genetische als auch eine Umweltbasis für den physischen GABAB-Rezeptor beim Menschen gibt. Ein Problem oder ein Mangel an diesem Rezeptor könnte die Fähigkeit einer Person beeinträchtigen, ohne Medikamente ausreichend zu schlafen. Die soziokulturelle Implikation dieser Studie ist, dass, wenn das Phänotyp sich vererbt, dies den Schlaf regulieren könnte und eine Veränderung des Rezeptors den Schlaf eines Individuums natürlich stören würde. Dies hätte negative Auswirkungen auf Aspekte des Lebens wie Schule, Karriere und alltägliche Ereignisse, die monotone Aufgaben und Konzentration erfordern.\n\n\n[REWRITE]\nThis paper examines biological and sociocultural models in relation to the sleep disorder insomnia.

Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",

Anschließend wird die Diagnose erläutert, einschließlich häufigster Merkmale oder „Alarmsignale“. Abschließend fasst das Papier zusammen, wie ein Lehrer in einem integrativen Klassenzimmer einen Schüler mit CAPD unterstützen kann.\n\n\tDas zentrale auditorische Verarbeitung Disorder (CAPD) oder das Auditive Verarbeitung Disorder (APD) „bezieht sich auf die Effizienz und Wirksamkeit, mit der das zentrale Nervensystem (ZNS) auditive Informationen nutzt. Eng definiert, bezieht sich (C)AP auf die perzeptive Verarbeitung auditiver Informationen im ZNS und die neurobiologischen Aktivitäten, die dieser Verarbeitung zugrunde liegen und zu elektrophysiologischen auditorischen Potenzialen führen“ (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Das bedeutet, es handelt sich um eine Störung, bei der das zentrale Nervensystem (d.h. das Gehirn) Dinge, die gehört werden, nicht ordnungsgemäß verarbeiten kann. Menschen mit CAPD können normal hören und werden daher nicht als „hörend beeinträchtigt“ betrachtet. Vielmehr funktioniert der Bereich des Gehirns, der das, was wir hören, übersetzt, Wörter trennt oder Gespräche von Umgebungsgeräuschen unterscheidet, nicht so wie es üblich ist.\n\n\tDie früheste Erwähnung der Störung, die zum CAPD wurde, stammt aus der Mitte der 1950er Jahre und hieß „auditive Imperzeption“ (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), als Forscher Kinder mit kommunikativen Störungen untersuchten. Das italienische Forschungsteam von Bocca, Calearo und Cassinari begann 1954 mit der Entwicklung von Tests für diese Kinder. 1961 führte Kimura „dichotische Tests ein und formulierte ein Modell, um die Physiologie des ZNS zu erklären, die der dichotischen Wahrnehmung zugrunde liegt“ (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). 1977 fand eine nationale Konferenz statt, die die Forschung an Kindern mit CAPD anregte.\n\n\tCAPD manifestiert sich auf vielfältige Weise: Die betroffene Person kann möglicherweise den Ort oder den Klang im Raum nicht lokalisieren; Schwierigkeiten haben, zwischen zwei oder mehr „akustischen Ereignissen“ (Schallereignissen) zu unterscheiden; möglicherweise kann sie keine Klangmuster erkennen; möglicherweise kann sie Änderungen in der Sprache nicht unterscheiden (z. B. Sarkasmus erkennen basierend auf Veränderungen in der Stimme); ein Schall kann durch einen nachfolgenden Schall blockiert werden; möglicherweise kann sie keine akustischen Hinweise synthetisieren (d. h. sinnvoll interpretieren, auf die sie dann reagieren können); und möglicherweise kann sie nicht bestimmen, in welcher Reihenfolge auditive Informationen präsentiert werden (Ferre).\n\n\tZur Diagnose von CAPD muss der Patient mit „systematischer Beobachtung des Hörverhaltens und/oder Leistung bei Tests der Hörfunktion“ untersucht werden, die von „Audiologen, Sprachtherapeuten, Psychologen und anderen“ mit verschiedenen Verfahren durchgeführt werden können, die auditiv-bezogene Fähigkeiten bewerten (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Dazu können Fragebögen und Umfragen, Beobachtung des Hörverhaltens einschließlich der Reaktion des Patienten auf bestimmte Reize gehören. Zum gegenwärtigen Zeitpunkt gibt es kein einziges Instrument oder Test, der zur Diagnose mit hoher Erfolgsquote eingesetzt wird, und es gibt keine bekannte Ursache für die Störung. Viele verwendete Tests präsentieren dem Patienten mehrere, gleichzeitige auditorische Reize und bitten ihn dann, bestimmte Elemente zu unterscheiden, z. B. eine Reihe von Wörtern oder Zahlen. Weiterentwickelte Tests umfassen die Aufnahme akustischer Signale im Ohr und die Messung der Reaktionen auf die Signale.\n\n\n\n[REWRITE] This paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD).

Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiological activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiological auditory potentials (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This means it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should.\n\nThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD dates back to the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CNS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on a change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\nIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals.",

    "raw_output": "## German Translation:\n\nDie Komödie \"Die zwölf Nacht\" scheint zu sagen, dass obwohl Verkleidung tatsächlich nützlich ist, um lange Zeit Täuschung zu ermöglichen, man am Ende eine neue Identität ablehnen muss, um sich selbst nicht für immer in diesem Prozess zu verlieren. Ein großes Problem beim Beenden einer Täuschung ist jedoch, dass man sich dabei möglicherweise von seiner Umgebung entfremdet fühlt. Daher muss man am Ende zwischen Selbstbewahrung und der Erhaltung der Beziehungen zu den Menschen um sich herum wählen. Denn obwohl einige neutral reagieren, wenn sie feststellen, dass sie getäuscht wurden, werden andere die Täuschung nicht so leicht nehmen und sich wahrscheinlich über die ganze Farce beleidigt fühlen.\n\nDas Thema der Täuschung in der Umkehr der Geschlechterrollen ist besonders problematisch, weil es viele Nebenthemen aufwirft, wobei das wichtigste vielleicht der Grund ist: Warum? Warum fühlt sich die Person dazu gedrängt, ihre eigene Identität zu vernachlässigen und eine Verkleidung in Form des anderen Geschlechts anzunehmen? In Violas Fall ist es offensichtlich eine Form des Selbstschutzes: \"Ich werde euch zu einem Hauptmann in dieser Stadt bringen / Wo meine Jungfrauengewand liegen, mit dessen sanfter Hilfe / Ich konserviert wurde, um diesem edlen Grafen dienen...\" (5.1.247-249)\n\nNeu in einer fremden Land angekommen, fühlt sich Viola gezwungen, sich als Mann zu verkleiden, um sich vor Angreifern zu schützen. Violas Plan funktioniert, aber er isoliert sie auch von den Frauen um sie herum und trennt sie von einem wichtigen Unterstützungssystem. Um die Sache noch schlimmer zu machen, scheint sie so überzeugend als Mann aufzutreten, dass Olivia sie mit Sebastian verwechselt und in der Tat in sie verliebt wird: \"Wohin, mein Lord? Cesario, Ehemann, bleib.\" (5.1.138) Darüber hinaus muss sie auch mit unterdrückten romantischen Gefühlen zwischen ihr und Orsino zurechtkommen: \"Knabe, du hast mir tausendmal gesagt / Du solltest nie eine Frau wie mich lieben.\" (5.1. 260-261)\n\nObwohl dies möglicherweise eine fortschrittliche Haltung ist, kann \"Die zwölf Nacht\" für den modernen Leser als Illustration dafür dienen, wie Täuschung dazu beitragen kann, unterdrückte Emotionen freizulegen, insbesondere in den Fällen von Olivia und Orsino. Bestimmte Passagen deuten darauf hin, dass die genannten Charaktere unerklärbare unterbewusste Wünsche haben, die das Auftreten von Viola/Cesario sie dazu zwingen, damit umzugehen. Ist Olivia zum Beispiel in Cesario verliebt, weil Cesario wie ein Mann aussieht, oder verbirgt Olivia wirklich heimliche Gefühle für Frauen? Man könnte argumentieren, dass dies wahrscheinlich nicht der Fall ist, denn Shakespeares Figur Olivia scheint eher die Menschen seiner Zeit zu parodieren, die andere nur an ihrem Aussehen beurteilen.\n\nDies wird durch die Leichtigkeit, mit der Olivia ihre romantischen Begierden von Cesario auf Sebastian überträgt und Cesario/Viola als Familie betrachtet, anstatt als Liebesinteresse, deutlich: \"Schwester, du bist sie.\" (5.1.315)\n\n[REWRITE]\n\nThe play \"Twelfth Night\" seems to say that although disguise is indeed useful in perpetrating long periods of deception, in the end, a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process.

    "raw_output": "## German Translation:\n\nDie deutsche Kolonialherrschaft wurde von verschiedenen Beobachtern für ihre Brutalität bemerkt, insbesondere in Bezug auf den Völkermord an den Ovaherero und Nama in Deutsch-Südwestafrika. Natürlich lässt sich ein ganzes Kolonialreich wie dieses nicht durch eine so einfache Beschreibung erklären. Das deutsche Kolonialreich war in seinen politischen Richtlinien und Führungsstilen ebenso vielfältig wie in seiner Geographie. Die Bildungslandschaft in den Kolonien war ähnlich divers. Als die Briten 1919 Deutsch-Ostafrika (Tanganjika) eroberten, fanden sie eine große Bevölkerung von gebildeten und lesenden Afrikanern vor. Die Bildungsarbeit der Deutschen in Kamerun und anderen Kolonien wurde auch von zeitgenössischen Autoren gelobt.\n\nDie Situation in Südwestafrika (heute Namibia) stellte einen krassen Kontrast dar. Im Gegensatz zu Ostafrika, wo die Regierung Staatschulen gründete und eine bedeutende Rolle bei der Bildung der Eingeborenen spielte, wurde die Aufgabe der indigenen Bildung in Südwestafrika fast ausschließlich an Missionsgesellschaften übertragen, die nur begrenzter staatlicher Unterstützung bedurften. Die Regierung investierte jedoch erhebliche Ressourcen in die Bildung von Europäern in der Kolonie und richtete ein System von Staatschulen ein, sowie die Unterstützung und Regulierung von Missionsschulen stärker vorantrieb. Diese Bildungspläne hatten langfristige Auswirkungen auf Südwestafrika, selbst nach dem Ende der deutschen Herrschaft. Während andere deutsche Kolonien mit bedeutenden Zahlen von lesfähigen und gebildeten Afrikanern auftrumpften, blieb in Südwestafrika „die überwältigende Mehrheit der Bevölkerung unberührt, ungebildet und analphabetisch“. Verschiedene soziale, politische und wirtschaftliche Faktoren führten zu den unterschiedlichen Erfahrungen in Südwestafrika. Diese Arbeit zielt darauf ab, die Diskussion zu erweitern, indem sie diese Faktoren identifiziert und besondere Aufmerksamkeit auf neue Forschungsergebnisse über die Einstellung der Siedler und der Kolonialbehörden gegenüber den afrikanischen Einheimischen lenkt.\n\nEs gibt eine Fülle von Literatur, die sich mit der Bildung im deutschen Kolonialreich befasst. Die meisten dieser Quellen sind in deutscher Sprache verfasst und wurden im frühen 20. Jahrhundert, während oder kurz nach der Zeit der deutschen Kolonialherrschaft, geschrieben. Ziel der frühen Werke war es in erster Linie, die Merkmale der Bildungssysteme in diesen Kolonien zu beschreiben. Spätere Arbeiten auf Englisch haben den Diskurs durch vergleichende Studien über die Bildung in den verschiedenen deutschen Kolonien und detailliertere Analysen bestimmter Aspekte des Bildungswesens erweitert. Diese Studien zeigten erhebliche Unterschiede in den Bildungssystemen der verschiedenen Kolonien auf. Das bedeutendste Werk, das sich explizit mit dem Thema dieser Arbeit befasst, ist Cohens Untersuchung über die Bildung in Südwestafrika und Ostafrika. Cohen vergleicht die Bildungssysteme der beiden Kolonien und diskutiert die Faktoren, die für die Unterschiede zwischen ihnen verantwortlich sind. Laut Cohen erklärt die große Siedlerbevölkerung von Südwestafrika viele der charakteristischen Merkmale des Bildungssystems der Kolonie.\n\nIm Vergleich zu den anderen kolonialen Besitzungen Deutschlands hatte Südwestafrika ein gemäßigt temperiertes Klima, obwohl ein Großteil des Territoriums von ariden Wüsten bedeckt ist. Die europäische Bevölkerung Südwestafrikas spiegelte die relativ milden Bedingungen wider. Bis 1913 lebten fast 15.000 Weiße in Südwestafrika, während nur 5.336 in der Kolonie mit der zweitgrößten Siedlerbevölkerung, Ostafrika, lebten.\n\n\n\n[REWRITE]\n\nGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, particularly with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa.

    "transformed": "The classification of popular music has grown over the past 100 years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters, most if not all genres - rap, rock, country, jazz, folk, just to name a few - have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain. Arguably, the subgenre of heavy metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past 40 years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions, although they tend to lean towards the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse because people soon after the genre's beginnings realized its flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own subgenres, which were then followed by sub-subgenres, and the chain continues to this day. \n\nToday, we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niche groups that it is hard to determine exactly what heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate many themes from other genres, but like everything else, it originated somewhere. To properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today, one must first understand what the metal movement is and why it is considered a movement rather than just a genre. \n\nMetal is, in many ways, a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a “music of more” – more bass, more volume, more violence, more theatricality. Less primitivism, more skill; people in metal bands truly know how to play their instruments, and it comes through in the music. Metal is also – although it may not come as a surprise – a movement heavily influenced by drugs.

The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",

    "raw_output": "Several Jahrzehnte bevor die surrealistischen Künstler mit ihren traumhaften Werken begannen, schuf der Künstler Henri Rousseau sorgfältig seine eigenen Träume, wörtlich und bildlich. Der Traum, ein Gemälde von 1910 des berühmten postimpressionistischen Künstlers, stellt nicht nur eine Frau dar, die von den Wundern des Landes, das sie in einem Traum besucht, beeindruckt ist, sondern auch Rousseaus eigene persönliche Träume und Ziele als Maler. Seit Beginn seiner Arbeit träumte er von Anerkennung, Akzeptanz und Lob von anderen Künstlern und Kunstliebhabern und fand heraus, dass er sich mit einem schwierigen inneren Dilemma konfrontiert sah, um diesen Wunsch zu verwirklichen. Der Traum ist Henri Rousseaus Werk, das seinen lebenslangen inneren Kampf am besten widerspiegelt: sich entweder an bestimmten Maltechniken zu orientieren oder sie zu imitieren, um von der kritischen Kunstwelt, die er so bewunderte, akzeptiert zu werden, oder sich kreativ unabhängig und einzigartig zu erlauben und seinen eigenen Weg zu gehen.\nBevor man The Dream aus dieser Perspektive analysieren kann, muss man zunächst etwas mit Rousseaus Biografie vertraut sein. Henri Rousseau wurde am 21. Mai 1844 in der Stadt Laval im Nordwesten Frankreichs geboren. Sein Vater war ein Blechschmied und Hardwarehändler, der „bürgerlichem Wohlstand“ genoss (Shattuck 47). In seiner Jugend erhielt er keine formelle Ausbildung in den Künsten; stattdessen war er bis zum Alter von vierzig Jahren für Frankreich als gabelou, ein Angestellter des städtischen Mautdienstes, tätig, obwohl er den irreführenden Beinamen Douanier, ein Zöllner, erhielt (Shattuck 46). Der Tod seiner ersten Frau, Clémence, der den Tod von acht Säuglingen folgte, hinterließ Rousseau mit einem einzigen Kind, einer Tochter namens Julia, und immensem Trauer (Shattuck 49). Er hoffte daher, Zuflucht in einem neuen Leben zu finden und die Malerei, um ihm Trost und neue Anfänge zu bieten, zu verfolgen. Im Gegensatz zu zeitgenössischen Kollegen Rousseaus, die in der Malerei den Bauern sentimentalisieren und romantisieren, ist er im Wesentlichen ein Volksmaler und hat die Hoffnungen und Träume des durchschnittlichen Mitglieds seiner Klasse.\nRousseaus Besessenheit davon, von der Kunstwelt akzeptiert zu werden, ist in diesem Kontext einigermaßen verständlich: wie bereits erwähnt, war er nicht nur unerfahren in den Regeln des formellen Malens und begann seine Karriere im fortgeschrittenen Alter, sondern er schuf Werke zur gleichen Zeit wie viele andere talentierte und bekannteren moderne Künstler. Obwohl Rousseau viele Jahre arbeitete, erhielt er erst etwa zur gleichen Zeit, als Matisse sich als Künstler einen Namen machte, die richtige Anerkennung für seine Kunst. In dem Buch „Moderne französische Maler“ behauptet der Autor Jan Gordon, dass die beiden, obwohl sie technisch gesehen Konkurrenten im Kunstszenario waren, sich nicht nur in Stil und Motiv, sondern auch in ihren Gründen für das Malen unterschieden: „Matisse war ein Maler, der vor der Gefahr der tristen Malerei Angst hatte, während Rousseaus Wunsch war, ein so konventionelles Bild zu malen, dass er in die Artiste Français aufgenommen würde“ (92).  \n\n\n\n[REWRITE]\n\nSeveral decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau carefully crafted his own dreams, literally and figuratively.

    "raw_output": "## German Translation:\n\nViele große Denker haben eine intime Verbindung zwischen Ethik und Ästhetik, zwischen Wahrheit und Schönheit postuliert. Ich glaube, dass es auf fundamentaler Ebene einen Grund dafür gibt. Wie John Keats in seiner „Ode an einen griechischen Vasen“ sagt: „Schönheit ist Wahrheit, Wahrheit Schönheit - Das ist alles / Was ihr auf Erden wisst und alles, was ihr wissen müsst.“ Ein Großteil dessen, was wir im Leben lernen, wird durch Bildung oder Erfahrung vermittelt. Wir scheinen jedoch Ethik und Ästhetik, wie Keats andeutet, ohne Unterricht in diesen erwarteten Weisen zu schätzen. Sowohl Ethik als auch Ästhetik sind ein Versuch, zu beschreiben und nicht zu verschreiben. Unsere Studien über Moral und Schönheit sind zum größten Teil Versuche, zu erklären, warum ein Kunstwerk oder ein literarisches Werk schön ist oder warum eine Handlung moralisch ist, anstatt ein Regelwerk für die Beurteilung oder Kreation guter Kunst oder moralisches Verhalten.\n\t\nDarüber hinaus ist die Kritik an Kunst oder Moral niemals in der Lage, die Essenz dessen, was gut oder schön ist, vollständig zu erfassen. Ein Gespräch über den Wert Leonardos Mona Lisa, zum Beispiel, könnte sich um Konzepte wie Vordergrund, Hintergrund, Kontrast oder kulturellen Kontext drehen, aber letztendlich beschreiben diese nicht, warum es sich um gute Kunst handelt. Stattdessen ist es üblich, wenn man nach einem Lieblingswerk der Kunst oder Literatur gefragt wird, einen Satz wie \"Es ist einfach etwas an ihr\" zu hören, bevor eine komplexere oder kritischere Erklärung folgt. Ich glaube, dass sich sowohl Kunst als auch Moral niemals vollständig zu einer Beschreibung ihrer Eigenschaften reduzieren lassen. Wie Flannery O'Connor sagt: „Eine Geschichte ist eine Möglichkeit, etwas zu sagen, was auf keine andere Weise gesagt werden kann... man erzählt eine Geschichte, weil eine Aussage unzureichend wäre.“ Egal wie vollständig wir die Eigenschaften eines literarischen Werkes beschreiben, es bleibt etwas Übergeordnetes. Ich glaube, dass die Ethik dieses gleiche Eigentum besitzt. Wie Wittgenstein sagt: „Es ist klar, dass Ethik nicht ausgedrückt werden kann. / Ethik ist transzendent. / \" Ich vermute, dass es dieses \"etwas\", dieses je ne sais quoi, ist, das die machtvollste Eigenschaft von Kunst und Moral ist, und dass die transzendente Natur sowohl von Ethik als auch Ästhetik einen Verbindungspunkt zwischen ihnen schafft.\n\t\nIch glaube, dass Moral und Kunst so eng miteinander verwandt sind, weil wir beide auf einer noumenalen Ebene, um einen kant'schen Begriff zu verwenden, am stärksten erfahren. Sie wirken auf uns ein auf einer Ebene, die erlebt, aber nicht vollständig erklärt werden kann. Diese Verbindung ist noch stärker, wenn es um die Kunst der Literatur geht. Wie McKean sagt: „Was die Literatur von den anderen Künsten am meisten unterscheidet, was ihrem Wesen nach einzigartig an der Kunst ist, ist ihre moralische Qualität. Es ist möglich, dass moralische Standards für andere Kunstformen, wie beispielsweise Musik, unangemessen sind, aber sie scheinen für Literatur so relevant zu sein wie für das Leben selbst. Das Leben beinhaltet notwendigerweise Werte... Literatur ist für uns wichtig genau wegen der Werte, die wir dort finden.“ \n\n[REWRITE]\nMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty.

With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",

Angesichts dieser einzigartigen Kultur ist es nicht überraschend, dass Deutschland so, wie wir es heute kennen, aus verschiedenen Quellen und Stämmen hervorgegangen ist.\n\nGermania ist das Urland der Germanen.

Julius Caesar verwendete den Begriff „Germanus“ erstmals in seinem Kommentar zu den gallischen Kriegen, in dem er die Galliern unterwarf und mit germanischen Stämmen kämpfte, die oft unter hinterhältigen Vorwänden den Rhein überquerten. Er nahm dieses Wort von den Galliern selbst und verwendete es, um die von ihm eroberten (die Galliern) von denen zu unterscheiden, die er nicht hatte.  Obwohl die Herkunft ungewiss ist, glauben einige, dass es sich auf einen Nachbarn in der gallischen Sprache bezog. Im ersten Kapitel seines ersten Buches über diese Kriege bemerkt Julius Caesar: „Germanen, die jenseits des Rheins wohnen, mit denen sie (die Galliern) ununterbrochen Krieg führen.....Sie kämpfen mit den Germanen in fast täglichen Kämpfen.“ (Julius Caesar, 50-40 v. Chr.) Andere behaupten, die Bedeutung komme von der Speer, die sie im Krieg verwendeten, bekannt als ger (O.E.D., 2010), oder vielleicht vom altirländischen Wort garim, was „brüllen“ bedeutet, was darauf hindeutete, dass die Germanen laut oder lautstark waren. (Namen Deutschlands) \n\nDer frühe römische Historiker Tacitus beschrieb in seinem Werk „De Origine et situ Germanorum“ aus dem Jahr 98 n. Chr., das sich mit den Ursprüngen der Germanen befasste, wie folgt: „Ich würde sie (die Germanen) als autochthon betrachten und nicht mit anderen Völkern durch Einwanderung oder Verkehr vermischt haben. Denn früher reisten diejenigen, die auswandern wollten, nicht über Land, sondern auf Schiffen.......Wer würde aus Asien oder Afrika nach Italien oder nach Deutschland, mit seinem wilden Land, seinem ungünstigen Klima, seinen düsteren Sitten und seinem furchteinflößenden Auftreten auswandern, es sei denn, es wäre sein Heim?“ (Tacitus, 98)\n\nUnd wer würde Rom für Germania verlassen? Mit Sicherheit nicht die Römer, zumindest nicht noch nicht. Sie würden ihre Eroberungen in die Gebiete Germanias schicken, um Waren zu erwerben und gelegentlich Landkampagnen führen, aber am Ende kehrten sie meist in ihr weitläufiges Imperium zurück. Als die germanischen Stämme Mitte des ersten Jahrhunderts auftauchten, lebten sie an den Grenzen des Römischen Reiches und handelten mit Waren, die sie vom Land gewonnen hatten, und mit ihren Fähigkeiten, indem sie in den Reihen der römischen Armee dienten (Ozment, 2005, S. 17).\n\n [REWRITE]\nGermany is considered a strong force today, a united country with its own blend of culture from the shadows of the Alps in Munich, all the way to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel.

Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17). \n\n\n[/REWRITE]",
    "transformed": "Germany is considered a strong force today, a united country with its own blend of culture from the shadows of the Alps in Munich, all the way to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. The same culture can be felt from Cologne on the Rhine River, through the center of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we know it comes from several different sources and tribes.\n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic tribe known then as the Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gallic forces (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he subdued the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous pretenses. He took this word from the Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (the Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gallic language.

Ohne Emotion, still, mit einem geübten Bewusstsein, das das Objekt des Studiums untersuchte, aber sich weigerte, es mit einem abstrakten Verständnis in Verbindung zu bringen, analysierte mein Geist das Bild vor meinen Augen. Gedanken schlichen sich in meinen Geist und schlichen sich fast so schnell wieder heraus, wie sie erschienen waren. So sanft und so rein arbeitete mein Bewusstsein, dass es schien, als hätte ich keine eigenen Gedanken, nur ein aktives und flüssiges Erlebnis dessen, was ich betrachtete. \n\nEinmal, auf Rat eines Künstlers, mit dem ich arbeitete, kaufte ich ein Buch über Kunstlehre mit dem Titel „The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain“. Ich wollte schon seit meinem sechsten Lebensjahr lernen, zu zeichnen, und dieses Buch lehrt alles, von dem, was ein Bleistift ist, bis hin zu den Prozessen, die das Gehirn verwendet, um Linien zu interpretieren. Eine Technik, die das Buch lehrt, ist es, einen quadratischen Rahmen um jedes Bild zu legen, das der Künstler studieren möchte. Damit verwandelt sich ein überwältigend detailliertes Bild, zum Beispiel eine Schale Obst auf einem Tisch, der sich in einem Esszimmer befindet, das mit einer Küche verbunden ist, in ein leicht zu fassendes Bild, diese Schale Obst auf einer einfachen Ebene. \n\nZu der Zeit, als ich auf die Schale vor mir herabblickte, konnte ich den Rahmen des Künstlers nicht mental projizieren. Ich war so überwältigt, so ehrfürchtig, dass ich nur stehen und voller Staunen blicken konnte. Picasso erlebte seine blaue Phase, Monet liebte Grün, die italienischen Renaissance-Meister zeigten einen Regenbogen an Farben. Wenn ich irgendwelche Ambitionen hatte, meine Perspektive als würdig des Titels \"Künstlerisch\" zu betrachten, dann waren vor mir der Anfang meines Bildes, der Start meiner Geschichte, \"Arbeit in Braun\". \n\nFingerkuppen setzten sich auf mein gewähltes Instrument der Kunst, Muskeln spannten sich an und entspannten sich wieder, als meine Hand durch den Raum bewegte, der Wille meines Geistes in Form und Gestalt gebracht, was in dem, was hätte sein können, dem kreativsten Moment meines Lebens. Wasser wirbelte, seren und glatt, kristallklar und rein. Kleine Teilchen lösten sich vom Ganzen und wurden ins Nichts getragen. Muskeln spannten sich, zuckten und zuckten etwas schneller und ängstlicher beim zweiten Mal, meine Hand schlug wieder mit aller Kraft auf den Toilettengriff. Das beleidigende braune Paket weigerte sich, sich zu bewegen, fest wie eine Schnecke auf dem Boden der Toilette. \n\nEin Lappen locker in der Hand, die Füße einen Fuß auseinander, eine grüne Krawatte, die sich unwohl um meinen Hals knüpfte, runzelte ich leicht die Stirn, als ich auf das unhöfliche Bündel aus verarbeitetem Tier- und Pflanzenmaterial starrte, das jemand als Botschaft für die Dummköpfe hinterlassen hatte, die die Badezimmer in der Rite Aid sauber machten. Ein paar weitere Spülungen, ein paar weitere ruhige, introvertierte Momente für mich, dann bewegte sich meine Hand zur Wand rechts neben mir, packte das Papiertuch am Ende der Toilettenpapierrolle und begann, sich wie einen Ofenhandschuh zu mumifizieren.

Die National Institutes of Health erklären, dass ein Aspekt des Problems darin besteht, dass das Teenagerhirn buchstäblich nicht für die Gefahren des Fahrens bereit ist. Auch die einfache Unerfahrenheit liegt im Zentrum des Problems. Diese Unerfahrenheit verursacht nicht nur mehr tödliche Unfälle, sondern auch eine höhere Unfallrate bei Fahrzeugumkippen, Geschwindigkeitsüberschreitungen und Fahrspurwechsel.\n\nTeens schneiden auch deutlich schlechter ab, wenn sie mit ihren Altersgenossen unterwegs sind – was jeder mit einem Hauch von Verstand weiß, dass sie regelmäßig tun. Das Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center führte eine Studie durch, die einen Zusammenhang zwischen dem Alter der Fahrgäste und der Anzahl der Verkehrsunfälle aufzeigte.\n\nKalifornien und andere Bundesstaaten haben versucht, die Sicherheit junger Fahrer zu erhöhen, indem sie vorläufige Führerscheine erlassen, die die Fahrzeiten für Jugendliche einschränken und das Mitfahren anderer Minderjähriger verbieten.\n\nAber vorläufige Führerscheine sind meiner Meinung nach nur Notlösungen. Das eigentliche Problem ist, dass die jüngsten Fahrer – gemessen an allen statistischen Kennzahlen – einfach nicht in der Lage sind, die Risiken und Verantwortlichkeiten ausreichend zu bewältigen. Der Psychologe Marvin Zuckerman glaubt sogar, dass 18 Jahre zu jung für einen regulären Führerschein sind. Die USA Today berichtet, dass Zuckerman Forschung durchgeführt hat, die darauf hindeutet, dass es unter Menschen unter 19-20 Jahren einen gemeinsamen Wunsch gibt, Risiken einzugehen, nur um den Nervenkitzel zu erleben. Es ist daher sinnvoll, das Fahren zumindest zu verzögern, bis der Drang nach Nervenkitzel nachgelassen hat. Wenn wir jungen Teenagern weiterhin Führerscheine ausstellen, werden wir nicht nur weiterhin tödliche Unfälle sehen, sondern die Todesopferzahl wird in den nächsten Jahren wahrscheinlich erschreckende Ausmaße annehmen. Bis 2010 werden die Babys der Baby-Boomer fahren können und Millionen von neuen Teenagerfahrern werden bereit sein, auf die Straße zu gehen.\n\nDie Gesetzgebung zu diesem Thema wäre relativ einfach. Schulen könnten weiterhin Fahrschulen anbieten, um den Lernprozess für zukünftige Fahrer zu beginnen, aber niemand unter 18 Jahren darf ein Kraftfahrzeug bedienen. Vor dem Erteilung eines vollständigen Führerscheins könnte weiterhin ein vorläufiger Führerschein ausgestellt werden, und eine bestimmte Anzahl von praktischen Fahrstunden wäre ebenfalls erforderlich. Die genaue Anzahl der Stunden könnte auf die Anzahl der Stunden basieren, die bereits von der Mehrheit der Bundesstaaten gefordert wird (in Kalifornien sind es beispielsweise derzeit 6 Stunden Fahrtraining hinterm Lenkrad und 50 Stunden Übungszeit mit einem Erwachsenen). Da die tödlichen Statistiken für Teenagerfahrer aus einem Querschnitt aller Bundesstaaten stammen, wäre eine einheitliche, nationale Gesetzgebung zu diesem Thema ein angemessenes – und meiner Meinung nach effektives – Mittel, um Jugendliche im ganzen Land zu schützen.\n\nDie von mir vorgeschlagene Gesetzgebung ist keineswegs neu.\n\n[REWRITE] Teenagers are dying behind the wheel.

    "original": "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",

    "raw_output": "## German Translation:\n\nWährend ich mich durch die Sammlung früher Edison-Filme der Library of Congress arbeitete, entschied ich mich, alle Trickfilme anzusehen, von denen es zwischen 1895 und 1901 fünfzehn gab. Diese Filme nutzen im Allgemeinen kreatives Editing, um Illusionen zu erzeugen. Meine Filmarbeit konzentrierte sich hauptsächlich auf die Beschreibung der Poetik der meisten Trickfilme und die Untersuchung der evolutionären Randcharakteristika, die in einigen der späteren Filme vorhanden sind. Im Wesentlichen ist der Trickfilm zum Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts an einen Ort gebunden, innerhalb eines frontal angeordneten Proszeniums aufgebaut, weist keine Kamerabewegungen auf, verwendet lange und mittlere Aufnahmen und hält sich an die strenge Methode \"ein Aufnahme = ein Film\". Es gibt jedoch einige Filme zu Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts, die sich diese Richtlinien durch die Einführung von Aspekten wie Mehrfachaufnahmen wagen.\n\nEiner der auffälligsten Aspekte, den die Trickfilme gemeinsam haben, ist ihre Aufnahme in einem Innenraum innerhalb des Rahmens eines frontal angeordneten Proszeniums. Die Kamera bewegt sich nicht von ihrer Proszeniumposition, um Figuren oder Objekte zu verfolgen. Diese Komposition war in frühen Filmen sehr verbreitet und entsprang dem Theater und, für Trickfilme, dem Vaudeville und Zauberkunst. Eine der inhärenten Einschränkungen der Verwendung der Bühne ist, dass Figuren in Trickfilmen im Allgemeinen nur seitlich bewegen und nicht auf die Kamera zu- oder weggehen. Nehmen wir zum Beispiel die Handlung im Film \"Onkel Josh in einem gespenstischen Hotel\" (1900). Die Schauspieler treten von der rechten Seite ein und bewegen sich hin und her entlang der horizontalen Achse. Selbst wenn sie aus dem Bild gehen, folgt die Kamera ihnen nicht.\n\nDer frontale Proszenium-Stil der Komposition bedeutet auch, dass Aufnahmen tendenziell lange Aufnahmen und seltener mittlere Aufnahmen sind. Nahaufnahmen werden in keinem der Trickfilme aus dem Edison-Katalog verwendet. Dies geht zurück auf die Theater- und Vaudeville-Tradition, in der das Publikum die gesamte Aufführung zu jedem gegebenen Zeitpunkt sehen konnte, eingefasst von den Rändern der Bühne. Wie in den meisten frühen Filmen bewegen sich die Schauspieler nicht von der mittleren Ebene zur Kamera, daher treten keine Nahaufnahmen auf.\n\nIm Allgemeinen folgen die meisten frühen Trickfilme dem Muster, dass ein konzeptioneller Shot einem Film entspricht. Dies begrenzt die Länge der meisten Trickfilme auf etwa eine Minute oder weniger, abhängig von den Bildern pro Sekunde. Es begrenzt auch die dramatische oder narrative Verwendung der Trickfilme; die meisten konzentrieren sich auf kurze, vaudeville-ähnliche Tricks, wie Magie, Verschwinden und Tauschhandlungen mit wenig Geschichte. Beachten Sie jedoch, dass bei einem Trickfilm ein konzeptioneller Shot in den Augen des Zuschauers nicht tatsächlich einem physischen Shot entspricht. Ein einzelner \"Shot\" kann tatsächlich mehrere Aufnahmen zusammengefügt sein, um den Eindruck von Apparation oder Verschwinden zu erzeugen. Schauen Sie sich \"Die Hinrichtung von Maria, Königin von Schottland\" (1895), eines der früheren Trickfilme, genau an. Eine gründlichere Untersuchung enthüllt den Moment, in dem der physische Shot mit Marias abgetrenntem \"Kopf\" beginnt, obwohl der gesamte Film dem Zuschauer konzeptionell ein Shot ist.\n\n\n[REWRITE]\n\nWhile I was going through the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I decided to watch all the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901.

    "raw_output": "John Taylor aus Caroline war ein früher und leidenschaftlicher Befürworter des Republikanismus. Obwohl er hauptsächlich Landwirt war, verdankte er dieser Berufswahl sowie seinem kurzen politischen Werdegang seinen Ruf für Hingabe und Offenheit in Fragen der persönlichen Freiheit und der Regierung. Seine Hingabe an ein Agrarsystem bildete die Grundlage für fast alle seine Meinungen über die Regierung. Es war sein Versuch, zu bewahren und zu fördern, was er für die überlegene aller Berufe hielt, der seine Argumente über Souveränität, Verfassungsmäßigkeit und sogar das Rechtssystem bestimmte. \n\nJohn Taylor glaubte, dass die Vereinigten Staaten eine große Chance hatten, ein ideales System zu schaffen, da es keine einheimische Tradition gab, die die Schöpfer der Regierung behindern konnte, wodurch ein System der Selbstregierung möglich wurde.  Er glaubte fest an die natürlichen Rechte des Menschen und an die Tatsache, dass diese alle voneinander abhängig sind - was bedeutet, dass wenn einer verletzt wird, alle scheitern werden und der Wert der verbleibenden geringer wird. Diese Rechte sollten daher außerhalb der Reichweite der Regierung sein. Er behauptete, dass das, was manche den „Naturzustand“ nannten, bedeutete, dass diejenigen mit physischer Stärke und bösartiger Intelligenz diejenigen profitierten, aber dass dies in einer Zivilisation nicht der Fall sein sollte.\n\nUm diese ideale Gesellschaft zu erschaffen, glaubte Taylor, dass eine Regierung geschaffen werden müsse, die die innewohnende Güte und das Böse im Menschen berücksichtigt. Taylor war sehr rigide in seinen Ansichten über eine dualistische Moral. Er behauptete: „Da die Regierung von Menschen ausgeübt wird, müssen ihre Tugenden und Laster menschlich sein“ (ebd., S. 167). Er definierte gute Prinzipien als solche, die Privateigentum schützen, die Landwirtschaft verbessern und Kapitalismus entmutigen, und glaubte, dass eine Regierung, die auf guten Prinzipien gegründet ist, unabhängig von ihrer Verwaltung gerecht funktionieren würde, die unweigerlich von Habsucht und Eigennutz geleitet würde. Eigennutz, glaubte er, sei die Motivation des Menschen in allen Dingen, aber er sei nur dann als böse angesehen, wenn er über die Schaffung einer Gesellschaft, die auf dem Gemeinwohl basiert, hinausging und Untergesellschaften hervorbrachte, die auf Kosten anderer lebten. Eine gute Regierung war notwendig, um das natürliche Böse des Menschen einzudämmen, und selbst dann musste sie unter sorgfältiger Beobachtung stehen, um der Hinzufügung schlechter Prinzipien vorzubeugen.\n\nTaylor, wie viele andere glühende Republikaner seiner Zeit, forderte eine strenge Auslegung der Verfassung. Er wünschte sich eine äußerst begrenzte föderale Regierung, die nicht mehr Rechte oder Befugnisse haben sollte, als in der Verfassung ausdrücklich festgelegt waren. Er wusste, dass eine umfassende föderale Regierung teuer wäre und daher wahrscheinlich despotisch wäre. Er glaubte jedoch, dass eine einfache, literale Interpretation gefährlich sei und dass ohne Bezugnahme auf die Absicht der Autoren diese Methode leicht korrumpiert werden könnte. Darüber hinaus betrachtete er die Unabhängigkeitserklärung als wahren Gründungsakt der Vereinigten Staaten, weil sie das Land expliziter als eine Gruppe von souveränen Staaten und weniger als eine Nation beschrieb.\n\n\n\n[REWRITE] John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.

Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

Ein ETF bietet Ihnen die Diversifizierung eines Indexfonds und die Vorteile des Einzelaktienbesitzes wie die Möglichkeit, Short Selling, Margin Trading und den Kauf von nur einem Aktien bei jeder Transaktion durchzuführen.  Obwohl diese Vorteile äußerst attraktiv sind, sind die Verwaltungsgebühren von ETFs deutlich niedriger als die durchschnittlichen Verwaltungsgebühren eines Investmentfonds.  Leider gibt es einige Nachteile, wie beispielsweise die Notwendigkeit, bei jeder Transaktion mit ETFs eine Gebühr zu zahlen, genau wie bei einem Aktienauftrag.  Ein weiterer Vorteil von ETFs ist die große Auswahl an Fonds.  Obwohl diese Vorteile klar dargestellt sind, ist es immer eine gute Übung für den erfahrenen Finanzeinvester, zu bewerten, ob die angegebenen Vorteile, wie die Diversifizierung, tatsächlich existieren und in welchem Umfang sie existieren.  Für die Zwecke dieser Untersuchung werden wir den ETF IHF untersuchen und ihn mit den zehn größten Positionen vergleichen, die den ETF bilden, um festzustellen, ob die Vorteile eines einzelnen ETF den Vorteilen eines diversifizierten Portfolios der zehn Aktien entsprechen und ob es bessere Konfigurationen derselben Aktien gibt, die einen optimaleren Sharp Ratio oder eine höhere Rendite liefern würden. \nUm den ETF zu bewerten, wäre es recht umständlich, alle Positionen einzubeziehen, daher haben wir beschlossen, nur die zehn größten Positionen zu berücksichtigen, die 63,58 % aller Vermögenswerte des ETF ausmachen.  Unten finden Sie die zehn größten Positionen und den Prozentsatz der Gesamtanlage.\n\nUm eine Schätzung davon zu erhalten, wie gut diese zehn Aktien den gesamten ETF IHF repräsentieren, können wir den aktuellen Prozentsatz der Vermögenswerte, normalisiert auf 100 %, verwenden, um die Beiträge jedes Aktien zur Beta und Rendite eines Portfolios zu berechnen, wenn das Portfolio ausschließlich aus diesen 10 Aktien in dem Verhältnis zusammengesetzt wäre, das der ETF durch seine Positionen festgelegt hat. Die Berechnungen der Beta und der Rendite sind in der folgenden Tabelle enthalten.\n\nAus der obigen Tabelle ist ersichtlich, dass die Rendite eines Portfolios, das nur die zehn größten Positionen enthält, 6,11 % höher ist als die des ETFs, eine Steigerung der Renditen um 16 %.  Es ist auch ersichtlich, dass die Beta der zehn größten Positionen 0,12 niedriger ist als die des gesamten ETFs.  Aus den bisherigen Ergebnissen scheint es, als könnte ein Portfolio aus nur den zehn größten Positionen eine höhere Rendite mit einer niedrigeren Beta erzielen.  Es besteht jedoch die Möglichkeit, dass die Mittel dieser beiden Portfolios statistisch nicht voneinander abweichen.\nUm zu bewerten, ob diese Portfolios statistisch unterschiedlich sind, wird die Standardabweichung jedes der zehn Aktien ermittelt und auf 100 % normiert, um deren kumulative Standardabweichung mit der des ETFs IHF zu vergleichen.\n\n\n[REWRITE]\nAn ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) is a security designed to track an index, a commodity, or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.

    "transformed": "An ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) is a security designed to track an index, a commodity, or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange. An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership, like the ability to short sell, buy on margin, and purchase as few as a single share in any transaction. Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.

In \"Traumland\" verwendet Poe den Begriff \"Thulé\" in den Zeilen 6 und 56, den Mabbott auf Virgil zurückführt. Virgil verwendete den Begriff in Bezug auf eine Insel nördlich von Großbritannien, die die Griechen als Ende der bekannten Welt betrachteten. Es ist sicher, dass Virgil den Begriff verwendete, aber es gibt eine aktuellere Quelle, der man einige Anerkennung zollen muss. Poe interessierte sich sehr für deutsche Autoren. \n\nDieser Zitat ist wichtig, weil es Poes Vertrautheit mit Goethes Schreiben zeigt. Karl J. Arndt, in seinem Buch \"Poes Politian und Goethes Mignon\", kommentiert die Ähnlichkeit seiner beiden Gedichte und kommt zu dem Schluss, dass Poe Goethe imitierte.\n\nDer Oxford Companion to English Literature sagt von Goethe, dass er ein gefeierter Schriftsteller des poetischen Dramas Faust war, das in zwei Teilen veröffentlicht wurde, der erste 1808 und der zweite im Jahr Goethes Todes, 1832. Innerhalb des poetischen Verses des zweiten Teils von Faust liegt ein kurzes Gedicht mit dem Titel \"Der König von Thulé\". Das Gedicht handelt von einem König, dessen Frau stirbt, nachdem sie ihm das Geschenk eines Kelches geschenkt hat. Nachdem seine Frau verstorben ist, beginnt er stark zu trinken und von der Erinnerung an seine verstorbene Königin zu weinen. Dann beschließt er, es sei seine Zeit zu sterben, und gibt seinen Besitztümern seinen Kindern, bis auf den Kelch. Dann geht er zu einem Klippen, wirft den Kelch ins Meer, schließt die Augen und stirbt. Die Haltung des Königs von Thule und die Beschreibung des Königs in Traumland sind sehr ähnlich, vielleicht ein dunkler Doppelgänger von Poes Verlust und Stütze des Trinkens. Faust wurde auch 1842 zu einem romantischen Drama von H. P. Grattan verfasst, weniger als ein Jahr vor Poes Verwendung des Begriffs Thule in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\".\n\n\nPoe erwähnt Thule zweimal in seinen gesammelten Schriften. Einmal erwähnt Poe \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\", aber er verwendet diese Phrase in \"Dream-Land\" zweimal, als Buchenden für das Gedicht. \"Der König von Thulé\" und \"Traumland\" können als Begleitstücke gelesen werden. Im \"Traumland\" sagt der Sprecher: Er beschreibt dann die Landschaft von Thulé und wie sie dunkel, einsam ist, er wird von toten Freunden geplagt und er sieht eine schattenhafte Welt ohne Farbe. Alle diese Szenen würden in \"Der König von Thulé\" von Goethe gelesen werden, da er gerade seine Frau verloren hat, er ist einsam und er hat seinen Willen zur Herrschaft oder sogar zum Leben verloren. Das ganze Gedicht ist eine Beschreibung, als hätte der Sprecher in Goethes Gedicht eingetreten.\n\n\nGoethe war ein bedeutender Autor, den Poe hätte gekannt, wenn es nicht schon aus Respekt für Tennyson wäre. Poe sagte dies, als er gefragt wurde, ob er Tennyson bewunderte.

Palmer wird argumentieren können, dass Martin das wahrscheinlich eintretende Unheil einer nicht entfernten Verschüttung hätte wissen müssen, da in den Monaten vor Palmers Unfall bereits mehrere D&D Kunden durch Rutschen verletzt wurden; und trotz dieses Wissens hat er die Verschüttung immer noch nicht beseitigen lassen. Palmers Argument, dass Martins Handlungen verabscheuungswürdig waren, ist weniger überzeugend, ist aber immer noch angemessen, wenn man bedenkt, dass 2009 sechs Sturz- und Sturzvorfälle aufgetreten waren und Martin immer noch keine geeigneten Maßnahmen zum Schutz der Sicherheit seines Geschäfts ergriffen hatte.\n\tAm 13.

    "original": "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",

Eines der Hauptthemen der hitzigen Diskussionen in der Klasse war, ob Islam eine feindselige Religion ist oder nicht. Ich glaube, dass die Frage heute relevanter denn je ist. Wenn ich an die Ereignisse seit dem 11. September zurückdenke, habe ich persönlich beobachtet, wie die Massenmedien von einer feindseligen Sichtweise auf Islam und Extremisten zu einer extremen Toleranz gegenüber Islam in Amerika übergegangen sind. Ich glaube nicht, dass wir 2001 jemals einen Präsidentschaftskandidaten mit dem Namen Borac Obama hätten haben können, der einen offensichtlichen muslimischen Hintergrund in seiner Familie hat.\n\nDie Biographie des Propheten fasziniert mich, weil laut meinen Kenntnissen über die Geschichte Muhammads die Biographie mit der Persönlichkeit Muhammads widerspricht. Aus meinen früheren Kenntnissen und Erfahrungen dachte ich, dass Muhammad Konvertiten zum Islam zwang. Er würde Stämme erobern und übernehmen und dann zwingen, die Religion des Islam anzunehmen. Aber laut der Biographie wurde Muhammad als eine Art Märtyrer dargestellt, der missverstanden wurde und sich sogar anderen unterwarf. Danach kamen die Menschen nach und nach und sahen die „Wahrheit“ in seiner Lehre und suchten ihn auf.\n\nEs gibt auch einige seltsame Ähnlichkeiten zwischen den Ministerien Jesu und den „Wundern“ Muhammads. Das offensichtlichste ist, als er Schaf und Milch nahm und multiplizierte, so dass es für vierzig Männer mehr als genug gab. Es ist dieser Schreibstil, der mich glauben lässt, dass die Autoren wollten, dass Muhammad als der bescheidene Prophet wahrgenommen wird, der nichts beweisen musste, sondern einfach in Wahrheit und Wunder lebte. Diese Art von Falschheit ist die schlimmste, weil sie das Wunder und das Leben Jesu Christi herunter spielt. Für mich ist es so, als würden sie stehlen und versuchen, sich das Leben und die Person Jesu durch Muhammad anzueignen.\n\nEs gibt auch viele Geschichten in der Biographie, die den Eindruck erwecken, dass es Teil ihrer Agenda ist, einen Beweis für „Zeugnis“ oder dafür zu liefern, wie Menschen „eigenständig“ zum Islam konvertierten. Das Problem ist jedoch, dass viele der Geschichten zumindest aus einer dritten Perspektive stammen. Das heißt, in der Geschichte verdeutlicht der Autor, dass er von so und so hörte, der von so und so hörte usw. Das gefiel mir nicht so gut, denn obwohl ihre Idee war, dass es den Beweis für die Wahrheit der Geschichten lieferte, hielt ich es für eine Herabsetzung der Geschichten und machte sie umso verdächtiger.\n\nIch denke, das, was mich am meisten an diesem Werk stört, ist, dass sie versuchen, Muhammad als einen göttlichen Mann zu erheben und zu erhellen, der bescheiden, liebenswert, weise und sanft war. Aber die Geschichte widerspricht der Vorstellung, dass Muhammad ein sanfter und bescheidener Mann war, und ich kann nicht anders denken, als dass die Muslime heute die wahre Geschichte hinter Muhammads Aufstieg zur Macht kennen. \n\n\n[REWRITE]\nAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before. Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme form of tolerance for Islam in America. I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Barack Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\nThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad. From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion. But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others. After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\nAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad. The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men. It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles. This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ. To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad. \n\nThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam. But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective. That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc. I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\nI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle. But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. \n\n[/REWRITE] \n\n\n",

Wenn wir diese Geschichte in großen Zügen betrachten, sehen wir einen Trend, dass sich das Christentum immer weiter von seinem Ursprung entfernt. Es scheint, dass die heutige Welt ein wachsendes Bewusstsein und einen beispiellosen progressiven Trend zeigt. Während traditionelle Menschen bleiben und jeder Art von Denken, das über das hinausgeht, was ihnen beigebracht wurde, Widerstand leisten werden, mag dieser Teil der Bevölkerung nicht prominent genug sein, um das Ganze zu beeinflussen.  Unter Christen wird in den kommenden Jahren ein historisches Bewusstsein enorm zunehmen. Ein Verlangen wird sich ausbreiten, die Lehren zu unterscheiden, die im Laufe der Zeit in das Christentum aufgenommen wurden, von der eigentlichen Intention des Namensgebers der Religion. Es kann Jahrzehnte oder sogar Jahrhunderte dauern, aber das Ergebnis wird unvermeidlich sein: Es wird eine große Kehrtwende im Verlauf der christlichen Geschichte geben. Es wird eine Entwicklung zurück zu seiner ursprünglichen Form geben. Eine Bewegung wird an Stärke gewinnen, die Schicht für Schicht Dogmen entfernt, so als ob die Uhr rückwärtslaufen würde, bis nichts mehr übrig bleibt als die Vorstellung von dem, was Jesus der Menschheit im Namen Gottes eingebracht hat, bevor andere Denker solche Behauptungen aufstellten.  Wenn dieser Trend die Vereinigten Staaten und Europa durchzieht und Massen mitreißt, um so zu verehren, als ob wir in der Zeit Jesu lebten und nur seine Ideen befolgen würden, wird die Kirche als Institution stark bleiben, um den Weg zu weisen.  Da die theologische Uhr jedoch rückwärts bewegt worden ist, wird die extreme Vielfalt im Christentum in immer mehr Glaubens- und Praxisgleichheit umkehren. Zwischen Regionen, zwischen Denominationen, zwischen allen Arten von Teilungen werden wir anstatt Unterschiede zunehmend Ähnlichkeiten sehen. Die menschliche Geschichte ist voller großer Kehrtwenden. Ein Beispiel dafür ist, wie Christen einst vom Römischen Reich verfolgt, gemieden und getötet wurden.  Später wurde dieses Reich zu einer christlichen Institution.  Unser Land ist von der afrikanisch-amerikanischen Sklaverei zur afrikanisch-amerikanischen Führung gegangen. Die große Kehrtwende, die in unserer Zukunft bevorsteht, spielt sich im Bereich der christlichen Religion ab, rückgängig macht die Geschichte auf der Suche nach der Quelle und rückgängig macht dabei die Vielfalt. Es ist wichtig zu beachten, dass ein Teil dessen, was diesen Prozess möglich machen wird, eine Methode sein wird, die Worte Jesu als metaphorisch und nicht als wörtliche Aussagen liest.  Also, was geschah seit Jesu Leben? Wenn wir weit genug zurück in die Geschichte blicken, finden wir nur Judentum, den theologischen Ausgangspunkt für die christliche Religion. Monotheismus, die Wahrnehmung einer von Gott offenbarten Religion und die Autorität der hebräischen Schriften waren allesamt im Kern der Religion, als die Römer 63 v. Chr. die Kontrolle über Jerusalem übernahmen.  Die jüdische Bevölkerung teilte nicht einen Geist. Sie teilten sich in Sadduzäer, Pharisäer, Essener, Zeloten und eine Mehrheit des einfachen Volkes. \n\n[REWRITE]\nThe teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.

Sie wollen nur auf sich selbst achten und ihr Leben so gut wie möglich gestalten, aber sie achten niemals auf jemanden, der unter ihnen steht. \"Die Fleischfabrik\" zeigt dies auf vielfältige Weise. Der offensichtlichste Bereich sind die Besitzer und Manager der großen Fabriken. Alles, was sie wollen, ist, ihre Unternehmen und Fabriken so groß und großartig wie möglich zu machen. Sie kümmern sich nicht um jemanden oder etwas, das ihnen im Weg steht oder das durch ihre Fortschritte verletzt wird. Laut Upton Sinclairs Werk heißt es: „Die Gebäude reihten sich klar und schwarz gegen den Himmel; hier und da stiegen aus der Masse die großen Schornsteine empor, und der Rauchstrom floss bis zum Ende der Welt.“ Sinclair versucht, ein Bild vom großen Schaden zu zeichnen, der durch diese Verschmutzung entsteht. Er zeigt, dass die Besitzer keinen Respekt für eine Person oder ein Tier haben, das verletzt werden könnte. Sie kümmern sich nicht um die großen Rauchwolken, die aus den Fabriken strömen, oder um die tierischen Kot- und Urinabflüsse aus den Tausenden von Ställen rund um Packingtown. \n\nDie Besitzer und Manager kümmerten sich auch nicht um ihre Mitarbeiter, die für ihren Reichtum arbeiteten. Sie würden alles tun, um einen zusätzlichen Dollar zu verdienen oder zu sparen: „Von oben bis unten ist der Ort einfach ein brodelnder Kessel aus Neid und Hass; es gibt keine Loyalität oder Anstand, es gibt keinen Ort, an dem ein Mensch etwas wert ist gegen einen Dollar.“ Sie zwingen ihre Mitarbeiter, schreckliche Arbeitszeiten zu bewältigen, und ohne jegliche Ankündigung können sie jederzeit ganze Gruppen von Arbeitern ohne Entschädigung oder Hilfe bei der Jobsuche entlassen. In der Zeit, in der \"Die Fleischfabrik\" spielt, gab es kaum oder gar keine Gesetze oder Vorschriften, die den Arbeitsschutz oder das Wohlbefinden der Arbeiter schützten. Dies ermöglichte es den Managern und Eigentümern, außer Rand und Band zu geraten und ihre Mitarbeiter zu zwingen, den Fortschritt zu beschleunigen und unter schrecklichen Bedingungen zu arbeiten. Obwohl das Buch es nicht direkt sagt, werden die Menschen, die in Packingtown lebten und arbeiteten und sich selbst zum Tode schrieben, einfach erwartet, sich mit den furchtbaren Bedingungen sowohl bei der Arbeit in den Fabriken als auch in ihrer Umgebung abzufinden. Es gab keine Agenturen oder Organisationen, die Informationen oder Hilfe für den Arbeiter bereitstellten. Es gab zwar Gewerkschaften, aber diese taten oft mehr Schaden als Nutzen, denn sie verdienten Geld mit den armen Arbeitern. Die Arbeiter wurden so schlecht behandelt und hatten keine Möglichkeit, dem System von Packingtown zu entkommen, dass sie als Sklaven beschrieben wurden: „Hier ist eine Bevölkerung, niedriggestellte und meist ausländische, die immer am Rande des Hungers hängt und für ihre Lebensmöglichkeiten von einem Whim von Männern abhängig ist, die genauso brutal und unehrlich sind wie die alten Sklavenhalter; unter solchen Umständen ist Unmoral genau so unvermeidlich und allgegenwärtig wie unter dem System der Sklaverei.“\n\n## English Translation:\n\n[REWRITE]\n\nI believe that \"The Jungle\" shows how humans deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered.

    "original": "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

    "raw_output": "**German Translation:**\n\nViele Autoren nutzen verschiedene Wege, um ihren Lesern ein bestimmtes Gefühl oder eine bestimmte Einstellung gegenüber wichtigen Themen zu vermitteln. Einige dieser Techniken sind effektiver als andere. F. Scott Fitzgerald verwendet viele dieser verschiedenen Techniken in seinem Roman \"The Great Gatsby\". Manchmal verbindet Fitzgerald ein Adjektiv und ein Nomen, die normalerweise nicht so zusammenpassen, um den Lesern eine bestimmte Aura um ein Thema zu verleihen. Zu anderen Zeiten verleiht er einem Symbol eine Bedeutung und verwendet es dann zu diesem gleichen Zweck. Fitzgerald verwendet diese letzte Technik mit vielen Farben, darunter Gold, Grün, Weiß/Grau und Rot/Rosa. In seinem Roman \"The Great Gatsby\" baut F. Scott Fitzgerald Bedeutung für Farben auf, insbesondere Weiß/Grau und Rot/Rosa, und verwendet sie dann später, um den Lesern eine bestimmte Erinnerung an ein Gefühl um ein wichtiges Objekt zu geben.\n\nDie Bedeutung, die Fitzgerald aufbaut und für Weiß/Grau verwendet, ist Einheitlichkeit, wobei Weiß ein bisschen schöner und höherklassig ist und Grau älter und verblasst. Fitzgerald legt diese Bedeutung zu Beginn des Romans mit ständigem Gebrauch beider Farben fest. Daisy und Jordan sind ständig \"in Weiß\" (8) - tatsächlich trägt jeder immer Weiß: Nick trägt \"Weiße Flanellhemden\" (41) zu Gatsbys Party, Tom trägt ein \"weißes Hemd\" (36), wenn er Myrtle trifft, und Catherine ist \"pulverförmig milchweiß\" (30). Tatsächlich ist das einzige Mal, wenn die Menschen nicht weiß gekleidet sind, wenn Nick seine Eindrücke von Gatsbys Party bekommt: \"Die Hallen ... sind mit Primärfarben geschmückt\" (40). Fitzgerald definiert diese beiden Farben weiter, indem er viele alltägliche, unbedeutende Gegenstände in diesen Farben färbt: Als Nick zur Arbeit geht, fährt er \"die weißen Schluchten des unteren New York\" (56) entlang, die Namen der Leute auf Gatsbys Partys sind jetzt \"graue Namen\" (61) auf Nicks Zeitplan, Catherines Wohnung ist \"ein Stück in einer langen weißen Torte aus Wohnhäusern\" - Einheitlichkeit (28). Er beschreibt auch einfache oder gewöhnliche Menschen oder Orte als weiß oder grau: Jordan und Daisy hatten eine \"weiße Kindheit\" (19) zusammen, es gibt \"graue Autos\" und \"graue Landstriche\" (23) im Tal der Asche, das \"italienische Kind\" im Zug ist \"grau\" (26) und der Hundehändler ist \"ein grauer alter Mann\" (27).\n\nNachdem Fitzgerald genug Bedeutung für Weiß/Grau aufgebaut hat, verwendet er sie, um Unwichtigkeit oder Einheitlichkeit für bestimmte Themen zu symbolisieren. Dieser Einsatz von Farben, um dem Leser etwas zu zeigen, beginnt mit Daisy. Nach langer Zeit ohne bedeutenden Gebrauch von beiden Farben beschreibt Fitzgerald Daisy plötzlich als \"in Weiß gekleidet\" in einem \"kleinen weißen Roadster\"; die Leser beginnen, Daisy als weniger als einen Charakter, eher als ein einheitliches Element zu sehen, etwas, das Gatsby will und sich danach sehnt (74). Fitzgerald verwendet diese Technik mehr um Daisy herum, um diesen Eindruck von Daisy als ein einheitlicheres Element zu vermitteln, zum Beispiel gibt es einen \"grauen Schleier aus Daisys Pelzmantel\" (18) und sie trägt wieder ein \"weißes\" Kleid (115), bevor Tom und Gatsby aufeinandertreffen.\n\n\n\n[REWRITE]\nMany authors use different methods to give their readers a specific feeling or attitude toward important subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald employs many of these different techniques in his novel *The Great Gatsby*. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an adjective and a noun together that don't usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a subject. At other times, he imbues a symbol with meaning and then uses it for this same purpose. Fitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In his novel *The Great Gatsby*, F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, particularly white/gray and red/pink, and then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an important object.\n\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit nicer and more high-class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald establishes this meaning at the beginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly \"in white\" (8) — in fact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears \"white flannels\" (41) to Gatsby's party, Tom wears a \"white shirt\" (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is \"powdered milky white\" (30).  In fact, the only time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby's party: \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors by coloring many common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), the names of people at Gatsby's parties are now \"gray names\" (61) on Nick's timetable, Catherine's apartment is \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\"—uniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and Daisy had a \"white girlhood\" (19) together, there are \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) in the valley of ashes, the \"Italian child\" in the railroad is \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is \"a gray old man\" (27).\n\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or uniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy. After a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster\"; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character, more like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses more of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition, for example, there is a \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" (18), and she is again in a \"white\" (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter. \n[/REWRITE] \n\n\n\n",

Es gibt einen bedeutenden Markt für biologisch-organischer Gemeinschaftslandwirtschaft in der Region San Diego, wobei viele lokale Organisationen lange Wartelisten haben. Auch biologisches Ei und Milch sind beliebt. Viele Bio-Bauernhöfe bieten außerdem Führungen über ihre landwirtschaftlichen Betriebe sowie Zugang zu Wanderwegen, Vogelbeobachtungen und anderen Freizeitaktivitäten an. Dies ist die Art von Betrieb, die es dem Landbesitzer ermöglichen würde, die Vorteile von staatlichen Programmen zu nutzen und gleichzeitig das Habitat zu verbessern, was Freizeitmöglichkeiten schafft und die Durchführung von Bauernhof-Touren und anderen Programmen zur Erzielung von Einnahmen oder zu Bildungszwecken ermöglicht.\n\nNeben der Befüllung eines potenziell lukrativen Nischenmarktes bieten die Vorteile des ökologischen Landbaus oft eine höhere Biodiversität von Pflanzen und Wildtieren in der Region, da Chemikalien im Boden und im Wasser fehlen. Der ökologische Landbau hat jedoch auf einige Weise höhere Kosten als der konventionelle Landbau. Er erfordert mehr intensive Arbeits- und Betriebsführung, um Schädlinge und Unkraut zu entfernen und den Boden ohne Chemikalien zu düngen, und die Verluste sind oft größer als bei konventionellen Methoden, während ein kleiner ökologischer Betrieb auch die Skaleneffizienz großer Betriebe fehlt. Praktiken, die nicht mit ökologischem Landbau zusammenhängen, aber für die Wildtiere vorteilhaft sind, können ebenfalls höhere Arbeitskosten verursachen, einschließlich der Aussaat von Gründüngemitteln, strategischer Weidewirtschaft, der Entfernung invasiver Arten und der aktiven Steuerung des Pflanzenwachstums, um bestimmte Bedingungen wie Randhabitate oder offene Flächen zu schaffen. Es gibt daher viele Gründe, warum der Landbesitzer in diesem Beispiel finanzielle Hilfe oder Fachwissen suchen könnte, um sowohl Gewinne als auch die Habitatqualität zu maximieren.\n\nDas für dieses Szenario ausgewählte Land ist ein Grundstück neben dem Städtchen Potrero im nicht rechtsfähigen Kreis San Diego, Kalifornien.

Sie ist auch nicht einförmig oder einheitlich. Aussagen wie „alle Russen sind hartnäckig“ oder „alle Japaner sind einladend“ sind inhärent breit gefächert und zu vereinfachend. Während das Verständnis von Verallgemeinerungen einer Kultur angebracht ist, ist es für einen Verhandlungspartner viel produktiver, die Bedeutung einer Kultur für die Angelegenheit zu verstehen, die im Raum steht, und wie die Einstellung dieser Kultur die Verhandlungen beeinflussen kann und wird. Wenn man eine fremde Kultur annimmt, erlebt man sie auf eine Art und Weise, die mit der eigenen Kultur vergleichbar ist, und Vergleiche ergeben sich zwangsläufig. \n\nDas Verstehen einer fremden Kultur oder Denkweise kann alles umfassen, von der Erforschung ihrer Geschichte bis zur Erkenntnis ihrer Vorurteile. Anstatt eine Kultur zu verurteilen oder zu versuchen, sie zu ändern, muss man sie einfach akzeptieren, wie sie ist, und innerhalb ihrer Grenzen arbeiten, insbesondere im Rahmen der Verhandlungen, und besonders, wenn man mit einer schwächeren Verhandlungsposition an den Tisch kommt. Ebenso kann ein Respekt für Traditionen und Überzeugungen nur helfen, kulturelle Barrieren zu überwinden und die Verhandlungen voranzutreiben, wenn ein Verhandlungspartner sich auf „fremdem“ Gebiet befindet.\n\nEs ist wichtig zu beachten, dass Kultur sich nicht unbedingt auf ein national/internationales Dilemma beschränkt. Die meisten Unternehmen innerhalb einer bestimmten Nation schaffen ihre eigene Unternehmenskultur. Zum Beispiel könnte eine Unternehmenskultur lange Arbeitszeiten im Büro oder einen entspannteren Stundenplan betonen. Belege für eine Unternehmenskultur sind in Dresscodes der Mitarbeiter zu sehen, im Kommunikationstil (direkte vs. indirekte Kommunikation, Delegation von Aufgaben) und in den Einstellungspraktiken. Einige Unternehmen fördern Wohltätigkeit in jeder Hinsicht von den Mitarbeitern, während andere sie auf „von Unternehmen genehmigte“ Wohltätigkeitsorganisationen oder Spendenaktionen beschränken. Man muss nur die Unterschiede in der amerikanischen Unternehmenskultur von Unternehmen zu Unternehmen betrachten (und tatsächlich existiert sogar intra-unternehmenspezifische Vielfalt von Region zu Region, von städtischen zu suburbanen Umgebungen) , um die Vielfalt der Gedanken zu schätzen, die in einer bestimmten gesellschaftlichen Kultur existieren kann. Bestimmte Kulturen sind nicht annähernd so geschichtet wie die amerikanische Kultur und erscheinen einem Außenstehenden möglicherweise einheitlicher, aber ein ähnlicher Schein ist einfach ein Zeichen, tiefer zu graben.\n\nWerte sind noch wichtiger zu verstehen, weil sie den „Warum“ einer Kultur liefern. Wenn der Erhalt des Ansehens oder die Gemeinschaftsstimmung in einer Kultur wertgeschätzt werden, ist es sicher, dass ein Verhandlungspartner seine Firma oder seinen Vorgesetzten nicht öffentlich beschämen wird, um am Verhandlungstisch erfolgreich zu sein. Ebenso wird ein Verhandlungspartner aus einer Kultur, die einem hartnäckigen Geschäft mehr Gewicht beimisst, nicht unbedingt dazu bestimmt sein, so schnell wie möglich zu einem Kompromiss zu gelangen. Die Berücksichtigung dieser Verallgemeinerungen ist wichtig, bevor man an den Verhandlungstisch kommt. Ein Verhandlungspartner wird jedoch gut beraten sein, etwas über seinen Gegner auf persönlicher Ebene zu erfahren, um die Verhandlungen effektiv zu gestalten.\n\n [REWRITE]\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation.

    "original": "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",

Um einen Gott-artigen Figur zu ermöglichen, der möglicherweise nicht dem gleichen entspricht, an dem unsere beiden Autoren glauben, würde es uns nicht erlauben, ihre beiden Argumente angemessen zu vergleichen, da sie im Wesentlichen die Verteidigung eines spezifischen Gotteskonzepts sind. \nDagegen möchte ich vorschlagen, dass obwohl jeder von ihnen gültige Punkte bringt, keiner wirklich eine ganzheitliche Grundlage für den Glauben an Gott bietet.\nUm diesen Punkt zu veranschaulichen, werden wir zunächst das grundlegende Argument von St. Anselm untersuchen. Ansels Passage spiegelt einen Weg wider, Wissen durch Glauben zu erlangen, indem man nach innen schaut, um Beweise für Gott zu finden. Er erklärt, dass weil Gott in unserem Verständnis existiert, können wir seine Nichtexistenz nicht effektiv begreifen. Während dieses Konzept, wenn es in seiner Terminologie ausgearbeitet wird, etwas mühsam und manchmal unklar ist, ist das grundlegende Prinzip, dass der Beweis für Gott in unserem eigenen Geist liegt. St. Anselm schlägt uns vor, dass wir nicht über die Grenzen unserer eigenen Seele hinausgehen müssen, um Wahrheit über Gott zu finden, sondern dass die Existenz dieses Wesens einfach dadurch wahr ist, dass wir das untersuchen, was wir in unseren eigenen Köpfen als wahr kennen. Fremde Beweise sind mutmaßlich unnötig. Dieses Konzept der Annahme dessen, wofür es keinen unbestreitbaren Körper empirischer Beweise gibt, wird in christlichen Texten oft als Glaube bezeichnet.\nDiese Idee unterscheidet sich stark von der von St. Thomas von Aquin. Aquin schlägt stattdessen vor, dass die Existenz Gottes vollständig durch Vernunft und empirische Beweise bewiesen werden kann, ohne jeglichen Glauben. Eine solche Idee wäre im Evangelismus, einem wichtigen Element des Christentums, vorteilhaft, da es die Rekrutierung neuer Konvertiten ohne Abhängigkeit von ihrer Bereitschaft ermöglichen würde, etwas anzunehmen, was nicht bewiesen werden kann. Sie könnten stattdessen allein durch Logik überzeugt werden. St. Thomas erläutert fünf verschiedene logische Argumente, die die Existenz Gottes stützen: Veränderung, Kausalität, Kontingenz, Grad der Exzellenz und Harmonie. In jedem von ihnen demonstriert er im Wesentlichen, dass der Beweis für Gott in der logischen Notwendigkeit für Gott liegt. Wenn man einem sagt, dass ihm ein fehlendes Puzzle-Teil fehlt, und man den Rest des Puzzles zusammenstellt, gebietet die Logik, dass man die Merkmale und die Existenz des fehlenden Teils kennen kann, ohne ihn zu sehen.\n\n[REWRITE]\n\"The fool has said in his heart, 'There is no God.' This quotation is first seen in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm's argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine whose is the better of the two, we must, for the sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\nTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm's passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within oneself to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one's own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn't go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\nThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it. \n\n[/REWRITE]\n",

Chr. wurde ein Prinz geboren, der eines Tages Buddha genannt werden sollte. Im Laufe seines Lebens gab er der Welt den Rücken und wurde erleuchtet, und seine Lehren führten zur Entstehung des Buddhismus - der orthodoxeste Zweig davon ist der Theravada-Buddhismus. Die Religion ist etwa zweitausendfünfhundert Jahre alt; sie sieht heute anders aus als zu Buddhas Lebzeiten. Das lässt sich überall sehen, zum Beispiel in der Theravada-Nation Sri Lanka, wo die jährliche Wasserzeremonie abgehalten wird. Mönche und Laien nehmen an dieser Zeremonie teil, und sie hat religiöse Bedeutung, obwohl Buddha nie über eine solche Feier gelehrt hat. Diese Unterschiede reichen von den oberflächlichen Traditionen bis hin zum soteriologischen Kern der Religion. Die Theravada-Buddhistische Gemeinde, sowohl aus der monastischen als auch aus der weltlichen Perspektive, musste ihre dogmatischen Prinzipien im Laufe der Zeit ändern. Dies lässt sich sowohl auf äußere als auch innere, sowohl feindselige als auch wohlwollende Kräfte zurückführen.\n\nEs gibt eine Reihe von Qualifikationsbegriffen, die in diesem Gespräch häufig Verwendung finden werden. Es gibt das Konzept von intern versus extern. Hier ist eine interne Kraft als eine Kraft definiert, die von Mitgliedern des Buddhasasana ausgeht, unabhängig von ihrem Mönch-Status. Eine externe Kraft ist jede Kraft von Nicht-Buddhisten. Eine feindselige Kraft ist jede Kraft, die der buddhistischen Gemeinschaft Schaden zufügt oder Schaden zufügen möchte - eine Kraft, die aus einer negativen Wahrnehmung des Buddhismus entsteht. Eine wohlwollende Kraft ist eine Kraft, die der buddhistischen Gemeinschaft weder schaden noch helfen möchte - obwohl sie möglicherweise als Nebenwirkung eines oder des anderen tut. Diese Begriffe werden im Verlauf dieses Gesprächs immer wieder auftauchen.\n\nZunächst ist es wichtig, die Grundlagen der Religion zu untersuchen - die Lehren, die am Herzen des Theravada-Buddhismus liegen. Buddhisten suchen Zuflucht in dem Dreifaltigkeitsjuwel aus Buddha, Dhamma und Sangha. Das Dhamma besteht im Wesentlichen aus dem Tripitaka - den drei Körben - buddhistischer Texte. Der Sutta Pitaka enthält alle Suttas, der Vinaya Pitaka enthält die Disziplinarregeln und der Abhidhamma Pitaka enthält die metaphysischen Komponenten des Buddhismus. Die metaphysischen Vorstellungen umfassen Dinge wie Anatta - keine Seele, Dukkha - innewohnendes Leiden im Leben und Anicca - Unbeständigkeit von allem. Nur durch die Anerkennung dieser Konzepte kann man Sansara, den Kreislauf von Tod und Wiedergeburt, beenden, der sich ständig wiederholt. Zusammen mit Sansara endet auch lobha - Begierde, dosa - Hass und moha - Verwirrung, wenn man erleuchtet wird. Im Vinaya Pitaka werden Lebensregeln festgelegt. Für Laien gibt es fünf Gebote (Ich werde niemanden töten, ich werde nicht lügen, ich werde nichts stehlen, ich werde mich nicht sexuell unangemessen verhalten und ich werde keine berauschenden Substanzen zu mir nehmen). Für Mönche gibt es viele weitere Disziplinarregeln zu befolgen. Die grundlegendste Dogma im Buddhismus ist das Konzept der vier edlen Wahrheiten. Erstens, Dukkha; die Wahrheit, dass das Leben Leiden ist. Zweitens, dass Anhaftung Leiden verursacht. Drittens, dass Leiden überwunden werden kann.\n\n\n**[REWRITE]**\nSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born.

Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.

Der Höhepunkt dieser Rivalität war der Mexikanisch-Amerikanische Krieg von 1846-1848, in dem die Vereinigten Staaten Mexiko angriffen und besiegten und sich Texas und den amerikanischen Südwesten als neues Territorium sicherten. Viele weitere Zusammenstöße ereigneten sich zwischen den beiden Nationen, die schließlich kurz vor dem Ersten Weltkrieg abnahmen. Die Rivalität begann, als Amerikaner und Mexikaner in wichtigen Fragen wie Religion, Kultur und Traditionen aufeinandertrafen und einen schweren Interessenkonflikt hatten (Schmitt 1974 S. 30-31). \n\nDas ist nicht unähnlich vielen anderen Nationen, die eine anhaltende Rivalität mit einem Nachbarn haben. Nationen, die eine Grenze teilen, neigen dazu, Interessenkonflikte zu haben, die zur Entstehung rivalisierender Positionen zwischen den Nationen führen. Die Vereinigten Staaten und Mexiko ähneln in vieler Hinsicht anderen anhaltenden Rivalitäten zwischen Nationen, die eine gemeinsame Grenze teilen. David M. Pletcher (1977) stellt fest: „Nur in Mexiko und Kuba kann man langjährige übergreifende amerikanische diplomatische Probleme finden“ (S. 41). Tatsächlich sind beide Nationen geografisch nahe an den Vereinigten Staaten und waren Rivalen der Vereinigten Staaten, während andere Nationen in Lateinamerika gute Beziehungen zu den Vereinigten Staaten pflegten und pflegen. \n\nReligiöse Fragen schufen eine Kluft zwischen den beiden Nationen, ein Problem, das viele Nationen im Laufe der Geschichte plagte. Sally Frahm (2001) sagt: „Wenn Amerikaner im 20. Jahrhundert gegen Faschismus und Kommunismus war, waren sie im 18. und 19. Jahrhundert gegen Katholizismus und Monarchie“ (S.86). Nicht unähnlich der Rivalität zwischen den Vereinigten Staaten und der Sowjetunion während des Kalten Krieges war der ideologischen Kampf zum Teil und zum Teil ein Wettbewerb um Interessen, die jede Nation für wichtig hielt. In diesem Fall basierten die ideologischen Kämpfe jedoch nicht auf der politischen Struktur, sondern auf den religiösen Vorlieben der Vereinigten Staaten und Mexikos. Dieses Misstrauen entstand aus dem Misstrauen zwischen den Engländern und den Spaniern. Das Erben dieser Misstrauensgefühle von ihren ehemaligen Kolonialherren war ein großes Hindernis für die Begründung freundschaftlicher auswärtiger Beziehungen zwischen den Vereinigten Staaten und Mexiko.\n\n\nDiehl und Goerts (2000) führen 17 Streitigkeiten zwischen Mexiko und den Vereinigten Staaten im 57-jährigen Rivalitätszeitraum auf. Die Mehrheit der Streitigkeiten im von Diehl und Goerts beschriebenen Rivalitätszeitraum waren territoriale Fragen im Zusammenhang mit Grenzüberschreitungen von mexikanischem Gebiet nach Mexiko und anderen Grenzproblemen. Grenzüberschreitungen durch Banditen und Gesetzlose aus amerikanischen Grenzstädten waren ein großes Problem, das bis dahin anhielt, bis sowohl die Vereinigten Staaten als auch Mexiko militärische Gewalt an ihren Grenzen ausübten (Schmitt 1974 S. 97). \n\nSchmitt (1974) erklärt, die Rivalität zwischen den beiden Nationen begann, als „Mexiko in erheblichem Maße von den Vereinigten Staaten abhängig wurde“ (S. 109) und endete schließlich, als sich die amerikanischen Ambitionen „von der territorialen Expansion zur wirtschaftlichen Intervention in Mexiko“ (S.110) im späten 19.

Ich hatte meinen Beruf aus einem tief verwurzelten Bedürfnis nach Sicherheit und Geborgenheit gewählt, die ich als Kind nicht hatte.  \"Du wirst immer Arbeit finden; die Leute werden immer krank sein\", war das Mantra, das ich immer wieder hörte, als ich ins Erwachsenenalter kam und darüber hinaus. Also - obwohl mein Traum es war, eine Wissenschaftlerin oder Journalistin zu sein - vorzugsweise ein bisschen von beidem - entschied ich mich für das Pflegeberufe. \n\nTrotzdem war ich dort: 46 Jahre alt und ledig, kein Geld auf dem Konto und nicht in der Lage zu arbeiten. Bis heute bin ich behindert, und nach 15 Jahren, in denen ich von der Sozialhilfe gelebt habe, habe ich nichts mehr, das ich als \"meins\" bezeichnen kann. Ich komme klar, aber jeder Tag ist ein Kampf und eine Attacke auf meine Sicherheit, Geborgenheit und Selbstachtung. Nichts in meinem Leben ist mehr sicher, doch eines weiß ich mit Sicherheit: Ich hätte diese Jahre nicht überstanden, wären es nicht die Hilfe meiner Familie und ein paar guter Freunde, egal wie stark ich bin. Und glaubt mir, wenn ein echter Albtraum eintritt, fühlst du dich überhaupt nicht stark. \n\nMeiner Meinung nach wird es in jedem Leben immer wieder Notfälle geben, groß und klein. Es gibt keine Garantien und egal wie gut man sich vorbereitet, manche Dinge sind einfach zu groß, um sie allein zu bewältigen. \n\nIch stimme voll und ganz zu, dass wir in den USA aufhören müssen, all unsere Eier in den \"Korb\" der großen Regierung zu legen; Gott weiß, der ist schon schimmelig und auseinandergefallen. Dennoch würde ich viel lieber sehen, dass Amerikaner wieder lernen, einander zu vertrauen - lernen, einander zu helfen und Hilfe anzunehmen, anstatt dass jeder von uns einzeln in den Garten geht, um einen Bunker zu bauen. \n\nDie Konservativen in den USA sprechen von dem \"rugged individualism\", der dieses Land aufgebaut hat; aber in Wirklichkeit war es nicht der \"rugged individualism\", der unsere Vorfahren in harten Zeiten am Laufen hielt, sondern Mitgefühl, gegenseitiger Respekt und der Austausch von Ressourcen. Die Pioniere, die mit Wagenzügen über die Rocky Mountains zogen, kamen nicht an die Küste, weil sie alleine unterwegs waren. \n\nAlso, seien Sie auf alle Fälle vorbereitet. Ich bin es auch. Ich habe ein Notfallset; Erste-Hilfe-Utensilien, Wasserreinigungsmittel, Plastikschirme und Klebeband für die Fenster im Falle eines biologischen Angriffs. Ich habe mehrere Taschenlampen und jede Menge Batterien, viele, viele Kerzen und wasserdichte Streichhölzer und Konserven. Wenn Sie Land und Ressourcen für einen kleinen Bauernhof haben und die Möglichkeit, Ihr eigenes Essen einzukochen oder zu konservieren, tun Sie es. Das ist eine gute Idee, ebenso wie ein Holzofen, solange Sie nicht in einer Wohnung wohnen. \n\nAber während Sie dabei sind, lernen Sie Ihre Nachbarn kennen.\n\n\n[REWRITE] Fifteen years ago, I unexpectedly and suddenly became disabled by an illness I never knew existed.  \n\nI was a nurse at the time.

Gibt es Einschränkungen oder Beschränkungen, die die Richtung des evolutionären Wandels beeinflussen? Obwohl D’Arcy Thompson bereits 1917 feststellte: „Selbst jetzt hat der Zoologe kaum begonnen, die einfachsten organischen Formen in mathematischer Sprache zu definieren“, lässt sich dies heute immer noch sagen. In jüngerer Zeit wurde mathematisches Modellieren auf allgemeine Aspekte der Mollusken-Skeletogenese sowohl durch Ontogenese als auch durch Phylogenie angewandt (z. B. Raup und Stanley, 1981). Unsere Studie untersucht, wie mathematisches Modellieren von ontogenetischen und phylogenetischen Veränderungen bei Prunum, in Kombination mit experimentellen Studien, zur Aufklärung der Mechanismen verwendet werden kann, die die Richtung und das Ausmaß evolutionärer-entwicklungsbedingter Veränderungen bestimmen. Wir verwendeten Röntgenaufnahmen von Prunum-Arten, um quantitative Parameter zu definieren, die wiederum zur Modellierung hypothetischer und tatsächlicher Skelettmorphologien verwendet werden konnten. Diese Parameter wurden in das Softwareprogramm CerioShell (Stone, 1995) eingegeben. Wir modellierten hypothetische Schalenmorphologien, die zur Interpretation der Grenzen möglicher morphologischer Veränderungen bei Prunum verwendet werden können. Diese Ergebnisse werden mit experimentellen und deskriptiven Studien kombiniert, um makroevolutionäre Ereignisse in dieser Klade besser zu verstehen.\n\nEine Schale kann als eine Struktur betrachtet werden, die sich im Laufe der Zeit in einem 360-Grad-Raum bewegt. Diese Umdrehungen oder Wendungen einer gekrümmten Schale werden Wirbel genannt und gelten als spiralförmig um eine imaginäre zentrale Achse. Diese Achse verläuft durch die zentrale Säule der Schale und wird als Columella bezeichnet. Die Geschwindigkeit, mit der sich die Wirbel vergrößern können, variiert, und eine kontinuierliche Linie trennt jeden Wirbel und wird als Naht bezeichnet. Bei den meisten Schalen ist der größte Wirbel einer Schale der letzte Wirbel (Körperwirbel). Die Spitze wird als alle Wirbel außer dem letzten angesehen. Die Spitze ist die Spitze der Spitze, und das gegenüberliegende Ende wird als Basis bezeichnet. Das Tier erstreckt sich durch eine Öffnung, die als Apertura bezeichnet wird, aus seiner Schale.\n\nSchalen können in apikale, basale, aperturale und abaperturale Ansichten betrachtet werden. (Die „übliche“ Orientierung einer Schale ist eine aperturale Ansicht, mit der Apertura in Richtung des Betrachters und mit der Spitze nach oben gerichtet.)\n\nEine Methode zum Zählen von Wirbeln wird unten gezeigt. Zuerst sollte die Schale aus der apikalen Ansicht betrachtet werden, und dann sollte bestimmt werden, wo die erste Naht beginnt. Eine Linie kann dann gezogen werden, die die Schale in zwei Teile teilt. Wirbel werden von dieser Linie aus gezählt und auf ein Viertel eines Wirbels geschätzt.\n\nEine Schale kann als eine Reihe von Aperturas betrachtet werden, die sich im Laufe der Zeit und im Raum bewegen, während sich das Tier akkumulieren lässt (d. h. baut) seine Schale auf. Es ist möglich, den Pfad der Apertura zu verfolgen, indem man die Koordinaten des Zentrums der Apertura jedes Wirbels sowie den horizontalen und vertikalen Radius der Apertura verfolgt.\n\nDiese Bahn kann grafisch und mathematisch dargestellt werden. Sobald eine mathematische Formulierung erstellt wurde, ist es dann möglich, Parameter zu variieren und die Skeletogenese des Mollusken zu modifizieren.\n\n\n[REWRITE]\nWhy do organisms evolve in the way they do?

While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.

Während das Land auf dem Weg ist, viele der Millenium-Entwicklungsziele zu erreichen, wie z.B. die Ziele für Wasserversorgung und Sanitärwesen, sind die Verbesserungsraten für die Gesundheit von Kindern und Müttern weit hinter den notwendigen Verbesserungen zurück, um die Ziele bis 2015 zu erreichen.  Die vielfältigen Ursachen für diese Mängel werden unten diskutiert und verdeutlichen den Bedarf an einer Stärkung des Gesundheitssystems anstatt den Schwerpunkt auf programmatische Interventionen zu legen.\n\nIndonesien hat Fortschritte in der Anzahl der Geburten mit anwesender qualifizierter medizinischer Fachkraft erzielt, wobei 72 % der Geburten nun dieses Ziel erfüllen.  Dies bedeutet jedoch nicht, dass alle qualifizierten Fachkräfte über ausreichende medizinische Möglichkeiten verfügen.  Obwohl diese Kategorie noch immer traditionelle Arbeiter wie Hebammen einschließt, können sie bei Komplikationen während der Schwangerschaft keine medizinischen Eingriffe vornehmen (daher der hohe Prozentsatz an maternen Todesfällen durch Blutungen).  Mit anderen Worten, die erzielten Verbesserungen in diesem speziellen Indikator sind etwas irreführend, und es gibt noch viel zu tun.  Darüber hinaus hat sich der Prozentsatz der bei Kindern unter fünf Jahren behandelten Durchfallfälle durch Fachpersonal verringert.  Obwohl die Daten zur postnatalen Versorgung unvollständig sind, ist klar, dass dies auch ein besorgniserregendes Thema ist, mit niedrigen Raten im ganzen Land.\n\nDie Kaiserschnittraten liegen immer noch unter dem zu erwartenden Niveau bei etwa 4 %.  Die Kaiserschnittraten weisen außerdem auf ein weiteres Problem hin.  Während die Kaiserschnittrate in städtischen Gebieten bei 7 % liegt, liegt sie in ländlichen Gebieten bei nur 2 %.  Dies zeigt das Problem der Gerechtigkeit in der Abdeckung des Landes auf.  Die Zutritt zu Gesundheitsdiensten konzentriert sich eindeutig auf städtische Gebiete.  Ein weiteres Problem des Zugangs betrifft die vertikale Gerechtigkeit.  Es gibt eine 27%ige Kluft in der Nutzung der Dienste zwischen den ärmsten und reichsten Quintilen.  Es ist klar, dass es für die Armen viel schwieriger ist, Zugang zu Gesundheitsdienstleistungen zu erhalten, wahrscheinlich aufgrund der Eigenkosten.\n\nBeim nächsten Schritt zur Verbesserung der Indikatoren für neonatale und maternale Pflege stellt sich die grundlegendste Frage, wie man den Mangel an Dienstleistungen am effektivsten angehen kann.  Konkret: Sollte Indonesien programmspezifische Ansätze entwickeln oder das Gesamtsystem stärken, ohne sich auf die vor- und nachgeburtliche Versorgung der Mutter und des Kindes zu konzentrieren?  Es steht außer Frage, dass programmatische Ansätze, um die oben genannten Probleme zu lösen, attraktiv sind.  \"Vertikale Ansätze\", die sich auf einen Sektor der Verbesserungen konzentrieren, haben nicht nur viel genauere, handhabbarere Ziele, sondern bringen in der Regel auch schnellere Ergebnisse.  Es gibt jedoch einige Nachteile, die man bedenken sollte.  Ein Hauptnachteil ist, dass eine hohe Investition in Programmen für einen bestimmten Bereich des Gesundheitssystems oft dazu führt, dass die Finanzierung anderer Bereiche darunter leidet und dass Personal zu diesem Bereich mit mehr Ressourcen wechselt (das Beispiel der internationalen Finanzierung für HIV/AIDS und ihre Auswirkungen auf den Bereich der Familienplanung).  Zusätzlich führen mehrere parallel laufende Programme für einen Bereich zu einer Verdopplung unkoordinierter Dienstleistungen.  Dies führt zu einer Zunahme von Formularen und Papierkram für Lieferungen und Finanzierung.\n\n\n[REWRITE]The rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia has remained relatively stable over the last ten years.

The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and they point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focusing on programmatic interventions.\n\nIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births attended by skilled health workers, with 72% of births now meeting this target. However, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions if a pregnancy becomes complicated (hence the high percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage). In other words, the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading, and much work remains to be done. Additionally, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional. While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it's clear that this area is also a concern, with low rates across the country.\n\nCesarean-section rates are still lower than expected, around 4%. The c-section rates also point to another concerning issue. While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural areas. This highlights the problem of equitable coverage across the country. Clearly, access to healthcare services is concentrated around urban areas. Another access concern is vertical equity. There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles. It's clear that the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nWhen discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service. Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre- and postnatal care for the mother and child? There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are appealing. Not only do \"vertical approaches\" that target one sector of improvements have much more specific, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results. However, there are some drawbacks to keep in mind. One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example). In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs. This leads to an increase in paperwork and bureaucracy for supplies and funding.",

Zwei Romane, die als viktorianisch gelten, aber von dieser Tradition abweichen, sind Oliver Twist und Wuthering Heights. Beide Romane verwenden ein Element des Mysteriums und einen Hang zum Bizarre, atypisch für die Romane der Zeit, was die Charaktere innerhalb jedes Werkes stärkt und Einblicke bietet, die ihre Motive und Emotionen erläutern.\n\n„Und jetzt kamen ihm hosts von verwirrenden und verwirrenden Gedanken in den Sinn. Er schien immer noch zwischen Sikes und Crackit zu spazieren, die sich wütend stritten; denn die Worte, die sie sagten, klangen in seinen Ohren; und als er seine eigene Aufmerksamkeit erfasste, … fand er, dass er mit ihnen sprach…. Plötzlich sprang er zurück bei dem Knall der Feuerwaffen zurück; und es erhob sich ein lautes Geschrei und Geschrei in die Luft; Lichter blitzten vor seinen Augen, und alles war Lärm und Tumult, als eine unsichtbare Hand ihn hastig wegtrugen. Durch all diese schnellen Visionen zog sich ein undefinierbares, unruhiges Bewusstsein von Schmerz, das ihn unablässig quälte und belastete.“ \n(Dickens, 220)\n\nDie beiden Romane nutzen dieses Mysterium oft durch Traumsequenzen oder traumähnliche Zustände, obwohl Inhalt und Funktion in jedem spezifischen Fall variieren. Bei Oliver Twist offenbaren diese seltsamen Ereignisse oft Einblicke in Olivers innere Schichten, was ihn quält, und sein Bewusstsein für die wahre Natur der um ihn herum geschehenen Dinge. Wenn die Schießerei an Oliver endlich im Kapitel 28 wiederaufgenommen wird, erlebt Oliver die Schießerei lebhaft wieder, als wäre er im Traum, während er nach Hilfe sucht (siehe links). Der Abschnitt betont den Mangel an Kontrolle, den Oliver über die sich entfaltenden Ereignisse hatte, sowie die prekären Umstände, in denen sich seine Gesundheit befand, was durch Olivers Halluzinationen von Sikes und Crackit deutlich wurde. Die Schießerei selbst überwältigt ihn, alle seine Sinne werden taub, da er die „unsichtbare Hand“ nicht bemerkt, die ihn wegträgt; er erlebt seinen Verzweiflung erneut, getrennt vom Schock des Schmerzes, da der Schmerz jetzt konstant ist und mit Angst verbunden ist, anstatt mit Überraschung. Da Oliver überwältigt ist, stellt sich die Frage, wessen Wille zu seinem Unglück geführt hat, denn es war sicherlich nicht sein eigener. Diese Schießerei verstärkt die Vorstellung, dass Oliver kaum Kontrolle über irgendetwas hat, da er sich nicht einmal bemühen kann, das Ergebnis eines Ereignisses zu kontrollieren, selbst wenn sein Leben in Gefahr ist. Ein wachsendes Gefühl der Niederlage bei Oliver wird auch durch diesen Auszug angedeutet, als wäre Old Fagin damit begonnen hat, ihn zu brechen und ihn dazu zu zwingen, diese Verzweiflung anzunehmen und seine Fähigkeit, zu reagieren, zu beeinflussen. Denn sonst kann man annehmen, dass Oliver zumindest aus eigenem Interesse etwas unternommen hätte.\n\n\n„Der Tag verging – Tag! Es gab keinen Tag; er war so schnell wie gekommen – und die Nacht kam wieder; Nacht so lang und doch so kurz; lang in ihrer furchterregenden Stille und kurz in ihren flüchtigen Stunden. \n\n## English Translation:\n\nVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.

Ich habe mein Bestes gegeben, um ihnen bei allen Fächern zu helfen, in denen sie Schwierigkeiten hatten, aber meine Stärken lagen in Englisch und Lesen. Eine der Lehrerinnen fragte mich, ob ich einem kleinen Jungen namens Adrian helfen könnte (ich glaube, er war in der dritten oder vierten Klasse), der große Probleme beim Lesen hatte. Mir wurde klar, dass etwas nicht stimmte; er hatte die seltsamsten Probleme. Einige Buchstaben konnte er perfekt aussprechen, andere überhaupt nicht, es war das Merkwürdigste. Adrian war, wie ich sicher war, lateinamerikanischer Abstammung, aber der Junge sprach perfektes Englisch. Wir hatten Schwierigkeiten, bis ich an dem Tag seine Mutter traf. Ich kümmerte mich (für mangelnde bessere Bezeichnung) um ein paar Kinder, während der Rest der Nachmittagsgruppe auf einem Schulausflug war, als seine Mutter hereinkam. Seine Mutter sprach kein Wort Englisch, nur Spanisch. Mit meinem sehr schlechten Spanischkenntnissen (ich lernte gerade erst) verstanden wir uns irgendwie. Aber dann wurde mir klar wie ein Schlag: Adrian konnte perfekt lesen, er kannte einfach das englische Alphabet nicht sehr gut. Ich weiß nicht, ob diese Erkenntnis ihm wirklich geholfen hat, aber ich hoffe, dass es ihm jetzt besser geht.\n\n\nIch erzähle diese Geschichte, um das Problem der Sprachbarriere in Schulen, insbesondere hier in Kalifornien, anzusprechen. Ich erzähle sie auch, um zu beweisen, dass es nicht immer so offensichtlich ist, wie wir denken. Selbst für ein Kind, das perfektes Englisch spricht, kann das Lesen eine große Hürde sein. Ich denke, jeder kann zustimmen, dass dieses Problem existiert, also was tun wir? In Adrians Fall war die Lösung recht einfach: Nachhilfe in Englisch, insbesondere im Bereich Alphabet und Aussprache. Aber für viele Kinder, die kaum Englisch sprechen, ist die Lösung viel komplexer. Es gibt keine einfache Antwort. Das bilinguale System, der Mainstream-Eintauchen, private Nachhilfe, ESL-Kurse, nichts davon allein wird dieses Problem lösen. Der Schlüssel liegt darin, all diese Dinge zu kombinieren!\n\n\nZuerst einmal ist das bilinguale System eine großartige Idee. Nicht nur für Kinder, deren Muttersprache Spanisch ist, sondern für alle Kinder. \"Kinder in zweisprachigen Bildungsprogrammen haben nachweislich bessere akademische Leistungen als ihre Altersgenossen.\" Um diese Idee ranken sich viele Ängste, dass es eine Verschwendung von Ressourcen ist und dass die Mehrheit der Kinder in Schulen keinen Nutzen davon ziehen wird. Aber das ist falsch. Wenn wir diese Art von Programmen als Regel, anstatt als Ausnahme, in den Unterricht integrieren würden, würden alle Kinder davon profitieren. Aber wie gehen wir das an? Müssen wir alle Lehrer zweisprachig machen? Nein. Das wäre unvernünftig und etwas unrealistisch. Allerdings glaube ich, dass es keinen Grund gibt, warum wir nicht spezielle Assistenten, Tutoren, wie auch immer man sie nennen möchte, haben könnten, die zweisprachig sind.\n\n[REWRITE]\nA couple years ago, I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students.

Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.

We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",

Wenn Gott existierte, dachte ich, er hätte längst aufgehört, auf mich zu hören. \n\nIch hatte nicht gewollt, ihn sterben zu sehen, von diesem Leben in das andere. Also hatte ich es nicht getan. Ich konnte das Leben, das mich erschaffen hatte, nicht beobachten, während es endete. Ich wollte mich an meinen Vater daran erinnern, wie er gelebt hatte, und nicht wie er gestorben war. Außerdem kannte ich meinen Vater besser als sie, besser als seine Familie, und ich wusste, dass Papa nicht wollen würde, dass sein einziges Kind ein Zuschauer bei seinem Tod wäre.

The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks.

Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",

Der Begriff Supply-Chain-Management wurde 1982 von Keith Oliver, einem Berater, erfunden. Keith Oliver beschrieb den Gesamtprozess der Planung, Implementierung und Steuerung dessen, was in der Lieferkette geschieht, um die Bedürfnisse der Kunden schnell und effizient zu erfüllen.  Es gibt sechs Schlüsselelemente einer Lieferkette: Produktion, Versorgung, Lagerbestand, Standort, Transport und Information. Manager von Unternehmen verwenden diese sechs Schlüsselelemente, um den Kunden den besten Service zu bieten.\n\nDie Produktion ist der erste Schritt im Supply-Chain-Prozess. Die Produktion bildet die Grundlage für den gesamten Supply-Chain-Prozess. Die Produktionsphase wird festlegen, wann, warum, wo und wie alles produziert wird. Manager müssen wissen, was Kunden wollen. Damit die Manager wissen, was Kunden wollen, können sie den Markt betrachten. Der Markt ist der größte Indikator, um die Kundenbedürfnisse zu bestimmen. Sobald die Manager den Markt analysiert haben und die Kundennachfrage verstehen, sind sie bereit, zu entscheiden, welche Produkte hergestellt werden sollen und wie viele davon produziert werden sollen. Nachdem die Führungskräfte entschieden haben, was produziert und wie viele produziert werden sollen, sind sie bereit, zu entscheiden, wo die Produkte produziert werden sollen und welches Werk für das Volumen und die Qualität der Ware am besten geeignet ist, wobei die Kundenzufriedenheit berücksichtigt werden muss.\n\nNachdem der Produktionsort für die Produkte festgelegt wurde, konzentriert sich der nächste Schritt darauf, die Arbeitslast zu planen und die Ausstattung zu warten. Die Produktion ist ein sehr wichtiger Schritt im Supply-Chain-Prozess. Jedes Detail ist im gesamten Prozess wichtig. Wenn nicht jedes Detail entsprechend geplant ist, kann es dem Unternehmen langfristig viel Zeit und Geld kosten. Zum Beispiel habe ich früher in den Einzelhandelsgeschäften von Wal-Mart und Target gearbeitet. Beide Unternehmen haben ein Design, ein Booklet und einen Prozess für jede Einheit des Geschäfts. Es gibt einen festgelegten Grundriss dafür, wie das Erscheinungsbild der Arbeitskleidung eines Mitarbeiters von der Annahme von Sendungen von Lastwagen aussehen sollte. Die Festlegung von Ablaufprozessen ermöglicht es einem Unternehmen, reibungslos zu arbeiten, ohne Verwirrung über Richtungen und Erwartungen.\n\nDas zweite Schlüsselelement im Supply-Chain-Management ist die Versorgung. Die Versorgung wird als strategische Entscheidungen definiert, die getroffen werden sollten, um die Kernkompetenzen einer Einrichtung zu bestimmen und die Partnerschaften im Rahmen von Outsourcing sollten aus diesen Entscheidungen hervorgehen. Ein Unternehmen kann viele verschiedene Produktionszweige für ein einzelnes Produkt haben. Alle Divisionen bestehen aus unterschiedlichen Geräten, Arbeitskräften und Spezialisten. Der Manager muss entscheiden, welche Abteilung am besten zu den verschiedenen Prozessen des Produkts passt. Die Führungskräfte können auch entscheiden, die Arbeit an andere Unternehmen zu vergeben. Der Hauptgrund, warum ein Manager die Arbeit an andere Unternehmen auslagert, ist die Schaffung von Geschwindigkeit. Geschwindigkeit ist die Fähigkeit, Qualität und Flexibilität zu bieten, gleichzeitig aber Kosten zu senken oder niedrige Kosten zu halten.\n\n## English Translation:\n\n[REWRITE]Supply chain management is the flow of processes that move goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer.

    "original": "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",

Burma, auch bekannt als Myanmar, ist ein südostasiatisches Land, das von einer tyrannischen Militärjunta regiert wird, die 1962 durch einen Staatsstreich an die Macht kam. 2007 fand eine Reihe von Straßenprotesten statt, die ersten öffentlichen Proteste in einem Jahrzehnt.

Nach den ersten Aufständen begann die breite Öffentlichkeit sich für die Proteste zu interessieren. Während die burmesische Regierung zunächst widerwillig die Mönche bei friedlichen Versammlungen duldete, eskalierte die Gewalt bald in einen was für einige wie ein allumfassender Krieg zwischen den Mönchen und der Militärjunta war, mit der militärischen Invasion und Plünderung von Klöstern im ganzen Land. Ausländische Journalisten wurden sofort verhaftet und eingesperrt, wobei der japanische Fotojournalist Kenji Nagai am 27. September 2007 einfach nur wegen seiner Anwesenheit bei einem Straßenprotest getötet wurde. Während die offizielle Todesbilanz bei 13 Toten liegt, wird Colonel Hla Win, der einige Tage vor dem offiziellen Bericht aus dem Militär desertierte, zitiert: „In den letzten Tagen wurden mehr Menschen getötet, als du gehört hast. Die Leichen lassen sich in mehreren Tausend zählen.“\n\nDas ist nichts Neues. Während dies einige der jüngsten Beispiele für Gräueltaten in unserer Welt sind, besteht der Wunsch einer Regierung, Dissens zu unterdrücken und die vollständige Kontrolle über ihre Bürger zu behalten, seit jeher. Frührömische Kaiser erklärten sich für von den Göttern erwählt, eine vollständige Exekutivgewalt über jeden Aspekt ihrer Gesellschaft zu haben. Es wird angenommen, dass japanische Kaiser tatsächlich Götter sind, die in unsere Welt geschickt wurden, um ihr Volk durch die Erfindung von Motorola-Mobiltelefonen und Hara-Kiri zum Wohlstand zu führen, und unser aktueller Präsident, George W. Bush, hat wöchentliche Videokonferenzen mit Ted Haggard, dem Leiter von „Stupid People Worldwide“, einer Tochtergesellschaft der Republikanischen Partei.\n\nEinige der bekanntesten Beispiele für diese Handlungen sind Ereignisse wie der Protest am 4. Juni 1989 auf dem Tiananmen-Platz, bei dem Intellektuelle, Arbeiter und Studenten versammelten, um gegen die autoritäre Herrschaft der Regierung zu protestieren. Die Todesbilanz in diesem Fall variiert stark, wobei offizielle Berichte der chinesischen Regierung 200-300 Tote angeben, während Berichte des Chinesischen Roten Kreuzes zwischen 2.000 und 3.000 Toten melden. Ein weiteres Beispiel ist der Völkermord in Ruanda in den 1990er Jahren, bei dem Hutu-Milizen, unterstützt von der ruandischen Regierung, systematisch Tutsis und politische Moderaten aller ethnischen Hintergründe massakrierten. Hitlers „Drittes Reich“, eine Periode, die sich über mehrere Jahre und mehrere Länder erstreckte, in der alle Menschen jüdischer Abstammung zusammengetrieben und getötet wurden, ist ein weiteres extremes Beispiel. \n\n\n## [REWRITE]\n\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, the star of \"Juno\", stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with a Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian country ruled by a tyrannical military junta that came to power in 1962 through a coup d'état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name \"The Saffron Revolution\", christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republican Party.\n\nSome of the most well-known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead. Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example.\n\n[/REWRITE]\n",

Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

    "raw_output": "Duke Ellington’s Erbe im Jazz leitet sich zum großen Teil aus seiner Langlebigkeit und ihrer damit verbundenen kreativen Fähigkeit her, seine Orchester zu formen. Ellings presence am Klavier ist in vielen der für diese Aufgabe ausgewählten Kompositionen subtil, aber als Komponist überzeugte Ellington mit der Schaffung von reichhaltigen und komplexen Stücken, die die individuellen Fähigkeiten der Bandmitglieder hervorhoben. Ellington schuf den Rahmen, in dem ein Solist frei improvisieren konnte, zusätzlich zu eng arrangierten Stücken und Phrasen, die den besonderen Stil der Bandmitglieder beanspruchten, um musikalische Ideen hervorzuheben. Dabei betonte er auch den Ton des Orchesters im Allgemeinen und schuf kohärente und originelle Klänge, die zu jedem Stück passten. Ellings Meisterschaft über den individuellen Klang der Spieler sowie über ihre Zusammenspielfähigkeit in einem wachsenden Ensemble ermöglichte es ihm, einige der innovativsten und brillantesten Stücke der Jazzgeschichte zu schreiben.\nDas Grove Music-Lexikon erwähnt in Bezug auf Ellings Klang und Innovation „Creole Love Call“ und erwähnt die Verwendung der Stimme „als Jazzinstrument“ während seiner gesamten Karriere. Dies ist ein frühes Beispiel für Ellings Verwendung der Stimme, um Textur und Farbe hinzuzufügen, ohne die Einschränkung von Text. „Creole Love Call“ zeigt auch Ellings Fähigkeit, den Stil seiner Solisten zu ergänzen, was sich in seiner gesamten Karriere zeigt. Dieses langsames, vorsichtige zwölftaktige Bluesstück enthält sechs Strophen, wie folgt:\nStrophe 1: Ruf und Antwort zwischen Stimme und Holzbläsern, wobei die Stimme zunächst glatt und melodisch beginnt, dann gegen Ende zu einem raueren Klang übergeht.\nStrophe 2: Gedämpftes Trompetensolo, das die grundlegende Melodie weiterentwickelt und mehrere verlängerte Bluesnoten betont.\nStrophe 3: Weites Klarinettensolo in einem hohen Register, untermalt von einem subtilen synkopierten Klavierakkord.\nStrophe 4: Das gesamte Orchester wiederholt die erste Strophe mit einem Ruf und Antwort der Bläser- und Holzbläser-Sektionen.\nStrophe 5: Die klimatische Strophe des Stückes, da die Holzbläser nun den Ruf und die Antwort in einem hohen Register beginnen, unterstützt von synkopiertem Stop-Time der Bläser- und Rhythmus-Sektionen.\nStrophe 6: Eine Rückkehr zur Struktur der ersten Strophe mit Ruf und Antwort zwischen Stimme und Holzbläsern. In dieser Strophe nimmt die Stimme den Klang der „Growl“-Technik an und spielt als Instrument Solo.\nTag: Kurzes Tag mit einem Gesangspass und einem dissonanten Neuheitsergebnis durch ein Trombon.\nEllings Verwendung der Stimme, um dieser Strophe eine Dimension der Klangfarbe hinzuzufügen, ist ein Beispiel für ein stilistisches Merkmal, das sich durch seine Arbeit zieht. \nIn „Hot and Bothered“, aufgenommen ein Jahr später, kombiniert Ellington seine Fähigkeit zum engen Orchestration mit seinem Gehör für Klangfarbe. Eine Ruf- und Antwort-Phrase zwischen „Bubber“ Miley am gedämpften Trompeten und Baby Cox’s Scat-Gesang nutzt die vokalen Elemente des Spiels von Miley und die instrumentalen Aspekte der Stimme von Cox, um einen reichen und komplementären Klang zu erzeugen. „It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing)“ erweitert diese Ideen, da Ellington Joe „Tricky Sam“ Nanton, einen Hauptbestandteil des Ellington-Orchesters, hervorragend einsetzt, um die Melodie am gedämpften Trombon einzuführen.\n\n\n[REWRITE] Duke Ellington’s legacy in jazz stems largely from his longevity and, consequently, his creative ability to shape his orchestra.

Bis jetzt hatte sie beschlossen, dass sie jemanden, anstatt etwas, wollte. Trotzdem hatte sie kein Interesse an irgendwelchen Jungen gezeigt. Einige waren an ihr interessiert gewesen, hatten die unangenehme Versuche unternommen, die Unannehme zu umwerben, aber niemand hatte ihr gefallen. Oft stellte sie sich selbst diese seltsame Vorstellung zur Frage und versuchte zu überlegen, was diesem seltsamen Ereignis mit einem Teenager-Mädchen möglicherweise zugrunde lag. Die wenigen Jahre der Kontemplation hatten Theorien hervorgebracht, aber nichts, das gut genug für sie wäre, um darüber wirklich zu spekulieren. Also lebte sie ihr Leben und stellte ständig ihre Wünsche in Frage.\n\nEin Tag zu Hause war normalerweise ein friedlicher Ding. Ihre Eltern waren gute und ruhige Menschen. Sie stritten nie miteinander und seltsamerweise waren Streits mit ihrer Tochter sehr selten. Das einzige, worüber sie sich jemals stritten, war ihre Behauptung von Unabhängigkeit und freier Persönlichkeit. Sie war die Tochter eines sehr ruhigen Paares, aber sie entgegenstellte sich mit Sicherheit ihren Energien mit ihrer umfangreichen und lustigen Persönlichkeit, was sie in Kombination mit ihrer Freundlichkeit sehr sympathisch machte.\n\nHeute war es aber nicht ein ruhiger Tag.

Schätzchen, ich ... brauche dich, um mich ins - Krankenhaus zu bringen.\" Die Worte waren gehetzt und angespannt und ihre Tochter konnte spüren, dass sie unvorstellbare Schmerzen hatte. \"Okay, Mama, sag mir einfach, wo ich dich abholen kann.\" Ihre Mutter dirigierte ihre Hände und in diesem Moment war die Heldin des Hauses sehr dankbar, dass sie Kurse besucht hatte, um sich zu stärken.

    "original": "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates.

    "raw_output": "## German Translation:\n\nIm Jahr 2007 geriet die Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika in eine verheerende Finanzkrise. Die Arbeitslosigkeit stieg, der Immobilienmarkt brach zusammen und viele der größten und wichtigsten Unternehmen Amerikas wurden ruiniert. Diese Rezession hält bis heute an, daher müssen wir uns die Frage stellen: Wie ist diese Krise entstanden und wie können wir sie stoppen? Kurz gesagt, die Finanzkrise wurde durch egoistisches und naives politisches Handeln geschaffen, das Banken und Unternehmen dazu drängte, Subprime-Kredite in eine bereits unreife und unzureichende Finanzinfrastruktur zu vergeben. Währenddessen wurden Fannie Mae (FNMA) und Freddie Mac (FHLMC) unter Druck gesetzt, diese Hypotheken in CDOs und CDSs zu unterzeichnen und neu zu strukturieren. Als die Kreditnehmer diese Kredite nicht zurückzahlten, waren die Banken knapp bei Kapitalreserven und übertrugen diesen Chaos auf die neu strukturierten Hypotheken, die sie verkauft hatten, und auf den Rest der Wirtschaft.\n\nDie Finanzkrise hatte ihre Wurzeln im Jahr 1999 der Clinton-Ära, als der Präsident auf eine zweite Amtszeit hinarbeitete. Er strebte danach, seine Präsidentschaft zu verlängern, indem er seine Popularität steigerte. Um dies zu erreichen, lockerte die Clinton-Administration die Kreditbestimmungen, was sieben Jahre später die Bühne für die Subprime-Krise bereitete. Steven Holmes vom New York Times berichtete 1999: „Fannie Mae, der größte Vermittler von Hypotheken in Amerika, steht unter wachsendem Druck von der Clinton-Administration, Kredite für Menschen mit niedrigem und mittlerem Einkommen zu erweitern und spürt Druck von Aktionären, das phänomenale Wachstum der Gewinne zu erhalten.“ Holmes sah die Folgen dieser Maßnahmen vorausschauend: „Aber die staatlich subventionierte Körperschaft könnte in einer Wirtschaftskrise in Schwierigkeiten geraten und eine staatliche Rettung erforderlich machen, ähnlich der der Bausparkassenbranche in den 1980er Jahren.“ Wie in der Einleitung und wie Holmes vorausgesehen hat, würde ungeplantes Kreditgeben sicherlich zum Zusammenbruch der Wirtschaft führen.\n\nViele Faktoren haben die Wirtschaft in einen Strudel gestürzt, einer davon war die neue und komplexe Struktur von Hypotheken. Variable Zinssätze, hypothekenbesicherte Wertpapiere und kolateralisierte Schuldverschreibungen (CDOs) wurden in den Jahren vor der Krise umfassend genutzt und trugen nur dazu bei, mehr Sektoren der Wirtschaft an den Immobilienmarkt zu knüpfen. Dies führte dazu, dass US-Haushalte und die Finanzmärkte im Allgemeinen überaus hoch verschuldet im Immobilienmarkt waren, was sie extrem anfällig für selbst kleine Preisänderungen machte.\n\nIn der Tat platzte die Immobilienblase, und die Finanzinstitute, die diese hypothekenbesicherten Wertpapiere gekauft hatten, wurden in Schwierigkeiten gebracht. Die fünf größten US-Investmentbanken meldeten zusammen im Jahr 2007 Hypothekenkredite in Höhe von 4,1 Billionen US-Dollar, was etwa 30 % des US-BIP ausmachte. Letztendlich wurden Bear Sterns und Merrill Lynch zu unverschämt niedrigen Preisen verkauft, Lehman Brothers wurde demontiert und Goldman Sachs und Morgan Stanley gezwungen, zu kommerziellen Banken zu werden, die einer intensiven Regulierung unterworfen wurden. Fannie und Freddie hatten 5 Billionen US-Dollar Hypothekenkredite und wurden im September 2008 staatlichen Kontrolle unterstellt.\n\n\n\n[REWRITE]\nIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis.

Eine angemessene Einführung in die Figur des Mannes würde dir erlauben, dich emotional in sein Schicksal zu verstricken und dir Einblicke in die Figur der Heldin geben: was sie an ihm sah, wie tief ihre Verbindung war, Hinweise auf ihre Gedanken, Überzeugungen und Träume, die sich durch das Prisma seiner Augen widerspiegeln, und so weiter.  Du würdest mit ihr um seinen Tod trauern und würdest so mehr mit der Heldin selbst verbunden fühlen.\n\nKurz gesagt, du würdest erwarten, dass es Fleisch auf dem einfachen Knochen der Handlung gibt: \"Sie trafen sich, sie heirateten, er starb\".\n\nAls Autor musst du dieses Fleisch liefern.  (*sieht sich die Metapher an, seufzt und taucht weiter ein*) Manchmal ist es verlockend, bestimmte Dinge zu überspringen.

A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on. You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat. (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*) Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things. Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",

    "raw_output": "Ich habe mir zwei Nachrichten aus Columbus, Ohio angesehen. Die erste, die „live“ war, war NBC 4 heute Morgen (13. August 2011). Die Hauptnachricht handelte von einem Mann aus Ashley, Ohio, der seine Frau erstochen hatte. Es wurde zwar nicht ihr Name genannt, aber sein Name war Shad Hostettler. Sie zeigten sein Polizeibild, und er sah aus wie pure Bosheit. Sie widmeten dieser Geschichte nur etwa zwei Minuten, da sie sich noch entwickelte. Die einzigen Details, die sie nannten, waren, dass er sie mehrmals erstochen hatte und festgenommen worden war. Ich denke, sie haben angemessen viel Zeit für diese Geschichte aufgewendet.  \nDie zweite Geschichte handelte von einer Schießerei gegen frühen Morgen, bei der Travis Buyers, 18 Jahre alt, verletzt wurde. Er wurde in der Sharon Woods area erschossen und schwer verletzt; zu diesem Zeitpunkt gab es noch keine Festnahmen oder Verdächtige. Das SWAT-Team ermittelte im Tatort. Diese Geschichte schien kurz zu sein, und ich glaube, das liegt daran, dass es sich um einen „schwarzen“ Mann oder ein schwarzes Viertel handelte. Ich habe bemerkt (und das schon seit Jahren), dass Minderheiten bei einem Verbrechen als Opfer übergangen werden, wenn sie Opfer eines Verbrechens sind. Wenn ein „weißer“ Kind oder Erwachsener entführt oder vermisst wird oder Opfer eines Verbrechens wird, wird die Medien hysterisch; aber wenn es sich um eine Person aus einer Minderheit handelt, ist es Glückssache, wenn es überhaupt erwähnt wird.  \nDie nächste Geschichte handelte vom Schussloch, das im Med-Flight-Hubschrauber gefunden worden war. Es wurden Details gegeben, wo sie dachten, dass der Vorfall stattgefunden hatte. Es wurde festgestellt, dass es sich um eine .22-Kaliber-Patrone aus einem Gewehr handelte, die den Hubschrauber getroffen hatte. Crime-Stoppers bieten eine fünfttausend Dollar Belohnung für Hinweise an, die zur Festnahme des Schützen führen.  \nDie nächste Geschichte handelte von dem Regen und dem Gewitter, die für Samstagnachmittag vorhergesagt wurden. Sie sagten, die Temperaturen würden über das Wochenende in den mittleren bis unteren achtzigern bleiben. Die Länge der Zeit war etwas kurz, aber sie wollten sie als „Teaser“ verwenden, damit du dranbleibst. \nSie berichteten auch über einen Raubüberfall auf ein UDF in Clime Road in Columbus. Sie sagten, es sei ein dunkelhäutiger schwarzer Mann gewesen, der den Laden ausgeraubt habe, und er habe einen Kapuzenpullover getragen. Sie sagten, er sei etwa sechs Fuß groß und wiege etwa 150 Pfund. Ich fand, dass sie ungewöhnlich viel Zeit damit verbrachten, zu betonen, dass er schwarz sei und wie dunkel er sei.  \nEine weitere Geschichte handelte von Rene Rodriguez, der ein verurteilter Drogenboss aus Texas war. Er war wegen des Verschwörung, große Mengen Marihuana von Texas nach Ohio zu vertreiben, verurteilt worden. Eine merkwürdige Sache, die ich bemerkte, war, dass sie anstatt zu sagen, er sei zu 25 Jahren Gefängnis verurteilt worden, sagten „300“ Monate. Ich bin mir nicht sicher, was der Hintergrund war, ob sie dachten, das klinge härter oder was. Sie nannten auch, dass er ein hispanischer Mann sei, ich glaube nicht, dass das wirklich relevant für die Geschichte war.\n\n\n[REWRITE]\nI watched two newscasts from Columbus, Ohio.

As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology.

Mit dem technologischen Fortschritt von primitiv zu modern entwickelten sich auch die Metaphern, die zur Beschreibung des Gehirns verwendet wurden. Anfangs wurde es mit einer Wachstafel verglichen, dann mit einem Papyrusblatt, dann mit einem Buch und zuletzt mit einem Computer. Wenn Sie mehr über das Gehirn lernen, denken Sie daran, dass die Nützlichkeit dieser Metaphern begrenzt ist und zu falschen Schlüssen führen kann.\nDie Informationsverarbeitung beginnt mit Eingaben von den Sinnesorganen, die physikalische Reize wie Berührung, Wärme, Schallwellen oder Lichtphotonen in elektrochemische Signale umwandeln. Die sensorische Information wird von den Algorithmen des Gehirns sowohl nach oben als auch nach unten wiederholt transformiert. Zum Beispiel, wenn Sie ein Bild einer schwarzen Box auf weißem Hintergrund betrachten, stellt die Verarbeitung von unten nach oben sehr einfache Informationen wie Farbe, Ausrichtung und die Grenzen des Objekts zusammen – wo sich die Farbe über einen kurzen Abstand signifikant ändert – um zu entscheiden, dass Sie eine Box sehen. Die Verarbeitung von oben nach unten verwendet die Entscheidungen, die in einigen Schritten der Verarbeitung von unten nach oben getroffen wurden, um die Erkennung der Box zu beschleunigen. Die Verarbeitung von oben nach unten in diesem Beispiel könnte Ihnen helfen, das Objekt als schwarze Box zu identifizieren, anstatt als boxförmige Öffnung auf dem weißen Hintergrund.\nSobald die Information zu einem gewissen Grad verarbeitet wurde, entscheidet ein Filter der Aufmerksamkeit, wie wichtig das Signal ist und welchen kognitiven Prozessen es zur Verfügung gestellt werden soll. Zum Beispiel verarbeitet Ihr Gehirn zwar jedes Grasbüschel, wenn Sie auf Ihre Schuhe schauen, aber ein gesundes Aufmerksamkeitfilter verhindert, dass Sie sie einzeln wahrnehmen. Im Gegensatz dazu könnten Sie Ihren Namen herausfiltern, selbst wenn er in einem lauten Raum gesprochen wird. Es gibt viele Verarbeitungsschritte, und die Ergebnisse der Verarbeitung werden wiederholt durch die Aufmerksamkeit moduliert.\nDamit das Gehirn Informationen verarbeiten kann, muss diese zuerst gespeichert werden. Es gibt mehrere Arten der Erinnerung, darunter sensorische, Arbeits- und Langzeitgedächtnis. Zuerst wird die Information codiert. Es gibt Arten der Kodierung, die spezifisch für jede Art von Sinnesreiz sind. Zum Beispiel kann die verbale Eingabe strukturell codiert werden, was auf das Aussehen des gedruckten Wortes verweist, phonetisch, was auf den Klang des Wortes verweist, oder semantisch, was auf die Bedeutung des Wortes verweist. Sobald Informationen gespeichert sind, müssen sie aufbewahrt werden. Einige Tierstudien deuten darauf hin, dass das Arbeitsgedächtnis, das Informationen für ungefähr 20 Sekunden speichert, durch ein elektrisches Signal, das für einen kurzen Zeitraum durch eine bestimmte Reihe von Neuronen läuft, aufrechterhalten wird. Es wird vermutet, dass Informationen im Langzeitgedächtnis in der Struktur bestimmter Proteinarten aufrechterhalten werden.\nEs gibt zahlreiche Modelle darüber, wie das Wissen im Gehirn organisiert ist, einige basieren auf der Art und Weise, wie menschliche Probanden Erinnerungen abrufen, andere auf Informatik und wieder andere auf Neurophysiologie. Das semantische Netzwerkmodell besagt, dass es Knoten gibt, die Konzepte repräsentieren, und dass die Knoten basierend auf ihrer Verwandtschaft miteinander verknüpft sind. Zum Beispiel könnte „Stuhl“ in einem semantischen Netzwerk mit „Tisch“ verknüpft sein, das wiederum mit „Holz“ verknüpft sein kann, und so weiter.\n\n\n[REWRITE] The human brain is a complex, creative system for processing information.

    "transformed": "The human brain is a complex, creative system for processing information. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing begins with input from the senses, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. Sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the brain's algorithms in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth.",

    "raw_output": "## German Translation:\n\nAldous Huxley kritisiert in seinem Roman \"Brave New World\" die bevorstehende Bedrohung sowohl durch Technologie als auch durch die kapitalistische Struktur, die sie durch die Schaffung einer Dystopie verstärkt. Seine Menschen schätzen Gemeinschaft über den Einzelnen und werden von Anfang an darauf programmiert, oberstes Gut den unmittelbaren Glückseligkeit nachzujagen. Die Bürger entpuppen sich als Bauern im großen Spiel, gefangen in einer einzigen Ideologie, die vom Weltkontrolleur diktiert wird. Unter dem Blickwinkel des marxistischen Theismus fällt auf, welchen Misstrauen der Autor gegenüber der Entwicklung der genannten Systeme hegt. Häufige Terminologie des Marxismus, wie Homogenität und Reifikation, unterstreichen die Idee, dass Huxleys Roman ein Kommentar zu den Fehlern der sich entwickelnden Wirtschaft seiner Zeit ist.\n\nKapitalismus wird durch die Verwendung der marxistischen These des falschen Bewusstseins satirisiert. Im Wesentlichen wird dem gemeinen Volk die wahre Beziehung zu anderen Klassen in wirtschaftlicher Hinsicht vorenthalten, da sie hauptsächlich an ihrem eigenen Gewinn interessiert sind. Es wird als Ergebnis der ideologischen Kontrolle des Proletariats und der einfachen Arbeiterklasse angesehen, was durch die Konditionierung der Menschen in \"Brave New World\" deutlich wird. Die unteren Klassen, Delta, Gamma usw., haben keinen wirklichen Willen ihrer eigenen; durch Hypnopädie wird der Drang zu konsumieren, auszugeben und sich zu ergötzen über alles andere verstärkt. Dies wird, wie bereits erwähnt, vom Weltkontrolleur manipuliert. Hegemonie, also die Idee, dass Gruppen sozialer Klassen von einer separaten Gruppe von Individuen insgesamt dominiert werden, wird in diesem Fall offensichtlich verwendet. Die unteren Klassen sind völlig unkundig von der Manipulation und kaufen buchstäblich in eine Ideologie ein, die diese Struktur unterstützt (d.h. Kapitalismus & Konsumismus). Die oberen Klassen werden mit der Fähigkeit zur Bewusstheit geboren, tun aber nichts; nur wenige Alphas oder Betas, abgesehen von Figuren wie Bernard, tun etwas mehr als ihren Platz ebenfalls anzunehmen. Tatsächlich sind die Wechselwirkungen der sozialen Klassen, wie später ausführlicher diskutiert werden, wichtige Hinweise auf die wahrgenommene Unterdrückung des Kapitalismus.\n\nBeziehungen zwischen unterschiedlichen Individuen existieren in \"Brave New World\" nicht. Der Roman scheint die Charaktere nicht zu unterscheiden - sie sind, selbst unter den Hauptfiguren, mangelnd tiefgründig. Vielleicht schlägt Huxley vor, dass der Aufstieg von Technologie und Kapitalismus zusammen dem Menschen seinen freien Willen und seine Ausdruckskraft nehmen. Liebe existiert nicht, ebenso wenig wie extreme Emotionen; stattdessen bleiben die Interaktionen oberflächlich und werden deutlich durch die Bemerkungen der Männer über Frauen hauptsächlich in Bezug auf ihr körperliches Aussehen (z. B. „pneumatische Qualität“) und die unbeschamten Kommentare der Frauen über ihre Begegnungen dargestellt. Darüber hinaus zeigt die Gleichgültigkeit jeder Gesellschaftsklasse gegenüber ihrem Status in der Hierarchie die sozioökonomischen Auswirkungen des Kapitalismus. Ihre absolute Gehorsamkeit gegenüber ihrer Rolle in der Gemeinschaft ist ein Hinweis auf marxistische Gedanken über das Proletariat, das fälschlicherweise davon überzeugt wird, seiner eigenen Überlegenheit über alles andere sicher zu sein, solange es konsumiert, gehorcht und mit den anderen in der Gemeinschaft Schritt hält.\n\n\n\n## [REWRITE]\nAldous Huxley criticizes the impending threat of both technology and the capitalist structure that reinforces it through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World.

    "raw_output": "## German Translation\n\nIch bin jetzt seit etwa zweieinhalb Jahren, oder vierhälbigen Semestern, Student an der University Park. Für viele, einschließlich mir selbst, kann es schwierig sein, sich auf dem Campus fortzubewegen. In meinem Freshman-Jahr wurde ich in einem Studentenwohnheim in East Halls untergebracht; ziemlich genau der östlichste Punkt des Campus, wenn man das Stadion und das Bryce Jordan Center nicht mitzählt. Die Reise von meinem Zuhause im Stuart Hall zu Vorlesungen in weit entfernt liegenden Gebäuden wie dem Willard-Gebäude, in der Nähe des Campuszentrums, konnte zu Fuß bis zu 25 Minuten dauern, besonders wenn das Wetter schlecht war, wie es in State College oft der Fall ist. Im Gespräch mit einem Absolventen, der nicht viel älter ist als ich, erfuhr ich, dass die Studentenwohnheime von East Halls vor nicht allzu langer Zeit durch riesige, unbebaute Flächen vom Rest der Schule getrennt waren. Heute ist dieser leere Platz mit Sportfeldern, riesigen neuen Gebäuden, einschließlich der neuen Molkerei und des neuen Gebäudes für Gesundheitsdienste, gefüllt und von Wohnungen umgeben. Da sich unser Campus weiter ausdehnt, wird es immer schwieriger, von einem Ort zum anderen zu gelangen. Was ist die beste Lösung für das Mobilitätsproblem? Auf einem College-Campus ist es das Fahrrad. Aber das Fahrrad allein löst keine Probleme. Studenten müssen sie benutzen, und der Campus muss so gebaut werden, dass er den Bedürfnissen von Radfahrern entspricht.\n\nIch sprach mit einem Freund, der kürzlich nach ein paar Jahren Pause wieder Fahrrad fährt. Er erzählte mir, er habe sich gefragt, warum er je aufgehört hatte. „Fahrräder sind großartig“, sagte er, „vor ein paar Jahren war es nicht cool, Fahrrad zu fahren, aber es ist der einzige Weg, um sich fortzubewegen.“ Neben der guten Wirkung auf den Körper ist Radfahren die effizienteste Art zu reisen. Eine Schüssel Haferflocken und ein wenig körperliche Anstrengung bringen dich 30 Meilen oder mehr weit. Wie viele andere Studenten lebe ich jetzt auch außerhalb des Campus; so weit vom Zentrum des Campus entfernt wie einige Wohnheime. Die klügste Entscheidung, die ich dieses Jahr getroffen habe, war, mir ein Fahrrad zu kaufen. Jeden Tag habe ich Unterricht im Thomas-Gebäude, das mindestens 25 Minuten zu Fuß von meinem Zuhause entfernt ist. Mit dem Fahrrad kann ich diese Zeit auf 5 Minuten verkürzen, wenn ich schnell genug fahre. Das einzige Problem ist, dass die Pollock Road der direkteste Weg zum Thomas-Gebäude von meinem Haus ist und es nicht immer ein einfacher Weg ist, mit oder ohne Fahrrad. Es gibt auch gute Gründe, zu Fuß zu gehen, aber persönlich bin ich zu beschäftigt, um zu Fuß zu gehen. Wenn ich kein Fahrrad hätte, wäre das Gehen meine einzige zuverlässige Option, um zum Unterricht zu gelangen. Täglich zum Thomas-Gebäude zu Fuß zu gehen, würde mir jeden Tag zusätzliche 30-40 Minuten kosten. Das sind über zweieinhalb Stunden jede Woche. Wenn man bedenkt, dass man auch zum und vom Unterricht, Terminen und so weiter zu Fuß gehen müsste, kommt man schnell auf eine Menge Zeit. Das ist mehr Zeit, als ich mir leisten kann.\n\n\n## English Translation\n\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years, or four and a half semesters.
