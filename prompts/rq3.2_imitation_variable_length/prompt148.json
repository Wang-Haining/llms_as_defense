Gimp boy Nevitt is actin as if e owns the park n challengin us to a match n shit, tosser. If we do play I'll skin im, snap im n slap im. But today, day off, luverlay. Got up, played Banjo Kazooie again, mazin game. Then went in2 the boro' village wiv Jay Ben n Thomas, nice bit of sayers confectionary 4 lunch. Walked bk, went in Ben's, few games of pool while the rain lashed down outside, beat him once, lol. Then sat off bk of the park, punishin jay 4 his comments about Tal. He took it well, props for that.  2nite, bit odd, walked down Bargain Booze n sum lad, maybe sanders, walked str8 at me 2 kick off, had 2 go on2 sum1s garden 2 avoid a smashin. Not fun. Then, bailed 2 jays n sat off, comical. Had ghetto experience smokin cigar. Sittin down on the floor, in an alley, wiv a cigar. Beast. And now, Im annoyed wiv gimp boy Nevitt. O well, 2moro's another day. Night.  LATER ADDED: I can't wait for this game 2moro, jay gna division 2 tackle nevitt. Bit arrogant but, I still feel on quite fine form, if not, on fire from trainin the other night. Just wanna embarass them all, n if they  try 2 snap, itll have 2 b an 'El Gerrardo' two footed tackle frm myself. Tune in 2moro to find out how it goes. Farewell                 Evenin y'all. Wat did i do 2day? Shite all. Well, that about covers the day. 'nite was rather more eventful. Went trainin wiv Beb Ath, and i threw my heart in2 it, and was playing well, but about 15-20 minutes in, disaster. Ian ran at me with the ball, i jockied 4 a bit b4 using an inch perfect tackle to take the ball off him. I then gallopped like a stallion down the left wing b4 being nudged in the bk 2 to throw me slightly off balance. When trying 2 regain my balance i moved my leg and recieved another nudge which then jarred my quad and fucking me up 4 the remainder of the session. From that moment on i was crap. Then, gt home, had a shower, sat down 4 a bit; then off out i went. I didnt know if lu actually did want me in hers so txt jay, he sed he cdnt b arsed but tom was out sumwer. So gave tom a rang, he sed he was talkin 2 lu n tal n dey wer bout 2 go in2 lu's, so i bailed there. Sat off in her kitchen with tal's niece and make chicken's with towels. Then tal bailed with the baby and me tom n lu sat in the kitchen 4 a while then went in the living room 2 watch big brother. That geordie bird's annoyin and i hate nadia lol. Nooow, im knackered, in pain, and thinking 'O my god! Lu's so fiiit!' Yeah well, later.                  Shite end to the day really. It's bin an OK/good day to be fair, but for sum reason iv jst got pissed off, no idea y. Woke up out 11:30 2day, larfin kidda. Got invited 2 go to London to meet tal 2moro as well, which is kinda random, but nice to be invited along. Then came out this afternoon n played bbit of cricket, which really became poor after a while, lack of effort from everyone due to fatigue. Then 2nite, went in jays n watched his season develop on Smackdown, mazin. He drove to the ring in a truck 2 av a battle with thingy, Kurt Angle. Mazin. Errr, then parked it n game of fooz, n proud of my first run. Picked up the ball, and drew 5 players towards me and jst ran thru them all. One lad, Chezza, gt bit annoyed wen he realised I was better than him n tried a 2 footed tackle on me, realisin wat he did chased bk 2 get the ball n he scissor tackled me; feelin my job wasnt quite done, i stayed on my feet n jst fell on his leg. He soon did one. Then came home, munched away lol, and now Im pissed off, Im nt sure if it was jst me or whether Lu did seem a bit off with me 2nite, i dunno. Well, better go get an ice lolly. Later fools                 Evenin, odd 2day n 2nite. 2day, gt up @ 11 mazin n jst played champ man 4 a bit, got bored of it so left it afta a while. 2nite, went out later than usual, n yesterdays bad feelin followed thru 2 2day. Ad couple games of red arse, good games, bit of bitchin like but no less than usual; just directed differently. Then as we left, cocks came out, nt literally, but heads frm beyond the Brookhurst boundaries n kicked off on chippy. Felt for him as i was in the same situation couple of months ago n itll haunt him 4 a while now. Went to Ste's to avoid the fightin, n gt picked up by his dad. Saten went on his role, he got out of the car, ad a go, the heads laid, n the best line being:  'Don't be a tit all of your lives'  I honestly thought he was gna hit them as he edged closer with the swear words poundin out like a good boom box n sum top hardcore choonz. Then came home n beat Mike at This Is Football 2004 with Rooney being superb. Then I came here. Had a chat with Lu n Tal, n dey both luvly, I had a compliment war with Lu about each others eyes, cos she has got gorgeous eyes. Anyway, I'm off, later.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
