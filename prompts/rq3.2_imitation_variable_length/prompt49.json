Yes, today I was chosen quite randomly to be interviewed. It seems to be a matter of stating the obvious ['so your good at maths and your taking economics... have you ever thought of being an accountant?']. Eventually I decided that I would make out that engineering would be the career for me so she wouldn't have to continue guessing jobs for me - the plan seemed to work as the interview was concluded fairly quickly after that.  4 Days until the end now; I had two random second or third years [they all look so alike] randomly scream in my face today. Perhaps it’s a hormone thing, I don't know but I remember not doing it to year 11s when I was a little second year. They should have more respect for their elders!

I worked a lot and that's been about it, I have secured about £110 for doing up my room and that's going to commence on Friday when my cold blue room turns to a dark red lair with  urlLink bats on the wall . I shall be envied!  Well I still have little time to write here, just a few notes; I am still off finding myself a girlfriend, it’s all too much hassle really at the moment and I am still addicted to the deadly concoction of concentrated fruit drinks warmed to lava-like temperatures. But in all the mayhem, I did have the following thought;  Squirrels. So the grey variety are rather detested but they do have a few trials in their life as I noted this morning that manufactures of bird feeders often make squirrel proof accessories, most commonly 'THE DOME'.  [see this link  urlLink http://www.duncraft.com/prodimg/1092_200.jpg ]  Anyway, little squirrel comes along, asses the situation - can't get at it from anyway than via the top so he climbs a tree, gets on the dome and thwump, he's fallen to the ground and he can't stand on it. Now we must think how they test them, they probably have a garden where they trial the new bird feeders, now think of the poor resident squirrel, each month or so a new feeder comes along, and each time he has no such luck, that squirrel is going to be getting mighty paranoid, he's probably scared of picking up little berries in fear that there is a grand piano suspended above it ready to be dropped on him. Maybe not. Well it looks like I am ranting which means something is bothering me deep down.  Ah well, another long post will arrive on Thursday and then every day after that if your good boys and girls.    \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
