I often think of my Mother. I know I cant do anything about her death , but I like to think that she is still with me every where I am. Maybe I am holding on to the feeling that she is still around, maybe I gota let go but I dont know what to do.  Everyday still even 8 months later I wake up expecting to see my mom downstairs fixing breakfast for me etc. I still set 4 placemats at dinner sometimes. I guess I just gota get use to it and let go from this feeling of loss. The problem is,I dont know how.   There are many serious and tragic events that has happend to me since November 5th 2002, my life could be a fucking movie with all  the real drama thats gone on in my life. Not that I am looking for excuses but sometimes you just hit a wall that keeps you from functioning normally for months, as I have been experiencing.   I dont want to depress anyone. Just needed to vent.                      Support our troops! Support John Kerry  --  This evening my grandfather blew up about getting his meal specially prepared for him. I know, its stupid. He thought thats not how meals should be served. Then when my grandmother said it was for him, he fucking exploded after he realized we were having something else.  I cant begin to describe the amount of yelling. I lost my voice cause I was yelling so much.     As my grandfather storms down stairs to listen to what I mumbled under my breath to him , i was expecting him to start yelling again, no, he just looked at me with the evil eye. He then went upstairs and grabbed one of the cars keys and leaves. He goes to eat at the Diner in Monroe alone. Goes to the ATM withdraws 500$ and comes home. I convince my grandfather not to go for the night ( where he would go I dont know ) and now he is yelling more.     Bottom line, he is bitching about a meal made for him that he likes but not for himself.     --     God give me strength because this is becoming all to common and frequent. I want to know what can I do to solve all the many problems my family has ( i know familys have problems w/e , but each is differnt , so for those who will say every family has fights , shove it ) to do to fox this.     There are days I want my mom back and days I dont. Sometimes I think she is 110% better off then us.     I just am at a road block.  I am going to a doctor monday for a screening of a lump on my side that has increased in size.     uggg .                       Support our troops!     Ok, well my computer is working well, 512 RAM, will upgrade.  Prom is tomorrow night. As people are partying I will be at my house playing some computer game or sleeping. As certain people decide to drive drunk , I will be safe in my own house. I may have a byast feeling of the prom , since the person I had orignally asked to go with me, did not want to go. That was a awful day. But now I feel the prom isnt as a big a deal.   Would it have been nice to go and have a good time ?, yes. By not going is it a life shattering thing? , no.   I know of 4 good friends who are not attending tomorrow night. I know of a few friends who are going with people they think they have a chance with and in reality dont. People go to this event for different reasons and attend with sometimes almost anyone just so they can say they had a date to the prom. I find this pathetic, even more so then by me not going to it.   I have realized that I wont be going , end of story. But is it? Is there something I will regret by not going?  I found that the person I currently like has a date and is attending prom. I am not to worryed. My X is up from VA . :)         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
