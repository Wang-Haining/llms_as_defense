( I can't believe I was the one who actually made him promise to wear a shirt.......hopefully he was too out of it to remember(that it was me..not to not wear a shirt)....oh and he owes Maya $3) eheehee.  I'm actually going to do some homework......seeing as someone *glares* made me not get home till like 11:30.....hehehe Oh on the drive home from Maya's we saw a HUGE snail......like we nearly ran over it and Im like thinking 'that looked like a snail' and Jez (bad, now blue, hair...) goes 'did you see the snail??' And yeah IT WAS A HUGE SNAIL I never knew they could get so big.....cool or what (that's been the favourite story of the day). Oh and Maya the Scarey hippy gypsies should be gone soon, I think they were there for the whole Venus-going-over-sun thing (or the Durumbal Venus dance party last weekend), so you won't have to scream and lock all the car doors!! (crap!!! you didn't lock the boot after you got Grizzley out....we could have been killed by the stick killing hippies!!!).  Stupid Danyel wasnt here today, and lonerised me with the fuckwits in Senior Science. Patrick and Brad (i think thats what they're called) are annoying the hell outta me- keep going 'HI BENITA' so next time I'm gonna be like 'OH..MY....GOD........there's a MASSIVE spider on your head Patrick' (cos thats the dude who I've heard is arachnaphobic (sp??!) Mwhhahahahahah Colli is sooo gay *cough*.....we have to go to Hastings Point on thursday to look at a bunch of rocks or something with the Bio class FUN FUN FUN......I'm soooo dropping it ;)                         Yeah that sign on book at school is soo cool.....I did the same on friday when I turned up halfway through english (period 2) - sure ive been at school since 8:40!  I have fire bridage training tomorrow morning and its so crap cos both Mya and Michelle aren't going (Mya soccer and Michelle the unco broke her leg so that means i won't have a buddy the entire time Mya is in Germany grrrr). I guess ill have to hang out with Luke whatshisface and the other retards *shiver*. Oh and I must not forget Beaver. ewwww *signs*.  Yeah Maya remind us to teach you the sign for 'well' me and Sim learnt it last night...its really cool.  I guess i *should* do some work seeing as I have done absolutely none since school went back (I live each week by going '2 more periods to stay awake for' then '2 more days to survive till weekend' then '7 more weeks till holidays' unfortunately I dont seem to get that its '5 more weeks till prelims' and like 1 more week till the first wave of assignments are due AND more scarily 9 MORE WEEKS TILL YEAR 12 AHHHHHHHH.  On the other hand its only about 4.5 months till Woodford!! ;)                       I Havent done much this weekend ..i went to the movies yesterday and saw Shrek 2 and it was sooo fucken funny, seriously u guys should see it..its so good. hah im gonna go see it again with joelle when she see's it cos its so funny. LOL, anyways thats pretty much all i have done. Malcolm got a new dog just like Ollie but its only 4 weeks old and it is so small, it has to be bottle fed, anyway when i went to Joelles yesterday and i was holding the new dog (which they called Cleo..) and it was moving around and i smelled something so i lifted up the dog and said to Joelle, something stinks and i was all confused n shit, then ....then ...IT PISSED ON ME. stupid little dog..i ran to the sink as fast as i could to wash it off and for then next hour Joelle couldnt stop laughing at me :@ bitch.. lol anyway im never holding that puppy again. well i probably will but the second that i see it do something strange or wriggle or something im giving it to someone else. stupid dog. heh anyway i better go and do something otherwise i would have wasted my whole weekend pretty much. check.                     okay well today was a pretty good day... had a free first period so i went to school for second and then signed on saying that i got there at 8:40am haha ya right... anyway  i shldnt have signed on coz we only had eng, phys and chem... eng i went to but for phys and chem me n momo went on the oval across from skool. It was very nice lying in the sun thinkin of other ppl sitting in a cold dark classroom mwahaha. I got some rash thing from the grass tho (it's alright it's gone now).  Joelle made up some optus transcript.. which was quite funny... she can add the questions  to the blog later.. well anyway this prank of ours allowed for joelle to ring ppl up (even ppl we didnt know), only if they had optus tho of course and make them go through a demented set of questions which was part of our survey... the catch was that they could win $10 worth of credit! ehehe. Renee Gallard was just one of the victims and she actually believed it (joelle went through every question) she even thought it necessary to lie about her name - calling herself Michelle. Most of the others caught on to what might b happening. :(   I also got to go around in a wheelchair at lunch and show off my 'wheelie'  whoop whoop. I brought the wheel chair back to Adam after that.. neways then in maths (which YES i did attend) i was punshed for being late but later i explained my reason (she apologized) but she continued my punishment of havin to sit next to Phoebe! with the excuse she was makin up for all the other times when she hadnt punished me!   4 more days of yr 11!! whoop whoop!! sooooo good... I think i will change my German exam from wed to like monday or tues.... coz then i wont come to skool on wednesday at all... the only class worth going to is maths AND that wld mean only 3 days left of yr 11!!!   I fixed up my room a tad too the other night.. got the stereo outta Oma's room and set that up with the speakers.. and got the speaker (top shelf) stereo system (middle) and my comp (bottom) so that my comp can easily just plug into the stereo.. anyway it kool (WELL I LIKE IT!) :@ :'(  rightio i off  later blog           \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
