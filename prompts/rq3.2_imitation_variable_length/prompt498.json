Thanks to that class, I can now type rapidly without looking at the keyboard.  My next course for next term is Drama with Mr. Van Camp.  I've heard that he's nice.  Hopefully he won't be mean.  Today in science, we disected cow's eyes.  Many people refused to do it.  Others were yelling and screaming.  I just sat there at the table, looking at the eye in the pan infront of me.  I casually picked up the blade and cut the eye in half as I was told to do.  Inside the eye, there was goo and this really nice floresent blue film on 'la r√©tine'.  I took out 'la lentille' and bounced it on the table (yes, it is bouncy).  After having fun with the eye, I threw it out and washed the pan.  I can't wait to disect something in grade 9!If you've ever disected something, you'll know what I mean.  Regarding 'The brick'.  I am pleased to announce that I have taken the brick off my back.  *Puts hand on heart and looks up at the clear sky*.  I've been waiting for that moment.  Kevan is comming over tomorrow for the first time in weeks.  Once again, Robin was suppose to join us but she is going to the yc (Please refer to last post). I guess I'll have to teach her about brace some other time.  Anywho, I'd best be going now.    Adieu.                 *Sigh*  Tomorrow is Monday, the start of another school week. I hope that this week goes by quickly.  I pretty much hung out with Kevan all weekend.  She came over on friday and I went over on saturday.   Friday- Kevan came over at 7:00.  We played donkey kong country 2 (We're almost done the game) and then we worked on the story.  After a little while, we decided to try to contact Robin at the yc.  We finally did after 30 minutes of phoning people to get the #.   When we finished our brief chat with Robin, we wrote more in the story and immitated triple yo-ers on msn.  Kevan and I played playmobil, ate a snack, played donkey kong once more and went to bed at 10:30.    Saturday- We woke up at 8:30 (so early..), ate breakfast and then  we left my house at 12:00 and walked over to Kevan's place.  I pointed out that we should do our ritual and go to mings to get gummies and chips.  After snacking on gummies, we heard  Kevans dad's Harley Davidson wheel into the driveway.  We immediately went down to greet him and his new bike.  Kevans dad then went out riding so we went into the house and snacked on our munchies while playing donkey kong.  After a while, we got tired of trying to beat the boss so we put on yo yo yo-er clothing and headed for the trampoline.  We must of played on the trampoline for quite some time because Kevans mom came home just as we were comming in.  We stayed inside for a little while and then headed back outside to play on the trampoline.   After the trampoline, we had dinner, watched this movie on tv called 'Susie Q' and decided to take a nap at 10:30pm and wake up at 11 to watch something on tv.   (We set kevan's alarm clock but we were in a deep sleep and we didn't hear it ring so we didn't watch it).      Sunday- We woke up at 8:30 (again!!),ate breakfast and played donkey kong.  Kevan's dad left to go riding again so we were home alone.  We cleaned up the downstairs and ate lunch.  After lunch, we went on the computer and then kevan watched tv while cleaning up the kitchen.  Meanwhile, I was cleaning Kevans room and organizing my things.  Kevan came into her room after cleaning the kitchen.  We sat on the bed bored.  I suggested that we read over the story until my mom comes to pick me up.  After that, we printed the story out and my mom came to take me home.        Once I got home, I took a shower, cleaned my room, made my birthday wish list (MY BIRTHDAY IS IN 30 DAYS!! WOOHOO!), ate dinner, watched half an hour of the oscars and now I'm writting in the blog to give you guys something to read.    I can't wait t'ill my birthday and t'ill my birthday party which I haven't quite planned out yet.  You're invited pals so feel free to tell me what you would like to do (see a movie, go swimming, go bowling ect.).  Anywho, I'd better get going now.  Enjoy the school week and write in your blogs!  I'm going to go sweep the floor, possibly eat yogurt and do 10 minutes of homework (It's the only homework I got!).  See ya later chums!!                 I've decided what I want to do.  Now I have to make the list of guests, call to make reservations and plan everything out.  I'm just hoping that everyone is alright with spending a little bit of $.  If not, they can always make up an excuse not to come.  Either way, my party will be fun.  I'm still thinking of who to invite.  I'll invite those who are nice to me within the next week.    I haven't got much to say besides that there was a drunken hobo on the bus today.  God it was creppy.  He got on near the dairy queen with a bag and cans of beer.  The bus driver got pissed off,  took the hobo's beer cans and told him he'd give them back when he will get off.  I was scared at first.  There was an intoxicated being yelling and scaring everyone away.  My fear then turned too laughter.  The hobo took out a harmonica (Vanessa's friend assumes that it was stolen from a little kid) and started signing and blowing in it like a stereotypical hobo.  I could not stop laughing.  A lesson has come out of this bus ride; Drunk people are fun to watch.                 As usual, yesterday was a blast.&nbsp; Vanessa dropped me off at Sam's mansion (yes, mansion) at 4:00.&nbsp; We really left the house at 3:30 but we made a few stops.&nbsp; The first stop was at the Ice cream parlour because I had promised to purchase Vanessa a     Mango   icecream cone for being my driver.&nbsp; After the ice cream stop, we drove down 56th and then phoned Sam to ask for directions.&nbsp; We got lost due to our old expired map.&nbsp; We eventually got to Sam's household.&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The stay at Sam's house was quite all right.&nbsp; I drank approximately 6 and a half glasses of water, went on the computer for a long time and listened to awsome music.&nbsp; Panago Pizza and Salad was served for dinner.&nbsp; I must say, It was really good until the salad dressing and cheese started to smell really bad.&nbsp; The Wedge came at Eight.&nbsp; 'Hard to explain' By  urlLink The Strokes  and 'D.U.I' By  urlLink HarMarSuperstar  were some highlights of the show.&nbsp; Hard to explain was great and D.U.I was just hilarious.&nbsp; It was really ironic because me and Sam were talking about The Strokes and Hard to explain and it came on.&nbsp; Another ironic moment is when D.U.I came on because Sam was telling me that she was thinking of requesting one of HarMar's songs.&nbsp; Yep... it was really great.&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm really happy that I got to see that episode twice!&nbsp; It's one of my&nbsp;favorite shows and I always look forward to new episodes.&nbsp; Well, that's all for now chums.&nbsp; Bye!&nbsp;&nbsp;   And remember kids.. 'Who's got the crack?'&nbsp; truly is a work of art.                     So I went to the mall today with Sam and Kelsey.  Kelsey came to my door to get me and we walked over to her dad's white car that was waiting for us in the driveway.  In the car sat Sam, Wade and Mr. Croft.  After a long car ride, we got dropped off on the side of a curb on a street near the London drugs in richmond.  We spent some time looking through the cd's and dvd's at the London drugs store and then we walked to the mall.   The trip to the mall was quite pleasent at first.  We looked through a couple of stores and went to the chinese bakery.  Then the worst happened.  Mr. Glass, who was sitting in a strange position on a near by bench, spotted us!  It was very unexpected and I was horrified.  Sam and I peaked around the wall of the bakery as Kelsey paid for some rolls.  Mr. Glass's eyes were focused on Sam and I.  Finally, after what seemed like forever, Kelsey finished paying and we walked out of Mr. Glass's sight.  After the awful moment, we browsed through a few stores, and walked over to the food court.  A small, chocolate,  Dairy Queen Milkshake was bought (and eaten) by Sam.  The last stop was HMV.  We spent a good forty five minutes there.  In the end, Sam bought a  Guided By Voices  Cd, Kelsey bought Two Dvd's and Cd's that were $101 in total and I bought  The Velvet Underground & Nico  (see the image above).   It turned out to be a great shopping trip.  Unfortunately, I didn't have enough money to buy something that I wanted so I'll have to return to the mall soon.  Hopefully I won't encounter Glass ever again.          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
