Although on the damned digital scale it still reads 77.2kg on the bathroom tile. I feel better about myself, about how things fit .. and I can see the curve of my waist vs my hips REALLY coming back.   So not sure what's up with the digi scale, maybe it uses a different calculation for kgs vs lbs? I doubt it. . I mean it must be progress since that old scale, in the same spot, used to read 175 a few weeks/months ago. And my sister, who's the yardstick because she has a constant weight always tests it out and it reads the same for her ... so .. okay I AM 165lbs!  I think it's good progress to see that I've gone from 175lbs to 165lbs pretty quickly (i think). Imagine how fast it'll all go if I start working out properly? So 155lbs here I come in about 2 months!    I've been eating great, although at night I get the munchies. Nowadays I reach from some wheat crackers, instead of chips or chocolates .. so that's good. I only give myself one chocolate item a day .. which is either a snack size Snickers bar or a choc pudding handi-pack. And I only eat one - two meals a day, no dinner .. not really. Maybe that's why I've been snacking late at night? I'll have to watch that.   Btw I haven't posted in my weight loss blog for quite awhile, but since the last post .. my lingerie arrived in the post about a week ago. And I look AMAZING in it! Even the one-size fits all one. I didn't think I could look that good honestly. I think all women should get some sexy lingerie .. just for themselves because it's so wonderful to know that you CAN be sexy no matter what your weight is.      Day two on being serious about losing weight (finally!). I've had a motivational burst because I've recently bought some new lingerie and want to look amazing in it. They're supposed to be one-size fits all but according to the measurements, I'm either at the higher end of it or I won't fit into it! So yes, I DO have to lose weight and at least get back to 155 which was where I was about 8 months ago, then we'll work it out as we go along.   My weight fluctuates between 77.1 to 77.5kg, but yesterday it was a little over 78kg after lunch. So about 170 - 173lbs. Way too much! I'm always like this .. I gain 15 - 20lbs in like nothing, then I go .. wow, where did it come from? It's so unimaginable sometimes.    My diet has improved. I read an article in Oxygen magazine, which has way too buff women .. but it is right the way they eat. They eat every couple of hours - 9 am, 12 pm, 3 pm, 6 pm, 9 pm. Small meals and snacks. I'm trying that .. and hopefully will stick to drinking protein shakes for my snacks. So far so good, they fill me up.   I'll focus on the diet first and then incorporate a little exercise. So far nothing actually .. wow, I haven't exercised in a while. I do some toning for my arms and legs once in awhile, but it's really not enough. I need to do more cardio and interval training, I see great results with that.      Day three and I ate a tad more .. 3 meals, not much snacking although there was choc in it (broke my promise again). I feel better about myself since I'm not snacking all the time on junk food or whatever. Although the meals today make me feel like a bad day, they are normal by everyone else's standards but I don't feel right eating 'so much'.   Lunch (4pm)  - rice (1 cup max) with sambal, 1/4 egg + choc milk  Tea (5 - 6pm)  - roti canai with kurma  Dinner (9 pm)  - pizza, 9' or 12' thin/homemade crust .. chicken & garlic (3 slices of varying size) - Coke (1 can)  Snacks (after 10pm)  - chocolates (4 cubes of Swedish choc) - Mentos (some) - Digestives biscuit (1)  The pizza thing at the end of the day was a little overboard .. 3 slices but at the very least they were NOT Pizza Hut sized. And the chocolates .. hmm ...   I weighed myself this morning and the old scale said 167 - 168lbs which is amazing. The digital scale says 77.1 - 77.2kg which is around there or 170lbs (depends whether it's 2.14 lbs or 2.2 lbs per 1 kg). I am so happy to be BELOW 170! Now my next mini goal is 160lbs by the end of May. It's quite a lot, but I think I can do it!      Hmm .. am still horribly overweight 168 - 172 lbs. And .. I have that vacation coming up where I have to be in a swimsuit .. because what else are you supposed to do at a seaside resort? No swimsuit yet but I am dreading shopping for it totally. I know I'm huge and plus size by any standard, and here .. pfft .. it's worse since the sizes run so small anyways. My hips are at the very least 40 - 41' which is HUGE .. and let's not mention my thighs or my waist or whatever. I mean no matter how proportionate I am, it doesn't matter .. I'm big. Look at how shopping for undies went .. I just couldn't find something that would fit me right and hopefully the stuff I got off eBay would work better (and cheaper too). So what chances would I have with a swimsuit? I want to swim and windsurf and kayak and parasail and all that fun stuff you do half naked (which I LOVE to do, am such a water baby) but .. I'll keep on thinking about my gross thighs exposed and stuff like that! Argh! I think I'd look amazing in one of those classic suits like 50s style, Marilyn Monroe style .. don't you think? :)   I was reading a magazine earlier today and there was these stats of how Australian women changed over the years - an Aussie mag. And of course, there was one about their weights and stats and such. So the 'average' Aussie woman is 68kg and has so & so centimetres for their waist or hips. But, I'm 10 kgs over average .. does that NOT tell me something? Also the US has this the average American woman is 5'4' and 145lbs. I'm like 20 lbs over that! Ouch! So ... is there ever proof that I'm overweight, then all that is it. I WAS average but now I'm not anymore.   But .. it's wonderful that I've heard of these girls who lose 50 lbs. and look AMAZING. One major case in point was this girl who lost 50 lbs. and in the end won the latest America's Next Top Model II. And you know I'm not past that point where I can't do anything about it or change it. The body is a wonderful thing and it CAN bounce back. So yup, will try to get down 50 lbs, as these people have done. A year will do for that, don't you think?       Woke up this morning, stepped on the scale and it was 169 - 170lbs and 78kg on digital scale. Yuck! I'm supposed to be at least 68kg (which is fat as well) .. and really should only be 45 - 55 kg! I can't imagine that. I have an extra one half of a whole person. I weigh more than a man, a man who's much taller than me.    At least it scared me into really moving my butt. I've been exercising pretty regularly and upping the duration and intensity for the past 3 days. So today I hit 45 minutes on the treadmill, did some crunches and very light arms, legs. And I did it in the morning! Which is such a miracle. The doing at least 10min per day thing works. In the end I don't only do 10 minutes, by the time I hit that mark .. I think it's more worth it to go to 15 .. then 20 .. then 25 .. then 30 .. and on & on! So yeah it's a good plan, tricking myself that way :)   Now, I have to watch what I eat. Honestly once you exercise, you rethink it before you put something in your mouth. You go .. I just worked my a** off on the treadmill for about an hour and if I eat this or this, it'll negate all that. At least that's how it is for me :) I need to make a habit of this.   Back to 155lbs within 2 months. I did it last year so should be a snap. Then .. 4 lbs each month, and voila .. by the end of 2004, you can have a new start with your new body.      And I so want a buff body. I keep on mentioning this but i am so sick (with myself) when I see people who can wear whatever they want and look soooooooo good. I want to be one of those women who can bounce quarters off my stomach & my butt, have thighs that don't touch, arms that don't jiggle. I don't think I should be satisfied with just being a healthy weight. At least once in my life, I'd like to unveil the smokin' body I know I have under all the fat.     Make that 175lbs. I am ACTUALLY 175lbs. How horrible!!!! I have a long(er) way to go.  I'm doing kinda good today. Did not eat excessively just yet. Will do my workout in the evening, not such a good thing .. compared to a.m. workouts, but it's better than nothing. I'll try to do 60min treadmill + 15min bike + 15min bike .. plus some easy toning for arms & abs.   I have my eye on a digital scale with bodyfat calculator. The price is a little steep $350, so I will have to forgo my DVDs next month. Sacrifice for my health/weight :) Should be cool to track my weight, bodyfat .. although I bet it'll be discouraging at the moment. The last time I measured my bodyfat I was 33% (at 150lbs.) .. and then 44% (at 160 - 180lbs) .. so now I could possibly be 50% bodyfat .. WOWZA!!! Although through the HealthCentral tool (which uses your height, weight and body measurements) my bodyfat is only 23%. I wish!   I was reading my old posts from a diet forum, from 1998 - 1999, and boy .. wish I could go back and kick myself in the head/ass. Because I was 140 - 147lbs, 38-27-38 and I thought I needed to get down to 125lbs!!! Stupid, stupid, stupid! But there were lots & lots of external/environmental factors then that contributed to that really distorted body image.  \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
