  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic:\n\n           Malachi on my mind.  'For from the rising of the sun even to its setting, My name will be great among the nations.  (Malachi 1:11).'  The imagery behind the rising and setting sun is so powerful and beautiful.  It only serves as a glimpse of God's true power and glory.  Amazing!   -----  'My covenant with him (Levi) was one of life and peace, and I gave them to him as an object of reverence; so he revered Me, and stood in awe of My name.  True instruction was in his mouth and unrighteousness was not found on his lips, he walked with Me in peace and uprightness, and he turned many back from iniquity.'  (Malachi 2:5-6)    Above reproach.  I admire the description of the Levite's faith so much.  Josh Chien used to train GMG (Godly Men's Group, high school) to be above reproach.  It had stuck with me since, but in many ways it contradicts a lot of the craziness in my life and in the previous blogs.  Being exposed to the harsh world is like playing 'hardball.'  It takes real heart preparation, and a strong walk with God.  When I'm not careful, it easily enflames a battle that rages within.  -----  'From the days of your fathers you have turned aside from My statues, and have not kept them.  Return to Me, and I will return to you.' (Malachi 3:7)  The last line blows me away, for His mercy is so great... and his arms are open to receive.                         Using scripture to steal...  I coworker shared about a family member using Paul's reference of performing good works to take his stuff, like clothes.  They looked back at the scripture about turning the other cheek and giving clothes to those in need to justify taking stuff from my coworkers house.  This was my letter to him later that day:  'Done with business, onto fellowship today.  I felt that your brother using scripture to take things from you stems not from the scripture itself, but your relationship with him.  Perhaps that is the heart of the matter, in the sense that there may be unresolved issues/ hurts/ bitterness from the past.  It's hard to imagine someone using a passage that clearly encourages love as a tool for greed and right out theft except if the scripture is not the issue on hand.  Or perhaps I'm speaking out of place, since I know nothing about your relationship with your brother except for the few words you said today.    Nevertheless, I feel that our witness and relationship with others can be so loving.  I know I'm young and idealistic (and naive), but I'd like people to look at me beyond a 'not bad' person and see Christ by our passion/ caring/ love for other brothers and for the lost.  For me, it's not enough for people to not see me as evil, that's just the tip of the iceberg.  The rest is showering them with love.  Most importantly, I write this letter as a word of encouragement because of your heart for your family.  They will be in my prayers as well.  It's a blessing for us to have fellowship like we do every once in a while.  Thank you for your questions and wisdom, my brother.  With you eternally, David An         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
