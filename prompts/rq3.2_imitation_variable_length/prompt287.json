I was supposed to take my buddy Chris's grill back to him cause i've had it since the fourth of July. So i blast down to the U-Haul to get a trailer and get the thing all hooked up and go inside to pay for it, and BLAMMO forgot my wallet a home.     So i go out and unhook the trailer, and drive all the way home, and all the way back to U-Haul, and get the trailer all hooked up for a second time. I go in to pay and she's like 'Ok i need a dollar deposit, and the trailer rental is 9.95. I go to whip out the credit card like a champ.....SHITE i left the fucking thing in my pants pocket from the trip home.     So...I unhook the trailer AGAIN, and by now the 90 degree heat is starting to get to me. I'm soaked to the bone from sweating cause did i mention...IT'S FUCKING 90 DEGREES HERE!!! I smell like the bottom of a garbage can that hasn't been emptied for three weeks, and i've got to drive my ass all the way home and back one more time!!! But oh no it doesn't end there.     I zip on home, grab the offending pair of pants, and chuck them into the car, while simultaniously looking at my watch realizing that the U-Haul closes in five minutes and it takes me ten to get out there. By now i was so pissed I thought ok i'll just give it a whirl and broke every traffic law trying to get back to U-Haul before they close. Well as was my luck last night i drove up just in time for them to be closing the gate on the rental yard.     I only tell this story because I crack myself up upon reflection of situations like this. All i can do is laugh. Owell, no one was harmed in the making of this memory so all is good. :-) Hope everyone has a good day and just remember to think before you spend all that enegry getting angry. It's so unrewarding :-P     Laters                      It's a wierd point of view for me to try to wrap my head around, that people out there don't believe in a 'Universal Truth' if you will.  I've spent a huge amount of in the past couple of years, reading and comparing notes, and accounts of the role of spirituality in the lives of 'The Greats', the people who were considered by history to be enlightened in some area.  As I move through this process, and analyze it from a myriad of different viewpoints, and sources, I begin to see patterns, and fundamental beliefs that begin to emerge.  These things emerge regardless of religious doctrine/dogma, social orientation, sexual orientation, and even period culture.  They just seem to be the things that are 'true' regardless.    I have gradually seen my attention shift from discovery, to implementation over the past few months.  How does this all apply to me, now, in my culture, in my social setting, etc.  How do the actions that I take in response to what I believe to be true look?  I don't know, but that's where I'm at right now, is trying to make sense of that.    I refuse to believe that who I am and what I believe in is dictated by the culture around me, and the circumstances I find myself in, and it seems odd to me that anyone would feel comfortable giving up power of their life to something as fickle as the group of people, and the society they find themselves a part of.  To recognize that society is constantly trying to influence you one way or another, and by default is not a revealer or spreader of truth, and in the same breath profess that society, culture, and circumstances are the things that make you who you are.  That just seems  crazy to me.    This all might not make much sense out of context but it stems from conversations i've had over the past several months about whether or not there is a common spiritual link in humanity, a core universal truth or belief structure that trancends time, and culture, and influences humanity.  Or is what I think and believe just a product of the times I live in, end of story.    Yeah, Yeah, I know, it's all really abstract, and sort of wishy washy.  Maybe It'll get boiled down to something concrete one day.  Maybe not.   Later,  Mule                      Ya ever get that feeling like you just can't relate to anyone. I have a fairly tight knit bunch of friends who love me despite what a gomer I am. These people understand that i'm a gomer, that I will probably say something stupid, or completly retarded at almost every encounter. They realize that I will probably trip on every concrete crack in the sidewalk, and spill red wine on my white shirt when eating.  The thing is that beneath all the gomerness, and occasional insensitivity, there's the real me trying to escape. I think certian people see that quicker, and with more depth than others, and they stick around long enough to get to know me. The thing that frustrates me more than anything about myself is that I don't care enough about looking cool, or saying exactly the right thing enough to have most people stick around. The fact that I don't have the time, and I flat out don't care to put effort into a little facade that draws people in long enough to open up makes me feel a little alienated most of the time.  I can't determine inside myself if intentionally putting that little mask together, and wearing it out and about a little, translates to hypocracy. It seems too much like those shitty little sales gimmiks that sales people use because they know the product they're selling is a total pile of dookie.  So they do every thing they can to get you to put your money in the mail and buy their product by spending all their time developing these little gimmicks. Thing is smart people, intelligent people, people of substance, see through the marketing gimmiks right away and consequently avoid being sucked in or spending any capital on the product or the salesman. I guess it all depends what my goal is, to meet and develop relationships with lots of people who aren't as engaged in improving their product, or wait out for the handful who choose to spend capital improving the product and not the ad campagin.  Now of course I know that one can't generalize like my example above does. And that peoples make up of marketing vs. product is not near as binary as I tried to illustrate above, or that one is even better than the other. But I believe a dichotemy exists to some degree, and that the side I find myself identifying with and pouring my energy into can get a bit lonely at times.  How this all translates to anyting concrete about how I go about my life in the next few months, i have no idea. But again like with most everything else I have written about in journals, or on this blog... the medium of text provides the ability to think things through and put them in a concrete form and process that you can look at and evaluate in a different way than just musing about it in you head.  Anyway enough of that for now, since no body likes me and everybody hates me I guess I'll go munch on some worms. ;-)  Nite,  Mule                      Well, i had an interesting night tonight.  Great dinner with the crew, planned on going home and got a call from Peto, and went out for a beer.  Anyway, it's midnight, and i'm ready to hit the sack.  All i got to say is who knew the mule had 'Game'.... I actually don't but that's what peto tells me.  Actually i owe a big thanks to him cause he's putting down a killer (i haven't heard it yet, but i know it will be killer) organ part on the song Jim and I have been working on.  Peto thinks It's about Ash Wart, but he's completly wrong.  Actually Jim came up with the idea of a dude talking about his DEAD observation of his murder by his wife.  It's really good, and i'm soo stoked about working with Jim.  Most of the time I think He's humoring me, cause he's really come up with the majority of the ideas for this song, but the lessons i've learned throughout the process are just awesoeme!!  Thanks to Jim, for the lessons, thanks to Andrea for not thinking I'm a complete loser.  Thanks to Steve, Peto, and Alisa for the beer, and we'll see you all real soon!    Laters,  Mule                     The only thing around is fog. Dense, dark, deafening fog. Its so thick that even the seagulls can't find the call of a mate from three feet away. It seems that times like these should be metaphor for something more substantial, but when the veil is lifted all there is left is perfect clarity. No room for ambiguity, no room for interpretation, just the truth. When the truth is revealed how can you argue with the process that got you there?  I'm not sure what it is that motivates us to do what we do but i think you get in trouble when you resist what it is your drawn to. Evil isn't manifested in the action, it's manifested in the repression. No one can spend a lifetime being something other than what they are 100% of the time. With that said who do you become when everything that you are changes and 100% of who you are is nothing that you want to become. Who's going to follow you down that road? Who will be there when you get back.  When standing at a fork in the road how much can one man spend by going down the same way, over and over again. How does he gather the courage to face the untaxed road he knows nothing about. You never know i guess but as long as you have fun walking who cares where you end up.  -anonymous-   So the beach trip was fun! I have amazing friends, who are incredibly funny, tollerant beyond measure, and good to the last drop. All but about 3 hours of the whole trip were absoutly perfect and i hope we can all do it again soon! Oh and just a mental note i need a new tent, sleeping bag, and pillow. Ha Ha Ha.....
