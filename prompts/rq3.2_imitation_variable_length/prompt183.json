Still downsizing.  Decisions on what to take are getting harder by the day.  Just 5 days left.  Charlie changed my oil.  He put synthetic oil in....so this should get me 10k before I have to change again.  About the same time I will have to probably change my tires if not before.  Learned how to check the air pressure in my tires.  We have written a seperation agreement and letter to family and friends that we will mail on the day we leave.  We think the people in town will be quite suprised by it all because they see us together everyday down town enjoying each others company and holding hands.  There is no doubt that we still have a great love & respect for each other.  Don't know why things happen the way they do.  But we have just vowed that we would part great friends.  Right now with all this planning and packing, Charlie is my greatest confidant.  I also confided in another close friend in town today.  She has done a great deal of traveling on her own in the past and could relate to my need to experience this solo trip.  She gave me much needed support that will prove helpful in the days ahead I'm sure.  WOW, just 5 days.  I'm sure it will fly.  Hope the items I'm waiting on to arrive in the mail get here soon.        \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
