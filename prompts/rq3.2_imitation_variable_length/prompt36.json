Had a few folks tromp thru the house...I have now come to the determination that realtors sell houses because they have no other real life or job skills, including being able to read.  But alas, it appears we shouldn't have to deal with them much longer.  The landlord claims she has sold the house (although she also admits to not having a written offer yet).  We have also been looking at other rentals.  It's just too soon for us to qualify for a purchase yet :(  Looks like we might go with one of the brand-new ones we looked at in January.  This would make me happy.  I loved that house.  And we'd save $200/month on rent.  That's a ton for us.    Not too much else going on though.  Other than showing the house, and the startling bomb of it selling suddenly, there really was not much happening.  Race at Topeka, which mostly sucked.  Did spend some time in the backyard shooting again (archery).  Enjoyed that.  A hobby is a lot more fun when you don't suck at it.                        So, here is part of the huge journal that I started writing a few months ago.  This is written to someone, someone that means a lot to me.  I am married...mostly happy...but I've had some feelings for this other person for many years...since the time I started dating my husband...so there is very much a feeling of 'what if'.  Enjoy....   You've been haunting me lately.  Realistically, I know I probably won't ever get to have you, at least any more than a fleeting moment.  So I have resolved not to think about it so much, to think about YOU so much.  And about the time I think I'm doing better, I start to dream about you, and a lot.  Last night it was the whole night.  I'm amazed at how well my subconscious remembers every detail of your face.  Last night's dream was so much like every time at the track - I stopped just long enough for you to acknowledge me, then I moved on.  But when you turned your head, it was like everything in that dream was real, you were so real.  I know I'm not crazy; I know enough about psychology to know that the dreams are my heart's way of not letting you go.  I try to forget you because I need to, not because I wish to.  And so by dreaming, part of me gets to hang onto you.  It hurts, and I'm very confused by why I still feel like this.  I almost feel like I left part of myself behind in Phoenix.  What I do know is that all things aside, you and I have unfinished business.  And it might take drastic measures to find out, but I'm willing to take that chance.  When I think of our 'play' time, I am constantly filled with regret.  But it is for what did not happen.  I think I missed something very special, and that eats at me daily.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Oh boy, do we have unfinished business.  Lately, I’ll be sitting on the couch watching TV and suddenly, during a commercial, I’m taken back to 18 months ago, standing in your office.  It’s a Wednesday afternoon, you’re leaving the next morning for a race and won’t be back until Monday afternoon.  We’ve managed to have a few moments when no one was around.  You sneak the door closed, making sure your dad is really gone.  You walk over and hug me, telling me that you wish I could go with you, even if just to keep you company.  How I would love to join you.  We could make such a team, such a talented man with a caring, supportive woman by his side.  But first you are running your hands along my waist, because I was kind enough to wear a short shirt today.  As you press your body against mine, kissing me gently, yet firmly, it makes my mind wonder with the possibilities.  You surely would make the most amazing lover.  All I ever wished for was that we had more time to explore the possibilities.  I will never forget our first kiss; the night the planets aligned and all was right with the world.  I have never wanted anyone like I want you.  It’s been almost 18 months since we spent any time together, yet sometimes it feels like last week.  I just can’t believe that whatever I’m feeling is still so strong.  It makes no sense to me…except that maybe I’m right, I missed something very important.  That also hurts, like nothing else.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  I see you online.  I want to say hi so badly, but I’m resisting the urge.  How am I ever going to let this go if I can’t stop talking to you?  I guess I’m just in one of those spots where the memory is too fresh again.  I know if I can get thru the next couple days, it will begin to fade and I’ll be alright.  Until then, I ache.  I hate it so much…I wish it could just be like you don’t exist.  I know you go thru life without thinking about me.  I envy you for that.  I wish I could stay as busy as you do…too caught up with my “real” life to worry about the fantasy, the “what might have been”.  I thought leaving Phoenix was going to help, because I wouldn’t be driving by you everyday.  Both it almost seems worst now, because I don’t have you so handy.  Before I could just stop by any time I felt like it.  But no more.                        Upon further thought regarding my excitement about leaving Phoenix, I rememebered that we left most of the utilities turned on because the house was still for sale when we left.  That explains why it felt like I was doing twice as much work this time around.    I have also discovered the possiblity that karma exists.  I look at it as 'do unto others...' as I was raised.  Well, I know it's totally true now, and thankfully, I'm on the happy end of it.  The buyer for the rental we are leaving did not get financing, and now the landlord has no buyer.  I try not to glory in other people's troubles, but talk about somebody asking for it.  Had she just kept her mouth shut, she wouldn't be in this problem.  Oh well, it's outta my hands, and I'll have her out of my hair in less than four weeks.  Early congrats to my sister, who graduates getting her Associates degree tomorrow.  She is the first of the three kids to get any degree.  After the summer, she'll be onto the university for her Forensic Sience degree.  Oh fun.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
