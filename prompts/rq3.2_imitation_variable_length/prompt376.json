  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic:\n\n       LOTR personality test:  You are most like  Aragorn (Strider) Son of Arathorn  Aragorn's decisions often seem against conventional wisdom, but he knows what to do and why it must be done, regardless of the cost. You are good at making contingency plans and come up wiith efficient means to acheive clear-cut ends. You are highly independent, and continue on with your plans even in the face of data that might suggest to others that it's no longer feasible. Time alone is important and solitary activities refresh you. You have a tendency to introspection. In your desire for clarity in life, you may have the tendency of being remote or even 'heartless'. You try to schedule your life as much as possible. You tend to finish your work before resting.   As the foil to Aragorn, Sauron clearly embodies the evil side of this personality.  Traits: Pragmatic, autonomous, ingenious, resolute. On the dark side you could desire power and       tion.  URL: http://www.hobbitlore.com/personality/index.php                Ever notice how being bi seems to be a fad? Take these descs as examples (I will still leave the desc owner's name known, mind you):  Taken from Mavix's desc: {14 . bi. holycrap}  As we can see this little portion of desc is quite ridiculous. She is 14 and already bi. This is very gross indeed, and seems more of a kind of stupid fad now. JOIN THE BANDWAGON! BECOME BI! This is just discusting. And what's up with the 'holycrap'? Also, you stole Ashait's colors, Mavix, so get rid of them, you wanker.  Note: Peeb is also bi. I have seen this many times in past descs.  Due to the fact that there weren't a whole lot of people on furc at this time, I will have to add to this ever growing list later.   More bi's: Sadina Anabell, Seamyst.  Also note that most of these people who are bi are retards. 'omgwtf' 'irabouttocry' and 'omgwhy' are just a few phrases these idiots have conjured up.  *If you are any of these people and are offended, too bad. It offends and sickens me that you're bi. Everywhere I click, BI, BI, BI. What is up with this? Ahh well, perhaps it means less children in the world, less disgusting,annoying children/people. Now all we need to do is have a d.eath penalty and less freaking houses.   Kudos to you bi's, in a way... :)              Your ideal Middle-Earth parents are Celeborn and Galadriel!  You live in the beautiful woods of Lothlorien.  You are an elf!  Your parents are very wise and will always be fair with you. They also give very good presents that seem cheesy until you realize that they are exactly what you need.  Your mother is as beautiful as the dawn, which means that you will be either handsome or beautiful yourself and your guy friends will want to hang out at your flet all the time to look at Galadriel.  Arwen, Elladan and Elrohir are your niece and nephews, and Elrond is your brother-in-law.  Your Middle-Earth mama is a psychic, which means that you can never, ever lie to her.  She is the disciplinarian and will do her best to see that you become a wise and noble elf.  Your Middle-Earth dad will try to be your best friend.  He is the one to ask when you want money for concert tickets or permission to go to a party.  Since he will really want to impress you with his hipness you shall be forced to listen to him butcher teenage jargon. Example: What up, homechild!  Thou art trippin in that tunic, yo?  Try to keep him from doing this in public.  Even with all that, Celeborn will spoil you, which you will enjoy, so live it up!  I hope you liked my quiz.  Please rate it, okay?    urlLink   Which Lord of the Rings couple would be your dream parents? Pictures and longish answers.     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla               Yes, I do feel extra crappy today. I feel as if it is humid or something, and even the smallest task makes me tired. As I was leaving the bathroom from taking a shower, I felt as if I was about to faint just going to hang my towl up. I have also felt more sad lately even though I already take some pills for it, and have been for a while now. I know perfectly well the reason for how I am feeling. I barely have any appetite anymore. I barely eat. I am hungry as I type this but we have nothing good as of now. I start to get more and more sad and wonder what there is to live for besides love..  Anyway, tomorrow morning (yes, morning) I go to the orthodontist or dentist or whatever and get my spacers. I am pondering on putting up a fight when time comes for me to go. For one thing, I'm going to have to wake up around 6 a.m, either that or stay up all night and then just take a shower when I need to, and another thing is that I never asked to get braces, nor do I want any. Either this or trying to reason with my mom to cancel the whole thing, which there is about a 1% chance she'll actually listen.    \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
