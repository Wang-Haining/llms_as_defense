Rock on, I was especially fitted and everything, because my physiotherapist told me if I dont run in proper shoes my knees will probably always feel as nastily as they did today when i run. Today I went for a short run and it felt quite like someone was crushing my knees in a vice grip. Horrific and almost made me cry! Today I went for a run, went to physio, drove to waterloo with my mom to return my rental flute, checked out singing reperatoire, drove back and went to the running works. j'adore these shoes! Its friday night and here i am, sitting around like a loner. where is everyone and why arent i with them? need a party desperately. else i'll be forced to like, clean my room or something exceedingly sadistic like that. good god, is this what summer is like? on the plus side, i feel like a tennis player or something in my running shoes because im wearing a short white skirt. Maybe i'm the next Anna Kournikova. Only Canadian, and less fit. Tennis players are hot. I want Andy (e)Roddick (lol heather alexa and i call him Andy Erotic) becuz he is so damn fine! sexy sexy. now i really need a party... lol. please people... call me!!!                 Et bonjour mes petits amis! I just got back from a runnnnnnn yay, now i feel good. much better now, because now i've done something productive with my day. also i was feeling creative after dinner, so I started a really funky collage about basically how i'm feeling right now, and basically representative of a lot of stuff that happened through the entire year.  its so weird how this year, so many things have changed. I'm still pretty focused on school and do the whole 'work ethic' thing, but I am doing less 'square' things than last year, hanging out more, enjoying life and caring less about school. its sort of weird... i dont know anyone else that has the same 'priorities' and stuff as me and gets 90s. i sometimes wonder how much longer i can keep up both sides of life you know? because i dunno, i dont really have anyone to... look up to I guess. it just feels weird. maybe i will just have to keep 'my summer life' so to speak apart from my school life. i honestly don't even know. life is weird. it happens. i'll think on it... but i won't change.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
