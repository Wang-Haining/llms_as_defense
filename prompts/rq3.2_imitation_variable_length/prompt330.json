Met up wif the hmct gang at cityhall. It's a pity Andrew, Thambi & Battalion How couldn't make it... Went over to Suntec to catch a movie.. 'The Village'. Before deciding on this movie, read various reviews abt it &amp; got mislead into thinking it's a horror movie. Ended up, I was 'horrify' after realising the 'Twist' in the show. The show was rather draggy & was actually quite bored... I do find the 'Monster' rather lame... But credits muz be given to the actors coz i think the acting was great... so overall i give 3/5... Watch only if there's nothing better to see...  After the show, went to Kenny Roger for dinner. Actually it's rather affordable, always thought it's quite exp to dine there... We ended up sitting there till the shop close... Chatting abt what's going on wif our new life, the current coy, the old francis era coy etc...  it's was really a great time & wonderful time!! Too bad no photo... maybe i'll bring a camera next time rd...              Yesterday was my clearance day.. Jus to update u guys some of the events during the process on dat particular day. It was a gloomy Thursday morning and unexpectantly, it began to rain the moment i left my hse to the infamous sembawang camp.&nbsp;Though the feeling of going back camp after 2 pure weeks of uninteruption&nbsp;is really bad, but no choice.. Clearance still must be done.  As i entered the office, i was greeted by hamdan, ang bingbing, and tay chow ching. I was quite delighted to see them actually (at least the first few pple i saw were not, uh hum.. u know who lah) But oh shit.. most of the pple are not ard. My mission for the day is to get the clearance done once and for all. But the situation seems unlikely.. To make matters worse, CSM entered. 'Everybody here annot?' Haha no lah.. He has a very surprised expression as if seeing a stranger. After pausing awhile.. 'Andrew, why must u leave us?' Haha i really dunno how to reply him but jus gave him a smile. He told me most of the pple are&nbsp;not ard n will be tough getting the clearance done. PC and OC were in east coast for AHM n won't be back till afternoon.  Then went over to hq office to zap my clearance forms. Suddenly, the door opened and Lim Y.Y appeared! He's the only one i felt indebted leaving him alone for the sake of my studies. Though there's a moment of silence between us.. He carried on his donation card calculations and i resumed filling in the forms. There was a sense of happiness within me, for i finally see someone so familiar. I broke the ice by asking him questions regarding the new elva's album he has recently bought and we began chatting. Then CSM came in again.. 'Haiya come back also dunno how to buy something.' Haha feeling embarrassed, i told him i'll buy the next time i come back to collect IC on sat.&nbsp;Only to know from him sat is a long wkend.. Haha too bad then.  RSM came to our coy to give our guys a lecture and it was quite quiet then (everyone's in the LT mah). The lecture ended and familiar faces came rumbling out.. Tan zw, chan jc, black baby, etc.. Then i had lunch at the canteen with lim yy, harkim, farquas, tang cw, and&nbsp;su gj. Though the food is still as bad, but the ambience of having all of us eating together is pretty not bad. Reminds me of the canteen breaks after our tasking hee.. After lunch, PC and OC were already back and I resumed my quest at the battalion HQ level. Wasted quite some time over there cos some big shots are either having lunch or meeting.. RSM is also no where to be seen.&nbsp; But after some waiting, all are done and i proceeded to S1 asking when to come back for my&nbsp;collection of IC. Only to know from the clerk dat unlike ord personnel, mine has to be collected at cmpb personally. Which means.. dat day is also my last day in sembawang camp (at least for the next 3 yrs lah). Hehe after bidding everyone goodbye, I walked out and&nbsp;took the bus with the words 'sembawang camp' behind me&nbsp;slowly diminishing..             Overslept today.... woke up at 0630, take a quick shower and reach camp at 0745. Whole day was sitting in the office still not doing much.. i refuses to do anything...except maybe for my beloved handing/taking over report. Was initially against the idea of doing juz a report, after all i'm juz a small fry, kind of stupid. But then again, i decided to do a extremely detail one which inculdes all my job-scope and a step by step idiots guide to doing my job.   Well..... went to chong pang wif sam & yuanjing this afternoon for lunch. Feel abit guilty coz i'm always critisting the&nbsp;those who always&nbsp;go out of camp to lunch. But hey... i'm going to ord.. so who cares... ord rulz...haahaa...  These few day, ariff is really aiming me to help out in the orientation of the new drivers. He send an email to everyone but me, saying he wants me in for orientation as he feels jeremy is really to take over and that he need the sect comd for LRI check. Much to my surprise, yuanjing shown me the mail & reply that he does not wants me to go for orientation and that I'm already clearing my offs/leave. Was rather happy he finally made a stand. First time he actually protected his own assistant. In the end, the small boy made the final decision that I'll will not go for orientation. Ariff doesn't seems to give up, bump into him at the loading this morning and he starts asking me abt details of my off and my actual ord date... I juz mumble something abt ording next month &amp; disappear...haa...  I really dunno what's wrong with my neck.. it's still soo stiff and i juz cannot bend my head. It really very disprutive to my daily life...&nbsp;I've changed my sleeping position and i even apply those muscle rub...nothing seems to work... arrgh...     \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
