I do not and never will understand why some people think that they cannot be themselves. Or when people think they have to be skanks/'cool'/the same as everyone else to fit in. The world would be such a happier and more interesting place if everyone started acting like themselves, dressing like themselves and not trying to be exactly like the model in that random magazine.  Why is it that people have that strange urge&nbsp;to be like everyone else? Well, people want to be accepted, they want to have friends.. no matter what they try to tell people. In an attempt to do this, some people go too far and give up even their own personalities in order to be 'happy'.  Ive been there. Its not a fun place to be. You hate yourself for not being who you are, and its like you live in constant fear of being found out. Its draining, frustrating and annoying, and I gave up, thanks to my laziness.. its been the best thing that could ever happen to me.  So the moral of this story? Well its just easier to be yourself in the long run. And its better too. So wipe the cum off your face, get off your knees, and wear something respectable. Thank you.  &nbsp;  Today I restrung my electric guitar. And played it.. its been a while. I havent used it since&nbsp;the band broke up.. I miss it. Not just the guitar but the band. Especially the band. I think we were supposed to jam sometime this week.. thatd be really nice. The biggest problem was that we started things too seriously. We didnt play for the music anymore.. we just played because.. why did we play? for gigs? just to say we were in a band?&nbsp;I dont know. Whatever the case was, it wasnt fun anymore. Maybe we've all grown up a little and can make it work this time.    &nbsp;  Somehow I doubt that.    &nbsp;  Can't wait until tomarrow morning..    &nbsp;   If you want to destroy my sweater,     I don't want to destroy your tank-top.     Hold this thread as I walk away.      Let's be friends and just walk away.     Watch me unravel, I'll soon be naked.      Hate to see you lyin' there in your Superman skivvies     Lying on the floor, lying on the floor     I've come undone                            WELCOME BACK LAUREN    Im so excited you get your very own post. Its great to have you back. Our walk was fun and I got a chocolate bar, which is always good. I ate so much crap today though, I need to run.. I walked home is that good enough? My mom yelled at me. She is 'disappointed' again.    &nbsp;  No work until Friday, when I work -what? A 4 hour shift? Swickedness. My feet hurt though.     &nbsp;  No one is on so Im trying to convince myself to go to bed... Go to bed. Hopefully it will be sunny tomarrow so that I can sit outside and do nothing and tan  all  day. I love summer.    &nbsp;  I wrote Kate a&nbsp;letter today. I was talking to her mom at work and she said it isnt too late to send one, and it reminded me that I should write one. So I did. Its pretty long too, and its basically me reminising [ach! I will never be able to spell that..] about our countless good times in ancient history. When both of us showed up that is.    &nbsp;   Listening To : Nirvana Unplugged in NY , the newest cd to my ever-growing collection.                         In a very blah-ish mood right now.. I miss behn but I dont want to be all whingey and 'I cant live without my boyfriend' stupid so I hope its not just that.. maybe I just need a day or two to be in a pissy mood. That and I think Im sleep deprived.. Anyway Im gonna stop complaining now.  Rant Of the Day: My favourite sex songs Has anyone ever noticed how much sex is in the music industry but its never EVER portrayed as a loving thing anymore? Its all about horniness. In my opinion, the 2 best songs about sex are In My Room by Incubus and Crash Into Me by Dave Matthews. I mean, Dave Matthews is one sick kid and the lyrics are kinda weird, but its a good song. And Incubus is just amazing. I dont think I even needed to say that but I did anyway.  Man Im totally out of it today, Im gonna quit while Im... ahead?   This party is old and uninviting, Participants all in black and white. You enter in full blown technicolor, Nothing is the same after tonight.  If the world were to fall apart, In a fiction-worthy wind, I wouldn't change a thing, Now that you're here.  Love is a verb here in my room. Yes love is a verb here in my room.  You enter and close the door behind you, Now show me the world as seen from the stars. If only the lights would dim a little, I'm wary of eyes upon my scars.  Pink tractor beam into your incision Head spinning as free as dervish's whirl. I came here expecting next to nothing, So thank you for being that kind of girl, That kind of girl                        I actually woke up early for work so I have a couple of minutes to post before I go.. Well lets see whats the line up for today.. working, then to band practice with lauren :D possibly hopefully something with behn, and then go to bed early because I am dead tired. 'and I look like shit without my makeup on... didnt I? you can say it, I looked like shit! Because I did..'  hahahha. I wont explain that one. Anyway so today will be the last day that I see behn for a week [and a day].. I know its not actually that long but we're really used to seeing each other, well, almost everyday. So itll be weird.. and Ill miss him, but its not that long right?.. right?   I wish Tyler was here to give me the old 'when I was going out with [insert random girl name here], we only saw each other twice a month because she went to a different school than I did, its only a week and youd better not get all mopey because I will come and kick your ASS.' talk. haha tyler I miss you, in a cousinly sort of way.  Well Behn if your reading this, if you ever get near to a computer when your gone, you can always come here to my blog and read about how much I miss you.. or Ill probably end up writing you sappy letters that start with 'Dearest Behn...'  ...Ill try not to though. Man Im weird.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
