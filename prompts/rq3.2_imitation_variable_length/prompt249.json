Oh well it wasn't really important and only about two people (maybe just eva) read this thing anyway.  I think I should discuss the title of my blog.  'Who do you think I am................ 'cause I'm not'  What this means is that a lot of people think they know me, but in all reality... Nobody has hung out with me or talked to me enough to know the real me. I don't even express my true self on this thing. So for all of you out there who think you have me all figured out you're wrong and I'm almost certain of this. I know of only two people who know the real me or at least understand the real me.  Bottom Line= I'm not as sweet and inocent of a guy as you all may think. Sure I'm a romantic, but there is an evil side to me too and lately I feel like it's trying to come out. I hate when people swear and I just hate the thought of swearing, but this is a special occasion.  My life is fucked up  Bye  \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
