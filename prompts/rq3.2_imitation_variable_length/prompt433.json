Me and some other girls had fun saying how bad we were and stuff---I guess you kind of have to know the whole story to understand--if you want to know--ask away! I had a talk with Z yesterday. Things aren't exactly FLY with us but at least he knows how I feel and vice versa. I just realized something. If Doug M. gets traded to the Red Sox there is a good chance that we may be facing him on Saturday or Sunday. Isn't that like CRAZY! See the deadline is three o' clock on Saturday. And the Twins have a three game series against the Boston Red Sox. So if he is traded THERE than we will be whooping his ass as of this weekend. That really tweaks my melon. Anywhos! This weekend I'm headed to Elk River for our state tournament. I'm staying with my grandparents, but leaving EARLY Saturday morning which makes me angered. I would say this should be an interesting tournament there are some problems flying around. So we will just see. Well that's all for now. Love ya guys--kiks                                   Haha don't ask about the name. I just thought that it was very catchy. lol. Tonight I had hockey and it went so well! My knee didn't hurt all that much only during the drill 'The Great One' lol, Kyle made it up. That just consists of a lot of tight turns. Also stopping on my left side hurts a bit. I think I did a very good job of taping my knee tonight too. I went to part of my brother's game and then I went in the car and taped it. Oh guess what everybody! Not that any of you care but it is Zanik and I's three month anniversary...yay...lol! TOo bad I haven't seen him for like three WEEKS! I didn't even get to talk to him today! So I'm kind of sad :(. Hmmm what else?......Tmorrow I am gonna go work on my summer confirmation at Deb's house. I'm almost done which is very good! All I need to do is a few more of those modules, write my I believe statement, go to a church that's not a Lutheran one, interview someone, and do a service project. But i have all of those planned out, cept my I believe statement. I've been riding bike a lot this summer and I think it's helping a lot because I don't think that my knee is swollen anymore. It looks different from my other knee, but that's expected because my knee cap got moved over. I think I'm gonna get moving here I don't have anything else to really say. Bye everyone--love yas---kiks                                      Hey everyone! The fair is FINALLY in town and it is MUCH fun! Today was the first day. My day consisted me of not doing much til about fivish when I had to go to church to interview an older member of the church. I ate there then walked over to the fair. When I was there I surprisingly saw lots of people I knew. I kinda floated between groups. Then I hung out with Zanik. We hung out in the cow barn a lot with Mindy and Cavit and some other people coming here and there. Oh funny moment. Okay there was like this huge ass mud spot, and guess who stepped in it wearing only flip flops! Yep, ME. Haha, it was funny though, I wasn't even embarrassed at all. But I went and sat under the bingo tent and water kept falling off the top so I got smart and put my feet under there and eventually all the mud got washed off. Eventually my feet dried too, haha. I am planning on spending all day at the fair tomorrow too. It gives me something to do I suppose and I enjoy it. I got to see horsies today, that made me happy. Also kittens, chicks (baby chickens, dur), baby goats, baby cow, ugh all SO cute! It got kinda icky at one point it looked like a storm was brewing, thankfully it didn't get us. PHEW..Kirsten doesn't like storms..let me tell ya...I had fun also embarrassing Jenna. That made me happy too, hehe. Well those are my adventures for today, I'll write later, love ya all! ---kiks                         I'm not a perfect person..there's many things I wish I didn't do...gosh I just LOVE that song! Sorry! tehe! Well anyways I will move on, I had hockey for the first time yesterday. It was nice to finally be back out on the ice...and actually not be the youngest one out there too! It really hurt about that last hour (my knee I mean), but I hope it didn't show! I'm not at my best, so I'm hoping that I'll only get better from here! I have a tournament this weekend in New Ulm..we have to play really early..ugh..although I won't be playing much the first game I'm guessing, that's understandable though. See I chose hockey over softball on Wednesday. I really needed to go to hockey though, cuz usually the first day is the easiest, and if i was totally unable to skate I wanted that day to find out. OH well, I don't think I missed much of a game anyway! Let's see, Zanik's coming over for a few hours tomorrow, we're like deprived of each other! *tear haha well I think I'm going to get going--much love--kiki                                 A few days ago there was a plan crash in Owatonna that smashed into a house. My surgeon, Doctor Gordon Welke, was in it. He was killed. Right now I am very very sad becuase my Godmother's husband has a brain tumor. So I feel unlucky right now. I mean Dr. Welke was just my surgeon, but it seems so unfair that someone who helps people and isn't that old at all has to die. I'm in kind of a depressed mood things aren't going wonderful for me right now. However I'll keep going on with my life! Yesterday at my softball game I pitched the whole game and we won 8-4! I pitched the WHOLE game that is so exciting for me. Because my knee didn't hurt at all! That ump had a bad strike zone. It bugged me for batting and pitching. Today I went to my Godmother's house and visited them for a while. It was nice. I just got back and I think I am going to go work out and ride bike. Well that's all I'm gonna say for now...much love---GOD BLESS GORDON WELKE AND HIS FAMILY--kiks                                  Hey everyone, I would've written a bit sooner, but my kitty, Blackjack had yet another seizure. It's scary that he has so many. This one he looked like he was sliding across ice and still trying to regain his balance. I at first thought he was trying to get away from my other cat, Max. My family and I are always cautioned when we are around it, we pet him and calm him down afterwards. I fear that even though he's like 11, he might be dying. I'm crying thinking about it, I mean he's MY cat and I don't wanth him to leave. Enough sadness.....Today I didn't really do anything. I could've gone to the fair of course, but I chose not to. I am like really tired and haven't been sleeping too well lately. I was also trying to get back at someone, lol as lame as it sounds, I'm just kinda mad at this person, and this person doesn't even know it. The Twins won today, they've won five in a row and are still only half a game in first! GEEZ! Well, as long as they keep winning, they can't lose their lead. Well I am gonna get going, love yas! Kirsten                                   Hey everyone! I just got back from a softball game we beat Austin by quite a few! I played first base the first game and the second game I played outfield...and you know what is ironic? When I was taken out the ball was FINALLY hit out into my neck of the woods...but NOOO I wasn't there. UGH! What a pain! Ben's party was postponed until Friday, but I'm excited!!! Only like ten or so more days of school left but like there's a few less for me because I'm missing next Friday, I'll explain later, and the second to last day before school because of Valleyfair! Today I confronted someone about their being a bit too nosey for my liking, and what did they do? They lied! I almost fell out of my chair laughing though. See what I think is ironic is the poeople that some people don't like (you know who you are) those people are the people that have been really close to me lately and really nice and honestly I consider those two and then a few more to be my best buds at this moment. In the library I sit by Zanik on those little couches and stuff you know and like Mr. Nelson always walks through the library and always wants me to move away from Zanik I just refuse. I know Nelson would never do anything to me. He wouldn't send me to the box and whatnot...Well I have to go take a shower, dry my hair, and all that jazz before Zanik calls love you all! ---Kiki               \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
