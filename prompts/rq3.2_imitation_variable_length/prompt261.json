One of them said, 'I'm the best    surgeon in Texas. A concert pianist lost 7 fingers in an accident, I    reattached them, and 8 months later he performed a private concert for    the Queen of England.'   One of the others said. 'That's nothing. A young man lost both arms and   legs in an automobile accident outside Houston, I reattached them, and 2 years  later he won a gold medal in field events in the Olympics.'   The third surgeon said, 'You guys are amateurs. Several years ago a  cowboy who was high on cocaine and alcohol rode a horse head-on   into a train traveling 80 miles an hour. All I had left to work with    was the horse's ass, a pile of horseshit and a cowboy hat.   Now he's president of the United States.'    and on the other side......   This test only has one question, but it's a very important one.  Please don't answer it without giving it some very serious thought.  By giving an honest answer you will be able to test where you stand morally.  The test features an unlikely, completely fictional situation, where you will have to make a decision one way or the other.   Remember that your answer needs to be honest, yet spontaneous.  Please read slowly and consider each line - this is important for the test to work accurately.   YOUR TEST: You're in Florida . . . In Miami, to be exact. There is great chaos going on around you, caused by a hurricane and severe floods.  . . .   There are huge masses of water all over you. . . . You are a Newsweek photographer and you are in the middle of this great disaster. The situation is nearly hopeless.   You're trying to shoot very impressive photos. There are houses and people floating around you, disappearing into the water. Nature is showing all its destroying power and is ripping everything away with it.   You see a man in the water; he is fighting for his life, trying not to be taken away by the masses of water and mud. You move closer. Somehow the man looks familiar.   Suddenly you know who it is - it's John Kerry! At the same time you notice that the raging waters are about to take him away, forever.  You have two options. You can save him... Or, you can take the best photo of your life.  So you can save the life of John Kerry, or you can shoot a Pulitzer Prize winning photo --- a unique photo displaying the death of one of the country's most 'powerful' men.   And so, here's the question... Please be honest...   Would you select color film, or rather go with the simplicity of classic black and white?     See..a little something for all of us.  I'm so not in everyone's league at this blog so, I'll resume the role as comic relief.  Like it or not I do have the right to post here.  giggle giggle.                        They're getting MUCH smarter.  Let me lay out this one for ya. The U.S. has basically conquered the world thru economics. We outspent the Russians until they went broke. Communisim didn't fail because it was a bad idea, it failed for the same reason the North won the civil war and the U.S. won WW one and two. The winner simply out produced the weapons and people it took to win. Economics.   SO now OPEC is raising oil prices which according to this mornings news on TV: every penny at the pump translates into one  BILLION dollars in lost spending on other stuff. Why would they do this?   To win economically. They KNOW we're gas whores. They KNOW we'll pay any price up to and including 3 bucks a gallon without changing our habits radically, it's been widely reported. So then what do you do in an election year when one of the guys who is running is prone to getting his gun off? You ruin the economy, raise the unemployment rate, and cause wide criticism of his policies which have led to the high prices. Because while we'll pay it, we complain each and every time the price goes up a penny.   They're learning. If we're gonna start taking over the countries that produce oil they have to, for their own survival, ruin us or fall prey to being our oil bitch.   What do ya think?                       Which brings me to the big ole flap over pictures of flag draped coffins being delivered to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware. As an interesting aside my brother used to be an Air Force Loadmaster, he unloaded these same kind of coffins. My position?   LOOK at the pictures. These people gave their lives for something they believe in. I think it's a really wrong war wrought by the worst misadministration in the history of the United States. But I've been in the military, I know what kind of people are coming back in the coffins.  IF the man that sends them to their deaths can be man enough to go meet them when they come home the very least the rest of us can do is to look at the pictures.   Look. Everything they have is GONE. Their families are paying for it every day and the asshole who sent them to their deaths ships the family a freakin flag, a dead sack of guts, and a final check. Then he counts himself done with the whole messy process and goes on to kill someone elses child.   The least we can do is SEE them. At least once.                        Laura just forwarded me an article about the torture going on in Iraq.  I've been meaning to comment on this but now I'm compelled. I'll quickly restate that I was in the military from 1978 to 1982. I was in the peacetime Air Force. I didn't have to kill anyone, but I did interact with tons of folks that did. I learned lots about how war works, how the military works, and how indoctrination, brainwashing, and intimidation are commonplace and acceptable methods of the top down management system employed by the folks trained to kill other folks before they can be killed themselves.  George Bush was AWOL during Vietnam. He joined the service in which he KNEW he wouldn't be called on to serve his country. It was the cowards way out of the conflict. Brave men and women went to Vietnam or fled to Canada, they did not pretend to serve.   But I digress. War is hell, you can ask anyone that's been in one. All the rules and regulations go out the window when the shooting starts. You don't train an innocent 18 year old to take the lives of their fellow humans and then get them to make the fine distinction of when to stop. You don't tell them they're fighting satan himself and then make them believe they should play nice with the devil when he appears to be under their control. You don't send people into real combat, who then watch their comrades die, and manage to convince them that they should treat the killers they've been fighting in a humane fashion simply because the murderous devils are now disarmed.   So the kids over in Iraq tortured, raped and maimed the Iraqis under their control.   AND YOU ARE SURPRISED? Can you smell the denial? I knew this would happen. It ALWAYS happens. It is war. In Vietnam they would take prisoners up in the helicopters and ask the first handy one a question. Before he had the chance to answer they'd pitch is ass out the door to die screaming as he hit the dirt. The next one to be interrogated would start answering the second he was picked out of the bunch. And there were things done that were much worse. But then if you stuck your head in the sand and pretended to serve your country then you could avoid seeing the real effects of putting the children of this nation in harms way for the good of Haliburton.  This is my point. Bush doesn't know SHIT about going to war. He's a modern American. He knows how to blow up the hardware with high tech weapons and lazer guided projectiles. What he doesn't know is what it costs. And I'm not talking about the dollars and cents he didn't provide in the first place. I'm talking about lost innocense. I'm talking about teaching children to kill. I'm talking about him sending my fellow countrymen and women to die for oil (because if you still think this war is about terrorism you're not only uninformed, you're just plain stupid). The man is EVIL.  You want to see evil? Take a look at the poser in the office of the president. He says shit like 'Bring 'em on' to terrorists and then sends them your children on a platter. He sends your children to die without flak vests, without supplies like proper food, and without thinking about the true costs of doing so. He hid out from war in the Guard and then sends them over for longer than ANYONE was forced to serve in Vietnam. Fucking Hypocrite. He's a fucking hypocrite. An evil fucking hypocrite.   They talk about reinstituting the draft? It'll never come from the rethuglicans. Because then the true cost of war comes home. It's no longer mostly poor people with no choices serving along side the occasional wealthy patriot. Now it's everyone, on every block that can die. Now, sticking a flag on your car isn't enough to be a patriot. It's cheap patriotism that is, no cost. Now, if there's a draft, you might actually have to die for what you beleive in.   Bring it on.                       So lately I've been comparing the impact the dominant religion in this country has on the fact that we're waging war on the soil of a foreign land. And an often repeated thought out in the world is that the fact that many of Iraqs folks are muslim is somehow what makes it OK.   It's always good to look in the mirror. Tends to keep the hypocracy to a dull roar.  Last time I checked that big bible book it said things like: Turn the other cheek; Love your neighbor; Judge not lest you be judged; Thou shalt not kill. Stuff like that. And from reading I've seen that sometimes, as the book says, god decides it's time for lots of folks to die. God decides.   Since when did God tell anyone to invade Iraq and bomb wedding parties? George Bush keeps invoking gods name all over the place. But I'm not thinking that spending your childrens inheritance on depleted uranium ammunition really qualifies as ecumenical training that would qualify him to be the mouthpiece of the all mighty.   Heck at least god knows the names of the folks that die. And actually knows the names regardless of their place in the kingdom. Nice thought that, that god knows your name. Shoot, George won't even go look at the bodies of the men and women he's sacrificed in his holy war for oil.  I'm just left wondering, 'Where's the outrage'? The guy trashes claims to be doing gods work by invading the muslim extremists lands, and no one calls him on it?  hurrumph.                       I've been invited to assist in Making a Point! I'm pretty excited about this! A place that is just about making a point and not about what I had for lunch today!  As Bill Maher says, it's an exciting time to live in. And I'm hoping that the Democrats manage to find their voice this election season. There is so much good to be done in the U.S. and since we've had the chimp for far too long it's time for someone that believes the U.S. should be on the world stage as a good partner and not the biggest bully on the block.   I'm right now so PUMPED that Salazar is running for the U.S. Senate for Colorado. I would love to see a crack in the republican armor of this far-too-conservative state. And I would love to see the deliberative body of the Senate back in the hands of the democrats. Hell, I'd like to see this country's representatives go back to believing in representative democracy based on majority rule with respect for minority rights and have us move away from representation of the most monied political contributors.   And I'd like to use less run on sentences.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
