Most would have ran for the hills screaming into the arms of some therapist or counselor by now. And for all the garbage I have put him threw I am sorry, profoundly sorry. I do find it easier to write than speak. I don't know why, but thoughts just flow better in more concise and clear manners when put in text instead of arbitrarily spat like tobacco, usually misread and harmful involuntarily. At any rate, there will be no way of truly telling him how I feel for him. My feelings are as strong as they can possibly be. I have never been able to fully trust someone the way I can with him. He makes me feel at ease as he talks about 'us' in the long term..which is stranger than fiction the way things are these days. It's one thing to know that sex isn't going to happen until we engage in a binding social contract and enter an institution, but to make me feel like it's the right thing to do, makes him special. When he lets me tell him all the insignificant goings-on of my day and takes the most genuine of interests makes him special. The way that every story I tell that makes me open up old wounds, he understands my tears makes him special. Putting up with me not seeing these things, makes him special. There are countless other reasons why I am lucky to have him in my life, but these are the ones that have been floating in the sky which is my head like hot air balloons traveling around the world. And for what it's worth.. I think that with Robert I can put my guard down and let him in... which is so difficult.     Why must try so hard to be hated? They may even be misunderstood. Perhaps they are trying to 'teach' the ever invaluable lesson, but will always come across as sheer malice and once this is felt, there is no going back. Either you have such contempt for me that you can not control yourself in a civil manner, or I am so stupid that by forcing me in a corner you think I can only be taught. Those are how I view things and I make no apologizes for it. It may change later in my life, like looking back you see why parents told you not to do something, and you may even thank them for it. But what about right now? Is it okay to make someone feel isolated and alone, even ashamed and stupid just for a lesson that only tomorrow may or may not bring? I am absolutely positive there are other ways of handling these situations, but who am I. All I can comment on is my feels as these things and other painful experiences shape and torment my psyche and soul.  There is no refuge from the devastating storm, Nor does there seem to be any relief in sight. Only the bombardment of pain on the soul of the lovelorn. One can see to the horizon, but who wants to look that far? The aching and suffering shall never seize in this heart. No oasis or sanctuary awaits this lonely weary traveler. No smoke from a friendly hearth to sit by. No food or drink to sustain life. All there is is the pitter-patter of the broken heart. To withdraw within seems a pleasant fate Until one learns of everything is hate. And every door is perpetually slammed in his face. These feelings and experiences can never be replaced. And if by chance one starts to smile, As good as gold, it will be defiled. For one lesson is as sure as sure can get. Your best bet is never to let yourself forget.  Bad to worse And low to lower, I sink farther and farther to thinner. To continue to live is to love to suffer. And if you think a great day shall come, Pray, tell me when your mansion was a slum? To such idiotic idealism I have become numb. When will the tears stop streaming? When will the end not fuel the beginning? Running away feels just so right. To day dream is the only way to lie awake for night. Both these ways I feel my wings take flight. Others take relish in your grievances of the present and future, Only in my dreams my life has true luster. So, I pray each night not to awaken me to quickly. And I have no ties to the world completely. \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
