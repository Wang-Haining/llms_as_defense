When someone who once was with someone and they decided a long time ago that being together would never work, then they move in together into an apartment, and they still say their just friends....then you say something like 'at least i dont have an alcoholic boyfriend' which i guess she just slipped and said, so i asked her if she and her friend are still just friends..................long pause...................... 'well when alcohol is involved alot of things you may not want to say are said' then she doesnt want to talk to me about what that means right now..................ARGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG.............why cant i just find someone who i can understand???? I always find the ones who are confusing to figure out and never give you a clear understanding of where you stand in a relationship. i dont think there's anything wrong with me at all!!!!! I've given her all the respect that i could possible give, i just dont understand what else i can do. Seriously..............some people just dont make any sense!!! Be honest with me cause thats how i am, i never lie to anyone about anything just let me know what is up and i'm fine, but say your doing one thing and then do another, i dont know what to say to that!   ...........very confused!                     this means alot right now...  There's a place off Ocean Avenue Where I used to sit and talk with you We were both 16 and it felt so right Sleeping all day, staying up all night Staying up all night  There's a place on the corner of Cherry Street We would walk on the beach in our bare feet We were both 18 and it felt so right Sleeping all day, staying up all night Staying up all night  If I could find you now things would get better We could leave this town and run forever Let your waves crash down on me and take me away  There's a piece of you that's here with me It's everywhere I go, it's everything I see When I sleep, I dream and it gets me by I can make believe that you're here tonight That you're here tonight  If I could find you now things would get better We could leave this town and run forever I know somewhere, somehow we'll be together Let your waves crash down on me and take me away  I remember the look in your eyes When I told you that this was goodbye You were begging me not tonight Not here, not now We're looking up at the same night sky And keep pretending the sun will not rise We'll be together for one more night Somewhere, somehow  If I could find you now things would get better We could leave this town and run forever I know somewhere, somehow we'll be together Let your waves crash down on me and take me away                     1.  The road represents your attitude towards falling in love.      You chose the short road--you fall in love quickly and easily.  2.  The number of red roses represents how much you give in a     relationship, while the number of white represents what you     expect in return.      You give 50% and expect 50% in return.  3.  This question represents your attitude towards handling     relationship problems.      You asked the family member to get your significant other--you     like to avoid problems and hope that they will solve themselves.  4.  The placement of the roses determines how much you like to see     your boy/girlfriend.      You want to place the roses on the bed--you like to see him/her     a lot.  5.  This represents your attitude towards his/her personality.      You prefer the person to be asleep--you love the person as the     way s/he is.  6.  The road to home tells how long you stay in love with someone.      You chose the longer road--you will tend to stay in love for     a long time.  That's all folks.  Best wishes to those who are in love.                     Well...since its been awhile since i've posted (from what i've been told) I'll give you a little something. I recieved my first check in the mail yesterday from work...$1120.00 ....very nice...i'll be getting around 900 or so i believe once i'm an actual 'employee' of ZenaComp. But before that happens i'll be getting another check around the same amount soon.    What's with the weather??? Had to go an buy a fleece jacket yesterday cause i had nothing that was semi-warm/fall jacket. So made a trip up to meijer again. Yes i saw michelle there, we talked on her break. Nothing else happened....she still is saying that she wants me to see her place, but somehow plans always fall through.  Ok...back to other more important stuff! I'm pissed! My bathroom sink still is not fixed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The maintence guy is supposedly coming out today to fix it, but originally wasnt going to come out till monday, asshole, fuckers, WHORES! It smells like shit, i dont even want to use it, let alone if someone was to visit and use the bathroom i dont want them even near it.   Assholes!                     Welllllllll...since everyone thinks i should do another post, i will.  Whats new? ummm not a whole lot. I finding out more and more that I'm getting older and wanting less and less to be involved in childish highschool arguments and discussions. I've been ready to just move on past adolesence and into adulthood for a long time, but some people in my life just feel that having drama and being an ass is always a good thing to be. You dont have to be right all the time! Well now thats off my chest maybe i can be more positive.   I went out and bought xbox yesterday.... been playin Simpson Hit and Run all day. its alot of fun. I want to get halo and some other games but i'll have to wait on that.  Its already a week into november....time is goin by pretty fast it seems. 2 weeks is thanksgiving, and i have no idea what i'm doing...i think i'm going to go to my grandparents house our maybe at my parents, dont really know.   I think this is pretty good for now. Havent really had a chance to post that much with working and stuff.....but this is for you who requested and you shall receive...umm yeah. later!                     I feel so tired right now....but its ok. Well lets see, the plan for tonight is to go and see michelle's apartment tonight, if that really happens, we'll just have to wait and see. I dont think i'm going to make a lunch tonight for work tomorrow, i'll go out and buy a lunch i guess. Its just that the traffic in Livonia (6, 7, 8 mile/haggerty) is really bad. My job is interviewing a new developer tomorrow morning. Hope he's cool like all the other people working right now, and not some asshole loser.  Well i finally made a design for the Masco site that my boss liked. Only took 4 designs. Its a pretty cool design, one of my best, but the others were pretty damn good too. My boss is just really picky. I actually though had to go to lunch early cause they didnt have anything else for me to do, untill i came back from lunch. Web Design can get boring after awhile, but when someone tells you that they like your design alot, it makes you more motivated.  I think i'm gonna add some interactive stuff on my blog...just have to go and find the stuff, dont know what i want to put up yet though....hmmmm...well that's all for now... peace!                     wow, i've havent felt so sick like this in awhile. coughing, nose running, sore throat. It sucks! Plus going to the club last night didnt make things any better, that was a dumb thing to do, since i didnt get home till 4 in the morning!!!!!!!! I'm not smart, not thinking. I had fun, kinda last night just wasnt really into dancing then my knee started to hurt which wasnt cool at all. I was supposed to hang out with michelle yesterday but that didnt happen, was a little dissapointed that we didnt get to see each other, but things happen and plans change, i'll probably talk to her tomorrow. I missed work this morning also cause i had no voice at all and to teach swim lessons on saturday mornings you need to have  a voice, well mine was cracking and i couldnt talk louder than a normal inside voice, so i couldnt make it in. So i went back to sleep and didnt wake up till 4, i'm feeling a little bit better now but thats only because of the medication. well thats all for now, there'll be plenty more for later.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
