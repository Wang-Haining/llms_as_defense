  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic:\n\n       Logically one would assume I'd be happy with the antics of the GMNC but through this entire ordeal (ok ordeal is a harsh word but it works in this context) there are a few truths about my family that I have learned:  1. Some members of my family are blind. 2. Most members of my family know nothing about me. 3. Marriage in our community means not just the union of two people, but of two villages of people. 3b. Villages have their share of idiots and the not-so-sane (not quite insane, but getting there). 4. Never judge a man by his parents - sometimes even parents screw up. 5. The Indian community has a lot of men suffering from  urlLink Oedipal complexes . (Ok not to the extreme degree, but we sure do have a lot of mama's boys). 6. The word 'homely' means something completely different in English than it does in Punjabi. 7. A personality is not necessary in order to get married.  Actually can sometimes be a hinderance. 8. If you're not a DLET or in computers, you need not apply, because in the brown world no other career is valid. 9. My parents can be quite intimidating. 10. I don't know how to play the part of the demure, coy, chai-carrier.                 Ok how is it possible that people leave the house and assume that they look good.&nbsp; I am no fashion-ista, but hell I know what looks good and what looks like sheer OMG crapola. I realize that ppl are entitled to wear whatever they like, but if there is a law against indecent exposure why cant there be one for exposing me to certain looks especially during lunch.&nbsp; The hurl factor was high today during my lovely lunch with my co-workers.   There are simple rules that people need to follow and based on today's lunchtime observations should be LAWS:  1. Denim: use sparingly, and with caution.&nbsp; If you attempt the denim on denim look please I beg of you DON'T or at least&nbsp;match (reference any hip hop video from the 80's and if ur look resembles that don't wear it outside) 2. Red lace shirts are just wrong. 3.&nbsp;Tie dye is ok on children and hippies, not on slightly bald, badly blonde dyed chubby men. 4. White shirts with coloured bras uhm ye no thank you.  There are many rules of thumb, but honestly please think about others as you step out into the world each morning - if your outfit scares your children, your neighbours or your dog, its a pretty good sign that you shouldn't be wearing it outside of the four walls that make up your home.                  Flax; wheatish; mocha; cafe au lait; cappucino; chocolate; chestnut - all colours our community uses to describe themselves.  Uhm ok, so I've been trying to figure out my shading for these profile thingy's.  So this is what I've figured out thus far: I'm fair, but most of me is pasty, except for my face which is just fair, hell it gets most of the sun and when its not bright red due to burns its a nice shade of pale almost transluscent flax?  See my dilemma.  What in the world does flax look like?  So I did some digging and some research and this what I found:   Wheatish  - refers to an almost yellowy brown (see wheat council  urlLink website ), light almost beigy tone  Flax  - is a messed up one, the flax flower is actually blue and white, which if that was what you were referring to as your colouring would imply that you look like a sailor, but then the again the flax seed (see the flax council of canada  urlLink website ) is a wee bit darker than the wheatish tone, but still has the yellow underpinnings, actually not a bad colour to be I guess??!!?!? mocha - a little richer in texture and in colour, more of a pink underpinning to it cafe au lait- lightest of the coffee colours closer to a beige but with a little bit more flavour sorry colouring cappucino- more frothy than the first two coffee based colour, and the medium rich tone of the three chocolate- uhm dark brown chestnut- reddish brown, the colour of a rich wood  then there are variations of all these tones, which I think is just silly.  We're brown, we're either fair, light, medium, medium-dark, dark, or uhm not brown anymore.  Have a wonderful day trying to figure out what range you fit in, if for some reason you're still not sure as to your exact tone, visit your local mac counter and a salesrep will help you out.  If you're a guy and feel strange talking to a cosmetics rep try your local Home Depot Paint expert, and ask them what Benjamin Moore colour your closest too.  If you haven't figured it out by now, I'm being sarcastic, I feel that whoever came up with this particular section on the profile page, is one hell of an SOB and needs to be spanked and I dont mean in a good way.  :)          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
