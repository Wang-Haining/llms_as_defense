Halloween is almost here! ::wriggles with joy:: I love Halloween!  So, I went to a urlLink  Silent Weekend  last weekend. ???, you ask? Silent weekend is a kind of immerse American Sign language camp. From Friday to Sunday, you do not talk. At all. Only signing. In your cabins, at meals, everything. It's fantastic. I always learn so much.  So anyway, I get up there, (having grabbed a few balls of wool and my knitting needles - never leave home without it, eh?) and realized I had no costume. I had exactly 1 day to come up with it, and I was 50 miles from a store, with no car, and couldn't talk.  What to do?  You guessed it. I whipped out the odd 'spice' colored yarn I had brought (kinda dull peach) to do a  urlLink Tangle  on Saturday night, and cast on ten stitches.  My goal? Somehow knit myself ears. Mouse ears....  So I knit along, increasing as I go, till I've got a bit of a crescent in my hand. I think to myself, 'gee, I wish I knew how to do short rows; this would be perfect for that! Oh well...'  Then I smack myself. Why not? I mean, I know the  theory  behind short rows. Even read the knitty.com article about wrapping stitches... why couldn't I?  So I tried it. And by gum, it worked! So I sat up Friday night, matching the one little cupped ear I had made, and then did a simple twisted cord (basically making a HUGE strand of yarn) for the tail. A black eyeliner penciled nose, and i was ready.   Ok, two more bits about this story. One: Everybody else had these great, elaborate costumes. One girl had made hers herself; a picture perfect Dorothy costume, complete with glittered shoes. Sewed the whole thing... And i was in grey pants, a grey shirt, and pink ears and tail...  The other thing is that there were these two Deaf kids there. I love kids. I love signing. I love signing to Deaf kids. See? So I had been teaching the girl to knit (she was fascinated by me knitting the ears), and playing with them both. I knit them little Kitty Nosewarmers. They used them for hats. I told them a story in ASL. We had fun....  Ok, so we're all standing up, waiting to be judged on the contest. I don't even want to be up there, as my 'costume' is pretty lame compared to the others... and out come the judges.  yup, the kids.  So they look us over, and I try to be 'rat-like' (in ASL, body language is very important) and the kids laugh at me. Good thing...  I won. I didn't mean to cheat! I didn't KNOW the kids would be the judges... Anyway, I won a free silent weekend... and all because I decided to try wrapped short rows!  Knitting: is there anything it can't do?  mouse                       I have seen the face of yarn god, and it is Velona Needleworks.  Ok, maybe not, but it's the best I've ever seen, down here in Southern Ca, where yarns stores seem to be few and far between.   urlLink Velona Needleworks ... my god, it's a saphic orgy of yarn.  My friend took me there because it was her birthday, and I told her she could go to any store and spend 40$. Of course she picked a yarn store!  So I walk in, and stop dead. The store is huge (compaired to the 'yarn closets' i'm used to), and packed to the ceiling with yarn. Every type of yarn i've ever heard of was there, in bags and shelves and boxed. From Lambs pride to trendstter, lace weight to super bulky. Cheap acrilic was there, shoved into a nook at the back. Eyelash, glitter, fur, railroad, flashing before my bedazzled eyes. Casmear and angora items beged to be touched. Every surface, vertical, horizontal, or diaganal, covered with kits and bags and patterns and yarn.  Oh so much yarn.  yarngasm, from both of us.  So we poke around for a little while, and next thing we know, one of the boy pops in and says we've been gone for an hour, the babies are crying, are we almost done?  An hour? It felt like moments... The alien abduction of fiber people can be done with yarn.  We touch, and talk, and ooo, and ahhh at everything. She can't decide what she wants, and i'm picking up things, putting them in my basket, and then returning them for something else I can't leave behind. We're drownding in choices... and loving it.  Eventualy we find ourselves at the counter, and she puts her little stack of yarn up there, and I find myself with only one (1) skein and 2 sets of needles. How the hell did I do that? the store isn't the cheapest, so we tried to get the most from our money.  Anyway, here's what I got. One skein of Trendsetter CIAO, a neeto ribbon-type yarn that looks like a little tiny knitted tube. I got it in the Brown/black Leopard colorway, and it's the softest thing I've ever felt. It's wonderful!  More later. I wanted to share my yarn love with yall.                           You are a  GRAMMAR GOD !   If your mission in life is not already to preserve the English tongue, it should be. Congratulations and thank you!    urlLink   How grammatically sound are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Hee hee. Take that, Red!  Hey there. Doing some neat stuff. Finally finished the pair of  urlLink Fuzzy Feet  for my little sister. I started the damn things back in November, meant to give them to her at Christmas... then it was pushed to her February birthday... and beyond. But I finished them. I did. Yey me.  Ok, they don't match because the second I did at a  urlLink Silent Weekend  and forgot the pattern. But she won't notice. Hell, she might not even ever wear them. But I feel good.  Hmmm, what else is going on? Oh, I'm doing a speech about felting in my speech class, and so have been felting balls for a few weeks. No, I'm not being dirty... After doing the first by hand, I decided to take the automated rout; handfuls of half felted wool plucked right out of the brown soak water, shoved into pantyhose and tied shut. I had a washer full of the weirdest looking wool sausages... Anyway, I'll have pictures when I'm done... I hope. I also dyed a bunch of old roving I had, so that people can customize their balls.   And we all know how much people like to have customizable balls.  On the dyeing front, I have an exciting opportunity.  This is a Sea Hare:    If agitated, they will produce 'ink'.    In my Marine Biology class, somebody brought in a Sea Hare... So, of course, when they offered to tickle it to show us the ink, I ran for a cup and, when they pulled the squirming gastropod from the water, I collected the violently purple liquid spewing from it. I have, in my fridge, two test tubes of Sea Hare Terror, bottled and labeled.  I'm going to try to dye some fiber with it. Now, I don't know what mordant I need, or if it will take, or if trying it is going to make my head explode. But I do know that with documentation, this undertaking, even if I fail, will count for  two  required papers; one for marine biology, and the other for my reenactment group. How do you think they got 'royal purple'? That's right, they did things like tickling big slugs and  urlLink pissing on lichien  and then dyed their clothing with it.  Ha.  Wish me luck; one source I found said it won't work. Maybe I'll just pee on it...         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
