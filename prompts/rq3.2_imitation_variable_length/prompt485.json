WOOHOO!  At last all that regurgitative bullshit is over.  8 weeks off, and then A-levels, where I can do only the subjects that I enjoy.  There will, unfortunately be some subjects that I miss.  There are 7 A-levels that I would like to do: Maths, Further Maths, French, Spanish, Latin, History and Physics.  I'm hoping to get 5 in there.  So there will be some subjects that I will be sorry to see the back of.  But there will be some subjects that I will not be.  Least missed subject?  English.  Hands down.  Shall I go on a rant about why we have to have not one, but two core English GCSEs, when the subject is full to the brim of bullshit anyway?  No, I shall resist, but suffice to say that I think English as a core subject is a waste of time and space, and I'd much rather have something like French as a core subject.  After all, being able to speak French is useful in life unless you're one of those xenophobic fuckwits who thinks that the only thing you need to do to get by in France is 'point and raise your voice'.  Well that might even be true, but businesses also have a much greater use for French than English Lit.  Irrelevant subjects is what annoy me.  Take chemistry.  It has potential to be a very useful subject, and I'm sure it is at higher levels, yet at GCSE they tell us how iron and steel are made.  Yes, because Britain is still a great industrial nation.  Keep telling yourselves that.  And the videos they show us at the end of term in chemistry... the biology and physics ones are scientifically fascinating, and might give someone keen on the subject some real ambition to continue it.  Not so with chemistry.  Physicists make rockets and go to space.  Biologists study the human genome.  Chemists grow long straggly beards and sit around in obsolete factories all day, looking at bits of steel and throwing potassium into the boilers in their lunch breaks (I'm not joking...)  I reckon you'd make more money out of the steel industy by learning Taiwanese than by learning chemistry.  And it would probably be more fun.  But anyway I'm ranting, and I said I wouldn't, so sorry about that.  And just in case you'd forgotten: EXAMS ARE OVER! YAY! WOOHOO!  My god I'm happy.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
