  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic:\n\n       i went to sleep early yesterday so i wouldnt get up late today. that was successful. i have yet to do much of anything. got the crack in my ghetto car's windshield fixed... hopefully. i did it the white trash way. this guy on the side of a long road in a motor home fixed it for $60. haha. yeehaw. now i have to go turn in my applications and call in to see if i work... i need to work dammit.  i talked to two of my VA boys earlier! that made my day so much better. i love them so much. aj's mom just called me back and thought she had missed a call from her brother in TX, that was sorta funny. she remembers me. sweet.  having talked to them, i got things sorted out and the culprit's name was revealed to me. RUMORS ARE BAD, AND THEY HURT PEOPLE. not just the people they're about either. but how shallow a person to spread a rumor about your 'best friend'. whatever. i dont have time for that crap anywho. people will grow up and get a life someday i reckon, if not, God help them.  July 4th is this weekend... i wonder what im going to end up doing...                 hah, i just got on an old screenname and read the profile... i used to be harshly depressed. which some may say i still am. but it was BAD. i sounded so pathetic. ::embarrassed::&nbsp; yucky.   tonight... i went to bucky's for a little. woohoo on that one. then i left around 9:30 and came home. that was a bummer. stupid michael wouldnt come to bmt to hang out with me. and he claims that he loves me! pshT. fucker. but then joel called me back and he got home early, so i went over there and chilled till 12:30. man i havent seen those guys in months. i miss them. paul is my sweetheart and joel is so talented it makes me want to cry. he's amazing. and now he's started playing piano, which is a weak spot of mine. its so beautiful. so now that we've finally gotten together, hopefully we'll do it more often. too bad school starts in 3 friggin weeks. something tragic needs to happen to postpone this traumatic experience, but only to where we still get out at the same time at the end of the year. haha. yeah right.   hopefully mason will have a better day tomorrow. my mom had to stay home from work today to take care of him. he still isnt eating, but he's not dehydrated. so thats good. he needs to get better quick, i cant take the squealing noise he makes when he's upset or wants something. (he does this because he tries not to speak because of his throat)&nbsp; its so unnerving. not to mention when piper throws in her high-pitched scream of death.&nbsp; wow.   i feel so unaccomplished, still. i do absolutely nothing with my life. nothing. im surprised i even have enough to write about on here. probably because it involves other people, not so much myself. i turned in my application at Carino's today. found out i missed getting hired. if only i woulda brought the appl. back within that week. dammit! oh well. hopefully i'll get a job there soon. i 'have a good chance' since i have no life and all i'll be doing is going to school until 1. lol. all i wanna do is work anyway. so thats alright.   a lot of things, which i really consider nothing, keep my mind occupied a lot of the day. i think about things that really dont hold much substance in the course of life. but seeing how thats all my life entails, its hard to think of other things. i dont think i made any sense there...   'i just want you to know who i am.'  - the Goo  (if you dont know who that  really  is... heh, wow.)            \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
