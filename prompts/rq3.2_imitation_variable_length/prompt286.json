I honestly can't be bothered to structure this, so I'll just list things randomly:   Had a really deep conversation with Ingrid, Alice & Amy about religion and politics  Lizzie got really shitty with me and kept making snide comments  I was nice to Ms Roberts  We had a fire  Jessie's group were robbed, and they stole Jessie, Annie and Becky's tent and a lot of their stuff  On the way there I sat with Lizzie on the bus  On the way back I sat next to Priscilla (but opposite Steph and Anna) and left Lizzie to sit by herself  When we slept in cabins I was with Ingrid and Alice etc. but Lizzie chose to stay with Vicki  Ms Roberts said I didn't need to convince her that I'd be good on the Marcian committee  I had to share a tent with Lizzie  Sarah Wills threw up on the way back and made me feel sick. I felt really sorry for Mrs Barden and Ms Roberts who had to clean it up  I was officially the worst hiker in my group  I was one of th worst skiiers  I am aching all over due to falling over many times and carrying an extremely heavy pack for 4 or so kilometres at a time  We were snowed on  I ruined a pair of my shoes  My sunglasses broke  Everything of mine stank when I got back  When we were driven back to Jungai after camping out, there were good songs on the radio: Cat's in the Cradle, Break My Stride, Sex and Candy, Sing Halleluia, (some crap song), Big Yellow Taxi ... I think there was another, but I can't remember it. Me, Penny and Anna led the singing. Lizzie just sat staring out the window - pissed off  I didn't sleep much  I read my book when I should have been sleeping  Someone snored  My hair looked really bad  My face was really dirty when I got home  The majority of things I said were comments about how stupid I am  I sang lots of songs  When we were skiing, Lisa told us to  slide , so I had the Goo Goo Dolls song stuck in my head  Our camp leader was Lisa, and she was good - she was nice to me even though I was slow and unfit  I realised how unfit I am  I don't care about Lizzie anymore  Lizzie kept complaining about everything, especially our group:  'Steph hates me...', 'Why were we stuck in this group?', 'Everyone always excludes us'  etc.  Lizzie failed to realise that this was the only group I would have been happy in (except possibly Ella's, except I don't know about that one because of Annaliese). Imagine if I had been stuck with Liv and Vicki - I probably wouldn't have gone on camp  I had too much food  I fed lots of people including teachers  I missed Fazz, and I haven't heard from him in over a week  Our pancakes were a failure - but scrambled pancakes taste better anyway...   * ^ * ^ * ^ * ^ *  I read through my old diaries today. They're actually really interesting to read. The thing is, I now want to let someone else read them to see what they think. Like Ella or Lizz or Del or even Ingrid. I dunno why ... I guess I just hate hate having to keep something inside me. I've gotta call Ella tomorrow - ask her about camp and stuff. I can't believe I haven't seen or spoken to her since Monday !!! I have lots of things to share with her.  :: :: :: :: :: :: ::     My Skiing song:  Slide - Goo Goo Dolls      Could you whisper in my ear The things you wanna feel I'll give you anything To feel it comin' Do you wake up on your own And wonder where you are You live with all your faults   Chorus: I wanna wake up where you are I won't say anything at all So why don't you slide Yeah we're gonna let it, slide   Don't you love the life you killed The priest is on the phone Your father hit the wall Your ma disowned you Don't suppose I'll ever know What it means to be a man Something I can't change I'll live around it   Chorus   And I'll do anything you ever Dreamed to be complete Little pieces of the nothing that fall May put your arms around me What you feel is what you are And what you are is beautiful May do you wanna get married Or run away   And I'll do anything you ever Dreamed to be complete Little pieces of the nothing that fall May put your arms around me What you feel is what you are And what you are is beautiful May do you wanna get married Or run away    (Thanks to  urlLink http://www.lovelyrics.com/artists/GOO%20GOO%20DOLLS%20lyrics/GOO%20GOO%20DOLLS%20SLIDE%20lyrics.php  - from which I directly copied the above lyrics).       \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
