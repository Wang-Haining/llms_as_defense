But after reading the transcript of his speech this morning,&nbsp; I can see what all the hubris was about. While reading it, goosebumps ran down my spine. He will amount to something great; something&nbsp;esteemed and reverant. Whether we see him as a running mate in the next few presidental elections or a powerful seasoned senator that consistantly champions for the rights of average American citzens. I look forward to his presence&nbsp;in&nbsp;American politics for a long time.    BOSTON&nbsp;â€”&nbsp;The following is a transcipt of a speech by   urlLink  Barack Obama    at the Democratic National Convention on Tuesday, July 27, 2004:     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'On behalf of the great state of Illinois, crossroads of a nation, land of Lincoln, let me express my deep gratitude for the privilege of addressing this convention. Tonight is a particular honor for me because, let's face it, my presence on this stage is pretty unlikely. My father was a foreign student, born and raised in a small village in Kenya. He grew up herding goats, went to school in a tin-roof shack. His father, my grandfather, was a cook, a domestic servant.     &nbsp;&nbsp; But my grandfather had larger dreams for his son. Through hard work and perseverance my father got a scholarship to study in a magical place; America which stood as a beacon of freedom and opportunity to so many who had come before. While studying here, my father met my mother. She was born in a town on the other side of the world, in Kansas. Her father worked on oil rigs and farms through most of the Depression. The day after Pearl Harbor he signed up for duty, joined Patton's army and marched across Europe. Back home, my grandmother raised their baby and went to work on a bomber assembly line. After the war, they studied on the GI Bill, bought a house through FHA, and moved west in search of opportunity.'     &nbsp;   I impore you to read the  urlLink rest .                           1)  P-Diddy biker gangs  I'm driving on the 101 yesterday nite, listening to death cab. while attempting to find the perfect pitch, a group of assholes in multi-colored leather outfits buzz by, scaring the shit outta me. These aren't your weekend riders who coast PCH on a sunday in search of the best bud light. Is it really necessary that you all must travel in a little pack like that? or that you guys all must rev your mufflers (or whatever it is that is responsible for that obnoxious noise) at the same time while passing non-intimidating green corollas? note to them: fucking slow down, before you kill me.  2)  my bad memory  Its like i have alzheimers, I can't remember shit. Yesterday, I was asked about my favorite roxy music album and I blanked. I've listened to this album almost every week for 6 years. I hit my head a few times, looked around the room and finally delivered the name of an album that was my second favorite. I lied about something so dear. I'm blaming, you for diminishing my integrity. note to memory: please don't fail me in those times of need, and you know what i'm talking about.  3)  the case of mild psoriasis on my elbow  you itch all the time thus bringing unwanted attention to yourself. after much staring by observant company, i have to explain that you are a non-contagious skin condition that causes skin cells to grow too quickly, resulting in thick, white, or red patches of skin. And  not  a staff infection i picked up using the bathroom at a dive bar in hollywood. note to you: go away,your freaking out my dates!  4)  dating  i'm not good at it. what happened to the times when a bunch of friends would go to the mall together on a saturday nite and the guy i liked would buy me gummy worms and hold my hand. No pressure, no effort. those were the days. note to dating: take some tips from adolescence.  5)  drew carey  i'm sick of seeing your fat, ugly face and hearing your terrible jokes. note to head haunchos who syndicate his crappy show: can it. get it off the air. remove all traces of it from existence. note to nasty models who fuck him: your disgusting, where's your self-respect.  6)  religious fanatics  i know, it might seem as if i'm lifting this from cross but i have to. you guys really believe all that nonsense about the garden of eden or seventy virgins in heaven? C'mon, we're adults here. we've got modern science now, we don't that shit anymore. i'm sick of seeing you on tv whispering detrimental, sweet nothings into the ear of our impressionable president. and picketing the helpless and vulnerable tourists(or sinners according to you)on hollywood blvd. and blowing people up. note to jihadists, right-wing christians, militant jewish settlers, and larouch supporters: retake your 5th grade science class (preferably in an urban area,away from middle america) and listen this time.  7)  urlLink Mickey Kaus   stop talking shit about john kerry. jesus, i though you were on our side. the fact that your still bitter months after the primaries because your guy didn't win, only reflects badly on you. alot of people read your blog and will be influenced by your negative rants. note to kaus: solidarity, look it up!   8)  the lakers winning the goddamn championships, again!  I'm fed up with the lakers, purple and gold, ghetto low-riders with flags and stickers obstructing my view of everything, and fair weather laker fans who leave games at the end of the 3rd quarter. note to detroit: please, please beat them.   9)   urlLink nicole 's disgruntled relationship with her cell phone  why have a cell phone if your never gonna pick it up or charge it?  either get rid of it or use it, stop teasing us. note to nicole: your outgoing cell phone message which was cute at first (music from zelda) has become extremely annoying and is now considered 9a on the list. please for the sake of my sanity, change it.  10)  my apathy   i'm surprised you didn't prevent me from finishing this list. also your getting me fat. note to you: Please go away and give me my desire to desire back                       If you care here's some info that clears the smoke concerning former Clinton national security advisor, Sandy Berger's and his&nbsp;removal of Archive documents&nbsp;regarding the Y2K terrorist threat.  (credit: Talking Points Memo.com)   A difference of opinion between Tucker Carlson and the 9/11 Commission ...   There is nothing random about the documents he took. Berger stripped the files of every single copy of a single memo which detailed the Clinton administration's response to the Y2K terror threat.   Tucker CarlsonCrossfire July 22nd 2004   Then there's 9/11 Commissioners Gorelick and Gorton ...   DOBBS: Let me ask you, not necessarily directly on point, but certainly related. Sandy Berger, the former head of the national security -- national security adviser under the Clinton administration, accused of, and admitting taking classified documents from the National Archives, those notes, whether copies or originals still unclear. Did the commission review that material, to what -- can you shed any light on what happened there? Slade Gorton, first.   GORTON: Well, we can't shed any light on exactly what happened there and on Sandy Berger's troubles with the Justice Department and the Archives. What we can say unequivocally is we had all of that information. We have every one of those documents. All of them have -- are infused in and are a part of our report.   DOBBS: So the commission was denied no information as a result of whatever Sandy Berger did or did not do at the National Archives?   GORTON: That's precisely correct.   GORELICK: And we have been so assured by the Justice Department.   Dobbs, Gorton &amp; GorelickLou Dobbs Tonight urlLink July 22nd 2004                                   This incredibly naive boy I met at a party this weekend seemed to think so. He was wearing a shirt that had stencils of Jimmy Carter (who I thought was Cheney at first), Ronald Reagan and George Bush behind bars, with the words ORIGINAL GANGSTERS above their heads. I saw the shirt from a distance and beckoned him over. You see, I'm trying to make shirts with political messages and finding excuses to talk to cute boys can be classified as research for my work. Anyways, He cautiously approaches as my friends and I are marveling at his great shirt. However, as he gets within a distance where my eyes can clearly decipher words and images (I have -6 eyesight in both eyes and wear scary coke bottles for glasses), I notice that it is not Dick Cheney's image as I thought earlier but rather the sweet smile of Jimmy Carter.  My friends looked at me and I at them with strange bewilderment. 'Jimmy Carter an original gangster', we thought. Jimmy Carter isn't a criminal nor is he comparable to those assholes beside him. I mean, he won the fucking Nobel Peace prize for his bold middle-east policy. I then asked the guy wearing the shirt, where he got it?, who made it?, etc. He replied that he assisted in creating and silk screening the shirt. Well you can guess what happened next. We grilled him HARD CORE. I began. 'Do you consider Jimmy Carter a criminal or a gangster? What about Nixon? Who actually was convicted of multiple felony counts after Watergate. How about those guys, dude?'  Needless to say the guy was dumbfounded. Three ladies ripping into him about his 'cool' shirt. He sadly retorted with, ' all presidents are criminals' and left with his tail between his legs.   Not Jimmy Carter, dude. That guy is awesome. Yea, he made some minor mistakes. Let's talk about them...  1) US covert operation in Afghanistan (1979): responsible for supporting/supplying/etc the Mujadeen (ie Taliban). According to testimonials at the time, the CIA sought to arm and support those who would undermine the Afghan governments of nor Mohammad Taraki and his successor, Hafizullah Amin.(by proxies of the Soviets)   2) Botched attempt to rescue the Iranian embassy hostages, thus setting the stage for his presidential defeat.    Political facts are dorky. I'll try something funnier tomorrow.                          Thanks for articulting this so eloquently and with such clarity. This has been one of those fragmented thoughts that float around in my head before I fall asleep. Since I am a victim, purpetrator,sufferer, etc of this phenomenon, I have decided to re-post it for those whom find themselves plagued by the same thing.  Authored by, Greg the Boyfriend  Tuesday, August 10, 2004    Too many friends have said the following to me:'I wish I had met her 5 years from now.' They all could see them marrying these girls, but they are scared of doing it all so young.I remember being 22 and totally in love with this kick ass girl. For the first time I was totally content.then one day she came over and she told me we had to break up.I asked her why.She said if she didn't then, she never would.  What the fuck is that?She said the thought of never having another first kiss, of never being able to act out on a crush...all of that, it depressed her.I understood.We spent the next year breaking up. We couldn't stop being with each other. It was painful and it sucks.I understood though. We both had many things that we wanted to do, and do separately, before we settled down with another person. Solo adventures, more experimentation, etc. etc. One would like to think you could do that with someone else if you two are close, but the truth is, is these days I think we all have lives we imagine on our own, and we see someone else joining us down the road.I think we both still fantasize that we will one day end up together, even though she had to move 3,000 miles away to move past our relationship.  I sometimes fear that she still haunts me to the level of never giving myself to another person. Sometimes we see each other on Holiday or something like that. Touching her arm can make me cum.But also, I think, that was it...we will never have that magic again.  timing is everything.Not only do you have to meet the right person, but you have to meet them at the right time.But we can't wait for a phantom, a ghost from the past. Yet we remain haunted and tainted.  Like cigarettes, what seems harmless in your youth can really fuck you up later.          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
