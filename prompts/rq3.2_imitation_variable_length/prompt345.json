I went back to Colorado this weekend for a wedding.  Dood, that place is wonderful, but I feel like the place is about 15 years behind the civil engineering learning curve.  The roads there are not near large or elaborate enough to accommodate all of the traffic.  I spent the last 4 days with veins popping out of my forehead, and terrible things coming out of my mouth.  NOBODY there drives with ANY urgency.  Cant tell you how many times I've pleaded with people to GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY WAY!!!!!!!!  It will be a while before I can endure such incompetence behind the wheel!   drunk...  When in Rome, do what the Romans do.  I was drunk from about 1 hour after landing until Monday morning....around 11:00 AM.  I suspect that this hang over will persist until i leave friday for a bachelor party in Chicago.  Anyone have a liver they can loan me?  Mine's almost out!!!   junk in the trunk...  My lil bro Kevin is the man.  This kid should be on the fucken bomb squad...that's all i can say about this line item.  He is the master of disarming disaster!   a bank robber...  In an effort to expand my ever growing army of tattoos, I had planned to get one while in Colorado from a place where my little brothers go to get theirs.  We scope the place out, and I'm all stoked to go on Saturday morning to get inked...until i read the paper!  The asshole who gives the great tattoos decided to rob the bank (the one in the parking lot next to the parlor) and gets caught because intelligence is not what hez good at.  This foolz girl friend works at the bank, and he robbed it by going to the drive up and asking for all the money.  Little did he know that they could see him, and since they all see each other every fucken day, he was recognized and caught.  The tattoo parlor seems to be closed, and needless to say, i didn't get my ink.  Lame.  So there it is kids...yet another epic adventure.  There are, of course, details that i could never give you because i'm under N.D.A. but believe me when I say this...it was one unforgettable trip.  All of this happened around the main event which was a wedding of 2 good friends of mine.....they went through with it.             On Dealing with Loss...  As i've mentioned, my Grandmother passed away yesterday.  Because this is the first 'close' death in the family, I really didn't have an established method of mourning.  I thought that the best way to honor my grandmother's life and death was to live yesterday to its maximum potential and to celibrate it!  Here is what I came up with:  Drove to San Francisco....saw the bay...saw the ocean.....saw the city scape...enjoyed my ability to see.  Went for a long walk...smelled the air....watched people hustle around...slowed down enough to enjoy everyday life and routine.  Went for a 8 mile run.....enjoyed my health ( and did it in a personal best time!).  Smoked a big 'J'.....enjoyed my ability to roll like a cuban.  Made a really fancy dinner......enjoyed my ability to cook and spoiled my senses.  Learned a couple of songs on the guitar....enjoyed my ability to be musical.  Hung out with close friends.....enjoyed others who are on this journey with me.  I feel that my grandma would have been happy with the way I spent my day because it was all about enjoying where you're at, when you're there.....you never know when it's gonna be time to move on!             On company xmas parties...  So I had my company xmas party last night....it was at the Agenda (place where the young and pretty people hang out...not me) which is this kinda night clubby thing....anyway....the people I work with have come to expect me to get into fine form at these types of events.....given that i have a people pleasing mentality.....i didn't let them down!  I arrived by taxi....with 4 other drunk ass foolz.  Our cabby was the coolest dood...too many people for the seat belts...we all had booze in us and with us and he let us have full control of the radio!!!!!  This man is truly a pirate after my own heart.  So the xmas party feels like it lasted about 5 minutes.........we get there.....and the next thing i know...all my co workers had bugged out and it was my drunk ass dancin on the empty dance floor (this happens often).  After the gig, I meet up with a few peeps at the my apartment...few bowls later, we decide that 12:00 on a school night is no time to quit....cause quittinz for pussies!  That said...we were off to my local watering hole.  We close the place down haven gotten even more drunk....by now....i could sell my piss as Jack Daniels.  I must of had a 'cute night' because one chick gave me her card (would never call her but it feelz good to be hit on for sure) and another chick had me back to her car for a biznowl with her brother (who i had to assure that I didn't want into his sister's pants....which is a true statement.......he was drunk n volitole).  By now its 2 am....i'm alll kinds of fucked up....walkn home....a buddy i'm hanging with tackles my ass....on my back.....both legs get folded under me...all you hear is a big crunch...both knees....fucked!  Of course....i lay an ass whooping....but i wasn't able to stand for a few minutes.....  So after some more bowlz and some madden.....its 3:30 on a thursday....and its time for bed.  I'm so sore today....kness so fucked up...feel like an old man.....head is spinning.....i'm sure my company's stock will go up today on account of my productivity alone!  ;o)      \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
