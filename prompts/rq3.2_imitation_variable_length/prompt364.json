After two years of misery, four months of not going for classes, moments of joy, moments of anger, moments of grief (!), moments of boredom and moments of sheer insanity, the “debate” part of my life is finally over. I may sound relieved, and in a way, I am, but when I consider the fact that had we won I would have been a mere sixteen minutes away from being part of a National-level champion team, disappointment sinks in. Anyways, I am not going to wallow in disappointment. Going back to class was amusing. The more rational-headed ones welcomed us back nicely, which was great. The brick-headed ones have yet to stop asking us what in the blue blazes made us lose, which is not so great. Whatever it is, “debate” definitely lives on (in my memory anyway)...   Quarantine  Quarantines were one of the more “colourful” aspects of debates, especially for us. Did we work? Well, to say we didn’t would be an understatement. But in the early stages of the competition, we would sneak food in and start playing around while in quarantine. Later on, it was more serious stuff, although I had the opportunity of having a go on a drum set that was in that Taiping school...   Identity Crisis  Well, that only applies for me. Till this very day, my Principal thinks my surname is Khaled, for some reason or the other. Every single time he’s called the team out during assembly, he’s called me that, and I’ve had to stifle torrents of laughter as I stand there thinking “who’s Khaled”. I think he’s been reading too many reports on those terrorists.   Wild Goats  Our journies to and from the debate venues have always been eventful. On the way home from Parit Buntar, a teammate of mine had something going on about wild goats. Must’ve been high on something. In Taiping, our teacher had the misfortune of confusing her left and her right…go figure!   Training  By far the best part of debates. Aww, c’mon, we needed to have some sort of distractions during training, didn’t we? And having access to a whole bunch of computers was really tempting anyway. Here’s to Unreal Tournament and World Cup 2002! Those were two great games...   The King And I  Thanks to the time-wasting training sessions during the hols, I have practically watched the entire school play – well, the unrefined version anyway.   Homework  I still have lots of these...no comments.   Tim, Andrew, Josh, Sheng Yuen  Four great guys who have been great teammates. Cheers to them!  (And J-X deserves it too, I guess, as he got us through the first round before he had to leave for good ol' Kay-El)                      I’m not very happy with myself at the moment. Failure to make the first batch of prefects to pass probation makes for a very lousy week. And unfortunately, that set the tone for my mood throughout the week, after a soothing break down south in Singapore. And look! It’s Thursday night. This confounded mood is probably going to carry on into the weekend. God! I think I’m going to sleep this entire weekend and save the trouble of feeling moody and sulky. Well, shit happens... I’m also pretty peeved that a certain senior prefect decided to run his mouth at me for being a statue while doing duty. He can ( this part has been censored to safeguard the “U” rating of this blog ). I’ve been threatened, intimidated, stared down and laughed at by students of that class and yet I have the guts to walk up to them and talk to them. And even if I am a statue, it’s as if he’s any better. All he does is stand at the back. Walk up. Walk down. Walk up. Walk down. You get the picture... And since my row has eight prefects on duty, which makes a ratio of one prefect for every ten students, I don’t understand why about five are always at the back. Am I missing something there? Is the view the better? Is the air there fresher? Blinking prefectorial board. And in other highlights, yours truly has managed to stay two periods of Biology without falling asleep!! A record has been set! If I can keep it up again tomorrow, it’ll be the longest continuous time awake for Biology lessons gone through by me. Anyways, Singapore is a nice country. Although I’ve supposedly been there loads of times ( the only thing I can remember is the airport for some reason or the other ), this definitely will change my mind a lil’ teeny bit about that country. (Note: Prior to this, I was always of the opinion of stationing a couple of tanks in Johor Bahru to invade them). Everything there is efficiently run, such as their MRT’s, and the system for everything works just fine ( except for their immigration checkpoint ). And everyone there is loaded! I mean, who has heard of 26 bucks for a bloody cup of coffee? Who else can boast of seeing a Rolls-Royce, Ferrari and ten Maserati’s parked in one row all in the space of three minutes? And I was just in a car park, not at a car show! Ahh, I feel much lighter now................   Norwich City 3 MPPJ 2. (Hmm…something’s not right with that score!!!)  Fusion16/2331hrs                     The handover is looming. This Monday, our seniors will cease to be prefects and our batch will take over the running of the board. I’m not entirely sure though if I’d like the board minus the seniors, some of whom are really cool guys and are people I respect. Of course, there are also some seniors who are not that great, but I have to say, Discipline Commission has the best, the most hip and the most 'happening' (to borrow a phrase from a friend) of all prefects. As I type this, I’ve just returned from a farewell outing. A brilliant farewell outing which, although beset by petty problems such as lack of food ( hehe !), could be considered an overall success, thanks to the stuff we did and the crap we talked. First of all, there was the “affirmation” time, where everyone could just say anything they liked about the commission. Naturally, I thanked my senior, who was also mentioned in almost every single prefect's affirmation speech. I personally feel glad I did get the senior I got, coz’ he was without a shadow of doubt the absolute, single most “lepak” prefect in the entire Form 5. He took everything with an easy attitude, and we talked about anything and everything ( even when there wasn’t really anything to talk about ). He also had hopes of me to be among those to pass the first batch. He also got me out of the “ragging” business after telling his buddies not to disturb me and covered my back over a whole lot of less than flattering things about me. Thanks again, Adrian. Owe you a lot. Disco will also be remembered for a personal reason. The first time I've ever managed to complete conversations with females in many, many, many years was during compilation meetings (yes, I am that pathetic). Of course, what outing would be complete without the traditional bombing of other commission outings? Why, none, of course. Our commission went over to a rival commission’s outing spot in a couple of cars right smack at 10.30pm and started chucking a whole lot of water balloons at them. Two minutes later, we realized they had a nice, powerful water pipe. At three minutes, the retaliations kept coming in fast and hard. At the fourth minute, we realized we were out of ammo (another thing caused by lack of organization) while the enemy was just beginning. At four and a half minutes, the entire Discipline Commission was effectively retreating. At five minutes, we were dying… More weapons were brought out. Eggs. Flours. At about ten minutes, half of all Disco members were busy being blur outside the war zone, while the other half were busy being hit by a whole lot of soapy water and flour. At fifteen minutes, the reinforcements from the Cleanliness Commission came in.  Disco  charged in again. After half-an-hour, war was over. Peace reigned once again (heheh!). I do not doubt that the various car drivers that passed the war zone, actually a house compound, thought a gangfight was in progress. I mean, it isn’t often you see a whole bunch of people gathering outside a house, busy chucking things in and out while running all over the neighbourhood, yelling and screaming. The end of a generation... We’ll never see the same seniors in our Commission again. It was fun while they were around and unfortunately, the future of Disco’s status as being the most “happening” commission around doesn’t look so bright. Well, no matter… anyone for a water balloon war? I like it...   -Discipline Commission 2004-           \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
