SO after I wrote my last blog I went to sleep and now im up. its 4:30…im tired as hell. Is hell tiring? probably not. Oh well. so my grandmas here, actually its my great-grandma, she doesn't like me ne more, cuz I don't do ne thing musical. I used to play piano, and clarinet, and I was in a musical. Now all I do is have drama class. But u see everything is competition here, and her other grandchild who is a year older then me WROTE a play, and that leaves me, second best, so I suck…according to her..hhahahahah..oh well..im over it… see over it. aw man..and now for the small talk..oh and she is talking about the better grandchild..oh mentioning theatrical shit. She is not really concerned with me or the fact that I stage managed a fuckin play..oh well not going to get angery…if she wasn't so little then it could possible be okay for me to STOPM her..JOKING JOKING!…ok ok..so im tired as. whatever is really tired..it's crappy weather..i can't wait till I get back to the K-DUB, and yes I do like to call it that. geeze..now I shall listen to the rambling of my great-grandmother Later Losers, but at this point it seems as though im the loser, hopefully tomorrow will be better. there will either be a rain storm or beautiful sunny weather. only 8 more sleeps!..oh god…plz save me I need my msn..i need to vent… to real ppl who can respond to me. Ok Later ppl im jealous of                  I hate summer..its really  boring...and ive been looking for a job (yay, note lack of entheusiam)  and thats nto been fun..i had an interview at bootlegger today (cross  my fingers) i mean other then the obvious, AMERICAN EAGLE i can handel  the colthes from there(bootlegger)..i think working at AE would be my  dream job..but they are all stuck up snotty bitches there..and that is  SOO NOT ME (im being serious) and if any of u bitches say other wise  i'll..umm kick ur ass, yaah, thats it..i whip out my KUNG-FU  hiiiiii-yah!....oh yes..im soo pro..actually i couldn't really kick ne  ones ass..im afraid..i might kill u with my lightning speed kicks..i  just can't controll my...uhh..ass kickageness..ah hahahha..yah thats  it..hahaha..so ne ways..i guess thats all that i have to say for  today..im going to see my new hosue tomorrow and im gonna beat my  family down untill i get the room i want....i can persuade them...im  literally a professional con-artist..yes i am that good..i could sell  fire in hell...     later losers     brit                    oh man...i thoguht of sumthing to wrtie here then once i signed in i forgot what i was going to write about. so then i sat at my computer for 13 mins. and tried to re-create what i was doing when i thgouth about what to write...i was reading my blog and crazy train was playing on my radio, and my msn was on but i wasn't talking o ne one, and that was it, rite so then i start hummming crazy train, and begin to read my blog. and then finally after 13 minutes i dicover that i was going to write about how i HATe the capital letter 'b'...andi realised this while reading my blog and i noticed that i signed 'brit' whit a capital 'b' in stead of a lower case 'b'...so then after the 13 mins. and then finally remembered that i was going wrtie about how i hate the upper case 'b' i also realised that, that would be really dumb to rite about. so now, am i writing about the fact that i hate it?..i don't think so, i think i'm writing more about the fact thiat i couldn't remember what i wanted to write about and how it took me 13! mins. to remember again. and why i sat at my comp for 13 mins. trying to remeber sumthing?...i have NO CLUE..while i supposed that it was to procrastinate from studying for my math exam..hey, im already going to summer school so why waste my time..i got my summer starting early!..oh yah...no..ne ways i'm done now. later losers, brit                 Ok so it is sat night…7:40\\and I juss took rick's (my moms b/f) dog for a walk in attempts to find civilization.

I may possibly draw a picture for u if u don't' understand…they were leaving..ok so then I got bit ON MY FUCKING NECK by a mosquito, mother fucker..so I keep licking my finger and putting spit on it..i know there's the 'x-thing' the 'scratch if until it bleeds' (that used to be my method)..and there's the 'don't scratch it' method…u have to have serious patients. I can't handle not scratching it… so I scratch then wipe spit on it..hahahaha…I mean come on its on my fucking neck!..geeze! So then I went to go home and the dog took of..then I saw three baby raccoons!…and they were alive!…then I got scared cuz I was afraid that the mama raccoon was gona come after me..so I wait until the babies crossed the road and went into the forest..then I ran…I told everyone that I ran cuz I was chasing after the dog, that's not true..i ran cuz I was afraid of the mama raccoon..they're CRAZY u would have run too!…ah hahahah so then I came home..and I think that I might eat a cookie..i found cookie, like oreos..but they're the cheap ones..and is a strawberry filling stuff…and there is POP ROCKS in them ohh yah baby..very exciting…it really really is!…I can't stress this enough how EXCITED I am. OK now I wanna try my cookie..i save a few ppl some..if they're not addictive…hehehe..they might end up being my addiction while im here.i hope not..i think im gonna keep walking in attempts to find civilization…MY AGE…16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23..ill stop at 23…but I mean if all I can find is sum one older then they will have to do..and guys…with cars, or, boats..are preferred ..but I mean., if all I can find are sum girls then I'll make friends to.
