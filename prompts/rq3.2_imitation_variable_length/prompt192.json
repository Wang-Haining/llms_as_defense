Overall Hodgkin's is a really treatable type of cancer, when caught early; in fact they figure that when caught early over 95% of patients will make it! But mine definitely wasn't caught early.  Without treatment, we know I had a 95% chance of being dead by next Christmas.  With the ABVD chemotherapy treatment that I'm on,  my odds are somewhere around 60 percent that I'll still be here 5 years from now!  There are other treatments out there - BEACOPP and Stanford V.  But the problem is, even though initial studies look promising on the other treatments (some claiming over 90% for advanced disease), they still have not been duplicated and the side effects themselves can kill you (for example, Acute Leukemia - which is not very treatable).  So I've opted for the tried and true ABVD.  So far it seems to be working.  After only one chemo appointment, my oncologist could only feel one small lymph node in my neck vs. multiple lymph nodes 2 weeks ago.  And I feel night and day better.  And based on my low white blood counts, it seems to be working too good.  Hate to see my blood counts if I was on stronger stuff.  Just hope I'm doing the right thing????   Comments anyone?                                   After reading the list of chemicals in the post below, you probably think I'm busy dying in bed, puking up a storm.  After all, the day after chemo is supposedly the worst day.  Actually, I just got done eating a great lunch complete with Ben and Jerry's Pistachio Ice Cream.  I feel phenomenal! I feel like I need to be doing something, like going for a walk.  I have no nausea and I don't even feel tired.  In fact, I FEEL GREAT.  I feel better than I've felt in a year.  As of yesterday, the doctor can feel NO lymph glands in my neck, and she can hear no fluid in my lungs.  Yes, the chemo is WORKING! (In fact, it's working TOO well, that's why the white blood counts were so low.)  Now for the big news.  Taking 3 chemo drugs that make you lose your hair, you would think I would lose my hair.  They said I would lose my hair for sure.  My mom bought me a phenomenal wig.  My friend Ginger sent me a great scarf.  The chemo nurses gave me two hats.  And my friend Anne knitted me three beautiful hats; wonderful hats; BEAUTIFUL hats packed with all the love that only a true friend can send.  Sigh...  Here's how my conversation with the doctor and chemo nurse went yesterday:  Me:  Well, I'm finally losing my hair!  See? (I pull on hair and produce several strands.)   Doctor and ChemoNurses (looking at each other):  That's not losing your hair.  What day are you on?   Me:  I don't know; Thursday will be 3 weeks.   Doctor and ChemoNurses:  You're not going to lose it then.  If it's not gone by Day 17, you don't lose it.   Me:  But you said I would lose it.    Doctor and ChemoNurses:  Well, you didn't.   Me:  What do I do with it; it looks terrible, I haven't cut it, waiting for it to fall out.   Doctor and ChemoNurses:  (Laughing)  It looks bad; go get it cut.   Dave says if I go get it cut, it will fall out for sure....sigh..                                  Now that I've calmed down, I remembered the doctor doing calculations on the tumor sizes and telling me it was MUCH better than the 1/3.  She then gave me the paper and told me I could calculate them for myself.  My friend Anne also brought up the same thing last night.  You see, the tumors are all down about 1/3 in width and 1/3 in length and 1/3 in depth.  As Anne explained, if you take a piece of paper and cut off 1/3 widthwise and then 1/3 lengthwise, you don't end up with 2/3 of the paper!  (And then you add depth in there too!)  So we went on the internet and found out how to measure volume; found it on a Middle School webpage :o) (plus Anne sent something similar).  So.....drum roll.....  So those nasty tumor beasts have had a volume drop between 39% and 67%!!!!   And the percent that's left is only 33% to 61%!!!!   Plus there's the thing about them being fuzzy right before they break up - the official word on the report is 'much less solid appearance appearing more as an area of infiltrate.'  Also, because my blood is FINALLY good this probably means the cancer is OUT of the bone marrow (which produces blood!)  On another note, I got in trouble at the chemo place.  I had met a new friend - 'Velma from Truchas'.  We were laughing and talking about our cancer and treatment and our kids and stuff like that.   Well, hurumpf, this grumpy old man threw down his magazine and said he couldn't stand our chatter.  Velma and I actually quit talking for a full hour out of respect for HIS cancer.  I finally had enough of that (I mean we have cancer too and we wanted to talk), so I told the nurse and she moved El Groucho over to the Grumpy Man Corner all by himself.  :o)  So Velma and I happily resumed talking, eating our cookies and crackers.  Her teenage grandkids even stopped into visit her on their way to see Ozzy Osborne in concert. :o)                                   I'm sure all cancer patients are scared to death to learn the results of their scans.  Hodgkin's patients really sweat.  Here's why:  Somewhere around 4 months, the chemo will quit working or maybe I should say 'the cancer becomes resistant'.  Chemo works best early on and eventually quits working.  Both doctors have been very concerned about the size of the tumor and the fact that the chemo may not get rid of it.  Both doctors said a stem cell transplant may be in my future.  To be in complete remission at 4 months, we figure over half of the big tumor must be gone in Tuesday's scan.  And it is a BIG tumor.  If it's not gone, my prognosis without a stem cell transplant is ZERO.  (The one exception is if there is just a small amount they may be able to use radiation which will buy some time.) 1/4 of Hodgkin's patients do NOT reach full remission at 4 months.  It's not unheard of.  And 1/3 of Hodgkin's patients relapse after reaching full remission.  Less anyone think a stem cell transplant is no big deal, know that you have high odds of dying during the 6 week hospital stay. You pack your bags, kiss your doggies good-bye, and hope you see them again.  And if you make it, your long-term odds are only 25% to 50%.  So, yeah, I'm sweating those results...                                 My new doctor is from the University of Nebraska.  She spoke very highly of it and told me that two of the top lymphoma experts in the country were there.  She said if I needed a stem cell (bone marrow) transplant that would be a great place to consider because they do 600 to 700 per year. And that I might want to go talk with them in a few months.  Now I knew the University of Nebraska was good; my sister did her residency there. But I didn't know how good.  I mean it's just a little place in the middle of a cornfield, right?  WRONG!  It turns out they did the first stem cell transplant there in 1983.  And that the doctor who was instrumental in the new classification of lymphomas (what I have) for the World Health Organization is also there.   They are written up in US News and World Report as one of the BEST hospitals for cancer.  They are one of the three busiest transplant centers in the US.  The link to them is      http://www.unmc.edu/international/pages/cancer_who_are_we.htm  Well, I guess we learn something new everyday, the University of Nebraska...not just for football anymore!                  \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
