'How could it be any good?', I'd think. If it was as good as it's authors seemed to think it was then surely they'd charge cold, hard cash for their efforts, and so I remained in blissful ignorance of probably the greatest piece of open source software out there, Blender. That was until a few months ago when I saw Blender featured in a magazine.    The power of this program is truly amazing, matched only by it's speed of development.   It just so happened I was on the lookout for a powerful 3D modelling and rendering package capable of creating professional images and animations. All the usual suspects had been researched and evaluated. TrueSpace, 3D Studio Max, Lightscape etc. All were horrendously expensive and difficult to use. As a Mechanical Design Engineer 3D modelling holds no fear for me, therefore it was really the scene creation, lighting, material setup and animation capabilities that were of interest.  I discovered that Blender had a growing following of 3D artists, mainly attracted by the zero cost but equally to the huge, friendly support community built around it. The power of this program is truly amazing, matched only by it's speed of development. Rarely a month goes by without a new update release with even more powerful features added. It does have a reputation for having, what is described as, an 'unusual user interface' but I must confess I have found it very easy to get used to. Admittedly, I do not use the modelling features but prefer to import from another package to Blender for scene setting and rendering. There are numerous blender scenes (.blend) available and tutorials to get you started (just do a google for Blender). The best source of information can be found on the  urlLink Elysiun Forums .  The home page for the entire project development can be found at the  urlLink Blender.org  site and the latest builds can be downloaded for a variety of operating systems at the  urlLink Blender3D.org  site. Give it a go. I fully intend to implement Blender as one of the key software packages for my 'soon' to be revealed Business venture.                       I mentioned a few posts ago that my boss had become hooked on financial spread betting and he was doing very well at it. At one point he was up by over 1000 quid all in a matter of 4 days. Then came the inevitable losing streak which has reduced his winnings to 250 quid. He is now re-evaluating his strategy.  Being much more cautious myself I have been playing with a few fantasy bets to help me understand how the whole thing works and to formulate a consistent trading plan to hopefully allow success. I am concentrating on Binary Bets of the hourly FTSE and Dow indices. In a binary bet you buy and sell an index to fall or rise in an hour period. So if you bought the FTSE 100 to rise at 45 points, and by the end of the hour it did rise above it's hourly starting point the binary bet would pay out at 100. That would mean a profit of 100-45*5(your stake per point)=220 quid. Seems quite simple and looking at the intra day graphs for the FTSE and Dow I have identified a strategy which should allow me to win 10 points at least on average 3 times a day. If I bet 5 quid a point I could make 150 quid tax free a day while keeping a limit on my risk of losing the original stake.  I've registered with  urlLink IG Index  as my dealer of choice if you want to learn more.                      Regular readers of this rubbish may remember  urlLink this post  in which I proposed the theory that women couldn't think laterally when the prospect of buying shiny new kitchen appliances was in the mix. I  may  have been wrong.  As I sit here through a fog of choking black smoke I have to report that the microwave in question exploded in flames this evening at approximately 7:30PM. I suspect the fault that Lesley mentioned in passing may have had something to do with this little incident or the fact that I put a tasty Tesco Premium Sticky Toffee Pudding at full blast for 10 minutes (the other numbers on the keypad fixed themselves a while back) and walked off. Lying on the sofa, gob salivating as the smell of perfectly melted toffee filled the air a tiny little thought filled my head...was that burning I could smell?  I can't continue, I'm too overcome... Lesley is already eyeing the Argos catalogue again, I'll have to go and lie down for a bit. In the meantime please entertain yourselves by visiting  urlLink We-Man!s Funny things to do with a microwave  page. Hey, let's be careful out there and pay more attention to your woman when she's waving the Argos catalogue under your nose.                      Nick Mason, that's him on the left of a very rare 5 man Floyd picture circa 1968, erstwhile drummer of the long dead band will release his memoirs  urlLink 'Inside Out - A Personal History of Pink Floyd'  in September. I love this picture not just because of the rarity of showing Dave Gilmour and Syd Barrett at the same time but the poetry of it. Syd gazing to the stars, having already begun to lose his battle with drugs and descending into a schizophrenic wreck, Roger looking in a completely different direction and Nick, Dave and Rick staring straight at the camera. Sums up exactly what would happen to the band in later decades.  Rumours of Nick's scribblings have been circulating for years but suspicion fell on fat d*ve as the main sticking point to it's publication. Allegedly he was unhappy that the book would be of Nick's opinion only (fat d*ve was never the brightest plectrum in the guitar case).  I don't like fat d*ve! Fat d*ve for those who don't know was the Floyd's one time guitarist. After Roger decided to leave the band in 1986, fat d*ve, with one eye on his pension, decided to keep the band going. What followed were 2 horrendously bad studio albums, 2 embarrassingly successful world tours and 2 stinking live albums. Roger Waters was, is and for ever will be Pink Floyd, and he was displeased.  So why, for me, is Roger Waters the man? Well, setting aside the fact that he wrote all the bands greatest albums, designed the stage shows, influenced the LP artwork etc he is well known for being a complete bastard to work with and a grumpy old git to boot, QED, he is, therefore, my God.  Expectations are high for a thoroughly cracking read as witnessed from the drum stool of every Pink Floyd gig ever (the only ever present member of the band in a history spanning 40 years). Spinal Tap will, I suspect, have nothing on the true goings on from the murky depths of London in 1965, through the dawn of Pyschedelia to the emergence of one of Rock's greatest song writers. I smell early Christmas present.                     I was finally diagnosed in March 2004 as suffering from ME, previously known by the widely held derogatory term of 'Yuppie Flu', but now recognised by the Medical establishment and better known as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. Although it is now officially recognised as a serious illness there is no known treatment for it. Self help and research was all my Doctor could advise and to steer clear of American information sites who tended to err on the side of sensationalism (who'd have thought it eh?). So there you have it, 'You're ill but there's nothing we can do for you'. If you'd like to know more about the illness then please check out the link section. I'd love to hear from anybody out there who is also fighting this depleting illness.  I plan to use this weblog to keep a daily journal of how I feel, what I've ate, how much I slept, exercise taken etc. With this information I hope to begin the long and hard road to recovering some semblance of a normal life. I'll also use it to post things of general interest, rants, pet peeves, news etc for those who might find it of interest.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
