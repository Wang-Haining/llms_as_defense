I had some chores to do outside anyhow though, so I just kinda got those done. I also got more of my room back in, my room. lol. I think you will definitely like the new layout, pretty suave ;) lol.  the power finally came back on and i enjoyed being able to listen to music once more. I got some work work done scanning some pictures and such, but other than that was really bored. took a nap, and when I woke up, i coulda sworn you were there, was the weirdest feeling, but in a good way :)  this evening planning on going to visit andy at work once more, then maybe hang out with heidi and tessa again after that. i really wanna play a game of risk too, but im just a geek and no one else here wants to, lol.  so um, yeah, that has been my uneventful crap day, hopefully yours at the waterpark, er, aquapark, went better (i think that is where you are/were today). My love for you is greater than the skies at night and deeper than the depths of the sea, and there is nothing that I want more, than to have you once more next to me. And yes I came up with that all by myself *snuggles*  *mwah*                       not, good, day.  today has sucked in just about every way possible.  I had a really really bad dream last nite. I know its not true, but it involved you and yeah, just sucked.  I also had to be up at 7 to go to the drum practice shit, so that didnt help either. then i came home and had to go cash money so i can pay my dad the $425 I owe him, great. THEN i had to do some real work cause apparently these pictures have to go back soon, so i scanned like 200 of those, which sucked. Then i had to do my summer reading, but that i cant complain about. that I am doing so I can spend more time with you. :) And I dunno, saw i robot today, cause i was that bored. and i kinda was hoping to hear from you, not like i expected it, would just help after last nites dream..... so yeah. But dont you dare feel bad cause i already feel bad for how big that fone bill is. Just, if you can, and ill pay for it all, i just want to talk to u once more before u leave for... here. *shrugs* im sillie. ive also been sick all day, tho trying to cover it up as much as possible. sorta half threw up last nite, but i think i know why now. at first i thot it was cause i had too much apple juice, but ive figured out its cause i ate 2 week old chips. cause i ate them again today and feel more sick now, blah. im an idiot. so in general, i feel like shit. hope your having a great time with your lesbians and dallas and all that, great big orgy ;) whatever, i can see you soon enough, so *shrugs* bye love *mwah*         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
