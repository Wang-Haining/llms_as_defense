Oh, and another thing.. why is this news?  Ehren's crystal ball prediction: KARE-11 will lead with this at 10:00 and the Pioneer Press will slap 'er on page A1, right under the story of women persevering from whatever they persevere from these days.  However, here's an ACTUAL news item:   urlLink Worker loses job after photographing soldiers' coffins   Peep THAT article out, my husky, internet-traveling friends.  And in case you're just too lazy to you know, read it, here's the gist:  A woman (yeah, they seem to be cropping up everywhere) snaps a photo of several flag-draped coffins on a US military cargo plane while at her job, and with nothing but good intentions in her heart, develops it and fires it off to the Seattle  Times  which gives it a prominent place on their Sunday front page along with a news item about the Iraq conflict and a feature about her and her job.  She then gets the ol' pink slip by the government for providing sensitive information to civilians.  And as always, there are two distinct sides to this story.  In defense of tami Silico, her act was one of kindness and compassion.  She simply wanted to show the families of deceased soldiers that they were well taken care of.  Then of course, there's that other side, the one that insists that the photo jeopardizes the most remote chance of the Iraq mission being successful, and thusly putting anti-war spin on it.  News flash: At least two thirds of this country is anti-war.  End of rant.                                 Now playing on iTunes: Blackstreet 'Take Me There'  I'm so awake it really isn't all that funny.  It was beyond hot today and yet somehow someone made the decision that the best mode for the air conditioner was 'off'.  85 degrees Fahrenheit in the hizzle?  no prob.  Things on my mind currently:  John Fogerty is vastly over-rated.  Seriously, just listen to him.  His songs are alright, but after hearing them so many times, they just get OLD.  I love CCR, but I can only hear 'Fortunate Son' so many times before I want to similtaneously vomit and plug a bullet in my head.  I still love my iPod.  Seriously, how can one little device be so damn cool?  I just put a grip of mp3's on it and I think my total is at around 23gb.  just too cool.  that and it's seriously like being in a tight knit community.  when I see someone with the trademark white earbuds or navigating the scroll wheel, a smile and/or nod is sometimes exchanged, and occasionally I've switched iPods for a few seconds to see what the other person is listening to.  I really miss Phil Hartman.  the Followers musical happened on Sunday. and Leigh just happened to be there.  I know it's been forever but I still like her a lot, and I just wish there was more time to talk to her yesterday.  but there was barely enough time to say hi, give her a hug and just look at her for a little bit.  sigh.  I really suck sometimes.                                 Now playing on iTunes: stellastarr* 'My Coco'  Well if you're one of the 2 readers who frequent this, you'll notice the absence of the gray backdrop and in its place a drab Blogger.com default scheme.  Reason being, I gave in to popular (among people I know anyway) opinion and downloaded Mozilla Firefox for my web browsing needs.  Upon doing so, I found that my blog page wouldn't load correctly, so I vainly spent an hour or so looking for a new skin that was pleasing to look at.  I suppose next time I just need to get off my ass and learn how to code CSS.  Firefox isn't the only new thing for me; yesterday I started sporting the Kyocera SE47 slider phone. Sweet.  It's a pretty nice little phone, it doesn't take up a lot of room in my pocket and it's loud as hizell unlike the LG I had for about a year.  So that's cool.  Yay for materialism.  On other fronts: Failure Sports One is still holding out and not making themselves available to cable or satellite outlets.  Oh, and I'm still making better onscreen graphics than they ever will  urlLink [yet another example] .  So eat my ass, Pohlad.  I get my Twins info from ESPN.com or Yahoo, my baseball-on-TV fix from Extra Innings, and a good dose of Herb and Gordon curtesy of WCCO.  Hah, looks like you LOSE, motherfucker!  Wait, that makes no sense...  Oh and by the way, I was lying the other night about putting up a new post after finishing my homework.                                 Now playing on iTunes: Dave Matthews 'Everyday'  a string of disappointments.  That's the only way I can describe today.  Let's see.. well I went to my English class and I had nothing.  I was supposed to go to the PiPress yesterday for observational purposes but it got bumped from the schedule, which resulted in my profiles paper not being ready for prime time.  So needless to say my peer review wasn't productive.  Another stressful day in my sociology class.. I am in way over my head on that one.  I also got my hair cut.  Not a pleasant experience.  I usually see this chick Heather near my job to get my cuts; today I went to a place near my school and I walked out looking like I was headed back to my double-wide to watch Smackdown.  No good.  Hey, also I got positively beat down at work.  That wasn't fun.  Plus it started fucking snowing again. I HATE SNOW IN MARCH.  I also decided that if I'm ever afforded the opportunity to have children that none of them wil be named John.  Reason being, with only a couple of exceptions guys named John seem to be self-absorbed cocks.  Yeah, I said it.  It's probably just me.  But if I see or hear the name John I will usually bolt in the other direction.  No kids named Derek either.  Every Derek I meet is some sort of dead eyed loner.  I hate to generalize like that but a name is a very personal thing, and sometimes your very soul can be tied into it.  Well that does it.  Later ~ E                                 Now playing on iTunes: Ben Folds 'Kate!!'  Not that it really matters.  Here it is, bitchez!  Breaking news... (linky)  urlLink Twins strike 8-year deal with FSN  (Star Tribune)  urlLink Minnesota Twins Telecasts Return to Fox Sports Net  (MLB.com)  urlLink Twins ditch their own TV network for Fox deal  (ESPN/AP)  elation is the best word to describe my mood.  plus now the Eels are playing on the iTunes 4.5 for Windows XP.  after many months of posturing, hardline negotiating tactics, and public-relations tug o' war, the Minnesota Twins hit the cable airwaves via FOX Sports Net North, and Kevin Cattoor and company are shuttering the Failure Sports One operations.  And you know what I have to say?  It's about goddamn time.  Not only did this Victory thing crush all hope of getting a stadium built in St Paul, but it caused many of the Twins fans to really beconme disenfranchised with the whole team experience.  Not that the TV 'experience' was all that great to begin with this year.  Sure, Dick and Bert were there calling the plays, but the camera work was amateurish at best and I've already expressed my feelings pn their onscreen presence.  That being, it SUCKED.  Next time, in 8 years when the Twins try this stunt again, they should really find someone with training and/or experience when assembling a CGI team.  And another tip: when the back end of the bullpen leaves for more money and you trade away two other key players for contract concerns, you shouldn't piss off the paying fan base, which is exactly what the Twins did and is the reason the average attendance has dipped almost 2,000 fans per game since last year.  Now that this whole Victory unpleasantness is out of the way, I can get down to some serious Twins watching.... if only the on-field product would improve...                                 Now playing on iTunes: The Thorns 'I Can't Remember'  my head hurts and it's uber-late, so this will be a short one.    I finally got Lunchbox® yesterday.  If you're wondering exactly what the hell that is, you need to visit my website.  Anyhoo, outside of that and dicking around on Photoshop I pretty much pissed away the day, just like spring break was meant for.  I also started to implement Lunchbox®'s intended use: the ultimate travel kit for my iPod.  Uh, it hasn't gotten very far yet.  It seems to have all the space I need but I need to figure out how to fill in the extraneous space.  I'll post a picture of it when I find my digicam.    Also, while bemoaning the fact that DISH yanked WCCO and countless Viacom channels off my television, I watched some of the Warroad-Orono hockey game and also saw that UPN was screening a POS called 'The Mullets'.  Now I was intrigued beause 'Mullets' was pulled off the air last fall before I could even watch the show to mock it.  In contrast, 'Luis' lasted longer this fall, and that was just a 30-minute Mexicans-vs.-Puerto-Ricans slur-fest.  I watched about 7 seconds of this putrid show today and I hope that it's pulled back off soon.                                   Now playing on iTunes: John Mayer 'New Deep'  Well I succombed to media pressure and yesterday I went to see  urlLink The Passion of the Christ  with my parents and some friends from church.  Wow, what an intense movie.  The suffering of Jesus during his final days on earth were portrayed so well on a human level, much more so than the countless Holy Week/Easter sermons, or the Bible, or even those cute little Sunday school stories ever could.  i was touched more deeply by this film than by anything else in recent memory, and the special part is that I was able to share in this moment with a packed theater, moved to a reverent silence, and that's where the success of 'Passion' ultimately lies, in that people are albe to see whet he went through for us.  On a much weightier issue (wink wink) I decided over the weekend that a switch to Mac is in my future.  I was looking at the gleaming new G5's on Saturday and after playing with it for a good hour my decision was made.  So there goes another $1500 ... thanks a lot, iPod.   Just thought you'd like to know. :) Later.               \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
