It’s a great topic for discussion.  My favorite part of the slacktivist post:  'Due to expensive land and encroaching urbanization, southern California [dairy farms] dairies are more geographically concentrated than those in other states, leading to a bigger manure problem. At a typical dairy [farm], hundreds of cows are locked into stations where they line up to eat hay. Once released into open areas, they jam together under whatever shade they can find to avoid the heat and glare of the sun.'  This is what those a-holes must mean in the 'happy cow adds' I see on TV.  The only hope is that investigative reporters will put this kind of stuff into the mainstream and enough people will worry about quality a la Upton Sinclair so positive change takes place.  At the same time, I continue to eat meat with little remorse.  Is this wrong?  My actions do support things that I know are wrong.  Why can't it be like when I was a boy?  Those days are gone, but I learned a lot growing up.  I’m not about to give up meat and dairy, but my eyes are open.  On the farm where I grew up we actually raised a fare about of the meat and eggs that went on the table.  We had chickens (some for eggs, some for eating), turkeys, and pigs.  We fished in our own boat and the times we caught dinner were the only times fish was on the menu.  We did catch extra and freeze them. Beef and dairy all came from the market.  After all that, I, and probably my sister, knew where meat came from - dead animals.  Animals that didn’t want to become dead animals.  I wish others had that experience.  I wish that everyone that eats meat had to raise an animal from birth – kill it – then decide if they wanted to eat it.  I’ve made my choice.  I wish folks that provide meat for the market took as good a care with their animals as we did with ours - for health reasons mostly, for the animal’s general well-being too.   My problem with it is that too many people just take it for granted – don’t think about where the meat is coming from.  Many get squeamish when they see slaughtering or butchering taking place.  Some can’t even stand the whole gutted fish in the market.  It is about making informed decisions, if the decision is to eat healthy meat raised in a humane way, like our family farm, then I’m all for it.    A counter argument often raised to justify factory farms is that it lowers the cost of the product, so more people can afford to eat foods that improve their diet.  Salmon farms are often the favorite example.  There is a point to be made here.    On the other hand- does this mean the economies of centralized animal raising and processing are really providing the best product for the lowest price in beef, chicken and pork?  The cost sure is lower, but why?  Part of the problem, is that the cost to the environment from these places is not passed on to the consumer.  It’s passed on to the neighbors of these large factory farms.  Other costs are  urlLink subsidized  by our federal government.  My main thesis is probably this – real positive change is only going to happen if consumers get hit with health problems or in the pocket book.  Cynical, but true I think.   Not everyone is going to have the type of experience I had growing up.  Fewer still will make a conscious decision about it like Matt and Jen.  Perhaps the wake up call is coming, let’s hope its not too painful.     Ok - so we're all up on the Governator's  urlLink 'girlie men'  comment in ref to the Democrats in the annual budget crunch out here in the land o’ sunshine.  Through bizarre fallout from the comment, we get a salient insight into the daily lives of our lawmakers.    The Democratic majority leader of the Senate, John Burton, now refuses to bring the Governator  urlLink whipped milk  from the Democrat’s espresso maker.  Relevent Quote:  “Republican leaders McCarthy and Ackerman, in an effort to show that negotiations were back on track, wheeled down a $2,000 Jura espresso maker that GOP members had purchased for the governor.  They pasted a sign on it that said: ‘Back in service.’ The lawmakers were playing off Burton's refusal to bring the governor whipped milk from his own machine, which had become Burton's practice until the weekend blitz by Schwarzenegger cut off the gifts.”  Two questions:  (1)  When did Schwarzenegger start thinking Burton and other Dems were “girlie men”? During budget crunch or after they brought him whipped milk for the first time?  I mean, come on, I like friendly partisan relations too, but bringing the guy whipped milk?   Its like an emasculated version of the 'secretary stereotype' of bringing the boss coffee.  I’m surprised Schwarzenegger didn’t ask Burton if his favorite dessert was creampuffs.  (2)  What the fuck are these people doing with $2000 espresso makers anyway?  They were either paid for with tax dollars or contributions to the political parties, I’d bet.  And now both parties have one?  Great use of funds folks – that two grand on the espresso maker is really doing a lot for the citizens or party supporters.  Even if they were not paid for in either of those ways, isn’t this still a little excessive when the rest of us make do with Mr. Coffee? Scheesh.      Every once in a while you find something on google that just makes your head spin.  I was trying to find a bulk quote price for ruthenium in elemental form, aka ruthenium metal.  So I type in the following unmodified:  urlLink metal prices ruthenium.   First hit OK, but the price looks off to me, so we start scrolling down.  Where it gets interesting is in  urlLink hit #5  entitled 'precious metals'. Starts out fine with some pretty standard info on precious metals: where they come from, common uses, with a few weird things added in like the following-  'Precious metals are now being actively and aggressively researched for their potential medical benefits.  Laurence Gardner [1] has provided considerably evidence in this regard by showing that these metals in their Monoatomic Elements, ORME, state are capable of amazing and astounding actions.'  That 'provided considerably evidence' construction is theirs.  And I've not heard or Laurence Gardner or much about the medicinal value of precious metals outside of Cis-Platnin for cancer, but what the hey - I'm no expert in the field.  Anyway, I'm curious now so I get the the end of the page and there is this link to the  urlLink The Philosopher's Stone.   This is some of the most fucked up psuedo-science I've read in a long time.  Its well worth the read if not for comidic value.      So I was thinking about a long post concerning the mysterious absence of gratuitous nudity in modern cinema, when  urlLink Political Animal  posts a link to  urlLink this .   A new study from the Harvard School of Public Health has found that a decade of 'ratings creep' has allowed more violent and sexually explicit content into films, suggesting that movie raters have grown more lenient in their standards.  ....The study, which was issued on Tuesday, quantified what children's advocates and critics of the ratings system have said anecdotally for years: that a movie rated PG or PG-13 today has more sexual or violent content than a similarly rated movie in the past.    Now, my thesis is that before PG-13, you basically couldn't make an R-rated comedy without a little gratuitous female nudity.  The list of early 80s comedies with some fleeting frontal shot of women's breasts is as long as your proverbial arm.  This list is topped, of course, by Phoebe Cates' mind-altering appearance in  urlLink Fast Times at Ridgemont High , but a long list of shower scenes, changing scenes, love scenes and just flat out bizarre unexplained nipples preceded it.  I realized the worm had turned while watching  urlLink Bad Santa  two days ago.  This movie, if you aren't familiar with it, features an incredibly foul mouthed drunkard played by Billy Bob Thornton as a criminal who dresses up as Santa, then steals half the store after it closes on Christmas Eve every year.  Don't worry, the ending is heartwarming.  Billy Bob's character gets laid multiple times in the film and  never is there a bare nipple to be found !  What could be the point of this?  He must say the f-word 150 times throughout the movie, making references to anal sex and Mrs. Santa's sister all the way.  The producers knew they were going to have an R-rating and frontal nudity would have been completely appropriate for the film.  Yet for some reason, they held back.  This is a huge puzzle to me.  What's going on here?  On one hand, we have some researchers saying that ratings creep has been occurring for the last 11 years in a big way, and on the other, we have films that aren't explicitly about sex avoiding nudity like it's a  bad thing .  Weird.  I'd also point out that depictions of explicitly sexual violence have gotten more common over the last few years.   urlLink Monster  has an absolutely agonizing rape scene, and indy films especially seem to equate showing this sexual violence with realism, rather than exploitation.  But the type of nudity I am talking about from the 80s was in my mind  far  less exploitive in the sense that it was often celebratory of the power of the human body.  It was objectification yes, but modern feminism has certainly shown us the double-edged nature of that kind of objectification, in that it also becomes a tool of empowerment in the enlightened woman.  So it depresses me that essentially neutral nudity has been expunged from film, while horrific dysfunctional power struggles and sexual violence still seem to have their place. \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
