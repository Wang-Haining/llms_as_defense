We need to turn the tables on tax cuts and start looking at paying taxes like paying dues to a gym or a labor union much the same way Bushites pay country club fees.    Over the long run, we need to re-frame the tax issue more broadly. The Radical Right has sought to define taxation as inherently wicked in order to promote tax cuts, with the ultimate goal of starving the government of revenue and forcing cuts in vital services like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. We need to turn this debate around.  One idea is to talk about taxes as the dues we pay as citizens of this country. These are like the dues we pay to be as members of a community swimming pool or, for those more likely to count themselves as part of George Bush's 'base,' a country club. We benefit from the dues that those before us have paid to build the facilities, and part of our own dues go toward maintaining the pool or tennis courts for future members.               The  urlLink World Socialist Web Site  discusses the findings of the New England Journal of Medicine about the effects of the predatory Iraq war is having on U.S. troops. It seems that a large number of service men and women are returing home with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other psychiatric difficulties. War is hell but suffering from a war over a lie is unimaginable. Let's bring the troops home safely and soon. Let's end the U.S. occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan.   A study published July 1 by the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) found that one in six soldiers returning from Iraq was suffering from a variety of emotional problems, with lower levels of mental disabilities exhibited among those who served in Afghanistan. The report, conducted by a team from the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Washington, D.C., is the first such assessment of war-related psychiatric disorders made while military action is underway. Most studies in the past that have focused on the effects of combat on mental health were performed years after the fighting had ended.    urlLink Read more...     \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
