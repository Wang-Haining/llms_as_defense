But yea his name iz austin hazan..i call him either hazan or cheese..either one. But yesterday he made the highlight of my day! every time duren lunch this principal helper person, who'z named  Dr. Grogan, has trivia question time. so she asks'wut's my real first name and how do u spell it?' so Hazan goes up and says ' DOCTOR! D-O-C-T-E-R!' and everybody cracked up! he iz da best dude ever. and today....he was all sad. Y? becuz...becuz...ppol told me..his bro wuz either in da hospital or...or..in a mental facility. He had his hood over his head..i could see his red nose..and tears droppen on da floor...Now when ppol are sad..i get sad. When all da popular crowd got away from him i went with my frend to..i dunno..comfort him i guess. So, I jus sat there with him. but then my teacher came out so..since his head was da only thing i could i kinda patted his head and left. herez a chat we had today...um i can't copy it suz i'm on AIM express. SRY yall. P.S HAZAN? i'll be there for u when u need me..u were there when i needed sum1 to talk to.                     A chat i had today with Noel. To understand it read this. It is a post noel put up on hiz xanga. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Ok, whenever im at UNF im always wandering around after or before classes, mainly because i like to find out whats up or what not around the place. So today i was doing the same routine and decided to check out this one building near the computer lab, dont know exactly what building it was tho (...i guess this explains why i always look lost)      i was eating some good food right before i was entering the building, and as i slowly opened the glass door some girl walks right by me, and starts starring me down (starring me down to the bone!..no joke!).. i thought she was a student worker trying to get me introuble for eating in the building (even though i know u can eat in certain buildings), panicing, i try to avoid her stare and try to by pass her while looking for a nearby trash can. To my luck i find a three foot tall ash tray (usually these ash trays have freaking trash cans attached to the sides) but i wasnt able to find the usual trash can hole to dispose my food. I was pretty much analyzing the structure of this mysterious ash tray, hoping that i would be able to find the common side trash hole, all in the midst of this girl just starring at me. After 30 seconds of me lookin like an ass studying the ash tray, and panicing in front of unknown girl starring at me, she finally breaks the silence and asks, 'excuse me....but, where are you coming from?' in my head i started to freak out! i was thinking, did i break a UNF law? am i gonna get sued for having trespassed this building? are they gonna report me for studying an ash tray? SURE curiosity killed the cat, but you dont see me with whiskers (unless i dont shave) purring my way through the night...so after having a mental breakdown, i simply answered, 'Im from here...jacksonville, its extremely nearby' and then she says 'oh no, im sorry, i mean... ur nationality...' so then i was like omg, is this a fantasy come true? ...back to my point, i answer 'im filipino...' and with excitement she says 'oh wow but you dont look like it!' and in my head i was like, 'whats that suppose to mean? not interested in me nemore just cuz im filipino?' its like she gave me a compliment that i dont look filipino...so is it a bad thing to look filipino? or is it a good thing to not look filipino? anywho i took it lightly, and just started conversating with her, and she seemed pretty nice...in the bigger picture i thought it was pretty cool that some random stranger took the oppurtunity to get to know me...  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  AnGeL G 2392: heylo wngx3: hey hey! wngx3: thanx for the commeny wngx3: comment* AnGeL G 2392: :-D AnGeL G 2392: well dat wuz a funny post wngx3: hahahah wngx3: what was funny about it?

WEll NEwayz...on monday something very funny happend. While my friend was teaching a lesson (it wuz a project)  we were doing a worksheet. all of a sudden we heard a little yap and a kid yelling because a little dog was chasing him. All of us went to see what was going on. (btw, my class was in a portable that period because i'm in a smart class, hehe) then we went back to our seats becuz the dog ran away. Then, while my teacher was walking in we heard a very big bark. my teacher goes, well that definetly isn't the other dog! So we went to look agen.  there was a GERMAN SHEPARD outside! sumthin wuz wrong with its back to legs. NEways, we were looking at the dog when two kids were walking and saw it. they were like just staring at it..slowly walking away. We went back inside and my teacher had some water..so she put it in a cup a let the dog drrink it. after the dog drank some it ran away. i hope those dogs r safe now.there not wild though..they had collars.                     Okay so its   DAY 2    So, I had to wake up at 7 and i was REALLY tired since i talked to Noel, raffy, and kristine until 12.    Anyways, I was only scheduled for the morning shift, but Ate chi made me a standby for all of the shifts and so i was in all shifts. So, i was a co leader of the Reuben tribe ages 10-12. and i was a co leader with this girl name kristine...NOT kristine from tampa. So like, i met everybody in my group and it turned oust that there was this girl nicknamed BOGAR..not booger..BOGAR . She's wierd. Anyways, This CFC person as like, okay kids, YOU HAVE TO CALL YOUR tribe leader ATE OR KUYA. and i was like...you don't have to call me ate since i'm like your age. so we had to make these stupid visors. and we used like rubber bands that felt like sand paper cloth to tie the ends together. of course..i didn't make one. later, we had snacks and this girl(aubrey) in my group said that her stomach didn't feel good. It turned out that this cherry kool-aid stuff that she drank, tasted disgusting and  it made her throw up. I'll skip the other stupid stuff and go to the next shift.     This shift i was leader of the Joseph group. these girls were 7-9. and they were like so obediant. they followed EVERY thing that they were told to do. So they colored stars on sheets of cloth. and during my next shift, they get to stuff them. ok so..NEXT SHIFT     Next shift, I was placed back into REUBEN group. and i got to sow BUGAR's pillow since she wasn't there that night. I got to stuff it then. and i stayed there till like 11pm.      DAY 3  I wen to mass and went to the kids watch. I was placed in REUBEn tribe again. and we sang songs(like we did the day before) and went out on the BIG porch area and played that egg on spoon game... except it wasn't an egg, it was a ball. then we just did whatever and I sowed aubreys pillow since she wasn't there and i got to keep it. IT IS SO PRETTY! And I got a hat that says YFC on it.  I'll talk about my trip to corpus christi with macy and her family tomorrow         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
