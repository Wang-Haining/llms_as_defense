So why not  urlLink check this out . It's the toothbrush posse, I am on the bottem left (8th row). If you click it, you will get my nexus profile! Yeah I think it's cool but eh..Im boring. Also to my amazment-when I turned on my printer this morning out of nowhere it printed my resume perfectly-without it even being asked!! I thought I was going to have to buy and ink cartridge before I could hand out my resume..Now I just have to get it copied at the pharmacy in parksville a few time when I go with my dad to the truck rental place to pay the bill for when him and ryan went to powell river on saturday to get a whole bunch of our stuff! Besides that-my life basicly revolves around listening to music and chatting online (as you already might know! hehe). Life is getting boring lately-the wheather has been good. Well, I'm gonna go on another bike ride today after I go with my dad, and I have to eat breakfast and brush my teeth yet so i'm gonna go.                     Today was alright, I woke up earlier than usual, 11am lol. David came over, and every time he does I feel sad, because every time could be the last. No, he's not dying or anything...he's moving...across the country. He keeps saying he wants to come back in 6 months, but he might end up staying for an entire year. I don't know, what if he likes it, and stays forever!! Omg well I don't even want to go that far. We walken up to Ashley's house, where we recently had David's 'Going Away' party. We snuck around the side of the house, Dave opened the back sliding door and ran into her eating on the coffee table. All I heard was footsteps and a loud scream. I was hiding down stairs, outside and was worried because after that I heard nothing. I thought maybe her or someone else had actually hurt Dave! We where only there for a little bit, but then her dad came home so we had to leave. We walked down to the Park and Dave had the brilliant idea of walking through the park to get behind my house. We both got stung by yellow jackets haha. After that we went to Nanaimo. I drove, after a huge fight with my dad about it because he always wants to drive...but he drove around Nanaimo, and back--even though Me and Dave left before my dad and brother went to go do their business. Yeah, actually my dad needed to go to the Superstore to return his steaks because they where infected haha. He actually called poison control last night omg! They where actually recalling them when he went in he said. Me and Dave stayed at the mall, and we went and ate New York Fries. Basicly for those who dont know, are the greasyiest, tastiest fries ever, covered in cheese sauce. My debit card was declind the first time cause I forgot my password! luckly, my second attempt worked. I didn't look to great today, because I didn't wash my cloths last night. But tommorow or wednesday I need to go out and hand out more resumes. After that we hung out in front of Wal-Mart mwahaha. My dad finally came to pick us up and he gave us a dollar each, so we had to go into walmart to get change...of coarse they dont sell cans up front, they also can't open the register unless a sale is made. So anyway, the teller told us we could go to customer service and get change. No, but she asked 'Who said that??' i pointed to the teller, 'TELLER 8?!', i said uhh yeah... she said 'Thats completely against policy!!' then dave finally came to Teller 8's rescue and said 'nonono, she said if we rush over maybe she would let us or something'... I never founded out what happened to Teller 8. Oh, and i wanted to add something else that I just was reminded of, when I was sitting in front of Wal-Mart today, across the street at a chrysler dealer guess what the temperature there was? 108 degrees. I dont exactly 'feel' the heat as much as i used to..but it makes me sweat, which is nasty. It's about 85 in front of my house, but it was darn hot in that fucking parking lot!!                      My dad and brother try so hard to piss me off. I kept getting up because they where leaving lights on or talking and I couldnt sleep. I put something infront of my door, took a sleeping pill and finally fell a sleep...at like 3:30. It was crazy. I actually woke up at about 1:30 which isnt too bad, but I really wanna try to get up earlier than that for tommorow because I really need to put out resumes! Thats just another day in my boring life. Actually no. But we are in another (mini) heat wave again which is hella nice, tommorow is getting up to 30+ again which is soo nice. I talked to my grandmother yesterday night and she said I will have to call my phone company (fido) or should I say my ex-phone company cause all we got here is telus, bell and rogers. Fido and sprint are Vancouver only...stupid ass middle of no-where town! I actually bothered to have a shower/get dressed today. I also went for my bike ride. It was a shorter bike ride than usual, but I will prolly go on a short one a little later this evening as well.          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
