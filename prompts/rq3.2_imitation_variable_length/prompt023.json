'The road to success almost always involves a series of rejections, until you meet someone willing to champion your cause.' - Luther Vandross  The very reason for self-publishing my own books is because I don't feel anyone has the right to tell me whether my stories are worth being out on the 'shelves' or not.  But, let's face it, every author's ultimate goal is worldwide distribution and marketing through a major publishing house.  I don't think it's worth expending any energy worrying about if it will happen.  The question is, when will it happen?  The answer is, in time.   Take Steven King's situation for instance.  After finishing his university studies with a B.S. in English in the early 1970s, King took a job as an English teacher at Hampden Academy in Hampden, Maine.  He lived with his wife Tabitha and at least one child in a trailer. Making ends meet was sometimes difficult, and the money that came from his short stories, published mainly in men's magazines, was very useful. It was during this timeframe that King also developed a drinking problem that stayed with him for over a decade.   King also began a number of novels. One of them told the story of a young girl with psychic powers. Frustrated with it, he threw it into the trash. But later, he discovered that Tabitha had rescued it, encouraging him to finish it as Carrie.  He then sent it to a friend at Doubleday and more or less forgot about it. Some time later, he received an offer to buy it with a small $2,500 advance.  Years later, the paperback rights sold for $400,000.  Do you think King's potential was fully recognized when Doubleday offered him that anemic $2,500 advance?  Nope.  And there are plenty of other examples of authors who achieved publishing success after being met with publishing indifference.  So stay the course.   urlLink SerialThriller.com             What Documentation Is Needed To Apply For A Construction Loan?  In addition to the standard asset, liability, and employment documentation, you will need to provide plans, specifications, and a fixed price (not cost plus) builder contract. If you are using the 203(k) program or the Construction Second Trust, you may act as your own General Contractor and we will need a cost breakdown plus subcontractor's bids/fixed price contracts.   What Is Required Before Funds Can Be Advanced?  Prior to disbursement of funds, you will need to provide: a copy of the building permit and hazard/builders risk insurance. Prior to your loan's conversion to permanent financing we require updated hazard insurance, well certification, a final survey, and the use and occupancy certificate. Other items may be required depending on the type of construction and permanent loan selection.   What Lender Fees Are Associated With The Construction Process?  We collect a fee at settlement, which covers inspections and modification to a permanent loan. There may be an additional fee if you exceed the standard number of inspections and draws. There also may be discount points (never origination fees) for prepaid interest.   When Is Private Mortgage Insurance Required?  Typically, Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI) is required on the permanent loan when your down payment is less than 20% of the completed value of the property.   Who Is My Primary Contact During The Construction Process?  Your Title Company or Settlement Attorney will handle the disbursement of funds at the appropriate intervals.   What Is The Draw Schedule?  The 'Draw Schedule' details the amount available to be disbursed and requirements that need to be met throughout the construction process. Generally, there are 3 to 6 draws. Draws are disbursed by the Title company after inspection by the appraiser to verify the work.  You will receive a draw schedule prior to closing.   What Methods Are Available For Disbursing Funds?  Funds are disbursed by check to either you and your builder jointly, you, or your builder.   How Does The Draw Process Work?  We will send an inspector out upon you or your builder's request. Upon verification of work completed, we will disburse funds.   How Are Payments Calculated during the construction phase?  Payments are interest only based on the outstanding balance and are due on the first of each month. A bill is mailed to you 15 days before the payment is due. Depending on the program selected, you may have a construction rate which is tied to the Prime Rate and may adjust or a fixed rate   When Should I Lock My Permanent Rate?  Depending on your preference, you may lock in your permanent interest rate at any time. However, keep in mind that there may be an extended lock fee for locks over 90 days. If you are concerned over rising interest rates, you may wish to consider the Smart Lock which will allow a Float Down feature is rates improve significantly during construction.   What Is Modification?  Modification is the process of converting your construction loan into the permanent loan of your choice after construction is complete.   What Do I Need To Modify?  Before modification you must have met all the requirements detailed on your commitment letter and draw schedule.   When Are Escrows Collected?  Escrows are generally required when you convert to a permanent loan. Also, please remember that you are responsible for paying property taxes directly during construction.   May I Pay Down On My Loan At Any Time? Are There Penalties?  You may make principal reductions anytime you wish prior to modification without incurring any penalties.                 Formatting Friday: Em Dash   Going forward, this is the day I will talk about punctuation, grammar, word usage, etc. Not that I'm an expert, believe me.  I've just accumulated some good information about these things from having 2 manuscripts professionally copy edited and through Internet research.    The literary laws and conventions of writing a novel are a necessary evil as far as I'm concerned.  I'd much rather concentrate fully on creating the story line and characters and leave the grammar grunt work to the experts.  But, alas, incorporating some of these dos and don'ts  will  same some editing money and publishing time in the long run.  So, just do it.  Now, back to the topic of this Blog.  Honestly, I didn't even know what an em dash was before receiving the edits back on  urlLink Torn Apart .  Basically, there are three dashes:   1) Hyphen is the shortest of the 3 and used mostly to combine words  2) En dash is the next longest of the 3 and means 'through.'  Is used to indicate inclusive dates & numbers, such as pp. 12-16.  3) Em dash is used to create a strong break in the structure of a sentence, such as a long sentence that has a number of commas.  I also like to use this to end one character's statement when interrupted by another.  My goal here is just to expose you to the difference.  You can do your own research to get more specifics and make sure you use the three correctly from now on.   urlLink SerialThriller.com       So how did I get started in this writing game anyway?   Well, I first discovered my love for writing while working on my master's degree.  This is when I was in the USAF.  I loved writing essays and papers.  So much so that after I left the military I wanted to pursue a topic of my own choosing.  Authoring a family history sounded like a good idea, but it turned out to be too tedious and not fun.  But I had begun to gather information that included some of my own most memorable experiences and didn't want that to go to waste.  So I started to build a story around a character who followed in my undergraduate footsteps and then developed a life of his own.  This was the birth of manuscript  The Duality of His Life .  While it was true that I had created something, I wasn't sure it was something I liked.  Then it dawned on me.  What do I love to read?  Horror!  Thus the birth of  urlLink  Torn Apart   and, ultimately,  urlLink  Sanguine Fluid  .  I won't get into these two stories because they can be obtained direct from my publisher @ xlibris.com, amazon.com or barnsandnoble.com.  Also, instead of recapping the process of publishing these novels, I promise to take you through each step from professional editing to final approval of the exterior and interior galleys when I finish rewriting  urlLink  The Duality of His Life   later this year.  So stay tuned because I have a lot of lessons learned to share with any would-be self-published authors.  Anyway, I also began to translate  urlLink short stories  that came to me in dreams.  BTW, the pseudonym James Spade also came to me in a dream.  The web address  urlLink SerialThriller.com  took a while for me to come up with and I was shocked it was still available.  So I quickly registered SerialThriller.net also.  (I'm strictly an amateur web designer, so don't be too hard on me if you visit.  My goal was primarily to get my portfolio onto the web.  Time fooling around with Frontpage is time away from writing, know what I mean?)  But do yourself a favor if and when you establish a website.  Reserve whatever name suits you immediately as a .com and .net so that someone else doesn't beat you to it and confuse your audience/customers down the road.  Depending on who you use, you shouldn't have to pay more than $20 to $30 per year.  I pay about $28 per year for 4, which includes jamesspade.com and jamesspade.net (all pointing back to  urlLink SerialThriller.com ).  So do your research.  I also found a deal through 1and1.com where I was able to get free web hosting for 3 years with no adds.    Lastly, although I am no poet, occasionally something touches me in a way that I need to express my emotions through  urlLink rhythm and rhyme .  Surprisingly, I have quite a few poems under my belt addressing a variety of topics.
