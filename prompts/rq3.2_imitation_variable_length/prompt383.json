  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic:\n\n       Some people work quietly inside KDE and do a great job. Stephan Binner, Andrew Coles (they fix all our English mispellings and i18n() errors), Lauri and PhilRod for the docs, Icefox for porting all the apps to new libs and cleaning code and others. Albert (TSDGeos) is among them, quietly going through the progs and fixing bugs (big bugs like memory leaks). So as I wrote yesterday, having the kids on holiday I cannot really concentrate and thus called Albert to the rescue for my KTurtle cyrillic problem. He delivered the fix not even 24h after, porting some pure C++ to Qt and using the magic of utf8() instead of latin1()! So a big Thank You to the quiet people, I personnally learn a lot from you.  Today I helped fixed two KDevelop bugs that were also fixed in a record time. I just tried to see where the bugs where, that was all my participation... 'teatime' again cut his night sleep to fix them, I hope he wont be too weak at work. Speaking of sleeping, I noticed that some developers recently went into bad sleeping patterns and it's my duty (as KDE mother) to encourage them to sleep a correct amount of time in one go! :-> (and please do also eat a correct amount of vegetables and fruits ;-)  At my LUG yesterday:  urlLink annma  and also in  urlLink group  (hint: blue TShirt).  'Carry me to the shoreline  Bury me in the sand  Walk me across the water   And maybe you'll understand'                     We had an install fest at my LUG today. It was the first time we did that and it went amazingly well. I was promoted KDE specialist of course and I did my best to customize a lady PC. She was amazed by the transparent kicker and other goodies and I managed to achieve all she wanted. She was not interested in the HowToDo-things part but she wanted a functional and customized desktop which we got. Konqueror being so versatile impressed her deeply (file manager, ftp, ...) I appreciated better the Fr translation team work as she was not bilingual and wanted it all in French. I also learnt a few tricks here and there while others were at hands on bigger challenges.  It's nice to see ordinary people wanting to get free software and knowing about freedom. A young guy was a FSF member and it felt conforting to see young people care about freedom and about the philosophy behind the GPL. Another quite young guy arrived with a home-made PC in a small briefcase! All components in a suicase! That was amazing. He wanted to install 2 Linux distros in his home-made PC to demonstrate Linux and he succeeded. He recently started a company which sells hardware and software support and he is switching from Microsoft to Linux software support. Another guy was a French living in Mali, on holiday in Quebec. He just bought a box in Montreal and was happy about the fest as he could quickly install a complete distro on his machine. He also got some ISOs for his friends. In Mali the Internet connections are quite poor and the low bandwith does not allow distro downloads or even updates. He was also a very interesting guy. He has a website named 'Think In Order To Act' (in French 'Penser Pour Agir').  I liked very much meeting such people, they open new horizons. And it also makes more sense being involved in KDE after such a day :-)                   So day after day we go closer to the real freeze. I have the feeling we did not get very much feedback from 3.3 beta 1 but maybe it's me out of tune here. The #kde channel is very quiet and people speak more of 3.2.2 than pre-3.3. I gave myself a good-kde-support-award after helping a gentoo user who got 3.2.2 plus half of 3.3 alpha 1 on his machine, not kdelibs or kdebase 3.3 but some other packages. He came first saying k3b was buggy but then k3b for 3.3 alpha1 could not find kcontrol... Helping in #kde is always fun especially with over-friendly users calling me 'mate', 'man' and 'dude'! I decided to translate KTurtle GUI + doc in french considering that French is my birth language and that the doc is quite long and difficult. So it's with pleasure that I subscribed to the kde-francophone mailing list again (my first involvement in KDE was translating) and found there people I already know. Those people, in fact, do a lot for KDE but in France and their names seldom appear on the dot or elsewhere. The translation teams all do such a great job! I had trouble getting KDE in french: I grabbed the kde-i18n/fr sources and then, as usual, after make -f... I did make install without make. But make is indeed in that case. Took me a bit of a time to get it. Then KBabel is a tower on its own to set up, it kept wanting to find the /de folder some place where it did not exist. I am quite sure I did not set it to its full capability. I'll just try to translate in real French and not in Quebecois!!!  It's already 10pm, I had the house full of kids this afternoon/evening. My oldest daughter's new boy friend found me cool so that lightened my evening! My second daughter's boy friend (who I now know more) helped with the swimming pool as I casually and randomly throw some stuff in it and the water was not very clear. Hopefully tomorrow it'll be fixed. My son who is 13 had 4 friends around and they were making some footage with a camera, dressed up and emitting strange noises... No wonder I did not work a lot... At least I need less sleep than them, they'll emerge tomorrow at nearly lunch time while I will have been up for at least 4 hours already.  'The Human Equation program aborted. Have a nice day. Dream Sequencer system offline.'                 I went to Montreal yesterday evening for the monthly Linux Meetup. We met at a cyber-cafe where the owners are totally nice, they gave us a nice room with a PC (we ran Knoppix on it) and a large screen. There's a large choice of beers. We were around 20 and after each telling the others how he (I was the only she) is related to Linux, we planned a Free Software Week in Quebec in September.  Only weird anedocte is that driving back from Montreal to Lorraine I was stuck in a traffic jam at mighdnight! I never experimented anything so crazy than driving in Quebec (and I drove in a lot of countries including Italy and Greece if you know what I mean) I kept myself awake by (badly) singing out loud some Epica.  I got some KLatin translated data which I don't know what to do with. KLatin is not prepared for having  other languages than en latin so I'll have some work to do on that.   I sort of gave up trying to implement the KNewStuff on KDevelop as it seems noone cares anyway.                  Three Dot Three is next KDE release. Alpha 1 and beta 1 quite suck so how will we make it? As Boudewijn says in his blog, there is a certain number of big bugs. Are developers already focused on 4.0, are they always running forward and don't they never take time to totally finish their programs? The Quality Team in which I put my hopes seems quite dead. It could have helped polishing things. Finishing a prog is boring, yes, besides the developer knows it too much and cannot see its flaws. I guess aKademy will refocuse development.  I spent a lot of quality time with my youngest daughter today: she cycled while I followed roller blading (yeah, keeping in shape...), we played in the swimming pool, we watched a bit of soccer. Kids that age are amazing, always happy to do things, eager to understand the world around, un-tainted by society. It's also the ask-questions age and after asking me at length about microbes she suddenly startled me with 'why are we alive?'. And looking in her big brown eyes, I was speechless .  'All I know Time is a valuable thing Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings Watch it count down to the end of the day'                   It's nice to get HEAD open again. Especially as I got some new data: nn files for KHangman and long-awaiten-english-sounds for KLettres! It's nice to see users take time to contribute. For KLettres especially, it is very difficult as you have to record sounds. Thanks to Rob for taking time to do that for KLettres and thanks to Gaute for KHangman Norwegian data!  Tomorrow I'll go to my LUG for an install fest, this is exciting (my first install fest). New users shifting to Linux :-) My own oldest daughter wants me to install Linux on her laptop as Windows 98 has all sort of problems after one year use. My policy is not to install Linux on the kids machines and to leave the supplied OS. My son especially is a big gamer, he plays online and over the LAN with his friends. As parents, we try to give choices and not impose our way of living/thinking/behaving as much as we can. Of course some boundaries have to be set. But not in the OS matter for example ;-) We also have one daughter who chose last year to become a vegetarian and I was quite proud of that. Proud that she could make her own decisions aged 15 and proud she felt free enough to do so.  Today I went with the two above-mentionned daughters at their college to start preparing their rooms, bringing micro-waves and such things. They'll go to the same college (which is convenient), Debs (17) is studying Fashion Design (2nd year) and  urlLink Blandine (16)  is starting Graphics Design. They'll live at the school dormitory for the week. They'll start the 23rd while the 2 youngest will start the 1st September.
