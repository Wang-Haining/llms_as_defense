It would have made it smoother to finish.  The project's due on Thursday, so I believe I have the drop on this.  Ha!  Of course there's another project on the way for next week.  It all but assures that I stay in front of the computer working.  I just got an e-mail about the interview I had two weeks ago.  The job opening was 'cancelled.'  The band for the job had been changed.  I can re-apply when the job is up for grabs again.  That sucks.  I feel like life's trying to hold me hostage.  Perhaps things are happening in a vacumm.  The world is not out to get me.  Not as long as I have the power to create, and the power to know love.  I am invincible.  Truth is, I cannot allow myself to feel defeated because of some setbacks.  Mind you, it's rough sometimes.     Song of the Day:     'Paradise'   by Sade.  Why?  Sade has some of the best songs with the right mix of mellowness and sadness that can push you to feel something good.  Paradise is where I'd love to be if I could.                           Went from the computer lab to Wal-Mart, and bought some bread, ham, and cheese.&nbsp; The store clerk joked about me making some sandwiches.&nbsp; he was right.&nbsp; I wanted them.&nbsp; Made some for lunch today.&nbsp; Alrady ate them.&nbsp; LOL&nbsp; Breakfast is good for the day.&nbsp; LOL  There may be a duty expantion for me at work.&nbsp; I will find out on Wednesday if I have new duties, as we prepare (yet again,&nbsp;I swear the delays are endless) to move into our new library.&nbsp; I talked with another co-worker from a diffent dept.&nbsp; He thinks we're going to have a lot of extra duties, for the same amount of pay as well.&nbsp; LOL.&nbsp; This expantion is a mixed blessing.&nbsp; I'm sure it means I will now have tacked on duties of other departments.&nbsp; I could be wrong, so I keep that in mind.&nbsp;   I don't want to do my Illustrator project.&nbsp; I find it rather cumbersome, and annoying.&nbsp;&nbsp; This stupid ball and mirror thingie.&nbsp; I have two finals in the class, and would love to dedicate time to them, and not be in such a jam&nbsp; later on.&nbsp; One day I'll have to post the projects, so all can see.    Song of the Day:&nbsp;  'Automatic'    by the Pointer Sisters.&nbsp; Why? It's one of my favorite 80's songs.&nbsp; I decided I wanted to purchase it from iTunes, and now I can can hear it all I want.&nbsp;                         My boss just shushed us.  LOL.  Now I have to find something quiet to do.  Namely I decide that it was time for today's entry.  Aftewords during lunch I can sing 'Swing Low, Sweet Chariot.'  It may take the edge off of massa's commands.    I woke up the morning with my eye burning.  I got allergies bad this week.  Man, it was hurting something crazy.  My intention was to call my professor, so I could get her help on a particular topic.  I found out my e-mail never reached her, so I sent it again.  e-mails are crazy sometimes, aren't they.  I get they get lost like some letters do in the mail.  I tried the 'Java Chip' at Starbucks today.  Not my usual vanilla latte, but it's different.  I've been doing coffee all this week.  Better slow it down 'fore I become wired and nervous.  All I need to be is a mess by tomorrow.  I'm going to have Chinese for lunch, or at least that what I'm thinking about.  General Tso's chicken from Chopsticks is the best I've had.  Wore my straw hat today.  People love this hat.  i get the best reaction from thius hat.  I should get my hair cut, so I can stop wearing hats all day.  Straw is more comrotable, but useless when it rains, like it did an hour ago.           \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
