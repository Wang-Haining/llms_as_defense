Doro Pesch and Lemmy                       My soul is burning but the chill of dying love is whirling around me - trying to find an entrance - I have no armor - no defences left I have no more will to fight for something that I no longer feel.  I have chosen a different path...there is one I wish to walk with me if he chooses but it cannot be you.  You have let this happen, you have watched the disintegration for months - you still choose to fight when there is nothing left to fight for.    You tried to clip my wings but they have regrown.  I am stronger, wiser and more free than ever before and I need the freedom to explore every realm of possibility.     When the dark wood fell before me And all the paths were overgrown When the priests of pride say there is no other way I tilled the sorrows of stone  I did not believe because I could not see Though you came to me in the night When the dawn seemed forever lost You showed me your love in the light of the stars  Cast your eyes on the ocean Cast your soul to the sea When the dark night seems endless Please remember me  Then the mountain rose before me By the deep well of desire From the fountain of forgiveness Beyond the ice and fire  Cast your eyes on the ocean Cast your soul to the sea When the dark night seems endless Please remember me  Though we share this humble path, alone How fragile is the heart Oh give these clay feet wings to fly To touch the face of the stars  Breathe life into this feeble heart Lift this mortal veil of fear Take these crumbled hopes, etched with tears We'll rise above these earthly cares  Cast your eyes on the ocean Cast your soul to the sea When the dark night seems endless Please remember me Please remember me  Loreena McKennitt-Dante's Prayer           \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
