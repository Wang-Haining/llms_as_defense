I got down at Purnea Chowk and took an auto-rickshaw to Hazratganj. The courier office was at Ansal City Centre. From the name of the plaza, it sounded like this would be a posh place, but it was a rather dilapidated structure on inside streets. Luckily, the auto-rickshaw driver knew the location. I picked up the big box and came back to IIM in the same auto-rickshaw.        What's more interesting is my first real glimpse of Lucknow. Some important points:   Lucknow is not very large, it seemed to me. The mentality is also a small-town one, and the pace is very slow. Existence of cycle rickshaws as means of transport illustrates this.  There doesn't seem to be any municipal transport service. Local means of transport are auto-rickshaws, cycle rickshaws, converted tempo-travellers and the larger cars filled to bursting capacity.  On the way to Hazratganj, I came across around three parks which seemed well-maintained and good.  Most of the advertisement hoardings were about establishments in a few areas only - Hazratganj, Aliganj, Shivaji Road, M. M. Malviya Marg, Nishatganj, Indiranagar, etc.  A very large proportion of the hoardings belonged to teaching and coaching insitutes. This included preparatory classes for IIT-JEE and PMT, as well as State board exams. Another very common hoarding message was ' Angrezi bolanaa siikhiye ', by establishments called 'British Insitute of Languages' and 'American Center for Languages'.   I crossed and re-crossed a bridge over the Gomti river. As it flows through the city, it is very narrow, compared to, say, Sabarmati. But it has quite a bit of water. As usual, there are slum settlements on its banks.  Near the Ansal City Centre were several biryani and kebab shops, named ' Dastarkhwan ', ' Naushijaan ', etc.  I also passed by the K. D. Singh 'Babu' stadium, the huge offices of the Geological Survey of India and many colleges.          This was as much as I could get a glimpse of today. Hopefully, I will be able to visit in a more leisurely manner immediately after the mid-term exams get over next weekend.      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In class, we applaud something good (a statement by a professor, a&nbsp;presentation, an announcement from the class representative) by thumping of desks. That naturally reminds one  of the Parliament and other legislative bodies where this is&nbsp;a common practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the comparison ends there. The class is too orderly to be compared to our unruly Parliament. People are not allowed to rush to the well of the class (the stage), everybody listens (or pretends to listen) to the 'speaker', questions are asked politely, Deve Gowda-style sleeping is not appreciated, walk-outs are impossible, late attendance is frowned upon, there is an attendance requirement for each session (80%), there are no Treasury and Opposition benches as there is only one party - that of the students, and of course, many others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two other likenesses of the class to our Parliament is that the representation of women is less than 33% (although it is increasing year by year) :), and video recordings of the class occur occasionally.   \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
