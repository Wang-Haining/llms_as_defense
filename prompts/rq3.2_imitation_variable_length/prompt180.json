Built in 1901, the Makindu Gurudwara is known for providing shelter and food to anyone who happens to drop by, irrespective of religion or nationality. The beautiful building, situated 250 kms east of Nairobi city can be spotted miles away by a 40 meter tall flag mast with flag bearing the Khalsa symbol on it. The Gurudwara complex itself is spread over several acres of land that include a farm, 48 cottages for visitors, a museum and a massive dining hall apart from the Gurudwara's main building and the Persian style archway overlooking it.    After a sumptuous breakfast of Aloo Paranthas and Lassi, I cover my head with one of the white bandanas lying in a basket and enter the gurudwara's main hall. In the sanctum sanctorum, a recitation of the Guru Grahanth Sahib is being performed. I am informed that the recital never stops.. it is carried on endlessly through night and day. The hall is beautifully decorated with pictures of the ten gurus and a unique calmness pervades the entire place.     Later we all sat around the Sardarji in charge of the administation and were told stories about the circumstances under which the Gurudwara was built. It was during the days of British rule in Kenya when the historic railway line was being laid between Mombasa and Nairobi. Several Indian men lost their lives in its making. The Sardarji spoke proudly of the glory of the Gurudwara and of the Sikh religion. He left us with some facts about the Golden Sikh Temple at Amritsar:             The Temple's outer crust is made of solid gold.        50, 000 people eat at the temple everyday.        On special occasions, between 150,000 and 200,000 people eat at the temple everyday.        At all times, the temple is stocked with food supplies of three months.    +      \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
