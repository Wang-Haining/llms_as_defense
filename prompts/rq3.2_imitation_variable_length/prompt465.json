She has been using our phone to call social security.  Yesterday she had a 40 minute phone call and came back for another 20 minutes.    I've seen this lady before. She has crazy hair; I mean, we're talking Don King here. The first time I ever saw her, she came to use our phone to report a crime. She called IPD to report that some lady was selling prescription pharmaceuticals, except it was over in Garland, according to her story. So they told her to call the Garland PD. She did that and spent about thirty minutes trying to explain herself, which involved a lot of speaking very loudly and repeating herself. I thought we should have banned her from the phone before she ever got on, based solely on her smell, but hey, it's not my decision. This last time, she didn't even ask, she pulled over Janis' chair and sat down behind to use our phone, which happened to be behind our counter.

Those brave and dedicated IPL employees that toiled, sweated and cried for the dream of a united Academic/Public library will be scattered like ashes to the wind among the various branches of the Irving Public Library system, broken and allotted like slaves at the auction block under the cruel&nbsp;Alabama sun. &nbsp;Those books which once stood so proudly on our shelves, virtually shouting their vast reservoir of knowledge to our patrons(student and public)will be divvied up like so much pirate treasure booty among the branches of IPL. The children's library, the gleaming jewel in the eye of knowledge that was NLCL, will close, it's lights dimmed forever, no longer able to battle against the ignorance that today runs rampant in the world of the child. Instead what will be left will merely be a shell of its former self, as North Lake college employees take over the many duties they once shared with their comrades-in-arms from IPL, and slave to provide at best 1/2 the service to 1/4 the patrons at 1/8 the level of competence(albeit at 2/3 the price.) Please take a moment to lament the passing of the dream that was NLCL. Alas, poor NLCL, we knew you well...                          Ok here it is:  Not long ago I gave a friend of mine a TexShare card from the library.&nbsp; She then took this TexShare card out of town to a different library that is also on the TexShare system.&nbsp; That library took one look at the card and commented, 'oh Irving will give a card to  anyone , even someone from Ohio...' and basically told her that they wouldn't issue her a card since they knew that Irving's policies were so open.&nbsp; Naturally I was unhappy since they offended my friend, my library, and my dignity...so here is what I did:  1.) I discussed this with Logan, who also agreed it was a travesty of everything right in this world, and I then emailed my story/complaint to him which I will forward to the Assistant Director tomorrow.  2.) I emailed the Texas Library Association and reported that a certain small-town library feels they have the right to be selective on TexShare cards they honor based on their interpretation of the other library's policies.&nbsp; We'll see what comes of that.  3.)&nbsp;I emailed the offending party a certain link that starts with  urlLink www.tub &nbsp;... oh wait, this has gone too far already...          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
