calendar’s first date, time won by default Tasted wine that was sour, bitter as gall is my fate, experiences and memories devour Wasted time in hours, early destines arrive late, expectations grow as towers  Face to face with my reflection, my shadow’s watching my back Back to back with the wall, tomorrow’s neglect is waiting to crack Placed in a generation of growing killers and thieves who believe in impatience Laced my shoes knowing this marathon is from genesis to the end of my existence  Escaped through the eyes of a needle from the jaws of temptation Scraped the skin of lies, released the truth using personification The shape of life is indefinite, unstable like heated gas Feelings explode like dynamites, ignited by experiences in the past  Swimming in my thoughts like fishes in an aquarium Dwelling in my heart like blood, fixed in my mouth like gums It snatches my prayers, infests my mind with fear, it turned me into a coward Crippled my feet, detests my insight like pests, rewind my memory no more looking forward  It exists as fate, I resisted with hate because love was late It fed me with bait, but materials can wait, with no debate it exists as fate                  “Ice on Fire”  Underneath the skin is where it begins, oozes out as blood, cause a global flood Where should I start mopping, platelet dissolve, gushing, no stopping, drowning in a pool of blood, a fool, a pig bathing in mud  Scabs from the scars, crabs in a jar, jello in a barrel, witness of suicidal acts of Jezebel Condensation quenches the thirst of my dehydration, never to be choked by the smoke from the barrel of a gun, never to be stripped of my physical apparel Parallel to heaven, Hades filled with babies, intersection between heaven and hell, innocence stifled by ignorance, fermentation of yeast in my cells All the well runs dry, the tears come when I cry, no doves in my sky, praying meaning what I’m saying, but no reply explores the pinna of a sinner, where my ears dwell Trapped in a cell, a cappella, no music when I sing, no ring on my finger, no medallions, I’m only on of the trillion souls dwelling in hell If I spell the words backwards dog turns to God, representation of loyalty and sacred supremacy, live turns to evil, hatred of human existency, radar remains the same to reveal what the words can’t tell  Lies with numbers put in scientific notation, with quotations from the Bible, Ten Commandments, the doctor recommends the truth If I ask for retribution, I’ll inherit the reputation from the people of my roots, my ancestors pass the torch, I’m the predecessor of their youth Fill the clip of my gun, take a sip of the rum, glance at my image, contemplated murder, but still I’m sober, nothing can make me shoot If the fires still scorch, or the cold wind still chill, infinite inferno or absolute zero shall inherit my skin after I jump without a parachute  If the ices shall burn and the fire shall melt, candles will explain my philosophy Hell extinguished, pieces of Earth turns to fire, the sky is a chimney, if ice shall ever burn with fire that would be the end of humanity                  “Untitled For a Purpose”  Watching my blood flow with the river, they join at the confluence  Splashing against the rocks like waves with a vengeance  Lost in the meadows of my memory, living my life in the past tense  Told the truth while lies blow in the form of cold wind, then condense  As I brainstorm the words pour in the form of rain Thoughts  give birth to ideas without a name My thoughts are flammable similar to propane Ignite it and it explodes in the form raw pain  Listening to the wind with the ears of a mammoth I hear echoes of a pin drop, still soaring to the top Attracted to lights like a moth  My skin feels like silk, my flesh is covered by cloth  I’m an active volcano, the lava is my blood My perception is almost perfect, roses and lilies emerge from a developing bud Smiles flood faces, the sound of waves crashing on the shore is heard in laughter which is softer,  when I cough the phlegm make a heterogeneous mixture with the mud  When in deep thought my mind soar higher than satellites Salvation cannot be bought, my burdens grow out my bones like stalactites  While in the dark bright lights devour my fright, my shadows devoured by trees  White flags of peace, my pants sag way below my knees Nothing can make me believe in rumors I don’t consider most jokes to be humor  I choke the necks of snakes till it breaks Snap the spines of backbiters in three, that’s a felony, a crime It’s all bad intentions locked away in my mind Life is affected by time, heartbeats recorded in seconds Ten minutes without a breath Death sings your dirge with a rhyme, the undertaker keeping records  The spirit leaves the body never to return Mind cremated, heart burned, face dilated, skin covered by ferns The nerves in your body has cease being nervous Your headstone is left untitled for a purpose                  “A Fiery Fate”  A prisoner in the mind, another spontaneous defect of mankind The memories of a blind man dissolved in the sand The miseries of pain conflicted with the brain Making it difficult to stay sane  Can’t maintain the ability to refrain, the rain came when he cried The skies turn red when he felt a pain in the head The shackles broke but he’s ignorant to freedom The manacles of his illiterate conscience hindered his wisdom Addicted to gum chewing his life away  Predicted his outcome with intuition A predilection of the righteous opposition  An atheist baptized in the shadows of death He followed and capsized to drown in his own sweat His breath was seized by the incarnation of death Pleased by his self sacrifice, received by hell because of suicide  Phlegmatic with no pride, married to the devil’s bride Divorced the levels of humanity  Rewarded with a sanctuary of fire An ever-blaze of haze with a nonexistence of hours and days  No burning to ashes, water and thirst never matches In a world where he elevated  The sun generated caloric calamity with a density that penetrated then burst The concentrated flames dispersed throughout his fiery spirit and parched His punishment couldn’t have been worse                  “Experience’s Uniformity”   Burdens crawling in my skin like insects, my veins are like a garden of vines The river Jordan has dried, my thirst is in drought, my bones harden with time My vision was stolen by bats, now the daylight is blacker than asphalt in the night Nocturnal shadows offer insomnia, I refused they diffused, haunted, I was daunted by fright  Emeralds glow from my eyes, my fear was bald, and bravery conquered the grave Spiritual minerals are minimal, I tried but the sweat dried, stepping into the soles of a slave Greed within cause internal bleeding, infests the mind like a disease Blisters even when it whispers, crystal tears break into pieces, as broken promises increase  Stitches in my scars, cut from a sharp edge, bleeding stars shine crimson, but my heart still beats Sleeping under the bed, six feet when I’m dead, but instead my body is cremated by heat Making love with the opposite sex as cumulating sins repeat Maturation form gums to teeth, introduction with life another person I meet Friendships and companionships converted in adversaries, as envy deletes  But even through the fire my heart still beats I’m prepared, ready for whatever; I’m the same human being, the same person from head to feet          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core
