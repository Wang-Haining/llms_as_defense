This is sooo wrong on so many levels, I scarecly know where to begin.  1. Originally, the Baptists [writ large] were the staunchest adherents to strict separation of church and state. The church was not to be about 'earthly' matters but to remain focused on the Kingdom of God. Any proposed mixture of the two was seen at best as problematic, at worst, literally the work of the devil.  2. The SBC has not be a font of Christian brotherhood. While their antipathy towards Muslims is well documented, they've not exactly been too welcoming of Roman Catholics. Hence, one would think they'd be a bit put off by Bush's papal trip only 2 weeks ago.  3. Fundamentalist Baptists were the most stringent proponents of separatism--Many did not even vote until the 1970s.  While I was raised in the American Baptist Convention, the basic tenet of separatism was very strong. In fact, as a HS student, I objected to reciting the Pledge of Alliegence, largely on religious grounds. I objected to the 'Under God' phrase. Since humans cannot deign to know the mind of God, we can't make that claim. To do so, would invite God's wrath upon our collective hubris.  I can see that opinion would not gain favor with our current court system.    urlLink The New York Times > Washington > Campaign 2004 > Strategy: Bush Allies Till Fertile Soil, Among Baptists, for Votes                      From the Washington Post  urlLink Bush Rallies Faithful in Keystone State (washingtonpost.com)   I spent the past weekend in PA visiting friends and relatives. I'm from the North-Central region, which has been solidly Republican since the Civil War.  That said, I was SHOCKED by the number of life-long Republicans who are GIVING money and their votes to Kerry. For example, one elderly gentleman, whom I have known literarlly for my entire life and with whom I have sparred over politics, is a former county District Attorney and life-long GOP activist. He has even attended the GOP convention as a delegate (1964).  However, he's supporting Kerry, both with his vote and $$. My jaw literally dropped in shock. He also hoped that Kerry would pick Edwards as his running mate (we chatted on Sunday, July 4th).   Once I gathered my wits, I asked him, 'why?'  His reponse: 'Because George Bush and his administration are lying bastards. They, as well Tom DeLay and Pat Robertson,  don't represent me or my values.'  His wife quickly intejected that she's been contemplating switching parties because she is SO disgusted.  I can't tell you how shocked I am by this. It's sort of like being half-awake at 5 AM, stumbling towards the refridgerator for some breakfast and finding Fidel Castro sitting there (thanks to Molly Ivins). I'm just absolutely flumuxed by this development. This gentleman has worked for the GOP in various capacities for almost 50 years. He's a regular church go-er, professional, white, solidly upper-middle class. And utterly HOSTILE towards the Bush White House.  Since the Pravda on the Potomac doesn't interview REAL people, I believe they're missing a major story.                     From the NY Times...   Here's the backgrounder on this issue. Back in the 1980s, the Reagan administration, then Bush administration systematically CUT OFF black farmers from Agricultural subsidies that they were legally entitled to, while at the same time funded larger, white-owned and controlled, agricultural coroporations (Think con-agra, monsanto, etc).   I remember seeing an interview with the head of the program during this time. He's was just increadibly bigoted (BTW: My dissertation was on the Reagan administration--they used to place the most bigoted and numbed headed racists in the domestic agencies).  Anyway, the results for black farmers&nbsp;were devastating...   The farmers filed a class-action&nbsp;suit and finally reached a settlement with USDA in the mid-1990s.  And now, the current Bush administration is&nbsp;denying these same farmers (9 out of 10) the settlement money that they are legally entitled to.  It's evil, evil, evil crap.    urlLink The New York Times > Washington > Black Farmers Accuse Agriculture Dept. of Failing to Live Up to Racial Bias Settlement                       Today's Washington Post has an article that examines young people and rural poverty.   Briefly, while the percentage of urban poor is 16%, for the rural poor it's over 20%. Furthermore, poor rural children have less access to medical care, dental care, and a host of social services, governmental and non-profit.  This is consistent with what I've been seeing in my home town, which is located in Northern PA, in the foothills of Appalachia.   I've seen families devasted by the lack of health insurance, particularly when a child is diagnosed with cancer. The local people will do their best for the family running all manner of fundraisers, but as they saying goes, 'You can't get blood from a stone.'  Needless to say, the area leads the nation in per-capita military enlistments. With the military, a person gets a regular salary, regular health and dental care (the quality is questionable, but something is generally better than nothing), and somewhat decent housing. Of course, you do run the rise of going to Iraq. But the benefits are more than what many of these kids have ever seen.  Go read and learn.   urlLink Poverty Tightens Grip On Mississippi Delta (washingtonpost.com)                      Robert Scheer of the LA Times has a dandy editorial on W's and the GOP's use of homophiba during this election year. A brief snip:  '...still smarting from the defeat in the Senate of a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriages, the president has returned to playing the God-and-patriotism card heavily — always implying that the GOP is the party for 'real' Americans. During his Midwest swing, he promised to protect those homeland values from the latest big threats: gays who marry and Hollywood entertainers who support Democrats. Bush did not quite equate gay marriages with Al Qaeda, as Pennsylvania Republican Sen. Rick Santorum did: 'Isn't that the ultimate homeland security — standing up and defending marriage?' Bush just held that gay marriages would destroy 'the most fundamental institution of civilization.'   **** Yup, W is using the us vs them electoral strategy. I really hope it bites him HARD. Perhaps like father like son...  urlLink Homophobia and Apple Pie                      The following is from the Toronto Sun  Here's a fast snip.  The era of strategic deception  Sun, July 18, 2004   The era of strategic deception  By Eric Margolis -- Contributing Foreign Editor  HAVING PRESIDED over the two worst intelligence disasters since Pearl Harbor -- 9/11 and the misbegotten invasion of Iraq -- the Bush Administration and its apologists are now whining, 'Okay, we were wrong about Iraq's weapons and supposed threat, but so was everybody else. Besides, it was all the CIA's fault.'   No way. The Iraq weapons fiasco was absolutely not caused by an 'intelligence failure,' as the White House and the recent Senate whitewash claim.   U.S. national security and CIA were corrupted and blinded by extremist ideology, cowardice, and careerism.      Nor was everyone wrong about Iraq.   Scores of Mideast professionals, this writer included, insisted from Day 1 that Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction, posed no threat to the U.S., and had no link to al-Qaida   urlLink Toronto Sun Columnist: Eric Margolis - The era of strategic deception                      I confess to a major character flaw.   Normally, I cheer for the underdog, but I've been a hardboiled Yankee fan forever. Given my politics, I should be cheering for the hopeless Cubs, but I digress. So, I was thrilled when the hometown crowd BOOed Darth Vader...er...Dick Cheney last night.   While Bush-Cheney was never popular in Manahatten (except, perhaps in isolated sections of the Financial District), they've obviously lost the Bronx as well.  From AMERICAblog   Cheney just got booed at the Yankees game    (I was thinking of retitling this: 'Yankee fans tell Cheney 'go fuck yourself.'')  I just got a live phone-in from the Yankees vs. Boston game in NYC taking place right now. Dick Cheney just got booed by the crowd!   Even as my friend Michael called me from his seats at the game, God Bless America was still playing in the background. During the 7th inning stretch at Yankees Stadium, they play God Bless America and show on the big screen pictures of anyone famous who's in the audience that night. Dick Cheney is apparently in the audience, and as soon as his face went up, the entire crowd started booing! As my friend Michael tells it, this is the blue-collar Bronx we're talking about, and Cheney is still getting booed - not a good sign for the Bush-Cheney ticket. As soon as the camera guys realized Cheney was getting booed, they quickly switched the picture on the screen to someone else.  Michael's read of the situation, as a die-hard Yankees fan: The election is over.          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
