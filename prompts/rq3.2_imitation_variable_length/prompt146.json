Marathon is the first title of a serie of 3 chapters (Marathon,  Durandal  and  Infinity ).  So basically, Marathon is  Bungie 's early attempt to Fps (before  Halo ). If you want a feel of what Bungie did before the  xbox  hit blockbuster, now is the time.  What i propose here is completely legal, the build is out of  Source Forge  and come with the free license and stuff so you won't get into any problems. This game was a  Mac  game, so it may not run perfectly on your pc.  Here are the files you need in order to start playing Aleph One - Marathon.   -Marathon Source code-  http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/marathon/AlephOne-Windows-20040417.zip?download  -Aleph One's Marathon Port-  http://orbitalarm.bungie.org/downloads/alephone.html    ---Details on how to install---  Windows : Just download both zip files and extract them. Just copy Marathon file into Alephone file and go in marathon, just click the icon. Important : Windows user download the Special Windows Version of Aleph one on the website.  Mac Os 9 : Same thing, but you also need the latest version of SDL library (1.2 if possible) extracted in the alephone directory. ---   Understand that i cannot provide support for the Mac users, your on your own. I have been able to make it work easily on Windows, so should you.  If you have questions about the game that i cannot answer, try on bungie.net                   urlLink        I found this article by pure mistake on google while searching for a model of an inverted knee robot. This article is named My Search for the Holy Grail of immortality. Writed by Emeagwali in 2003. Trough the basic of a 'Prediction of the future'. Emeagwali explain a bit on how will technology works in 50-60-90-100 years in the future. Some of the stuff he says appear to makes sense, some of it does'nt. Something striked me tought.   As Emeagwali describe that Computers and the internet can only be viewed from a physical point of view (The internet is 10,000 kms of fiber ropes that interconnect all computers in order to facilitate Human communication). He put emphasys on the fact that computers, in the future, interlinked with the net, will form a kind of Brain. Considering the fact that in 100 plus years, computer will be a lot more faster, everything will work extremely fast. Also one thing to be considered is the electronic implants.   'In 300 years, I believe that the Internet will remain a spherical network as large as the whole world. However, because it could be a zillion times more powerful, faster, and more intelligent, I believe that in 300 years the Internet will evolve into a SuperBrain as large as the whole world.'    this sums it up a bit. There is more.   'Without realizing what we are doing, we are determined to redesign ourselves. Our compelling urge to redesign ourselves is deep-seated and will remain so. We have embarked on a self-propelled evolution in which we are both the creator and the created.   Already, we have imbedded our consciousness and intelligence into computers. Now that we have implanted our intelligence into computers, we are now figuring out how to imbed our computers into our brain. That is, how to imbed inanimate intelligence into animate ones.'   This is were it gets completely logical, in the end, we survived since pre-historic age as a team.Still today, everyone is linked in society.   He explain that at some part, everyone will be linked as 1 Brain.   'Unification implies that we will become one people. With one voice. One will. One soul. And one culture. '   'We will understand that we are not human beings that exist separately from other beings. Instead, we may come to believe that we are small and separate beings that exist within a Super Being.'    'I began by studying the interconnectedness between millions of computers configured around the Earth. I learned that interconnected computers do emulate one supercomputer. I then inferred that we could use that knowledge as a metaphor for living entities, which we also know, are interconnected.   Therefore, I have inferred that interconnected animals and plants do emulate one Super Being.'    Ok it's a bit long, but i suggest you have a read.  http://emeagwali.com/speeches/immortality/my-search-for-the-holy-grail-of-immortality.html  Regards,  Zephyr                       urlLink        School just finished, last test was the simulado, a  5-questions-for-each-subject test . I went with  Helder  to the  Nitro Lan House  (a new place near the school). I wanted to install  Pandoras Tomorrow  but computers were all full, so we waited for 15 minutes. When we got computers, noticed there was no cd on mine, so i just played  Command & Conquer Generals . Slow computer, took 10 minutes to load the first map, anyway the game was ugly. After that i booted  Cs , it was the wrong version and it jammed, got out of there and met my mother in the street, we went with 2 of my brothers to a restaurant. Went back home and here i am!   Yeah, so 7 days before  Canada , can't wait to be there. Also, we are moving soon!   Made up my mind and i will buy  Homeworld II  if i have the chance in Canada, it's top innovation and deserve to be played a lot.   Well, i'll probably update a bit later, just wanted to cover the 3-days i did'nt.   Oh and if you see no update, it may be because we will have our internet connexion disconnected by  Telefonica , since we are moving and stuff. So basically, if it happens, expect the next update the 9th in the afternoon.  Regards,  Zephyr                     Add a talk with a friend from canada about what i planned to do in the future. It kinda resonate in my head, only one answer : nothing. Not only have i no idea, but also i feel like nothing is the answer. Everyone as a dream, after thinking about it,i have none. I see life as something without meaning. In the end, you die and your forgotten. What is the meaning of existence?   It's true i spend all my time on my pc, but i don't feel like anything else is important anymore... It as been like that for a few years now. What happened? I remember i used to like gym classes, had fun doing maths, i already loved school. Why is it i hate all those things now? What changed?   It's one of those times where you feel broken and hopeless. I feel like that too often is seems. Wishing you were someone else, that things did'nt turn out the way they turned. I really can't understand. I just feel misplaced and in the wrong direction. I wonder how everyone manage to go on with their lives without these interrogations. Everyone is so sure of themselves, looks like i missed a complet chapter of the book of life.   July again, it was july last year, i tought it would be my escape door. In fact it was just a new cell. I tough all my problems and toughts would vanish, but they did'nt. they took hold of me even harder. May this July be more meaningful for my existence...   Wow, i feel like a writer! Well, Bruno should be done with the downloads by now, so let's play some soldat!  Regards,  Zephyr                   urlLink        I found those covers on the net. I frequently play  The Ninjawarriors  on  Snes . I also never understanded why there was 2 versions of it released on the same system with different names, one named The Ninjawarriors and another named  The Ninjawarriors Again . After reading a bit on the subject, it seems there was a  amiga  game named The Ninjawarriors, so the snes version is simply a remake. I hope i get the chance of playing the amiga version, it looks really cool.   Downloaded  America's Army  ( a file of 745mo). It's nice ,but it does'nt really have that special feeling i was expecting out of it. I simply uninstalled, i believe  Counter-Strike  (even if boring as hell) as a little more originality to it.   Had a argue with my parents about study and stuff. I will study at least 1 hour each day, i have to do it, even tought i really don't have the will for it.   I spoke a bit with  Renata Gazini  ( Ana Eliza 's friend!). She would like to have the photos we took on  Helder 's camera, and as well chat on  msn . I gave her my  Google  mail and my msn, altought she did not log on today (guess she only enter on weekends like all the rest here).   Oh well, i'm tired and i have nothing special to do, so better go sleeping early!
