I was sooooooooo homesick for living in Ch'town and being a 'hop in the car' away from visiting my friends...Not a big deal, it's that time of the month but I was one sad chicken last night. All the talk yesterday about how I was looking forward to having a romantic night with Ethan on Friday had me missing him in a HUGE way yesterday.  I tried him in the morning, he was asleep...tried him in the evening he was at work...tried him even later...he wasn't home... in the midst of all this, I watched 50 First Dates which made me think of him and then also started reading my new book which was girly and made me laugh but also a bit sappy.  All in all, I missed my boyfriend and didn't get the opportunity to talk to him...Sometimes I really hate living in Scummerside.  I like my job and I have a great arrangement with Joanne and Jerry but I don't know...I still feel confined sometimes...Ch'town isn't that far away but fuck,...anyways...as you can tell, I'm still in a 'mood' today...I'll post again when I'm in a more positive frame of mind                  Morning y'all...note I didn't say 'good morning'...what's so good about it?  I'm at work...I'm tired...and slightly hungover...  I had a kickass Canada Day yesterday...how about you folks?  I was up at 'em early yesterday morning...after my post yesterday, I finished cleaning and then vegged by the pool for about four hours.  I floated on the floaties in the pool, I swam and played with the beach ball with my niece, I sat and drank beer on the patio with my sister it was fun.  About four, I showered and got ready to head to ch'town.  I arrived at Ethan's to find him, his roommate, and other friends drinking beer on the porch...I grabbed my cooler of beer and there was a collective cheer.  I am proud to say that yesterday I successfully paced myself drinking.  I was a happy, talkative, tipsy girl...but once I get to that point the drinks usually go down faster and then I'm hammered...not yesterday...I succeeded in pacing myself!  yeah for me!  Ethan, Donovan, and I went to Dr. Dave's for BBQ last night.  Sheldon and Marina were there as well.  Ethan and I went down to Dylan's for the fireworks and the three of us went to Baba's for Port Citizen.  I saw Brodie Read for the first time since he got home this summer...he looks fabulous as ever.  Leah Quimby was home as well.   Deeder:  Leah says 'hello' and 'congratulations'....I also ran into Dale Gaudet who passes on his heartfelt congratulations...he started talking about you guys in highschool, and then how happy he felt to have all us girls to hang out with at the dorm back in first year...he was almost a little misty-eyed...it was cute...also congrats from Heather Panton.. Ames:  Leah says 'hello' as well and that she wished she could have seen you while she was home and that she misses you like crazy.  I told her about the burlesque show this weekend and that you were performing as Lulu Sassamafrass...she absolutely loved that you were doing that!!!  So yes, left Baba's around 12ish...got pizza...Ethan had a slight altercation with some redneck idiot that started going on about 'fucking skateboards' and tried to take his skateboard...that got smoothed over quickly and we went home where I promptly passed out...  Now I'm at work...but only till lunch, then I'm going to fill the propane tank for the BBQ and nap by the pool.  Can't wait for Sunday...it's going to be 21 and no rain!!!!  Oh, and Sam Roberts tonight...I LOVE HIM!!!!!!                  It's gonna be a scorcher!  It's 9:30 a.m.....I plan to write this post, get dressed, go for a walk, and be poolside by 11:30...yippee!  I think Julie and Ruth are coming by today.  That should be fun.  Wish the rest of my girls could be here.      I just had a really sweet e-mail from Dave, in Calgary.  I had an e-mail from him out of the blue not too long ago...a four-liner asking how I was doing and saying that his new girlfriend was 'great.'  I got the impression that he was only e-mailing me to let me know that he had a girlfriend.  We haven't talked in months; I kinda ended that one night when he kept making comments that I wasn't serious about Ethan, that he knew if there was a way we could be together that I would do it.  I told him that I cared about Ethan and didn't appreciate his comments.  Things kinda died off from there.  Anywho, I e-mailed him back saying 'wow, this girl must be pretty special if you're actually mentioning her to me...'  Turns out they've been together six months...she's a total sweetheart, etc.  Blechh!!!  No, not really...just a slight twinge of jealousy.  BUT since he has a girlfriend now and, for the time being, I still have Ethan...we've been able to e-mail back and forth once or twice a week about normal things, which is nice... the thing with Dave is he's the guy that I would say listened to me the most out of any guy I've ever been linked too.  He knows everything about me and it's so nice to hear him ask about all my girls, Nadine's wedding, my Dad's health, etc. because he's interested and not because he feels those are the right questions to ask.      Anywho, that's my blurb of the day...take care                    Hi all!  Work is busy today!  I just looked at the clock and it's 11:20...I've been working steady since I got in this morning.  It's nice to have the day off on Friday but it kinda sucks fitting 5 days of work into 4.  After being bummed about not talking to Ethan the other night, I ended up talking to him like 3 times yesterday plus one REALLY cute voicemail from him on my cell phone as well.  He's so cute!  Tonight they're having a 'hardcore BBQ' at there place.  Four bands...Buried Inside (from Ottawa), Doctor Unk, Cheers to Beers, Gruesome Feast and another band Poison.  I've been to the last two shows at their place.  The turnout is pretty amazing.  They do it all-ages, no alcohol allowed, and even though the kids are thrashing around like crazy their respectful at the same time.  Besides the bands, their BBQing veggie burgers and dogs, having salad etc.  I've chosen not to attend though, I'm opting for a night with my Ruby Tuesday.  I'll see Ethan tomorrow night and all day Friday!!!!  So yes, tonight I'm hanging with Ruth...we may veg and watch a movie, or possibly head into the Heritage Pub for trivia to meet up with some of the other nurses she works with. My cash flow is pretty limited so I'm hoping just to hang and watch a movie.  Anyways, my life is unexciting...I don't know why I'm continuing to ramble.  Hope y'all having a great day.                     The pendulum of the mind alternates between sense and nonsense, not between right and wrong.    I read that quote today and it struck a chord so I thought I would post it.   New look for my blog today. I went to do a post and I just didn't feel like writing on a green screen. I didn't sleep well last night and I woke up with a headache...I'm feeling pretty pissy today. This template is called 'dark dots'...I'm feeling a bit dark today so I thought it would suffice.   Today, I could have totally used a mental health day rather then coming into work. I think I could have laid in bed all day today. Unfortunately, there is no such thing as a mental health day in the perfect Parnham residence... that being said, something is not right in the world of Cricki...Did I mention I'm how excited I am to be going to Halifax next weekend. That right there might do the trick! I need to get off this Island...aaaaaarrrrrgggghhhh!   Anyways, it appears that this morning my 'pendulum' is swinging more to the nonsense side of things...I'll quit my rambling and start my work.    xxxooo                      I'M BAAACK!  Well the last two days were fun!  Beautiful, sunny days and I got to be outside for both of them.  Although we only did the Sidewalk Sales for six hours each day, it was tiring.  Tuesday night I had an hour nap when I got home.  Last night, I had supper, went to downstairs to start laundry about 6:45, was asleep at about seven and didn't wake up until 3:30 this morning and I successfully went back to sleep and slept until 7:15.  I feel rested today, I guess.  I'm torn about whether to take tomorrow off or not.  Ethan has today and tomorrow off...sort of.  They're shorthanded at work so today and tomorrow he has to go in for a few hours in the morning.  Anywho, I wanted to possibly pack the cooler with some beer and snacks and go to Blooming Point for the day...I mentioned it last night but he's always in a dither now.  His job is OK but he doesn't love it and he's working alot of hours so he's always cranky, which doesn't go over well with me since I'm in a different town not knowing what's going on.  I ended up just saying that I would talk to him later.  I don't know, I may take tomorrow off and go to the freakin' beach myself with some beer.  Anyways, I've got work to catch up on since I haven't been here for the past few days.  Later         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
