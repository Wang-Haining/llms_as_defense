After i took my bath, i sat on the bed, covered my legs with my wonderful thermal blanket and read my booK while enjoying the air con. How i wish i didnt have to go to work today, especially since it is statemt week which means.. that a lot of ppl will call to check on their transactions.  Anyway it is already 4.30pm.. wOohOo 1 1/2 hrs to go. Hrmph... shd i meet Fendy or not? Met him yesterday and the days before. Im scared if my dad flare up again. Cheh.. but if i go home also ok. There is plenty of food.. i save money.. and i can use the PC.   Dang.. why do i bloody have to talk abt food. I am so bloated and fat. SHIT.. i think i better do something abt it?  What is the best way to lose weight? Hrmpph.. should i..  1) Start going to the GYM again. With who? 2) Take up kick boxing. Dont know where and dont know if i have the time. 3) Stop eating chox and ice-cream. And stop being happy? 3) Go on a diet of mantou bread. It works the last time. 4) Try 'Thin & Slim Naturally' from GNC. 5) Continue on HerbXXXXX and suffer from life-is-bitter-throat-is-even-more-bitter syndrome. 6) Start taking XenadXXXX again and start having vertigo again. 7) Stop eating altogether and disappear from this planet. 8) Survive on cabbage soups and suffer from constant flatulence. 9) Feast on salads like cows do. I look like one anyway, with big tits and big rear! Haha. 10) Quit my job and ground myself at home without eating. That is possible, as when i extracted my wisdom teeth, i didnt eat for 4 days and lose 5 bloody KG.   Hrmph.. so what do u reckonn i shd do?   COUNTDOWN TO HOME -- 1HR 15MINs...                                 Hrmphh.. it is Monday already? I dont feel rested. *siGh*.. anyWay, yesterday me and fenDy didnt go to the beacH but we went to TampiNes. His friends went to watch spiDeY 2 but we didnt. Instead we went to starbucKs and manage to get comfy on the sofas. But it was darn freeZing. Cheh.. esp since we were telling each other gHost stories.. hehe. And we were drinking the strawberries and cream frapuccinO.. so wonderful.. taste like strawberries and cream ice creaM. YummY! Aft that we walked ard and i boughT a earPhoNe. My darLing Fendy help read the speCs and decide which one i shouLd buy! That is the advantage of getting an audio engineer in-training bf. Hehe! c',)  This morning i was listening to the The BeatLes on the way to work. LoveLy.. hopefuLLy the rest of the daY is lovely too. 'All You Need is Love' keeps playing on my mind... hrmphh.. later i shd listen to 'Across the Universe' too but the Rufus W's version!   OOoh btw.. you shd watch 'I am Sam' if you are big Beatles fan.. All the songs are The Beatle's song but sung by Rufus W. Simply wonderful. Actually, you shd watch the movie, even if you dont love the Beatles. It is so moving. I watched it thrice and i cried. Even Fendy cries. c',)               \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
