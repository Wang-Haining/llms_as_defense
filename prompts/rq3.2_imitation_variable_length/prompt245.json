One really important person was missing but ......   anyways, ever notice how a simple conversation with the right person can cheer you up, well, it works for me ... and has taken me so far through this week. Think i need a daily dose!!   just finished Paulo Coelho's  ' Valkyirie '  , he is really one of the more powerful writers of our time, highly recommended.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
