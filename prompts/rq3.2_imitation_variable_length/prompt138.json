I like to leave the link at the top there so everyone can use it. Aren't I kind? (Entirely rhetorical. Don't answer.)  Rob told me to blog. So I am.  Look! Blog! Isn't that great?  What's going on then? Tomorrow, I have an 'Industry Day', where I get to spend the whole day in school doing... Hell, I don't even know what it's meant to be. What a load of shit. What's that Mr. Mathieson? I just suffered the most boring week of my 6th form life and now you're telling me I have to do even more shit? Thanks a fucking lot.  What else? I'm bored. I had a bacon sandwich earlier on. I liked it.  What else? I had some skittles earlier too. They were also nice.  What else? Somebody phoned me lots of times. And my house too. If you wish, I will tell you the number and you can see if you know who it is. It is very disturbing.  What else? I have induction training at Waitrose on friday. That should be fun. Once I start, I will be on Â£3.90 an hour, thursday and friday nights. Plus, if I do overtime I get more money. PLUS, if I work on sundays I get 'time-and-a-half', meaning I get all the money I earn that day plus half again, in case you didn't know.  Anything else? No? Good. That's quite long enough. Congratulations for surviving my post. I like them long, as you can tell.                                 I prodded Dave! ^.^ right in the arm!! thats the most exciting thing I did all day as I had to work...OH DEAR GOD! I really was not made to earn a living. I work in the new Freezeways shop in Fore St. I have to work on my own with a bunch of old people who want cheap frozen goods. gah! It was so boring and so hot and I had to tidy and do boring, boring things. I love to rant! Also, my boss is a mixture of David Brent and Wallace from Wallace and Gromit. It cracks me up! so anyway life is boring at the moment. My mobile phone got stolen :-( I can't remember if I told you guys before but I'm SOOOOO annoyed!!! Damn Saltash Community school bastards. I cried - and I NEVER cry! Sorry I'm blabbing, but, shush. There are some really good films coming out which I must see at some point - Shrek 2, Garfield the movie (he rocks ok!!), Spiderman 2 (better be better than the first) and Thunderbirds the movie (come on, you can't say your not a little tempted?) Oh and one final point. I HATE THE BLACK EYED PEAS!!!! ARRRGRRHHGHHHHH! Au revoir                                 Okay, I'm going to double post (and maybe triple post because I have cool photos!) The reason? I need to show off about my recent holiday to both Egypt and Cyprus and ask about Dave and Rob smelling each other? My holiday was ammmaaazing! We went to Egypt on a cruise firstly, then we spent a day in Egypt, visited 3 pyramids, The Sphinx, The Egyptian Museum and some real live(?) Mummies. Then we spent the rest week and a half causing chaos in Cyprus (we = me and Kirsten). In Egypt I got my first wedding proposal. It wasn't exactly what I was expecting but jus as I was happily buying some papyrus some boring Egyptian dude came up to me like a schoolgirl and asked if I wanted to be his friends wife. When I said no he asked if I would wave at him, or marry his other friend. It was oh so romantic...damn Egyptians and they're vast amount of wives!! I also rode a camel (life dream succeeded...), went paragliding and snorkelling. In fact, I did loads. This meant no time for tanning (well, thats my excuse). Oh oh and we got beaten up by young german kids who thought it'd be funny to pull at our bikini strings. It really wasn't funny. Oh God...(typical Germans!) Anyway, I don't care if this is really long because I've been blog-deprived for three  WHOLE  weeks! So now I'm back I'm going to learn to play the guitar and go bodyboarding as much as possible :-D Anyway, I'll shush and post photos because I'm silly like that. Oh, and going on holiday means I must be forgotten? I'd like an ode (maybe a shorter one, we don't have many private jokes :-( ) Oh and decision time should I take either politics or history for A Levels?                \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
