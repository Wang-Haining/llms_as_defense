I didn't get any work done - I really didn't get much of anything done. Went to the inlaws for dinner last night, that was probably the most productive part of my day LOL I wrote myself a daily checklist so I can remember to take my vitamins and supplements. Taking the vitamin B/zinc (you need zinc to absorb vitamin B properly) really helps with those 'blah' days and I have been forgetting to take it every day, twice a day like I should be. Losing weight is a neverending battle and it is not going well to say the least - no matter what I do or what I eat I cannot lose weight and its really been very frustrating. Brian and I were talking about picking 3 days a week to go and walk the nature trails with the kids for a bit of extra excercise for everyone. I think we will start that this week (if it stops raining!) Today it's back to work, already started for the day and I'm taking a quick blog break here then back to it again.  Also have a few things that need to get put away that kind of just got tossed in the 'don't know what to do with this pile' when we unpacked and work on shopping lists of things we need both grocery and household in general.  I've been trying to squeeze in some stitching time every day again like I used to. Yesterday and the day before I didn't really get to but most of the week I fit it in.  Today is a rainy dreary day and it looks like it's going to be like this most of the week - blah! No trips to the playground this week.  Better get my tooshie back to work....              \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
