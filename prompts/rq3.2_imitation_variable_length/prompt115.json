  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic:\n\n           alot of thoughts came to my mind on the way back home. listening to jay chou's 'An jing' on repeat while i am driving. Yep, just that one song. I dun know the real reason why i am listening to that song so much. It's like... it puts me into a solemn mood. i believe it's a sad song yah... but somehow i feel calm about it.. it's like i actually enjoying dwelling in that sort of mood. it's like slipping into a comfort zone and not wanting to get out of it. I feel like i'm shutting myself beneath in the shell (i.e car) and live in my world. At the same time, i began to ask myself... why didn't i have more frens in uni? i do know ppl yet they aren't exactly frens... more like uni-mates. conversation topic resolves around school and that's pretty much about it. Sometimes i wish there are more to it but it's not easy to build up a frenship eh. Considering the fact that we only see each other 2-3 times a week. I can't envy some of them whom know loads of ppl, from different nationalities, different culture. It's so ironic, i mean, the thing about me coming to Oz was to get to know more ppl... yet somehow, i dun see it happening. Maybe it's me that's not putting the efforts in getting to know ppl or i can simply blame it on fate. *HA!* It's so farking ironic eh that here i am talking abt me enjoying the time being alone, feeling depressed and complaining about not enuff frens.   I caught Last samurai last nite. I thoroughly enjoyed it even tho it was rather predictable. It made me forgot abt my crappy lab test which i did in the afternoon. shan't talk about that. There were loads of ppl at the theatre and i bumped into this gal whom i think i've seen that day at the post office. I wasn't exactly sure but i have a feeling she is. i was looking at her for a while and perhaps, too long... coz she 'caught' me looking at her. oops. Well, that was about all which was interesting. Then it was time for home.   my hopes of getting PR here in Oz seems to be fading. doesn't look like it's gonna work out since a lot of factors are against me. Sigh. I realllly wanna stay here for a few years. i do not want it to become a history where i can only look back. i want it to be present. i.e me, staying here. i am dreading the day my visa expires... the image of me packing up, with my airtix, all ready to go home is rather disturbing. I mean, not that i ignoring my home or folks back in SG but somehow there are so much more to offer here and i want to experience it all before i m ready to go back.                         dun know why but somehow or rather.... i still dun feel right about the whole thing. maybe i am just being paranoid, my thoughts are churning much more than i can handle them. different scenarios replaying in my head and they aren't pretty pictures i tell u. Sigh...how i wish things didn't turn out this way but i know it's beyond my grasp and control. Nature took its course and things took a life of its own. what can i say? it's not exactly what i expect but then again, you can't have the best of both worlds. one hand, i am glad that puzzle seems to make more sense....but on the other hand, it doesn't necessarily makes me feel better or at ease. i really hate this feeling and i wish it will go away but somehow it doesn't. It's sticking onto me like a leeching, sucking every inch of life in me. Maybe i should just fuck it all and hope for the best? nah....i know i won't feel totally happy at all. sigh. or have i reach a stage where i can't bear to give it all up and i just want to posssess them, all for myself. seems rather selfish huh? oh well, all humans are selfish by nature. Every man for himself. it's only how much of a degree they are that makes the difference.   i guess when u have a gf that gets along so damn well with all guys, u really can't help but feel this way eh.                       i am feeling a mix of emotions as my dateline for my assignment approaches... it's tomorrow anyway. And i have yet complete 1 final task.... out of 6 fucking tasks... it took me almost a friggin month to reach where i am but it's not good enough. It is seriously pissing when things do not get done... So fucking frustrating. You spent shite load of time, reading, studying, doing the exercises, yet the output is not exactly as productive as you thought. This is shite. It is also a surprising fact that i am also catching the movies tonite... boy, talk about shooting myself on the foot.   I dun know... i was having this short chat with a fellow blogger yesterday and somehow what surprised me was when she mentioned a statment which i thought was uncalled for. she said, 'well, problems come and go, unlike you *.' I was surprised...i am like, 'why do u have to compare yrself with me? does it make you feel better this way by putting someone down? i didn't really agree with what she said so i asked her what made her feel this way, she said, 'Oh, from my senses and what * agrees too.' Oh yeah. so together with another fellow blogger, both of u you feel the same way about me. Well, from what she implies, 'from her senses' i supposed she form her opinion and impression of me through all the conversations we had. and maybe she was a bad day yesterday therefore, the conversation was a tad bumpy... it didn't flow well at all. I mean she told me she hardly visit my site coz i am writing the same old stuff everytime she visits... whereas she has too much to write... well, so be it then... why the comparisions again? i feel that she's trying to be someone who's icy and almighty.. the kind of image she wanna potray is similar to the gal, Julia Stilts in '10 things i hate about you'. She doesn't give a damn about anything whatsoever and being hard to get and stuff, it's like trying to be a feminist with an attitude... I mean why all the dramatic persona? even her blog, she is putting words like ,' in my icy tone'.... and the most prominent indication has to be her title of the blog... but of course, i ain't gonna mention it here. Well, therefore, i made it a point to be a pain as well in my replies with her. I was adopting the same tone of response as her..very curt and blunt. trying to be 'almighty' myself. I really didn't like our conversation at all... In a way it is sad becoz i always thought she can be a really nice friend but i guess...people comes and go and especially with the internet.. to lose a friend is as easy as erasing the words from yr notebook... once it's gone, it's gone... you write it over with something else.   Well, enough of the bitching here... after much cooler thoughts and calmer sense of mind, i figure that she might be having a bad day that's all and it's alrite if she think of me this way. To each is own. Hopefully, the next time round, she'll be having a better day.                       I dun know where my future lies.... i'm wondering should i stay here in OZ get my PR or to chase my dream of getting into one of the airlines back home? sigh. both have so much to offer. My good fren has already given up hope of trying in SG and he told me that he would very much head to down under and try his luck. He was saying i have a good opportunity of trying my luck in Oz since i am already pursuing my studies here. This is not an easy decision to make. So much so that sometimes i dun know what i want anymore. Was looking thru some pilot training brochures and was very much tempted with the course. If only i have an extra 4.5K... i can easily get a Private license which i am sure will no doubt boost my chance. It's like a dream that's forever hanging in the air and i am having difficulty reaching it. I was thinking about my fren who's currently in France.... on his way to becoming a fighter pilot. Life is certainly unfair. And another of my Indian fren who got thru the interview with SQ and in the process of signing the contract. I'm not being sour grapes here. I just can't figure out why is it that ppl around me seem to have it so much easier than i do? is there something that i lack? Is there certain X-factor that i have not yet attained?                      i've finally opened up my CPF investment account. did everything within the space of an hr. Unbelievable. At least i know i'm putting my money to good use rather than earning a miserable 2.5% interest fr the govt. Well, other than that, nothing much for the past few days except meeting up with frens and finally met J. A very close n personal buddy of my gal. It was a strange, trippy feeling. it was odd. i mean this is the guy whom had a rather intimate relationship with her and here i am smiling, chattin with him as tho he's just some guy fren. i'm not sure if that is the way i should be reacting or otherwise. Whatever it is... it was a feeling that took me a while to digest but overall, he is a pleasant lad with a pleasant gf and it was really nice meeting him for the very first time. Happy? not really? mad? neither. So what it is? nothing perhaps. just a peace of mind that's all. at least now i know what sort of person he is and what he looks like. am i being very fair to myself? i have really no idea.                      All of a sudden, i found myself sinking into a depressive mood. Maybe i do know the reason yet at the same time, i m not sure. There are so many factors that triggered my turbulent emotions. So many things that are beyond my grasp and i really wish i can do something about it. I wonder why my life is so full of obstacles and difficulties.. are they created by myself or is it becoz of my fate? i sometimes wish my life would be in a better state but somehow i seem to be experiencing all sorts of issues that simply throw me into a state of uncertainty. Have i chosen the wrong path in my life? are there other ways to experience an easier and comforting life? i love the ppl around, yet i'm unhappy with my life. There are just so many things i wanna change but i have so much constraints that are preventing me from doing so. Life goes on, i still go to school, i go out and and fun and i have a comfortable place to say. BUT beneath all that, there are many issues that say, 'look, u are in a huge mess. how u gonna save yrself?' I know that i can give a call back home and probably that will be an easy way out but then, how much can my parents help me? i dun want to be a burden for them coz i know how hard is it for them to be supporting a portion of my education here. I am already contented with that and i try as much not to be dependent on them. sigh.  I'm kinda stuck at a dead end at the moment. i really hate it when things get undone. I wish that everything will just fall into place at this very instant and make my days easier to go by. i feel like switching myself off, and not think about anything at all. A totally blank state of mind is what i'm looking for. i dun know which direction i should head or what should i do. I'm in need of salvation.           \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
