It started out as many things do, a fleeting impulse in my brain. I had planned to make strawberry jam this year, but missed out on the best u-pick berries. Shortly after that a friend commented on his appreciation for raspberries and my jam-making scheme was given new life.  Saturday I stopped at an innocent vegetable stand near my parents' cottage and purchased the five pints of berries required in my jam recipe. On Sunday I gathered around me the fruit, sugar, lemons, and Certo ready to commence with the boiling and stirring. Then what to my utter disappointment do I find but mold, MOLD on my berries! Yes, it appears as though they must have been quite taken with the stuff just under the surface when I bought them, for surely blooms like I witnessed there were not formed overnight.  After much wailing and knashing of teeth I determined I was not going to let these rampant spores ruin my jam! I meticulously picked out the berries untouched by any nasty fuzz and rinsed them in some warm water in the sink. I could make this work, I had lots of strawberries still frozen from my u-pick adventure last year; I would just supplement a few cups of one berry for another, genius! Now all I need is that large bowl....    CRASH!  BANG!   SMASH!    tinkle tinkle....    In reaching clumsily for the bowl I knocked it over and managed to also take out one of my onion-soup bowls in a shower of glass and pottery shards. I looked down at the collander in the sink, the berries now covered in the tiniest slivers of glass you've ever seen, and I swore like a sailor. I cleaned everything up and carefully packaged all the glass, and berries, in a cardboard box so as not to impale any unsuspecting sanitation workers.  And just to give you insight into my phsyche; I am more determined than ever to make raspberry jam now.                  Remember the house I was in love with? Well it looks like it might be mine! Mom and Dad have agreed to help me with the downpayment, with the additional stipulation that this is the last time I get to borrow big money from them.     Yesterday I wrote up my offer at lunch. I think I was pretty reasonable; I asked for appliances, window coverings, and that the oil tank be topped-up. I bid a number a bit below the asking price. By dinnertime the counter-offer had come back: all appliances, window coverings, whatever oil is left in the tank since they just topped it up two weeks ago, and they only upped my bid by $1000! OMG I was jumping up and down when I heard that!!! I think I really lucked in there, but I also have to give credit to my realtor. Apparently the owners were somewhat attached to thier stove and washer/dryer; but my realtor convinced them to give me a break since I'm a new homeowner.     One big hurdle left to go; financing. I see the mortgage broker today after work and should know by weeks-end if I'm approved. Wow then it's inspection, lawyers, and I have to find a boarder for the third bedroom. I think I'm going to make a deal with my friend D to come live with us, and only ask for enough to get by comfortably.     Wow this is a lot to absorb in a short period of time! Everything seems to be on an upswing now for me, I'm a lucky girl.                    This breakup is like that movie 'Lost in Translation'; there's very little dialog, when there is it's dry, and the whole thing seems to drag on forever. I call M to tell him I have his cat basket and this is the dialog:  Me: 'Hi, I've got your cat basket, can I bring it over' M: 'Oh, I guess this isn't really a good time' Me: 'But it will only take a minute and you're already home' M: 'Yeah but... blah blah blah ...Panama'  Me: 'Did you say Panama?' M: 'Yeah they say I can go now' Me (internal dialogue): 'WTF?' Me: 'What the fuck?' M: 'Oh yeah, I didn't tell you... blah blah blah ...going to Panama for a work thing.' Me: 'Oh, I see' M: 'So I went out last night and now I'm scrambling trying to find my passport' Me: 'Well that's alright, you can just call me or something some other time when you have more time' M: 'Yeah maybe next Saturday, I think my plane comes back Saturday' Me: 'Okay, have fun'  That is really honestly the just of the conversation, and I'm very proud for being nice and trying to bear no ill-will towards the BIG BIG JERK WHO'S A BIG MEAN MEANIE! *ahem* There was really no reason I needed to know he had been out Friday night, I'm sure it was a jab. I'm glad I didn't play the game and see who's having a wilder single life, and I'm not out to even compete in that game. He can have the club scene and I'll stick to the pub scene.                  I really want to have a reason to call or email M, but I know I shouldn't. I went so far as to check his profile on  urlLink slashdot  to see if he had made any recent comments. I saw an interesting article and wanted to email him about it because no one else I know would 'get it'. I keep hoping for the phone to ring or for there to be a knock on the door. I want to tell him how wrong this is, how we're so meant for each other. I feel so pathetic, like those wussy lovesick girls who write really crappy poetry.   I think the website is helping, it's hard to tell. I can be fine for a while and then an instant later be in pain again.  I have so much to do right now, I need to find the drive to get it all done. I'm taking a night class at a local university and have a mid-term exam tonight, and a project due on the weekend. I'm moving in less than a week and have to get my things packed. On top of that I have a full time job and a daughter to raise. Normally I can handle it but this whole situation is starting to make it overwhelming.   My friend is watching my daughter tonight while I'm at class. She lives right across the street from M. I wonder if he'll see my car while I'm there, I wonder if he'll see me. I wonder if I'll catch a glimpse of him, I wonder if I could keep my composure if I did. I wish I could make this insane little trains of thought go away.                     Well it looks like tonight I have the choice between 'The General's Daughter', or some COPS special. I think I'm going to watch my episodes of Chobits again, thank you Bittorrent!  So I already don't shop at WalMart, now I'm going to stop giving my money to Tim Hortons. My story starts with the fact that I'm broke, and when I say broke I mean I've even spent my overdraft! So with half a tank of gas and NO money in my pocket I take Jasmin to Tim Hortons. I don't drink coffee myself but I have a lot of friends and coworkers that do; during the 'roll up the rim' contest they gave Jasmin several winning rims for free cookies and donuts. Jasmin happened to find one of the winning rim pieces today and REALLY wanted a donut. So I take her into town and we go inside, I was sure she was going to pick double-chocolate but instead she decided on the vanilla dip with sprinkles. Smiling, I held up the little torn piece of coffee cup and asked for my free donut.  Cashier: 'I'm sorry, we only take those during the contest'.  Me: 'But there's no expiry date mentioned here' Cashier: 'It's written on the contest cups' At which point I had to turn around to my eight-year-old daughter and tell her she wasn't able to get the donut after all and we had to go home now. I can't beleive that, I could understand if I tried to cash in a coupon that was three years old, but not this. I never liked that contest anyway, always thought it probably had worse odds than the lottery.                 This whole sad saga should be over shortly. I'm not only tired of writing about my feelings, I'm finding less to write about. I have so much more to share; thoughts on politics, the environment, comic books.   So Saturday I will return the cat carrier to M and say 'Adieu'. Buddists say that ill-will towards people is a negative force we should be wary of, so I'm going to make a concentrated effort to be especially nice and watch what I say. If I think this 'new M' is only going to find emptiness in his new lifestyle I will keep it to myself (and my weblog).   I'm excited about the prospect of camping next week, and I think I have a lot to look forward to this summer. I think I might try getting out and meeting new people. I'm certainly not interested in a new relationship right away, but I'm not averse to dating. I created a profile on  urlLink lavalife.com  yesterday and had about 5 smiles within a few hours! Granted, some of these guys were over fourty but still it's a nice ego boost.
