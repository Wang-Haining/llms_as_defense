I'm broken.  Oh doctor, doctor, can you fix me, can you fix me?  Oh Pretty Baby, you're so naive -- but it comes off so cute        We don't want to fix you        We love you just the way you are        The butterfly pinned to the page        The nightingale locked in the cage -- won't you sing for me?        Sing for me, uh-huh        Yeah, we love you just the way you are        Crushed 'neath fashion magazines        Trampled by circus pony dreams -- won't you kiss me?        Won't you kiss me, uh-huh  Oh please, mister, can't you fix me, can't you fix me? (uh-huh)        Someone, anyone, won't you fix me, won't you fix me? (uh-huh)        Oh, someone, please, the moon has raped me        I can feel it inside me        Oh, mama, please let someone fix me!        Let them fix me, uh-huh Let them fix me, uh-huh  So cry yourself to sleep        Cry yourself to sleep I am strong and you are weak        Wait, you are strong, and I am weak Fuck -- just cry yourself to sleep           &nbsp;    &nbsp;  I think I'll continue my face just so I don't piss anyone off. I'll sleep on the idea.  I mourn for the life I led. I mourn for being what I was. And yet I see what I want and despise it entirely. I hate the people around me, whom I choose to surround myself with. I see they are skeletons of people. Unfeeling, unbreathing beasts of the world I once lived in. I just wish.... that they could understand the desperation I am to find me. To find what I desire with open arms and dripping wrists.               Wonderful morning.  Dad's sick - got the flu or something, so he's home. Mum's working all day.  Lots of people online. Just no one I actually talk to :P  Hearshot Kid Disaster - Coheed & Cambria.  I love this song.  I listened to it alot when we went to Brisbane. I way wasn't over Dan when we went (and considering he lives in Brisbane - and I saw his friend every day), so it was a really depressing trip. The song kept me busy. I so didn't enjoy being in Brisbane. I'm glad we went though - simply because of my new clothes :P I don't know what I would do without my cargo's.  I'm sorry. For the lies I've spielt. Please forgive me, For my demise.  I apoligise, with all sincerity, Please accept this, I am alone.  I need who stood by me, supported and cared, back with me, return.  For you know who you are, and you know how much I need you, I'm broken and wrecked,  but I am too weak.  I want to turn back time, and remove all the tapestry, that dared ensue my life. Please, my worm.    \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
