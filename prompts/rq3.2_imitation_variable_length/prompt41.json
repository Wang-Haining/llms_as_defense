(22:47:25) Jood: You gotta watch out for those rays (22:47:30) Jood: they'll getchu with 'um (22:47:35) Dougie: buggrit, buggrem (22:48:24) Dougie: The old pool shooter had won many a game in his life.   But now it was time to hang up the cue. When he did, all the other cues came crashing to the floor. 'Sorry,' he said with a smile. (22:49:18) Jood: It was at this moment that the other men realized that without that old pool shooter, this world would fall apart. (22:50:05) Jood: And when they had this apocalyptic epiphany, they all dropped their jaws, and let their eyes grow wide with amazement as they watched his silhouette fall into the horizon (22:50:34) Dougie: as he dropped 500 feet onto a raging river that flowed over razor-sharp spikes (22:50:40) Dougie: that were poisonous (22:50:46) Dougie: and explosive (22:50:54) Jood: doug. you just lost the cinematic feel (22:50:55) Jood: c'mon (22:51:27) Dougie: and the a glorious, soaring eagle picks him up and wraps him in an American flag (22:51:30) Dougie: then* (22:51:41) Dougie: and everybody breakdances (22:52:08) Jood: Only to have the flag burn his skin, like holy water on a demons chest.  This is when everyone knew his true identity. (22:52:35) Dougie: Lord Gribnak had returned! (22:55:21) Jood: Only to wield his mighty sword, and thrust it to the heavens!  And Hell rained down upon the earth, bringing an end to this meaningless process we call life. (22:55:46) Dougie: and everybody died happily ever after (22:56:01) Jood: Fin. (22:56:12) Dougie: ::roll credits:: (22:56:26) Jood: ::eats roll::            I went to a Dido concert last night at the Tower Theater. She is amazing. Actually I didn't knwo anything about Dido until I went to this concert. Fortunately, I found me saying to myself, 'Wait, Dido did that song? Wow.' So I could at some parts sing along. I got a t-shirt. Very cool. Overall it was a nice calm concert and she wasn't all fancy like Britney Spears changing her costume 5x's each song and using props like snakes. It was very enjoyable. Ok, now for the amazing news....   I AM GOING TO A STYX AND PETER FRAMPTON CONCERT JUNE 25TH!!!!!!   Well, I actually don't know anything about Peter Frampton but maybe it'll be another Dido experience. I am going for the Styx, one of my favorite bands. It'll be at the Mann Music Center in Philly, and I'm going with just my dad (so sorry friends, unless something happens to my dad, I can't take you.) We'll be about 20 seats or something like 100 yards away from stage which I think is pretty good. Anybody know anything about Peter Frampton?                  I got 5 teeth pulled today so that I can get braces by Thursday. There aren't any teeth to put them on! The laughing gas really got to me. It was just like that episode of the Simpsons where Lisa got braces and got laughing gas. I started seeing double all the time...Then whenever they put a needle of novacane in my mouth the people who were working on me would say, 'You will feel a sight pinch.' Then the scene would freeze in front of me and some silver spirals would appear below their faces. The whole tiem in my mind I kept hearing a voice (prob my inner self) singing, 'I'm on the Simpsons! I'm on the Simpsons! I'm on the Simpsons!...' and so on. It was a weird experience a lot of the time it kept playing the one scene where Lisa dreams about The Beatles, from the laughing gas, in my mind. All that I could remember from the actual procedure was getting the weird needle dream and the pulling of the last two teeth. When I got home, I felt like a chipmunk...I hate being numb...I lost feeling in most of my face...including my ear. Now that's over...I gotta lotta Tofutti (tofu ice cream) and sweet potato mush...AlexD suggested I drank liquid prime ribs **shudder**. Great, now I have to go through the pain all over again for braces on Thursday...                     ::sigh:: i want to see stepford wives, but my mum says i cant see it, she says it got bad reviews and she thinks it looks bad. dont you love the fact that she thinks if she wont like it i wont like it, heh heh so not true. and i think that goes for riddick too, sorry tucker. ::sigh:: good news for gus tho.... i can see shrek2, and now for the bad news, not today. since my dad broke his leg he thinks he should be pampered, so we are talkign him to longwood gardens, and guess who gets to push around the wheelchair? you guessed it yours truly. joy. and now for more good news (bad news for you gus) we cant see shrek2 tommrow either for its my bros birthday party and we are going paintballing (yay!). bad news for dougie, and tucker tho, i am oh so sorry i cant bring anyone, plus i doubt any of your parents are gonna want to sighn the waver required by anyone under 21. heh heh heh its a fun but dangerous sport. so have fun at the movies ::sniff sniff:: with out me... -sporko- p.s. i am free monday!!! w00t!!!                 Besides the fact that I've no life this week :(...I'm leaving on Thursday to go to the Penn State Arts Festival til Sunday, and then as soon as I get home I must leave to Rehobeth (spell?) Beach for a week with Alexandra (she's comming home, yay!) Thus, I won't be taking the landscape class :( and I won't get to update my blog or IM any of you for 2 weeks!!! So sad....sorry...anyway....yesterday! *** 4th o' July was fun! Was at the D's for most of the day...most of it consisted of eating, and breaking sticks and throwing them out the window...yeah...Then at five we had to leave for the Mannix's. You have to understand that when I got there I was wearing my hair back tight, short shorts, and a tight top. I kinda scared everyoone there when I came downstairs changed in my baggy pants, my Styx shirt that was intended for an adult, and bearing all of my frizzy blue hair. When I came downstairs with my shirt a guy there named Bernie looked at my shirt (he works in the music record deal bussiness). Well, first he made a joke that I was too young to like Styx (I could tell when I went to the concert). Then he told me that that very morning he was talking with someone he works with who asked him if he wanted a signed photo of the lead singer of Styx who plays the keyboard (with the tight tight tight pants!!!) and he said no cause he thought no one would wanted it. Now he feels really guilty. But oh well...he turned out to be a cool guy. He gets to vote for the Grammy Awards. He found it facinating that I was interested in Classic Rock for my age. We ended up talking a lot about it. In the end, he sujjested that I listen to Pink Floyd. I'll try it... When am I gonna get thses drawings on my blog????         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
