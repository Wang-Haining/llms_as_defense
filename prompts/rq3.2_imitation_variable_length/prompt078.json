The ones that were there, where the one that made the year - Lev, Niki, Alo  (hehe, I´m home and you are not!),  Heinzl, Balint, Mate, Kristina ...   Yes, yes, yes I know it took me a long time to come back to my weblog but hellooooo! do you have a clue how busy you can be when you come back home after one year? Today is 31 of July! I arrived in Colombia exactly 2 weeks ago (15 of July)! And  after spending only one week there! , I moved for one week to BRAZIL! Right now I am in Sao Paulo,  and I´m in love with this city , but ok, soon I´ll write about Brazil. Now let´s focus on some farewells/welcoming feeling ...  In few words, I really still don´t feel having came back home! I´m now in a totally new culture (well, the totally is very relative, is new, but is so easy to adapt) and it has been like jumping from the part of the culture shock curve when you feel estable to another cultural shock curve where you are in the 'honeymoon period'. I still need to saty a longer period home :) to feel back and maybe to start feeling real 'reintegration symptoms'!  Anyways, even if one week, there are deeper things you can realize!    1) One I realized I´m still in love,  actually never stoped, even if at the moment to love seems to be harder than ever. Sometimes I asked myself if I wanted to keep believing that I was in love or I really was. Answer was found.   2) I realized that I made it to gain weight!  (allthough I think I´ve been loosing weight the last two weeks as well and actually not on propose, just as a results of more movement and STRESS!! - welmcome back real stress!). About the gained kilos :), let´s say 80 % of the people like it a lot, so funny, they say I look more 'woman'! Other just say - 'Look good, just work on your belly'!     3) Barranquilla is Barranquilla!  freaking hot weather and cool night flair make me finally remember where I belong!   4) The leader is back!  Could also feel how the 'leading sister, daugther' position came back to me. Was nice not having it one year, you feel kind of with one responsibility less, but having it again proves so much the level of trust that your relatives have in you, wich is also a better feeling.  THE QUOTATION OF THE PAST TWO WEEKS SEEMED TO BE:  'EXPECTATIONS REDUCE JOY IN LIFE' , I came with many, not all have been fulfilled till now, but  I can really feel how slowly balance is coming. Actually I regret that because overestimating my 'coming back' expectations, I underestimated some of the last moments of being near to some people back in Europe  I still believe in expectations, not to have them is to be like a ship without destiny, but at least someone made me realize to overestimate expectations can drive you crazy. True.  Specially after this week in Brazil, as said, I start slowly to feel so balanced, cause let me tell you ...  LIFE IS SO AMAZING! and all this world was just made just for US! Two weeks ago in Vienna, one week ago in Barranquilla today in Sao Paulo! Does the jurney have an end? I hope never!    It was a fair farewell. It was also a fair welcome. Thanks for this ones!                               The closer the day of my coming home from Austria is, the more exited and pleased sound my family in the phone ...  I mean it´s an unique feeling - They tell you these small things that money can´t buy like what are they gonna cook for you, how thinks will look like in your own room, how many sunsets that we miss we can see now ... etc ... on the other hand friends also start to mail, asking for the exact date you arrive and making preliminary plans for a bastard WELCOME PARTY ... I also can´t imagine seeing my  urlLink boyfriend  again,  actually have to confess that this is my favourite part and would deserve its own posting, or even its own weblog  ... in general it would be like a bombastic explosion of all the love you kind of stored for one year for your people ...   Many peope have asked during the whole year (time after time)...  'Mowwww, you miss your family? you miss your country? wow, how can you manage it with your boyfriend?'   And many times I answered proudly: ' NO! I do not miss them, I mean you miss someone when they are not anymore with you or when you lost them, but despite the distance anyway I am so close to them, and you know, I´m very used to travel and connect with them all in very different levels'     Which IS A COMPLETE CRAPY LIE and A CHEAP FAKE THEORY. OF COURSE I MISS THEM, AND A LOT! HUG AND BE HUGED, KISS AND BE KISSED, FIGHT, CRY, OR JUST OBSERVE THEM WHILE THEY ARE SLEEPING AND I WAKE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT TO HAVE A GLAS OF WATER.      Therefore I find really stupid how I sometimes was proud of 'thinking that I was not missing', or that 'missing' was a sign of being weak ... or in general thinking that feelings is somthing you can control.  CRAP! CRAP! CRAP! and ten times CRAP!    TO MISS IS NOT MORE THAN TO WANT:  'To discover the absence or omission of; to feel the want of; to mourn the loss of; to want; as, to miss an absent loved one'  I am really happy of coming back home and BEING ME AGAIN. It sounds silly. About this BEING ME again, again, I guess this is something I have to put into paper/ or into weblog quite soon, then it was one of the biggest realization of the year. I guess I realized finally what makes me unique back home (familiywise, countrywise, professionalwise, leadershipwise) and how the last 12 months I kind of played to 'taking a rest' and BEING ANOTHER ME. Posting shall come soon ...                           I can be an asshole of the grandest kind  I can withold like it's going out of style  I can be the moodiest baby  And you've never met anyone  As negative as I am sometimes   I am the wisest woman you've ever met  I'm the kindest soul with whom you've connected  I have the bravest heart that you've ever seen  And you've never met anyone  As positive as I am sometimes   I blame everyone else, not my own partaking  My passive agressiveness can be devistating  I'm terrified and mistrusting  And you've never met anyone who's closed down as I am sometimes    What I resist, persists, and speaks louder than I know  What I resist, you love, no matter how low or high I go    I am the funniest woman that you've ever known  I am the dullest woman that you've ever known  I am the most gorgeous woman that you've ever known  And you've never met anyone as everything as I am sometimes   You see everything  You see every part  You see all my light  And you love my dark  You dig everything  Of which I'm ashamed  There's not anything to which you can't relate  And you're still here                               Hi mates,  I just realized that is quite 'fake' the way I have been handling my old  urlLink http://orianatorres.aiesec.ws  weblog ... actually I will keep using it (that´s why old is not the best way to name it), but for the same I´ve been using it till now, making kind of newspaper for friends that might be interested (or not) about what I´ve been doing lately.  Come on...I love writting , for those who really know me, they know I do, and I love to do it long, and detailed ...           Looking into my sent-mail folder, I realized that it´s high time not not only share the random, other times 'rationale' but however always emotional thoughts that come to my mind, with the same 3 people. Actually I trust them a lot for doing it, but what is so bad to post freely what you thik?    And Bingo ... I managed to find this free bloging site (thanks  urlLink Santi  - http://santiagou.blogspot.com/,  I just saw you were using it).  Well also real credits should go to  urlLink Levri . Levri - ulli.typepad.com  also had a big influence in my way of perceiving (or actually using) blogs (and specially bloggers) and how money, true friends, and dreams can be made out of them. Once she asked to someone, what his key to sucess was, and this answered:  'I just did it through sharing my ideas'                   \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
