She smokes and her personal hygiene is not the best.    It's easy to look at her and wonder if she'll be a good mother.  The doubts started forming in my head whether she'd be able to take care of her baby adequately.  Boy did she prove me wrong.    Every day, she's here at the hospital before 8am and spends at least 10 hours here caring for her baby.  Her intelligence is so evident when you have a conversation with her.  I'm envious of her knack for remembering names and faces.  She says she was shocked to find out she was pregnant but now that she has her baby, she's devoted her life to taking care of him.  And it's apparent in her excitement over every little milestone he passes.  It's so infectious, you can't help but smile when you talk to her.  I guess that's where the difficulty lies.. breaking down the pre-conceived stereotypes we have formed in our heads and trying not to judge.  She deserves to be treated with the same respect and compassion as any other patient.                                 Taste of the Danforth was fun last night.. but it sure takes some skill trying to eat your food while squeezing your way through the massive crowds.  I wasn't sure if I was ready for Greek food again after last year's trip and eating gyros or souvlaki every single night, but I managed to eat.. quite a lot actually (1 skewer of pork, 1 skewer of grilled octopus, 1/2 roasted yam, 2 salmon maki).  Sunday already.. back to the grind tomorrow.  It really hasn't felt like summer this year yet.. not sure why.  And Sept is quietly creeping up.  I miss those days where summer seemed to last forever, as Bryan Adams puts it.  It's strange cuz there's still 24 hrs a day but it just feels like it's going by so much faster now.  This hasn't been a good summer for me either.  My mood is just everywhere.. some days i'm bouncing off the walls, other days I just can't shake the funk.  I'm trying to suck it up, but I can't stop thinking about all the things I could be doing without the gimp knee (i.e. last night, they were selling belly dancing skirts on the Danforth.. the ones that jingle.. and I so wished I could take more classes).  Then it's like a downward spiral, I get sad, then I start thinking about other things that make me even more sad... like things I don't have in my life and friends I haven't seen lately who's company I miss.  But I think i'm ready to get on with it now and stop this moping.  Let me focus on the things I do have and the things I can still do.. like taking a cooking course and enjoying the company of people who are still around and care.  I can do this.                                 I've never really had a good grasp of what to do with my money (besides spending it on 'retail therapy', sushi, KF, travelling.. things I consider personal investments), so I've always thought it'd be a good idea to get to know some finance stuff.  I do save some money now that i'm living at home and invest in GICs, RRSPs, mutual funds etc., but I always wonder if there's more I can do.  So with all this idle time at home this week, I started to read the Prospectus thinking that's a good place to start.  It made me sleepy and felt a bit deja vu of school reading, so I put that aside and took a look at my annual HOOPP (hospitals of ontario pension plan) statement.  It lays out what my estimated monthly benefits would be if I retire at age 55, 60, or 65.  I told my mom that retirement at age 55 sounds very tempting and her reply was that well, I'd better get married and have kids soon then if I want them to be self sufficient by the time I retire.  hmm.. good point.  Estimated date of retirement:  Dec 01, 2031                                 I am an INFP.  That's what I found out the first week of pharmacy when we took the Myers-Briggs test.  I was doing some cleaning this weekend and found an old box of pharmacy stuff that I failed to purge after graduation.

Friendly, but often too absorbed in what they are doing to be sociable.  Little concerned with possessions or physical surroundings.  What's amusing is that I scored full points for being a Feeler and zero points for being a Thinker!  I guess you can tell which of my organs is getting the better blood flow.                                   Miscellaneous rants… no flow or common theme here.&nbsp; Just one of those jumbled thoughts days.   … 1st physio session yesterday, started with her massaging my leg for the 1st 15min.&nbsp; I thought, hey, I think I’m gonna like this physio thing.&nbsp; (I know I’m sure it’ll get more intense after).&nbsp; Then I just got hooked up to the electrical machine to strengthen my wimpy quad.   … I’m starting to get worried about my Gung-gung.&nbsp; He’s been doing so well after his stroke.. didn’t really have any residual neurological deficits and he has good short- and long-term memory.&nbsp; But the other day, I thought he was in his room sleeping when I heard talking.&nbsp; So I went to investigate and he was talking to himself.&nbsp; But he was obviously having a conversation with someone and he was speaking coherently, not like when you talk jibberish in your sleep.&nbsp; I listened for a bit outside his door then he goes, I don’t want to talk to you anymore, and hits his head a few times and he goes quiet.&nbsp; A little later in the day, I asked him who he was talking to earlier and he denied it... then smiled and kinda chuckled to himself.   … really must learn how to parallel park.&nbsp;   … I’m so lovin the amazing race right now.&nbsp; That would be the one reality tv show I’d love to do.&nbsp; I’d need a guy to be my partner tho just in case we had to eat icky things.&nbsp; Or hehee.. Christine and I could always be the “Asian Flowers” duo.&nbsp; We seem to have that lost and confused look down pat, judging by how people kept coming to help us with directions in Greece.&nbsp;   … having a bit of baby fever right now.&nbsp; There’s this incredibly cute but cranky Chinese baby boy in the nursery.&nbsp; I so just wanna pick him up and play.   … my jasmine plant is dying.&nbsp; She’s now under the care of my mom who’s spritzing everyday and trying to revive her.&nbsp; No greenthumb for me.   … had a lesson with a cute boy at KF.&nbsp; He punched me in the breast… it was a light punch, but still embarrassing.&nbsp; Things happen, I guess… can’t be as bad as them getting accidentally kicked in the balls.   … looking forward to the long weekend.&nbsp; Tonight we’re getting another dose of Gus and his band.&nbsp; Tomorrow’s plans to go dancing at the Garage416 party at Sunnyside for my friend’s birthday got cancelled.&nbsp; It’s too bad cuz I was looking forward to seeing him (don’t you love it how some guys just disappear once they start dating someone?!) and to hearing some good house music.&nbsp; Saturday, it’s BBQ time with the girls.&nbsp; Yum yum.&nbsp; Hari’s band is playing Saturday night too.. oh wells.&nbsp; Guess I’ll just catch his next gig.&nbsp; Hee.. I’m such a groupie.   All ranted out now :)                                   So whatever's been going on with me has just got to stop!  Last week, I forgot to get off the GO train then messed up my knee, yesterday I had the call night from hell (see below) and this morning I locked myself out of the car at the train station while leaving my bags in the car.  Whatever this is, I hope it passes soon.  It's not even full moon anymore.  I think last night was the worst on-call night i've ever had.  Non-pharmies feel free to tune out now.  I was on the phone from 8-10pm and at one point had 5 calls in limbo while I was looking up info.  Then at 11pm I had to come back to the hospital to  compound  sodium benzoate oral solution for this pt in emerg with high ammonia levels.  Picture me, weighing out sodium benzoate powder then pulling out the beakers and stirring rods.  Flashbacks of orgo labs!  I was technically supposed to make the product in the sterile hood, but I figured since the pt was from a shelter and her gut is definitely not sterile, it shouldn't be a big problem.  And technically I was supposed to check the pH of the solution and adjust it with HCl or NaOH to achieve a certain pH.. but at midnight, I wouldn't even know where to go to find pH paper.  I was more preoccupied with getting the dang powder to dissolve.  Then after I get home (scary driving home in the thunder & lightning storm), I get another page from this resident about this pt with subtherapeutic phenytoin levels, who's now NPO and has brain mets.  I think I was ready to seize at that time.    So ready to crash right now..               \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
