Food was nice as always.. but i was having fecking cramps! I took 3 painkillers.. then i think i becaMe very giggLy.. haha.. had a wonderful giggLy time with Fendy.. c',)  &nbsp;  Yesterday was very tiring.. me and Fendy went to the lovely My Soup Meal and ate and after that we went to starbucks to have the superb hot cocoa with whipped cream. Simply wonderful.. simply delicious...*sip*.. i am so in love with Fendy.. we hope we could get married late next year and have children...  &nbsp;  If God bless us with children.. we want 4..&nbsp;and the names we have in mind are..  &nbsp;  BOYS  Rauf Seyif  Riyaz Seyif  Sameer Seyif  Iqbal Seyif (fendy doesnt like this!)  &nbsp;  GIRLS  Ameesha Seyif  Amyrah Seyif  Esha Seyif  Sakeenah Seyif  &nbsp;  ... these are only some of them.. nice ait.. c',)..                                             Hrmphh.. it is Monday already? I dont feel rested. *siGh*.. anyWay, yesterday me and fenDy didnt go to the beacH but we went to TampiNes. His friends went to watch spiDeY 2 but we didnt. Instead we went to starbucKs and manage to get comfy on the sofas. But it was darn freeZing. Cheh.. esp since we were telling each other gHost stories.. hehe. And we were drinking the strawberries and cream frapuccinO.. so wonderful.. taste like strawberries and cream ice creaM. YummY! Aft that we walked ard and i boughT a earPhoNe. My darLing Fendy help read the speCs and decide which one i shouLd buy! That is the advantage of getting an audio engineer in-training bf. Hehe! c',)  This morning i was listening to the The BeatLes on the way to work. LoveLy.. hopefuLLy the rest of the daY is lovely too. 'All You Need is Love' keeps playing on my mind... hrmphh.. later i shd listen to 'Across the Universe' too but the Rufus W's version!   OOoh btw.. you shd watch 'I am Sam' if you are big Beatles fan.. All the songs are The Beatle's song but sung by Rufus W. Simply wonderful. Actually, you shd watch the movie, even if you dont love the Beatles. It is so moving. I watched it thrice and i cried. Even Fendy cries. c',)                                 Before this job.. i thought the most exciting countdown was for New Year. Nuff said.  I am so exhausted. How can so many evil people reside in this earth? The worst thing is that their evil ways led me to hate them. I dont like to hate people! I hope this people will get what they deserve. *sigh*  Why cant this be a perfect world? So many evil people roaming and poisoning the planet. So many people who think they are god or they are more superior than others.  *sigh*  I hope i will have a nice day tomorrow. I cried at work just now cos this dingo was so nasty. To add on to that.. i am stressed and i am having my PMS. I need a new job. DESPERATELY. It doesnt matter if the bank gives me 21 days leave and >4mths bonus. It doesnt matter. *Chemical Bro's 'It Doesnt Matter' plays in my mind. I need some happiness. I deserve some happiness. Money is not happiness and cant buy happiness. I need PEACE. I need to feel GOOD. I need to SMILE. I need to be HAPPY. OMG... i think i need to start praying again. But i am having my rasberry ripple week.  I think i will meet SHeels tomorrow and have a nice morning. Evening... if i feel like it.. i will meet Fendy. Fendy... Fendy Fendy.. *sigh*.. dont know what to say. I am down... i am down.. i am so sleepy... i am so stressed. A sense of melancholy has enveloped me. I need a HUG. *sigh*.....                                  Me & Fendy celebrated our 2 yr anniversary on Friday 11/06. Two years together.. how time flies. *Smiles* Anyway, we went to airport in the afternoon (his studio was cancelled!haha) and ate nasi bukhari @ T1. It was wonderful. After that we went to T2 and sat at the viewing mall amidst all the chaos and running monsters. How unromantic.. hehe! Then Fendy could not take the BO of the nonya beside him anymore.. so we decided to get ourselves an ice cream from Swensens. But before that.. we had an argument.. i guess Fendy was kinda bored and sleepy ( actually me too!) and we were like kinda sad that we are 'celebrating our anniversary' like this. But anyway we got ourselves a sticky chewy chocolate cone, ensconced ourselves somewhere hidden and hahaa.. the rest is between us.  After that, we decided to go to Tampines cos that was where we had our first date. We ate takoyaki and $3 pizza from the Pasar Malam then sat behind Tampines Mall. We recalled sitting at the exact spot on our first that. Then we went to KFC and sat at the exact same spot we sat at on our first date as well. And talked abt what happened and how our lives changed. Fendy said something touching.. he said.. now he could feed me and 2years ago he couldnt as we werent together yet. After filling ourselves and reminiscing, we went to sit outside.. yes at the same spot we sat on our first date and talked and ...! How Wonderful.  I love you so much honey... 2 yrs have done nothing but made me love you more... ! I cant wait to spend the rest of my life with you darling!  As i sat there with you Talking abt the things we want to do I felt so complete And know that you are all that i need  Two years have passed And look where that has left us Still strong together Loving each other more than ever  Although we have our arguments We too have our sweet moments This still feels so right The future seems so bright  I cant wait for that special day When we can be together everyday When you put the ring in my finger And be with me forever                                  ---- Original Message ----- Sent: Thursday, 07 August, 2003 9:14 PM From: HIM  Hi, Just wondering if u are still using this emailaddress  Regards HIM  ----- Original Message ----- Sent: Thursday, 07 August, 2003 9:14 PM From: ME   HeYa Yes im still using this email... why u wanna use this email address?

Thks ME  ---- Original Message ----- Sent: Sat, 9 Aug 2003 14:19:12 8.00am From: HIM  Peace... thank you                                  I have been having the same kind of dreams the past 2 weeks. It is either about me getting married, me looking for a house with Fendy or me having babies. Weird aint it. Although the dreams are not exactlyunpleasant, it is rather upsetting when you wake and realize that you are not married, no house (still has curfew) and no babies.   One particular dream goes like this..'Me and Fendy were at this house. Initially the house looks small but then there is a long hall which leads to a bigger hall and there is this huge balcony facing the beach. It was simply breathtaking and then it turns out that it is actually two units combined into one. Me and Fendy was so happy'. Then i woke up and realized that was just a dream.  Another one goes like this..' I was at a stadium-like place (dont know for what though) then i saw my youngest brother and he has this baby with him. The baby was okay for a while, then he started screaming his heart out. Everybody was looking at the baby. Then i rushed to the baby to try to pacify him. That was when i realize that that was my son. As everybody was looking at us and whispering to one another, i had to take the baby out. Then all of a sudden, i was alone at the stadium and cradling the baby in my arms. The baby has huge pores'. Then i was awaken by my mum's voice. Weird and scary!  Why do i have these dreams? I really have no idea why i keep dreaming of these things. Do i want these things ie. marriage, babies & house badly? Am i going thru a quarter life crisis (albeit an early one)? Or is my biological clock ticking?
