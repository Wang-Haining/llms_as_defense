BUT the thing that was the most fun for me today, was realizing how wonderful my boyfriend is. he is so amazing and i love him so much. hes definitely one of the greatest people that i kno. im so glad that i have him to 'call my own' lol! do you want to kno the greatest feeling in the world? the most powerful? the down right best? well its knowing... not just thinking you kno, that you are loved. by anyone... but especially by someone that you kno that you love back. love is a very strong emotion, that i dont feel should be used too extremely lightly. now i kno that ive said it and not truly meant it. but lately ive realized that to say it and not mean it is worthless and just a flat out waste of time. im sure that we all kno who this is really to... so im just tryin to say that i really love you. ;) bye ppl...            hey people howz it goin? im fantabulous. just sittin here thinkin about how important my friends really are to me. i spent this weekend with a friend of mine who is moving out of state in well... one month today. this friend of mine is so special and amazing. she makes you laugh at all the right times and she will always be there to protect you or when she needs a little protecting of her own! lol!  she is so sweet and i love her so much she is just such a great part of my life and i really dont want her to leave. i understand the fact that she has to go but it doesnt help the me any because im going to miss her so much and its so unfair that 'life' is takin away such a great friend from me. i always hate when people say life is unfair so let me correct myself... i think her parents are unfair. but even so i love them too. i really dont have anything else to say but you go whitney! ill really try to help you with your motto/resolution as long as you help me get a few 'needed' things. call me and ill tell you! lol! well guys and gals out there b'bye!             this weekend has been so much fun... im a little tired lol but good none the less. umm on friday i went to the pool and was so tired that instead of swimming i fell asleep!! lol. and then at home i talked to kim vu, who i havent talked to in forever! i was so happy! and then i stayed up all night talkin to seiji hashimoto about everything in the world. it was so fun... but when it got to be 4 in the morning, and both of his friends were completely passed out and wed talked for over 4 hours, we decided to call it a night. lol. my mommy also got a new ford explorer, so i had to babysit all night... it was ok tho. then yesterday i woke up babysitting because my dad had done something with the jack and busted his lip open and had to go to the hospital. he ended up getting 11 stiches. lol. o yea! the cops also found my daddys stolen truck yesterday! but its a not so good thing anymore bc tomorrow hes supposed to pick up his brand new, custom, factory special king ranch edition ford f-250. lol. well see how that one goes. then last night i decided that i was gonna go to sleep early and sleep in late bc i havent done that all summer... thanks to drivers ed... so at 1030 i was out... then just on time... my phone rang. seiji decided to talk at 1220 last night. i was up sharing information with him for an hour but i was so exhausted that i had to go back to sleep. and now its today. im gonna dye my hair and go buy a new suit. fun stuff, and i also have to do my drivers ed homework so ill catch yall later! lol! bye!!!      \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
