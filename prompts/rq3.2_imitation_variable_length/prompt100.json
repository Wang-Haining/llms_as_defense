I dont know, $256.&nbsp; Yeah I'm pretty important now, the only people who are above me out of all 11 companies&nbsp;are my boss (her title is&nbsp;the controller)&nbsp;and the two&nbsp;owners.&nbsp; I think I may have underlings but I'm not sure yet.&nbsp; This is only tuesday of my 3rd week, talk about pressure.&nbsp; I have to stay late like real&nbsp;managers if I don't get everything done and I can come in early, but I'll adjust to all this money I'm earning.&nbsp; Well, time to take senior pictures.                  Last real day of school! There are still finals though so its far from over.  Went to Nicks after school today, we wached The Last Samurai and part of Catch Me If You Can.  The Last Samurai was really good, Nick fell asleep right before the final war.  When we got to his house he took off his shirt and Im like 'uhh Nick...'  and hes like 'Im doin what I do' so he was like that the whole time and it was disturbing.  Especially because I just got a pen that electrocutes you when you press it and he was shocking his nipple.  People all day in school were asking me if they could shock themselves.  I was like 'ok just dont throw it' then theyre like 'it hurts that much?' 'yep' 'ok Ill do it anyway'  then they press it and throw it wicked far 'sorry i couldnt hold on to it' 'i know'  then they did it again.  it was like that for just about every class.  In accounting Brink wanted to try it but he was afraid so he kept pacing around and he said he would do it when the second hand hit the 12, it would be like a suicide.  I think I'll have some fun with this, i know a place that if you shock it, either your heart stops or you have a seizure or you just twitch and hurt a lot. ();^)                 Work was ok today except I got the worst paper cut by far of my entire life.  Blood was flowing out pretty fast and its over an inch long and 4 millimeters deep.  I measured how deep it was by how high the blood was on the paper.  Thats pretty damn deep for a paper cut.  I've gotten at least 10 paper cuts since I started working there but none nearly as bad as this, and I think I'm getting addicted to them.  Whenever I get a new one I feel kind of refreshed like I've gone too long without one.  Its kind of weird.  Anyway I went to Russells house after work and we tried to find a pawn shop, but the only one had apparently turned into a bike shop.  I was gonna try to buy some kind of weapon or something.  So yeah someone at my work called her house and her 5 year old daughter answered the phone so she said 'Hi honey can I talk to daddy?' then apparently the kid started laughing so she said 'Well you're little miss giggles today aren't you?  OH SHIT!' as her coffee spilled all over her lap and her daughter started crying.          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
