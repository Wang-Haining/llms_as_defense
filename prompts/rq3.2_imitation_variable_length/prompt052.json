My first thought is that the browser could just keep a list of personal information that you want to be kept private (so that it's never sent in any outgoing packets at all) or that you want to be warned about.    It sounds simple enough, but there are always issues. Two that come to mind are a potentially significant performance hit as the browser scans outgoing packets for personal information, and the local storage of that data which may be vulnerable to cracks and exploits in another branch of the information privacy war. Though I doubt that the majority of the information would be of much use to scanners, email addresses would definitely be among the protected strings, and these are very highly prized by bots. One more possibility is the accidental blocking of legitimate packets that just happen to include blocked strings by accident - a false positive.    Mokalus of Borg    PS - It's an idea, all the same, even if it's one that could use some work.  PPS - It's probably small enough to be made as a browser plug-in.                      Because I seem to be socially maladjusted, my interactions with other people can seem strained at best and non-existent at worst. Last night during a long session at the local coffee establishment with many acquaintances, I felt particularly lonely, and wondered why. My current working theory is that I am tired and overworked, which means I'm unable to focus on anything for long - let alone the social interactions I usually find so taxing.  Could that be why so many of us feel more alone in the cities than residents of quieter towns claim to feel? Maybe not - I already have a theory about that. When we have thousands of people from which to pick and choose our friends, we don't have to be nice to everyone we meet, and end up being snarled at by most of the strangers we encounter. When there are only so many friends to go around, we need them all, and we are nice to everyone, which in turn creates a generally positive feeling in the community.  We have lost our community existence. A friend of mine - a youth worker - said that the basic unit of society used to be the village. Then it was the extended family. Then the nuclear family. Now it is the individual. Soon it will be the fragments of the individual.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - Sometimes, I can hear it emerging already. PPS - Where will we be left when we can't even form a cohesive whole of ourselves?                     I read  urlLink this post  on SlashDot and thought it might be indicating an article about the coming personal digital device revolution where we all carry around a phone-PDA-iPod-GPS-hard drive. Then I skimmed  urlLink the indicated article  which seems to be more about a disagreement between RealNetworks and Apple over the rights to interact with iPods.  In a hacker's ideal world (and by 'hacker' I mean 'programmer'), we all use interoperable standards. The iPod wouldn't be the issue at stake, as such, because it would use the one universal managed music format that is freely available to everyone. RealNetworks and Apple would both be providing a service of downloadable music for a fee, and the disagreement would likely be over content theft or the rights to a certain label's music. See the difference? You can do what you like with your content, but the  protocol  must be open. That's how we create better competition and serve our users properly, because what they want is the music, not the method.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - I acknowledge that it is often difficult to create a standard that fits everyone's needs. PPS - Most of the time, though, we don't even try.                      Here's a paraphrased summary of an email I just received:  Hello everyone,  I've been using your new software for a month and it sucks. I just tried it on a brand-new fast PC and it still sucks. I couldn't generate a report because you suck. The current software doesn't suck nearly as much as you do. Your software is way too slow, which sucks, and you need to make it fast before we spend any more money on it.  Your software sucks because it's not like what I have right now. Even if you work really hard, I think it will still suck.  Big Accountant Guy  To be fair, the report generation is slow. To bite back, I have a few points:  The computer that actually needs upgrading is the server, not his desktop  The previous software is far more limited than our reporting engine and only generates pieces of the report on demand  Big Accountant Guy thinks the old software is fast because it only generates a hundredth of the data and returns that, then gets the next hundredth when he asks for that.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - If we don't get this fixed, the project could be axed. PPS - On the plus side, that would mean I don't have to deal with accountants for a while.                     I've had a bit more time to play Knights of the Old Republic now, and I'm getting to enjoy it far more than I expected when I started. The Star Wars backdrop is probably helping me get into it, but it's more than just liking Star Wars or puzzle-solving. Before too long I may even go hunting for experience points just to advance levels and skills. Truthfully, I don't make that much time to play. I spend my free time on Big Brother or movies, and at the moment my free time consists of Monday nights, Saturdays and Sunday afternoons. I sleep on Saturday mornings and Sundays, and I've been seeing plenty of movies lately, which I usually do on Saturday afternoon. Monday nights is Big Brother weekly nominations for eviction which takes an hour and a half, and Saturday evenings is often a video night. Any remaining free time in the week is typically needed for sleep.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - The game says my total playing time so far is just under six hours. PPS - And I'm pretty sure I bought it over a month ago.                     Last night, due to a voting mis-count, the latest Big Brother evictee, Bree, was returned to the house. The phone company that handles the phone voting stated 'human error' as the cause. I'm sure it's cost them plenty in bad press, time and cold hard cash, but they did act with honesty and integrity. I like Eddie Izzard's comment on admitting wrongdoing - sometimes we do it just so people will think 'My, what a strong personality that person has. I like to have sex with people with strong personalities.'. I doubt the phone company is similarly motivated, though.  I also watched Faking It - the second episode I've ever seen. They turned a shy junkyard worker into a catwalk model. I wondered later if they ever choose a profession that  doesn't  involve some performance aspect. I wouldn't think so, because it takes a bit of performance to make good television.  At the enthusiastic recommendation of a co-worker and the fact that Foxtel is currently giving away the Comedy Channel for free, I watched Conan O'Brian and I don't think I'll bother in future. Having not had the pleasure before, I'd have to say he's a very strange looking guy. His face is just about flat from the front, like he was pressed hard against a wall until his head reshaped. He only made me laugh with 'If They Mated'. The rest was hardly worth my time. I expected a little more energy. I hardly think the opinion of one Australian will matter, though. Especially since I didn't watch in the first place and don't have the chance to watch later.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - I left after that, just as Naked News was starting up. PPS - I wonder how long my Dad watched that before changing channels or switching off. Doesn't seem like his kind of show.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
