She ordered a homemade ice lemon tea and a pork cutlet vermicelli while I got myself rice with tender beef slices and the plum soda.  &nbsp; Halfway eating, a&nbsp;basket which comprises of 2 fried wanton &amp; 2 vegetable rolls landed on our table. I guess, we were too occupied with eating what's in front of us and our HK trip discussion to bother with it.  &nbsp; Just when the plates in front of us were almost empty, the 2 aunties beside start to think aloud why their basket of wanton and rolls did not arrive.  &nbsp; It then registered to us that oops.... their basket was in front of us &amp; we were not meant to have any basket.  &nbsp; Alas... Yiwen and I had this gulity look while we saw one of the auntie walking towards to the counter to make enquiries about her supposedly 'missing' basket.  &nbsp; I whispered to Yiwen what to do. She replied with we can tuck in after their basket arrive. So we continued to sip our beverages while maintaining an indifferent look.  &nbsp; Soon, their basket arrived and we on the other hand, happily tucked into our free wantons &amp; rolls..... Yum Yum  &nbsp;  Bad bad Me &amp; Bad bad Yiwen                       It was my first time, at the stadium, celebrating NDP with 59,999 ppl, even though it is not the actual day. It's already good enough.  Went to Northpoint to get the Hang Ten red official NDP T-shirt in the morning. Costs $5 each becos my mum combined forces with another auntie to buy 3 pieces. She purposely got the same design for me and Alex and even wanted to ask my aunt whether she should also buy the same for my 2 cousins. Sigh... Commented I will look ridiculous in this bright red.  While on our way to pick up my cousins, we saw a lot of ppl in red, either on the buses, taxi or waiting for cabs. There were this family of 4 in red top and white bottom... hahahah...  Settled our late lunch at the old airport hawker centre before heading to the stadium. Again, there were red ppl everywhere.... At that time, Alex commented, 'come here, then not embarrassed to be so red'... That's true. It would be weird if you are not in red.  Took a long 20 minutes walk to the stadium. Upon arrival, all we saw were ppl, ppl and more ppl. There were booths giving out bread, crackers and drinks. My cousins and I queued up for the face painting. They painted this year NDP logo on their faces and mine was on my arm. It's a spray of fireworks in 5 colours with stars. Quite pretty.  Squeezed into the tiny entrance with so many others. Got me all hot and sweaty. The ushers packed us to the 5th rows from the bottom. Like sardines in the can. While waiting for the program to start, we ransacked the goodies bag. Everything were packed in a red/black sling bag which was rather heavy and bulky.   Goodies in goodies bag : pkt of salted peanuts pkt of Justea green tea (taste weird) bottle of Slimwater bottle of ISport pkt of cheese biscults pkt of chestnuts program booklet NDP magazine discount booklet tatoos (patterns vary from I LOVE SINGAPORE, Singapore flag, 2004 NDP logo) Drum Cap Shaker (sand in a can) Singapore flag Torchlight in the shape of Nokia hp   To the best of my recollection, that's all I could recall. Phews... Luckily, we did not ta bao any McDonalds, as planned.  The show started with 5 mediacorp stars like sharon au, gurmit singh, jean danker etc trying to get everyone into the NDP mood.... they sang and danced to the beat of the music.... Took out our flag, shaker and drum while trying to hold on to the torchlight.... sure is hard for my small hands.  Next came out the 'bananas' ...dressed in bright yellow cap, top and bottom, you can't blame me for calling them that. They sure did a good job in motivating the crowd with their actions.  Then it came the usual routine which comprise of march by the SYF award-winning school military band, parachutes, parade, simulated walk-in of the MPs and president, singing of national anthem and 3 major formations by students. Alex kept on saying that every year is the same thing. Little did he know that I was already very overwhelmed by everything. The feeling of watching the annual NDP live compared to watching from the TV was so different and interesting. You get to see the scenes that are missing from the screen. At that time, I strongly felt that I do belong to this nation.... let me re-emphasize,  at that time ....     Funny scenes :   1. The person impersonating the Senior Minister during the simulated walk-in was holding a sign board saying ' SM '. We both burst out laughing.... '  sex manic  '.  2. The fake Prime Minister arrived in an old old white car for his simulated walk-in. Alex commented, ' Ai yo, preview also must find a good car mah... my year at least they got him a Mercedes' .  3. There was one particular formation whereby everyone would have to dash out from the field to the sides all within 5 seconds. Everyone around me started laughing when a boy, on the plump side could not clear the field fast enough.... he was the only poor soul left running, while holding on the the wings of his costume.  4. Yiping asked me to watch the parachutes very carefully..... when I asked why, she replied :' kan you mei you ren die dao mah '. However, everyone ended on the field on their feet and nothing more. She seemed so disappointed. This is pure evil.  5. In broad daylight, Gurmit Singh wanted us to hold the torchlight in our hand and sway. Hallo... you think this is fun!!! Everyone look like an idiot. Guess he knew himself when he said ' I know this is stupid but later. you will all look beautiful '. True enough, when dark prevail, every single of us shine... It was so magically beautiful.  I love the fansinating display of fireworks most. All kinds of  c  o  l  o  u  r  s  and all sorts of designs never fail to dazzle me.  Argh....It all ended with everyone in a joyous mood. just the mere thought of squeezing out with those 59,999 ppl is enough to make me wringe....   NDP 2005 ... wait for me.             \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
