  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic:\n\n        I have had in my possession for the last ten months or so a copy of the New York Times, dated September 12, 2001. An hour ago I finally read parts of it, for the first time.     It is important sometimes to remember, and also important sometimes to forget. Flipping through the pages of this paper, seeing some photos for the first time, reading about the destruction and replaying my memories of that day, has reminded me of things that for me, and especially for certain people at my college, are best left forgotten.     Though I have made my peace with the tragedy, and I have seen innumerable examples of kindness from my fellow Americans and humans, the callous and insensitive words and attitudes of some people at my college still scrapes at my insides. Even now (and I assure you this is not due solely to the heat), I'm sweating profusely and having trouble putting my thoughts down just thinking about these people.     Like I said earlier, sometimes it's good to remember and sometimes it isn't. I'm still struggling with whether I can forget certain incidents and therefore forgive these people. After all, they really had no idea the scope, the magnitude of the tragedy.     There was a long pause between the end of the last sentence and the beginning of this one. Ever since that day, I've had a lot more trouble justifying whatever I do. How can I complain about my poor treatment by boorish Minnesotans? I am alive. I did not have to, was not subjected to the horrors of being downtown that day. This whole blog thing is worthless. I was in counseling for a long time to learn how to not beat myself up, and it all seems like such a crock of shit. Do a search on this webpage and see what percentage of the total number of words the word 'I' takes up. How many sentences begin with 'I'? In my dumb, idiotic, fucked up, petty way, I wish I had been in 'the jaws of hell' as one reporter called it. It would at least give me a valid reason for whining. See, there I go again. There's just no end to it, I should shut the fuck up right now.     I had originally signed on to write something good about how maybe on September 11, 2002, I will do my best to show people that I care about them. I will remember the tragedy and do my best to help others. I will forgive and forget.     but no. I highly doubt I will forgive and forget. Maybe I will show my loved ones and my friends that I care. Maybe I will seek the company of other New Yorkers in an attempt to find some meaing somewhere. But I will not forgive or forget these few boorish Minnesotans. I do not hate all Minnesotans or Midwesterners or even Georgians. I may say I hate them, but really, it's hard to feel anything one way or the other towards individuals about whom you know nothing. I can generalize about people, but I usually try hard not to. After all, I did see a very touching letter from a little Georgian girl at Ground Zero. We're all in it together as Americans, as human beings. All of us except for those of you who aren't with us. If I see any of you Boorish Minnesotans on September 11, 2002, acting in any manner that I find objectionable, I will do what I should have done a year before. I give my word that you'll get what's coming to you.                  This is something I talk about with my friends a lot, but I've never written about it. The population of New York (Manhattan, specifically, because this certainly doesn't apply to Queens, dunno about the other boroughs) seems to get more attractive every summer. You can't go out without seeing a hot person every block. The bar we went to, two out of the three barwomen were attractive, and I'd guess half of the women in the bar in general were very attractive. Walking from the bar to the Indian place, we must've seen at least another five attractive girls. And this is at 1am, mind you. 1am, even on a Friday night, is kinda late. I'm sure if we were walking near the clubs in Chelsea we'd have seen even more people.   Adam said that it's because Manhattan is just an island of rich people, and rich people are almost always attractive. According to the great Israeli mathematician J. E. Nissenboim, there is a genetic reason for this: the first generation rich guy, a self-made man, is ugly as sin, he made his fortune in toilets or something. Because he's rich, he gets to pick any woman he wants, and of course, he will pick a very attractive one. So their children will at least be alright looking, and born into money. They too will get to pick attractive mates, and on and on it goes until the ugly is bred out of the family. If not bred out, then at least become recessive.   And here is the sad conclusion: Humble Jay Gatz understood that Daisy's laugh was full of money. Jay Gatz becomes Gatsby, and still isn't good enough for her. Will Humble Ho Ying find happiness with some attractive girl in Manhattan, with silver dollars tinkling out of her throat? No. The most I can hope for is that my great-grandchildren, if I ever have any, will have a chance at what I want. As for me, I'll probably end up with some Queens girl who doesn't know her Merlot from her Bordeaux. Feh, I don't know French either. But this Queens girl... I'll be lucky if she speaks unaccented English. And I don't mean she'll have a charming European accent either. Nope, I certainly won't enter into American society.   Twenty years from now, if I'm still alive, you'll find me at some old man bar on 162nd street (in Queens), not a tooth in my head, smoking Old Golds or Mavericks or Viceroys, drinking Bud. The memories of 20 dollar cigarettes, 10 dollar port for dessert, and a certain Daisy I knew, will be faded like photos you leave in the car.                    Just got back from fat catting around town with Adam. We went to a Belgian Beer Bar, then had Indian. Each time I eat Indian I'm completely clueless as to what I'm eating, though I had something tonight with chickpeas that was delicious. It was part of the 'Kashmiri Dinner' (mmm... disputed).   Also went to the last day of job training today. It was complete bullshit. The guy spent the first hour and a half telling us the economics of the undercover security trade, which was not on the test. Then we watched a couple of videos from the 80's designed to help merchants prepare against crime; the narrator sounded a lot like Robert Stack. The last part of the class, the guy just had a copy of the test in his hand, and basically told us the answers of some of the questions. Unfortunately there were a lot of questions for which he didn't prepare us. I ended up getting an 88 out of 100 on the test, meaning I passed, and will return on Wednesday to be assigned. Some people in the room took half an hour to complete this 25 question multiple choice, true/false test.    Example: What is a class C fire? The guy didn't mention that at all. I think I had decided sometime during training on Tuesday that my mom is out $169 bucks and that the whole thing was a scam. Well, at least I feel like I'm doing something, just like when I first got home and applied to five jobs a week (and not hearing back from any of them).                   I have just finished reading the novel Portnoy's Complaint by Philip Roth. It's a good book, you don't have to be Jewish to enjoy it, or to sympathize with the main character. There's this great 'fish out of water' bit in there from which I'll quote (the setup is that he's in Davenport, Iowa to have Thanksgiving with his goyishe girlfriend's family. He had never been to the midwest):   'Then at the railroad station her father says, 'How do you do, young man?' and I of course answer, 'Thank you.' Why is he acting so nice? Because he has been forewarned (which I don't know whether to take as an insult or a blessing), or because he doesn't know yet? Shall I say it then, before we even get into the car? Yes, I must! I can't go on living a lie! 'Well, it sure is nice being here in Davenport, Mr. and Mrs. Campbell, what with my being Jewish and all...' '   That's the thing about the midwest. People are suspiciously nice. It's hard to say whether they are actually that nice, or if they are just being fake. Being a New Yorker, I automatically assume that they're fake (generalizing, of course).   This book also made me think about being Chinese. I came to the conclusion long ago that I didn't make a very good Chinaman, and did not even make a good 'pan-asian.' Even at the age of five or six, when my cousins had all mastered eating with chopsticks, I had already given up on chopsticks and insisted on eating with western utensils. I vaguely recall one of my aunts telling my mother that I should be forced to practice with chopsticks until my hands fell off. Anyway, the last few girls that I have pursued have been white, and the majority of these girls have been blonds. Have I been overzealous in my desire to assimilate into American society? Do I, like Portnoy, want to somehow symbolically enter into America? Just food for thought.
