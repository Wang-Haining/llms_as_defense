Somebody wants you to go to a website? Hmm, www.tubgirl.com, eh? Sounds enticing and sexy, doesn't it? OK, I'll bite, just type it in... Oh dear God, what is that!!!!, you exclaim, closing the browser in horror.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although you can purge your IE cache to expunge any physical traces of your visit after the shaking stops, you&nbsp;will never&nbsp;get Norton Systemworks to install inside your tortured mind.  If this scenario sounds familiar, then chances are you were, at one point in your life, tubgirled.&nbsp; Although some people are ultimately able to laugh at their trauma, others never quite seem to be the same after viewing that enigma wrapped up in a mystery wrapped up in a brown geyser.&nbsp; I have noticed two general reactions to the tubgirl phenomenon, which I will dub 'A' and 'B'.   TYPE A: A type 'A' tubgirl victim&nbsp;was initially horrified and confused by what they saw, and, in fact, may not be entirely certain what they just looked at.&nbsp; However, any morbid curiosity on their behalf will be quickly swallowed up by one single, all-consuming mania: 'Who can I show this too?'&nbsp; My theory is that a type 'A' tubgirl victim can only survive what thy have just seen by passing its unholy&nbsp;e-miasma along to another victim.&nbsp; A good analogy to help you understand this would be the movie  The Ring .&nbsp;   TYPE B:&nbsp;Statistical analysis of a sample of&nbsp;type 'B' tubgirl victims reveals that most of them are exposed to the phenomenon through a type 'A' acquiantance.&nbsp; The type 'B' victim's symptoms display themselves similarly for the first few minutes, and they may be confused with type 'A' symptoms by the casual observer.&nbsp; However, the type B victim never feels the need to pass the burden of seeing along.&nbsp; Instead, they feel a need to understand who, how&nbsp;and why tubgirl is pressing down on them like a crushing weight.&nbsp; Long-term morbidity data is forthcoming.   My research into this matter has caused me to speculate about the existence of type 'C' victims, for want of a better term, who do not seem to be affected by the TG miasma.&nbsp; My best working hypothesis is that these 'victims' are not fully human and therefore immune to the condition; however, I can not state this with confidence until I have performed several comparative autopsies.&nbsp; In this matter, I can only hope that Seamus's girlfriend Stacy will come through for me.&nbsp;   In conclusion, to all you type A's out there, rest easy--&nbsp;the danger has already passed.&nbsp; Type B's, you are in my prayers, and we are hard at work on a cure for your condition.&nbsp; Type C's, if you really exist, please come forward.&nbsp; And finally, for those out there who have seen no trauma gushing forth as a fountain&nbsp;&nbsp;as of yet-- if, one day, you see the tub loading on a computer screen, avert your eyes and save your soul!!            \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
