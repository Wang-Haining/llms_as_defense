I saw it with Julie, shed seen it before and when it ended this song played:  All around me are familiar faces  Worn out places  Worn out faces  Bright and early for the daily races  Going no where  Going no where  Their tears are filling up their glasses  No expression  No expression  Hide my head I wanna drown my sorrow  No tomorrow  No tomorrow  And I find it kind of funny  I find it kind of sad  The dreams in which I’m dying are the best I’ve ever had  I find it hard to tell you  I find it hard to take  When people run in circles its a very very  Mad world  Mad world  Children waiting for the day they feel good  Happy birthday  Happy birthday  And I feel the way that every child should  Sit and listen  Sit and listen  Went to school and I was very nervous  No one knew me  No one knew me  Hello teacher tell me what’s my lesson  Look right through me  Look right through me  And I find I kind of funny  I find it kind of sad  The dreams in which I’m dying are the best I’ve ever had  I find it hard to tell you  I find it hard to take  When people run in circles its a very very  Mad world  Mad world  Enlarging your world  Mad world   And i sat up at the credits started and could utter only one syllable...'wooaah...' and i kinda just kept saying it over and over again. Its such an amazing movie, its sooo powerful in that it makes you wanna just say 'woah' over and over again. Im listening to the song above right now and i feel so strange, its so wierd. I want to be an actress about a billion times more now... Ok im gonna go and watch it again maybe...i dont know...i dont klnow what to do with myself now!  I wanna call michael, but he's still in new york and i dont have a number. The feeling comes and goes, and then my emotions kick in where i get sooo happy. i dunno, the feeling has kinda faded away, so hopedully thats a good sign... In other news, The Chad arrives today at 11:30am, its 11:02 now...dispite myself im kinda exited, i havnt seen him in a forever. Also Jared Leto is perfectly, typically a dreamboat... As is Jake Gyllenhaal... xoxo                   You know i dont actually know why im blogging lol. I domnt have anything on my mind...or anything id like to publish anyways. DOnt forget to read my post directy below this one. I doubt i'll publish this, u will know if i hve though...cos you wontbe reading this if i dont. I just wrote realy long entry in my diary...i wish i could share it with someone, i may later, but there are 3 people who would be very very very upset with what im feeling...it probably isnt you if u r reading this. I feel like I have a confession to make before i can move on with what i feel is becoming a new me. I never really liked led zeppelin. i really didnt, that is until this weekend. on the 6 hour car ride home yesterday, it was dark, everybody, david, spencer, garrett and katie grogan were all asleep, and mrs.bray was driving the car, so we werent talking. i think it was about 10:30, and led zeppelin was playing, led zeppelin IV i believe. For the first time ever i really liked it, it may have been to do with my mood. the car rides there and back were very very long, but the hours went by so slowly and peacefully for some reason. i had a lot of time to thing, to debate my beliefs, what i strongly believ to be right, what i want to prevent, and what has already happened that isnt fair. one thing isnt fair, and thats that i allways want what i cant have, this has nothing to do with matt, this is to do with another guy, i dont think any of you will guess who it is, and im in not wrong mind to tell you, that would be a mistake. but i think that because this guy is so restricted, by 3 people, those people mentioned above. 2 of them have made it very very very clear their stand point on this guy and me, and one of them ive never met, but im pretty sure she wouldnt like it much at all. i just feel like all these restrictions, they arent fair, but if there werent such restrictions on this guy i wouldnt like him. its the danger factor that i love. What i realize on the car ride back was I loe a bad boy, one who im really not allowed to like or date, or touch. i also like a guy who is mean to me at first and then becomes really nice, because then i have no expectations and its such a shock that the ground comes from under my feet and i fall into his spell lol. ok enough of these ramblings, i have to go and bbq, like i said i dont know if i will publish this, i may have said too much, plus i dont know what ui wrote, im too lazy to proof read. xoxo                 I havnt blogged in a few days, for a few reasons. 1 is nothing much has happened, another is ive been studying for finals and the last one is ive been baby sitting, so there really hasnt been much time. I have time now because i have finished studying for my biology final, and our visitors went to the ebach and so we r waiting for them to get home so we can have a bbq. They were supposed to be back 44 minutes ago.  Tofay was so relaxing, besides the part where my alarm went off at 9am and i studied. after studying i sat in a rubber ring in my pool and finished macbeth, then i lay down on a lilo in my pool and fell asleep listening to music, it was wonderful :)  I went to a graduation party last night for my brothers friend Nate, billy kaplan and evan alpaugh were there, it was fun, we talked, not like deep conversations, but we did talk. My life is so boring right now, i wish something exiting would happen like getting picked for a movie while i was walking down the street or something. im not gonna do miss.california because the time limit ran out. it ran out because everytime i asked my mother if we could talk about it she said 'later' or 'tomorrow' or she walked away. she claims to have not done that purposfully but i think her grand plan was to put off talking about it until it was too late, and her ruse worked. im soooooo...lacking in anything engaging to do. im gonna go read blogs, bye bye for now, :-D xoxo                 My cousins left at 7:30am today...ive stopped crying but i have this huge heavy feeling, i miss them so much. we had such a good time...they are the most awesome people that i know...and whats cooler is they are familly! They really are like my sisters...exept i only see them once a year. next summer is going to be incredible! im going to ireland with my familly for 2 weeks and then they go home and i stay on for another week or so. i wont go into details of all of our plans (we already figured everything out lol) but it looks to be a big drunken blur lol. and then fiona and Aoifa come back with me for about 2 weeks and we party it up la style....its enough to keep me going thru the year! Its so wierd, they talk about how much they hate ireland...i love it, its so comforting.   Besides all that im starting to get depressed because i keep on seeing all these back to school commercials...im not ready to go back to school! we only have like a month left!! i really cant be bothered with 10th grade! ugh!!!! this summer has been going by sooooo fast! its kind of creepy! toodles xoxo                 o...holy...shit... I have the feeling, and the feeling has never been wrong. The one person, in my entire life, who has so cruely rip;ped me of my heart and pride and esteem, has moved on. He hasnt said anything, but the feeling, i have the dreaded, god awful, forsaken feeling that ive had so many other times before...the self same feeling the clued me in on conrad, john creasy, and michael. The same feeling that has never been wrong in all the years its wispered in my ear. Why should it be that every time i talk to this person, this person that you all know, i start to cry. I know why, because he doesnt still get those butterflys that i get, and i dont think that he looks in anticipation to see if ive responded as i do with him. im so sick of my love life! my fuckign phsyci was right!im in dire love trouble, and i feel like jumping off a bridge. i feel like drving back to shaver, jumping on a wake board and falling straight over the dam.  I hate that one person can make me feel this, i dotn get how one person can have so much control over me. i feel dead.                 Okay, i have discussed this with julia, but no one else. im not sure who else is affected by this, but its going to drive me insane!!! eMy mother says that her and a bunch of other mothers have desided that none of us are allowed on our computers past 11:30pm!!! nooottt cooooll! The best conversations happen in the dead of the night when every1 is exhausted and not sure what is going on! As julia said, 'do they really want us to go and get knocked up???' which naturally is the answer...if im not online past 11:30 than what can i do besides have sex and end up knocked up??? lol thats why we love julia :-D   I would just like to say SORRY if i upset anybody this vacation, i can only think of one person, but if there r more im sorry to them aswell.   i dunno where that came from  anyways back to the internet...my mother gioes to bed at like 9 or 10, so how is shwe gonna make me sign off??? people who are affected (and i know it is alot of people) we need to boycott our famillies! WHO ARE THEY TO DECIDE WHEN WE DO OR WHEN WE DONT TALK TO OUR FRIENDS??? i say that if this comes into play, instead of talking online, we all call each other!!! ok gotta go xoxo muah          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
