So it is with great joy that i am going (ceterus paribas) to the south of France in August for 2 weeks, and bringing my chick there.   Well check this out, when she went and asked for her vacation time, they told her they would count the Saturday she was taking off (yes, that saturday, the WEEKEND day) as a vacation day...... So lets get this straight:  - She works Monday through Friday, 7 hours a day, for a grand total of 35 legal working hours. - On her paychecks, she gets 2.5 something days off a month, for a grand total of 30 days off per year - the legal 5 weeks vacation in France. - and no, she doesn't work and hasn't worked any Saturday.. and has not had any absences for not being at work on saturdays.  So this is beautiful! I just imagine myself in this situation, where i work all year, monday through friday, and when it comes to taking vacation, they count my saturdays in my vacation days! Isn't the weekend supposed to be free time where you don't work? WTF! When asked about this little rule they have (which in the end helps them out, because you can take less work days off, hence work more for SHIT pay), these people said that it was an internal rule that the director (that bitch) implemented, so they couldn't do shit about it. Well guess what..  I've been investigating the French Law.  And you know what, what they are doing is LEGAL. You see, French companies can actually calculate your vacation time two ways: 1) by the days you actually worked (jours ouvr√©s) 2) by the days you COULD HAVE WORKED (jours ouvrables). the latter means that even if you don't work on saturday, they can count the saturday in your vacation time...  NOW THIS IS FUCKED UP. The only day they can't take off you is Sunday..... I mean i know this is a lot of fuzz over one day, but imagine how PO you would be if you have to take your saturday as a day in your vacation, when usually it's your weekend anyways and you don't work. And I mean you could try to just take the week days, but you are FORCED take your saturday as well, you have no fucking CHOICE.   I am really starting to hate this fucking place..  But then I looked at my paycheck and saw there was a slight difference. I get 2.08 days off a month for a total of 25 days off a year. Those days are Monday through Friday (5 days) She gets 2.5 days off a month for a total of 30 days off a year. My assumption is that from the beginning, they gave her vacation time on her saturdays, which would make the extra day vacation she gets a month (25/5=5 days of work/vacation; her 30/5=vacation based on 6 working days, hence Mon - Sat.)  I still don't understand why they do this, whatever, fuck it, it's Friday and I don't care, I'm on my weekend in a couple of hours.  That's my bitching for today. I'll have more later - the fumes are still hot.                                    Well.. It has been way too long since I've bitched about one thing or another, but truth is, I haven't had much to bitch about... Imagine that.. It's a sad state of affairs ! I've been off to Denmark on vacation, and we have moved to our new apartment as well.. I guess I've simply been to occupied to complain.  Anyway, now I'm back at work (damn it), and already now various things are starting to make my piss boil - that coinciding with Dimitri leaving for vacation tonight is not exactly helping out the situation. I know.. yes.. I  know  shit will hit the fan as soon as his dumb ass has left the building.. Printing problems, vira shit, and general PC hardware problems. I've got to be honest with you guys, I'm not one bit too happy about him requiring vacation...  Moving.. god I hate moving. Actually I like it once all boxes/furniture have been moved - but moving heavier-than-titanic furniture (fridge) three floor down is a no-go.. that, all while it is 35 degrees Celsius outside in the burning sun just kills me. It's all done now though.. and I love the place! We just miss a few furniture for the kitchen and then we are all set to go.  Alright, I'd better get back to work.. gotta write that code.. doesn't make much of a difference..                                They salesreps at our office are using these headsets with their telephones, and recently we ran out.. We purchase batches of them every now and then.. Those industry standard don't come cheap though.. They are about &euro;100 a pop ! Yeah, a ridiculous price for something pretty basic..  The last couple of months, we have changed a lot of them around the office (I don't know what the hell those salesreps are doing with them). Last week, we ran out of new headsets.. We requested upper-management to purchase some new.. Bad call.. When our CEO saw the price on those headsets, he made an unpredictable move. 6 months ago (or so) we tested out Skype for inter-office calls, and for that purpose we bought a shitload of cheapo pc-headsets (those for a couple a euros a piece) -  Yeah.. That's right.. I trip to  urlLink Castorama  later, and Dim and I are sitting and removing mini-jacks from the pc-headsets, combining the them with the connectors from the other headsets.. Electrical-tape, choc blocks (thanks Lasse) and a lot of patience.. A real MacGyver solution..   Result: A working headset for our phones, ugly as hell - for less than 2 euros a pop.  Pictures to follow....                               I recieved this email from my friend Paul R. I find it so true and so in synch with what i feel that I have left it untouched - so here you go.  PS: Lewis, don't think I'm plagiarizing, this is for the good of everyone.  Hello, my name is Lewis and I suffer from the guilt of not forwarding 50 billion fucking chain letters sent to me by people who actually believe that if you send them on, a poor 6-year-old girl in Arkansas with a breast on her forehead will be able to raise enough money to have it removed before her redneck parents sell her to a traveling freak show.  Do you honestly believe that Bill Gates is going to give you, and everyone to whom you send 'his' email, $1000?  How stupid are we?  'Ooooh, looky here! If I scroll down this page and make a wish, I'll get laid by a model I just happen to run into the next day!'  What a bunch of bullshit.  Maybe the evil chain letter leprechauns will come into my house and sodomize me in my sleep for not continuing a chain letter that was started by Peter in 5 AD and brought to this country by midget pilgrims on the Mayflower.  Fuck 'em.  If you're going to forward something, at least send me something mildly amusing. I've seen all the 'send this to 10 of your closest friends,and this poor, wretched excuse for a human being will  somehow receive a nickel from some omniscient being' letters about 90 times.  I don't fucking care.  Show a little intelligence and think about what you're actually contributing to by sending out these forwards. Chances are, it's our own unpopularity.  The point being? If you get some chain letter that's threatening to leave you shagless or luckless for the rest of your life, delete it. If it's funny, send it on.  Don't piss people off by making them feel guilty about a leper in Botswana with no teeth who has been tied to the ass of a dead elephant for 27 years and whose only salvation is the 5 cents per letter he'll receive if you forward this email.  Now forward this to everyone you know.  Otherwise, tomorrow morning your underwear will turn carnivorous and will  consume your genitals  Have a nice day.  P.S. Send me a 100 bucks ASAP.
