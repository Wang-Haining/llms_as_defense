It was Teaz night at bargo courtesy of Addict mobile and Deepa was one of the teaz patrol. It was all fun fun and then there were mini contests, a girl won for herself a brandnew erricson fone by just 'picking the mannequins balls'(har har har). I shouldve came up there and gave my self a chance to pick balls, bwehehehe ( like alvin's balls for example, one of deepas friends there.)  It was suppose to be a getaway sans office entities but i saw Freaky Ricky wandering around the Gay'ol Nakpil Orosa sts. Me and geeta talked about boys, how insane they are, what they want and how to read their minds. And soon got tired of it , we just gurgled our san migs away till 3 am. Deepa never returned so geeta went home and me and noel stayed in the streets..ehehehhe.. I met some of his gay friends and ate squid fuckin expensive balls.   Geeta set me up with this gerald. He just texted last night but i was mighty tired and my body aches so i apologized for the delay of the answers and told him i would gladly text him back tomorrow. i hope he's nice and not an asshole. I have a lengthy list of assholes in my book, i dont want to add more names on it. oh well.  Its 5 am . We slept yesterday 4pm and woke up 1pm. Now I have a mid shift which is 2pm later to think about. Now How Am I gonna survive? ........................     PEABERRY COFFEE                      Yesterday wasnt my day.. pci was all fucked up for a couple of hours and i am dying of famine. I was reliant on the atm machine in keeping my money and they fuck up and i get hungry...pci equitable havent heard of back up systems i guess.. but what the fuck i got my money 7pm na. I was dying from hunger and so i went to jollibee and ate my dinner breakfast lunch represented by the chickenjoy meal then off to glorietta to meet geeta my cousin. We were headed for paranaque to drink, even though i still couldnt get it i joined them. The place was nice tho,  martys  , as they call it. It has a live band that will send you in a manic deppressive state due to the que of their songs. I met geetas friends and their okay. bitin nga eh sayang pero okay lang. Twas nice to meet other poeple again. Best of the best, marty's supa cheap! we were drinking up our guts and eating at the same time and man the bill was ultra cheap.  best place for manic depression, go to marty's thats in paranaque, read it QC folks, drink cheap go to marty's paranaque! AHAHAHAHA!   Shet long time no post in this bloggy o mine. Im quite busy with work and some stuff. Its near xmas time and its getting colder and colder. i have been drinking a whole fucken lot to ease the tension.. ever wonder what we look like when drinkin drunk? here are pics...:     thats elton, me and larry ever drinkin as could be. later we will again be merry.                     Today absent TL ko. Tapos syempre as usual panget yung account. Yung pagkain pininyahang manok na may pagka curry. 4 na lang di pa ko kumota. Nag plano kami ni ginpao ng inuman sa sabado, sa aming humble shack, im sure larry and paul are gonna be there. Harsh eh yung mga kaibigan naming pupunta, puro lalaki walang babae, ako lang. Mukhang masaya to. Mukhang susuko nanaman ako ke paul pag dating sa inuman. Mukhang sira nanaman diet ko. Mukhang mula hanggang gabi nanaman ito hanggang umaga. Maaya nga si vera.  Nakakatawa...hahahaha...wala lang. Gusto ko namang tumawa, kasi inaantok na ako. 7:39 am na, gising pa ako.  Nagbasa ako ng  urlLink Bulgar  at me nagpakamatay pala sa sm manila. Taga mapua.Hard. Dahil siguro ito sa pressure ng magulang. Basta ako nung na pressure ako ng magulang ko, lumayas ako. Suwail, pero dun ako mabubuhay eh. Ayokong mamatay. I Love life, i want to live. i exist to live and give life. Though there are a lot of instances that i thought of ending my life, but realized that its not worth it. I am the child of the universe, sabi nga naman ni max ehrmann, (to quote from his obra, The Disederata') and i deserve to be happy. I may not find the happiness that i am looking for from my family members, i'll look for it someplace else first in order to continue to live and live my dream. And what is my dream? To be happy and contented with myself regardless of what i become in the years to come. To be able to smile and say that i am truly a survivor and that I can give love to other poeple because I have loved myself enough to spread it. Labo, antok na ko.  Nag asses kami ni noel kanina before going to the office tungkol sa pag titiwala sa tao, and i remembered a certain individual who became one of the factors kung bakit ako nagkatrauma in terms of pagtitiwala. Ang nasabi ko na lang sa dami ba naman ng tumarantado sa akin di ba naman ako matututo. And after that was a good and honest laugh, that i have indeed learned from the things ive been lacking before.   Ngayong oras na to, nag iisip na ko kung ano ang susuotin ko mamaya sa office. Goodluck sa lalagyan ko ng damit, makalat nanaman ito mamaya.  Syempre at ang picture of the day, kakalimutan ko ba? mamaya na lang tamad ako maghanap                                ass kissing was never my game and never will be.period.  ____________________________________________________________  Quite an interesting week. First, in the very heart of katipunan, where the usual traffic is, we saw 2 very cute guys in their not so cute and OA car last thursday ( a baby blue 'over shocked' civic esi with that pathetic www.blahblah.com/his name sticker shit, to make it look like a racing car) one in the passenger seat is married (reez saw the ring) and the free one was the driver named jmariano. 3 girls at the back, thats moi, gen my friend and reez my sisters friend got a little bit infatuated so we were turning our heads in the car's direction. Migs on the other hand felt empathy and started to make us write down our names in a paper...the only brave soul to have her number written there was gen, not because she wanted to fool with the guy but to help us, mga friends nya na scared shit to give out our numbers. And so it happened, migs gave gen s number to the guy in the baby blue pathetic car and we started texting... tonight is when were finally going to meet the man.  Anyway after the flirting-with-the-other-car thing I decided to have a decent night out with my girlfriends way back UST soccer days, had a ball drank beer to death until 2:30 with them then made senti with carlo in whistlestop until 5 am. My crew (naks crew!) went to a different party where i was supposed to go as well but opted not to for the simple reason that i dont want to see the arrogant whore that made a fool out of my 2 friends for i was in the verge of giving her yung sampal na makakaitsa sa kanya hanggang mars you know. So there, temper was in a a real high nung gabi ba yun kaya i decided to take a break and unglobal myself for the weekend (UNGLOBAL HUH).  Sunday I recieved a text message from Ivan for some strange reason. Got pissed coz theres a possibility na me nag trip sakin. Its either gary or some guy who knew i liked him. If I get to see who that is Ima tear him to peices i swear. To text him back for that instance is an embarrasing thing for me, since ima be breaking my code. The responsible guys gonna pay who ever that is i swear.  So yun lang                     drill: don't reply. copy and paste in a new  bulletin and put your answers, then click send.  haha.
