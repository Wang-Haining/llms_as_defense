They never succeed.  I just realized that no matter how okay you think you are you will still feel better when you've talked to your mom. Well, provided it was a good talk and you didn't have an argument with her, for once. Even if she tells you that she's too busy to send you a letter [She's a 60-year-old government employee who will be retiring this December, how busy can she get?] or she can't send you text messages because her mobile phone's broken [I thought it was the kids who were supposed to say this to their moms?].  All thanks to a quick phone call courtesy of my brother, who wanted  me  to make a follow up with our mother about something  he  needs. I learned that my other brother is doing very well. He is now with his wife and kids, tending to a very modest but pretty successful food delivery business. I still feel a pang of regret knowing I wasn’t much help to him financially, which is where he needed help the most.  My sister is starting school next week. Her last year in high school! My mother said she would like it if M takes up B.S. Nursing because there’s a huge demand for nurses overseas. In my younger days I would’ve objected to that logic. But today I told her of my plans to work abroad in the very near future. Only then did I realize how serious I am about it. Where’d the patriotism, the activism, the anti-imperialism of my college days gone to? [insert snicker here]   My mother also mentioned the application for immigration to New Zealand she has been pushing on me for years now. Had to tell her finally that I lost the papers a few weeks after she sent them to me. I guess this is the only response she can think of when I told her my woes about working here. I bet she still can’t figure out why I took a 40% pay-cut to take an entry-level job straight out of the junior-managerial position I left last year. I know it’s not easy to accept that my reason in taking this job is because  I am tired of writing for a living.   Which brings me to the topic of my job…Let’s just say that today I tried to make this office a better place to work in. I aired my sentiments to one of the individuals that evaluates our performance. I even had a co-worker proofread it to check if I was too harsh or un-diplomatic. Long story short, I think I made a mistake. I think when they said this company had an open-door policy they only meant that very few offices here have doors, and those doors are hardly ever closed.   No matter how good I try, I always seem to come up short according to the myriad performance matrices, evaluation standards and quality assurance criteria. Doesn’t matter if I don’t use up any of my breaks----if the system fucks up and says that I went on over-break for 300 hours, the system is  still  right. I can only be grateful that I have a considerate and intelligent supervisor. Then again, the supervisor can only do so much  because the system is still going to be right.  Yeah right. Let me take a few moments to think if it’s worth my energy to effect change within the system. If not, then I guess it’s time to leave the system. Deadline: July 31, 2004.  Meantime, I’m going back to my writing. I guess there’s no disconnecting me from my craft, too.          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
