  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic:\n\n       A California judge ordered the release of the divorce papers of Illinois Republican Senate candidate  urlLink Jack Ryan  and his former wife, America’s sweetheart,  urlLink Jeri Ryan , the vivacious, lovable superstar beauty of such unforgettable classics as 'Star Trek: Voyager,' 'Matlock: the Final Seduction,' and 'Boston Public' and the revelations are quite steamy.  It seems the conservative investment banker has a taste for what he calls “avant-garde nightclubs.” And by “avant-garde,” Ryan means nightclubs that offer mattressed cubicles, “cages, whips and other apparatus hanging from the ceiling.”   According to Jeri, her ex “wanted me to have sex with him there, with another couple watching, I refused. Respondent asked me to perform a sexual activity upon him, and he specifically asked other people to watch. I was very upset. We left the club and respondent apologized, said that I was right and he would never insist that I go to a club again. He promised it was out of his system.'  Way to treat a lady right, Respondent!   'Then during a trip to Paris he took me to a sex club in Paris, without telling me where we were going. I told him I thought it was out of his system. I told him he had promised me we would never go. People were having sex everywhere. I cried, I was physically ill. Respondent became very upset with me, and told me it was not a 'turn-on' for me to cry. I could not get over the incident, and my loss of any attraction to him as a result.'  For the sake of fairness, let’s listen to Ryan’s defense: 'What dad wouldn't do the same thing I did?'  Um, good question. But what I don’t understand is why these episodes repulse Jeri when she has to look at Fyvush Finkel every day.    .   Regardless of daddy’s avant-garde escapades, this douchebag will be defeated come November if he doesn't end up dropping out of the race sooner.  urlLink Barack Obama , Ryan’s opponent, is top notch—truly one of the best Senate candidates the Democrats have fielded in years. Obama (rhymes with Osama) was the first Af-Am editor of the Harvard Law Review, then worked as a community organizer in Chicago, a professor at University of Chicago Law School and now he’s a state senator. Obama's appeal is broad and is reflected by commanding leads in every major poll.   In general I think scandals are stupid.  But still, one can’t help wanting payback for the way the Republicans degraded the greatest decade in recent memory, the 1990s.                   The reviews are in: Washington is raving about Saddam Hussein’s fabulous new look! It’s hard to believe that just seven months ago, brutish American forces drove a chunky, unkempt Saddam out of his dirty hole. But just look at him now—the deposed despot has gone from flab to fab. Fashion critic/Director of Iraq’s Special Tribunal, Salem Chalabi, said Saddam “had lost weight” and “looks fine.” Sure does.  Meanwhile, on the west coast, the fashionistas at the  urlLink L.A. Times  had this to say of Saddam's extreme makeover:   “In sharp contrast with the scruffy, disheveled Saddam shown on the December video being examined for lice, the ousted former president was nattily dressed in a charcoal sports coat and crisp white shirt. His salt-and-pepper beard had been neatly trimmed, giving him a look as dignified as a literature professor. His dark hair appeared to have been blow-dried.”  Yum. A lock for this year’s best-dressed lists, the Washington Post calls Saddam’s new style “combative but courteous.”   So is courteous the new black?                   Oops, Republican Congresswoman and international embarrassment Katherine Harris did it again.   Our most trusted vote-counter, most beloved citrus heiress and most qualified Congresswoman has left some Midwesterners “dumbfounded” with her claim that a terrorist plotted to blow up the power grid serving the bustling metropolis of  urlLink Carmel, Indiana  .  At a rally for the same George W. Bush she impartially worked for as Florida campaign chair, Harris “either shared a closely held secret or passed along second-hand information as fact” by revealing to the 600 person audience their impending doom.   Officials in Washington and Indiana have substantiated her assertion.  A staffer from the House Intelligence committee admitted that he “had heard of no such plot.”   While local sheriff Doug Carter contended, 'I have no information to corroborate any of that.'  So how does U.S. Rep. Harris defend herself? 'I was told in an open, group (AA meeting) that a recent situation threatened a Midwestern community (Bush’s presidency) and that it had been diffused (did I douche today?), I regret that I had no knowledge of the sensitive nature of this situation (I’m a total idiot) and any undue concern this may have caused (Pussies!).'   Lady Miss K went on to say that on her watch, the US has thwarted 100 terrorist attacks since 2001. 'Actually, it's been more than 100, It's classified...obviously not classified to me...but things I can't go into details about.'  Sadly, Katherine Harris does not serve on the Intelligence committee.                    Hurricane James is *proudly* introducing a new feature called 'Dykes I Like' where exceptional L Words will be periodically spotlighted.   Out of the 62 women in the House, only one is openly gay. The big dyke is Tammy Baldwin, a three-term Democrat from Wisconsin and by all accounts, she looks great these days. According to those policy wonks at the Advocate, Baldwin's 'once fussy hairdo is now softly tousled. Her boxy suits have given way to fashionable separates. In her fitted jacket, tailored slacks, and sleek high heels, she is polished but not slick. With an easy smile and a soft, feminine voice, she betrays not a hint of radicalism in appearance or delivery.'  But this Tammy is more than just a pretty face. Her showdown earlier this year with  urlLink Rick Santorum  on 'Face the Nation' proved Tammy could really kick ass, but that's not to suggest Baldwin's legislative focus is limited to gay issues and courting the polygamist/bestiality vote. The centerpiece of Baldwin’s progressive agenda, buoyed by a coalition of student, labor and minority interests, has always been the establishment of a single-payer, universal health care system.   Congratulations Tammy Baldwin, you're officially a Dyke I Like.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
