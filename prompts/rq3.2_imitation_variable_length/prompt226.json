Enough dosage of this would definitely blind, numb and dumb us. It will make us feel nothing but its inhibitions. And that I think is the only bliss it could offer, it makes us feel nothing. We consistently become apathetic to all the norms. We become one with our inner self.    ------------------------------------   contributed by :  tha motha fuckin' grasshoppah    Christianity in itself is a freakin’ stupid story altogether that I feel so sickened about it because it is obvious that it is just a story based on all the lies that the people of the church would want us to believe. I’m not saying this because I hate the christian religion that I grew up with, it’s just how the whole freakin’ story is trying to mold each person with lies, lies, and lies. Take this one example. Mary, the mother of Christ, could do nothing but shed a tear when her son Jesus was being tortured to death by his agressors. Who in the right mind would believe this? MILLIONS! Why? Because she has been described as an idol that we should worship. But if you scrutinize it deeply, the female mammals would even give their lives to protect their children. She did not even raised her voice in protest of what the romans are doing to her son and even when the jews sentenced her son to death by crucifiction. If I was the mother of Jesus Christ in these times I’d take a fucking blowtorch and burn everybody’s asses in that freaking place.  So what I’m exactly saying is, for every action there is always an exact and opposite reaction.  Why would God send his son to die on the cross for the sins of all mankind? Why not kill a turkey instead? Anyway, He's God... that can be done! You do the math!   ------pang addict ano?    (gawa ni glen 'scammer' disu)            As i was sucking this big lollipop cookie while writing this uneventful way of screaming on top of your lungs aching to be heard and be noticed for the great many things that you have shared which is writing, and yet i am always compelled to feel that greatness and aura of independence in the cool streets of baguio. All alone, no one to look after you, hell they care you sleep at Burnham Park and wake up still wearing same unwashed office clothes and yet get the smiles and the non-chalant feel of fellow workers who have no idea of what underpaid is and yet still are compassionate and&nbsp;dedicated with there&nbsp;means of living and&nbsp;about their way of life.  Not as liberal as what we hoped it to be, well, it is a choice and lifestyle. maybe its because of weather that it seems so perfect for a little birdie like me. Or maybe it was a wrong assumption of a birdie getting the poopoo days counting up here, ei?  The nightlife has yet to see the fresh feel of my wings brushing in their faces down the crowded and rowdy streets of session, legarda and nevada square. I love it.  It was an epitome of the real orgasmic wings of freedom indeed. better watch out dorm boys birds peeping down ready for the plunge of the hot, entangling shower of hot water on smooth skin with hairs falling down the drain. Well, heres a cold tub for you to sulk in my friend.             “Heaven and Earth are impartial, they treat all creation like straw dogs”  This phrase serves as an ultimate reality blow to all those 'arrogantly conceited' people, whom in some inexplicable manner succumb themselves with the idea that they should be accumulating all the possible materialistic wants that they oblige themeselves to need and bleakly suppose that the heavens and earth both connived to give them biased treatment whenever they were not able to grab what they’ve been ravenously craving for. And also in the case of the catatonic and neurotic-depressive people whom “in the slightest provocation would leap at each other’s throat” (sorry Jessica Zafra) only because they feel so abandoned and not living and as always blames the inequality of life.  Well all the predicaments that we are situated into occurred simply because we have contributed something, even a very minute factor, that resulted to that specific dilemma. These wild concoctions over us being unfairly dealt with by the Heavens is the traditional scapegoat of those losers who claim that they should be the victors.            It’s cold outside and you sit in your garage… double shot of Jack Daniels coming right up. Straight-no-chaser, just how you like it. Puffing on your Marlboro 100’s… red. You have a grin on your face. I love the smell of clams on your grill… while dried leaves fall all around the place. What are you staring at? You stare into space like you’re looking at the woman of your dreams. Why do you have tears in those beautiful brown eyes? Your brother sits with you, talking carelessly… about how things will be alright. About how we all face hard times in our lives. Why won’t you let go of that bottle? Why do you smoke so heavily? Why do you kill yourself? You just sit there numb… dead from the inside-out.  Like an empty shell impervious to cold.  I shake my head… you poor soul. You are so lost. Why are you alone in this?  Long night. Tough week. You lose yourself over that red bell pepper with cheese wrapped in egg  and cold milk straight out of the fridge. Your mom is talking to you… you have no idea what about, your head is pounding. Your mouth so dry. Hang-over. Straight into your mouth goes an Advil out form the closet. In and out of your ears is your mom’s early morning lecture. Do you wanna talk about it? She asks. A big gulp of milk to wash down that oily egg concoction. It all wants to come out again. It’s a weekend. Weekends mean no work… no greasy fingers and dirty tool boxes and screwdrivers that you turn and turn, ‘til your hands hurt and bleed and makes you not want to see another mechanical tool ever again.  Relief. An escape from the things that occupy you and makes you forget. Forget about your past. And how it betrayed you. Forget about how we all face hard times in our lives. Like what your brother said. It’s a weekend. And you remember well on weekends.   I made you stand up from where you were sitting. I threw your Jack Daniels and Marlboro 100’s in the trash. I caught your attention from staring into empty space. I gave you your life back again. And gave you company. I made you forget everything that is putting your life on hold. I set you in motion. I set you free.  Don’t go back into the dark… it gets so scary sometimes.           \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
