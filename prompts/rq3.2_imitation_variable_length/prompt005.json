Not really much time to write out anything to put on here. Plus I just haven’t had any good stories to tell. But as I sit here today I’ve been doing a lot of thinking about life. Something’s not right. I’ve decided it’s because I need something new in my life. Some change.  I haven’t figured out what change that is. Over the past week I’ve considered buying a big screen T.V., buying an old beat up truck, taking a big trip, growing my hair out for a year, going back to school to get a new degree, and the list just goes on and on. I still can’t figure it out. But one thing I’ve decided I’m doing is skydiving. Yes, I am going skydiving. There isn’t anything more exciting, crazy, and new like skydiving. Can you imagine jumping from a plane at 10,000 feet and falling to the earth with nothing but a piece of nylon and string to keep you from dying. Who wants to go with me?  Ok, as I write this I’m thinking to myself, am I going through my mid-life crisis? Is that why I’m constantly wanting to do something new and exciting. Or have I been listening to the new Tim McGraw song “live like you were dying”. Either way it’s got me in the mood for some skydiving. If this is my mid-life crisis does that mean I’m only going to live to be 46? If so I better get moving on getting everything done that I want to do before I die. Then again I may not live to see 24. Maybe I’ll just start living every day like I was dying. What’s the one thing you would do if there was no tomorrow? What’s keeping you from doing it? I know if there was no tomorrow for me that I would make sure that I’m enjoying every moment. I wouldn’t worry about relationships, money, what other people are thinking, and many other things we worry about day to day.  So if you’re having the same feelings that I am about not worrying about tomorrow and you want to do something crazy come join me for some skydiving. After we are finished with that we can go find something else new to do.              Ok, so apparently I tried to type my last blog in a yellow font to get the black and gold look that would match the Colorado Buffaloes colors. And I apparently wasn’t grammatically correct because I didn’t type it in a word document before I posted it. I apologize for my mistakes. But in my defense I’m still new to this thing. I still haven’t learned how to post pictures. Sorry but I do have a life outside this cyber world. But I did learn tonight how to link my friends blogs to my blog (Thanks Gambil). And this got me thinking, if I connect just one person to my blog then my blog could possibly be connected to just about any blog in the world. Think about it. I’m connected to a blog and that blog has 5 friends connected who all have 5 other friends connected. So pretty much its all connected through blogs. Pretty soon you’ll be able to play that 6 degrees game that you play with movies. For example we'll be sitting around quizzing each other. “ok I can connect Troy Townsend to Hank Torn in under three people. Troy’s blog is linked to Cochran’s blog who is linked to Hank’s blog.” Its like that Kevin Bacon game but only more gay. What’s this world coming to? Why am I writing about this? Why am I this tired this early in the night? Especially after i went to Starbucks to get “juiced up”. Well let me know if you agree with my connected blog theory. Its pretty deep I know. I think I’m going to watch Dumb and Dumber now.              urlLink    Soccer   Last night we had our first soccer game of the season. It was the first time we’ve played in a while. Most of use were out of shape, but we didn’t let it keep us from winning. We won 9-4. Beau only scored 7 goals. Gambill scored 1 after missing two easy ones in the first half. I also scored 1 in the second half after having a few good shots not go in. Overall we looked pretty good. Rosey, Jamie, Tracy and Anastasia played a good game. If you haven’t made it to one of our games you should come watch us. We play at Hat Trick arena on 122nd St. Our team name is officially Rhombus, but unofficially we are known as the Cochran Family. Anastasia and Rosey decided to surprise us with their custom team shirts that say “The Cochran Family” on the front and a phone number on the back. We all plan on having our own custom shirts eventually. Mine will say G-unit, Beau’s will say Metro Beau, and so on. Any way as soon as I get a schedule I’ll post it on here so you can know when we are playing. Come support us. We promise it will be worth your time.                    urlLink    The Amazing Race&nbsp; urlLink     &nbsp;  The Amazing Race is my new favorite TV show. I absolutely love it! If you’ve been living under a rock this summer and haven’t heard of the Amazing Race you’re missing out!&nbsp; Here are my top 10 reasons why I like the show and why you should be watching it! &nbsp;  10. It’s the only reality show that has an Emmy…yes folks it beat out Survivor!  9. What other reality show can you watch where teams are going to different locations each week. Every Tuesday night I feel like I get a free vacation.  8. CBS picks the best teams to watch. This year we have a Christian dating couple, an internet older dating couple, father daughter , husband wife, bowling moms, brothers, twins, 2 other dating couples, once engaged, and my favorite the cousins. Usually you can pick one team that you are really rooting for.  7. The host! Alright ladies Phil is no Jeff Probst (Survivor Host) but he’s pretty dang close. Unlike Jeff, Phil really doesn’t talk , which I like. Sometimes during Survivor I get so sick of hearing Jeff voice his opinion. WHO CARES is always what I’m thinking. With Phil you don’t have to worry about that because he doesn’t talk! I like that! 6. The Fights! Each team has chosen their partner so they know each other pretty well! Nothing is better than watching partners get in a fight and then still having to be stuck with each other. It’s great!&nbsp;  5. Wednesday…yes Wednesday! Wednesday is the day my good friend Teresa and I discuss the show. We have some great discussions on our opinion about the show. Sometimes these discussions last most of the day, hey helps me get through the work day!  4. More fights! These teams not only fight with each other they also fight with the other teams. This week one team didn’t like another team so they bought the remanding airplane tickets so that team couldn’t get on the plane….harsh!  3. Stupid people that make the show. You’d be surprised how many DUMB people make it on the show. The brothers teams… they like to yell at the foreigners because they think that helps them understand English!  2. The fact that this is the only show that I seriously sit in front of the TV and yell at the teams like they can hear me! Sad as that is… I’m not joking!  1. Charla! I love her! She’s with her cousin Mirna. Charla is a little person (FYI little people do not like to be called dwarfs or midgets). She has seriously gone farther than I or American thought she would go. Just look at her, how could that not be enjoyable to watch!   Alright I hope I’ve convinced everyone to tune in next week! It comes on every Tuesday, 9:00 pm CBS.&nbsp; Happy tubing!&nbsp;&nbsp;   Review written by Lindsy Graham           \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
