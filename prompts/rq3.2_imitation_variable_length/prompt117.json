Makes sense. I have for years now. She liked me the whole time I liked her until like 7 or 8 months ago, then she got over it. Shit, that was some crappy timing. Well I didn't get over her, I got worse. I really want to ask her out but I'm afraid to for two reasons. First- I've got the Michelle thing brooding in my mind still. Because of how bad I fucked up with Michelle I'd decided not to date. Well now I'm not sure. I figure I can do better this time and the odds are more in my favor; Amanda doesn't live an hour away, we have more in common (hell, we're practicaly the same person) and she doesn't worry as much as Michele does (No offense Mich). I'm really  really  afraid that I'll fuck up again and end up hurting one of my oldest friends, not a pretty thought. I think that has me most anxious. Second- She has an unbelievably huge crush on some guy named Nate (I don't know who he is so I can't really describe him) and I don't want to ask her out and have this Nate guy do that same thing a little later and leave her in a shitty situation, that sucks, I know. I dunno, maybe I'm just trying to justify me not having enough balls to ask someone out, it's probably thatmore tahn anything else. Oh well. I'll quit worrying about it soon hopefully. Peace. <>             I saw Hellboy today with my dad. It was actually pretty good. It had a religous side to it that got me thinking... do Christians have pilgrimages? Either way I'm going on one of my own. I'm trying to decide where to go... so far I want to see Augsburg, The Vatican, Westminster Abbey, Jerusalem, The Dead Sea, Nazareth, somewhere in Spain and Constantinople. That way I get an overall dose of every part of Christanity, not just the Lutheran part. I also decided I need to find a good Rosary that I may or may not wear around my wrist. Holy crap, I'm turning Catholic. Really, I'm just looking for places to pray. I really like praying. There's something about it that makes you feel so close to God, it's a great form of meditation. The only problem is, I don't have any places that I really like to pray at. The Seminary is pretty good, so is Redeemer. Problem is, I can't always go there. I need to make somehwere at my mom's that I can go. All I need is a big cross, some holy water quiet. Crap, two of those are hard to come by. I can get a cross anywehere but peace and quiet? Not in my house. I duno, I think I just want to go visit a bunch of sacred places and feel more religious or close to God or something. You know what's wierd? I swear when I find a good cross or something religous I can almost feel something like power coming from it. Sounds stupid, I know, but I swear I can. Oh well. <>             I'm worried. My dad has decided not to shave until he gets another job interview. That was three weeks ago. He's on the verge of looking out of state. If he does go, which is looking likely, Debbie, Noah and probably Jill would go too. I'm not too concerned with Debbie or Noah, it's my dad and Jill that bother me. As much as I hate to admit it, things just wouldn't be the same without my psyco little sister harassing me. And my dad and I used to be so close. I mean, we used to go bowling every week and see movies and hang out. Before seeing Hellboy this weekend the last movie we saw was Return of the King. That was almost four moths ago. He told me on Sunday that he can use money in his bank account for about another six months beofre things get desperate and that he would hate to have to use the money he has saved up for me and Jill for college. I would hate that too but I would want him to use it. I'm worried nonetheless, three weeks is a long time to go without an interview and I'd hate to have to use my money to support the family but I would. I just don;t want to tell him that because it would only stress him out more to make him think I'm planning on using my earnings to support the family. Especially when I'm already having money problems of my own (prom, the car, etc.)      That's another thing. Debbie and Noah are starting to bother me. Debbie keps trying to mother me, calling me honey and all that shit. I hate it. The only people that have been able to pull that off are friends, and fairly good ones at that. I don't want to sound like a bad person or like one of those little whiny teenagers that has to control everyone but she's always there, I never get any time alone. Not at my mom's, not at my dad's, not at school. I just want to be able to sit around and hang out with my dad or be alone, but no, with her and Noah around someone's always near me. It's driving me insane and they aren't even married yet. Speaking of Noah, he's just like any other annoying little shit 12 year old. He whins all the time, screeches lilke a girl and invades everyones privacy. I'm going to hurt him. Oh well. I suppose I'd better quit bitching. <>             I spent last weekend in New York City visiting my David and his girlfriend, Jamie. It was fun except we only stayed a day, I'd like to go there and hang out for like a week but I don't have the time. We went to a They Might Be Giants concert in Prospect Park in Brooklyn, it was really fun. I then went to a wedding in Connecticut. It went well. Overly emotional but that might be because I didn't know the cousin that was getting married as well as other people did. It's funny, the whole Powell/ Rinell side of my family (my stepdad and older stepbrothers' family which I still consider family since I ignore the step-anything crap) is al the same. Everyone looks similar and everyone seems to study either religion or science. It is really, really... different. On the plus side I discovered three new cousins (one thet I've never met and two from marriage) which means I need to re-tally my family (I think I'm somewhere near 35 cousins and counting) and I also found out I have some fun family... really I found out one of my cousins, Karen, is fun and was the only person I talked to much the entire time.  There's other stuff I'm sure I could write and I'm sure I could m,ake this post more coherent but I'm lazy and I'll write more this week I'm sure. Peace. <>             Ok, so I called in 'sick' today and took a day off from school. I really needed it. I slept in 'till 10:00 or so then got up and mowed the lawn. Woo. Then I went to Grinder;s for lunch and Zak and Jimmy came over and ate luch also. Of course, they had to go back to school. Suckers! I then went to the bank and got my oil changed. I went to CVS to buy duct tape and saw Katie working there, none of you know who she is, uhh... she worked at Pizza Plus for like two months and then joined the army. She was fun. We talked for like 5 minutes and I went to the Seminary and hung out with my mom, Jamie and Adrianne. Again, none of you know who the last two people are but trust me, they're cool. After that I went to the McHouse to volunteer (yes, I volunteer at the Ronald McDonald House with my mom) and came home. I started writing a paper but got sidetract in an argument with Michelle. It sucked unbelievably, I pissed her off again, hopefully for the last time. Now I'm writing this and I don't have much else to say so I'm out. Peace. <>             So I celebrated my birthday at my mom's today and I got some good stuff. I got an acoustic guitar so I can finally become a rock god (all I need is to learn how to play, a hit song and some grupies... actually, all I  really  need is the groupies). I also got some CD's and the two greatest board games ever made, Risk and Stratego. I know what you all are thinking... you all are thinking to yourselves  damn, he is so cool for having those games , and I agree. But seriously, you all need to play them sometime, they're fun.  I finished my exams and am now officially a Senior! Although if I had the chance I would prolly go back and redo my Junior year to fix a few (and by a few I mean a lot) of things. But I can't do that so whateva.  I got my stiches out today, which is suprisingly annoying to do. They have to cut the knot which hurt a bit and then the dentist pulled out the thread which feels really, really funky. Either way I'm almost done with the gum graft ordeal. Rock on.  That's all I have for now. Peace. <>             Well  Hamlet  ended which sucks. It was a lot of fun. I'll miss the show and everyone in the cast. Thanks to everyone that saw the show.  Apparently I was a good ASM. Or at least that's what people were saying (most of them were drunk at the time which made it funny to hear). Anyhoo, I had a revelation- High school is pointless. I know I always thought it but I finally realized it. Seriously, all of high school is one exceedingly emotional drama. I mean, everyone worries and panics about the smallest things. Who cares if you don't dress the best. Who cares if you bombed a Spanish test? Who cares if you didn't make the lead in the musical? Nobody. No one if going to look back at your high school career and make some judgement once you get into college. High school is supposed to be fun. Relax people. Enjoy yourselves a bit. What will happen will happen, life will suck at times and will be awesome at others. Just find some people you're good friends with and life will be ok. Now the point- I've decided to simply enjoy my senior year. I'll study and all that crap as needed, but mostly I'm just going to enjoy the total lack of responsibility.  On another random note, I now have like five people that are determined to take me out drinking when I'm in college. It's funny.
