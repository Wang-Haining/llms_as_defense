I heard the punk rock version by New Found Glory somewhere last year when I first discovered them. These lyrics are adapted from the NFG version because Astraweb has yet to post the version by North. I don't think the lyrics should differ much (There's another version by B.B. King and Bette Milder). Nice ballad anyway, go listen.       Tonight it's very clear     As we're both lying here     There's so many things i want to say     I will always love you     I would never leave you alone          Sometimes i just forget     Say things i might regret     It breaks my heart to see you crying     I don't wanna lose you     I could never make it alone     I am a man who will fight for your honor     I'll be the hero you're dreaming of          We'll live forever     Knowing together that we     Did it all for the glory of love          You'll keep me standing tall     You'll help me through it all     I'm always strong when you're beside me     I have always needed you     I could never make it alone     I am a man who will fight for your honor   urlLink      I'll be the hero you've been dreaming of     We'll live forever     Knowing together that we     Did it all for the glory of love          Just like a knight in shining armor     From a long time ago     Just in time i will save the day     Take you to my castle far away     I am a man who will fight for your honor     I'll be the hero you're dreaming of          We're gonna live forever     Knowing together that we     Did it all for the glory of love     We'll live forever     Knowing together that we     Did it all for the glory of love          We did it all for love     We did it all for love     We did it all for love     We did it all for love                    Great, after Euros comes Copa America. But I'm giving it a miss. TV Mobile was playing the match between Venezuela and Columbia just now. Because I live all the way at Jurong, I managed to watch all the way into half-time. It isn't nearly as exciting as Euro. Partially because the players are foreign to me and also because the speed of the game is so slow! I ended up looking outside the window most of the time, only to turn back and see them miss the goal three times in a row. And then we have our very own S.League, who are hoping to qualify for the World Cup in 2010, and who are ironically, even more foreign to me. I'm sorry for being so honest. But seriously, who bothers to keep up with the scores of Home United and Jurong Football Club. Even The Straits Times has very little news to do with our local sports scene.  Talking about media, I'm sure you have already noticed the striking similarities between our reality TV, and America's reality TV. AI(SI), The Bachelorette(Eye For A Guy), The Amazing Race(Are You Game Enough?). They might be coming up with the Singaporean version of Fear Factor and The Apprentice pretty soon, so look out for them! Survivor is difficult because of our limited land space. The only place where they can host the show would be in Pulau Ubin. (Yeah, I bet that would be challenging.) Where's the much talked about originality? Oh, I forgot. They're hiring foreign talent to do that aspect of the job too. Yes, I should try to look at things from their perspective. I understand that if they don't mimic America's shows, Mediacorp's ratings will plunge big time. Who denies the fact that reality TV is the reason why everyone is suddenly watching Channel 5? Even our SS teacher recognises the fact that Singapore copies what others do. Isn't that the reason why they put Switzerland and Venice into our syllabus? So that we can learn how they form their government, so we can form ours. So that we know how they lead their people, so they can lead us. The only thing they have yet to copied from the Westerners, and cut us some slack, is their education system. Can't they tell from the child suicide rates? That is why there're more and more cases of graduates going abroad for further studies and end up staying there permanently, resulting in us having to poach foreigners to drive our economy for us, even increase our birth rates for us. I see why we're dubbed a cosmopolitan state.  This has been a skeptical and critical post. I shouldn't have wrote it, and you shouldn't be reading it. We should always remember our roots and have unwavering faith and undying loyalty to our motherland. What was I thinking? I'm Singaporean.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
