I auditioned for the Mary Ann character. I'm not drop dead gorgeous so I had to rely on my mad comic skills to work. I think I actually did rather well. I had 3 interviews, and all three the camera guy, boom guy and interviewer were cracking up. Some of the questions I answered - 'Finish this sentence- I would make the Ultimate Mary Ann because...' I said 'I am cheap and easy to work with'. 'If you had to be stranded on an island with three other people, they would be...'  I said, 'Ewan McGregor by himself would be fine, thank you'. and 'One thing I will look forward to about living on the island is...' and i said 'muscle tone'. see. those are way more interesting answers than the other skanks. I mean girls.  Ewan McGregor week- today's movie is Moulin Rouge  . I saw the real one in France from the outside. The movie was different. I liked the 80s and 90s music juxtaposed with the early 1900s scenery. It was like a pop up book come alive. I enjoyed it. Nicole Kidman's baby voice was a little irritating. John Leguizamo's lisp was hysterical. The whole show was put together well. I especially liked the ending-not happily ever after. Its refreshing to ditch the white horse and the sunset.  Rating- 3 1/2 stars                 As Ewan McGregor week winds down to an end (recap-Trainspotting, Down with Love, Big Fish, Moulin Rouge, and now Nightwatch- two more to finish the week off !), I am going to review 'Nightwatch', a little known Ewan suspense-thriller. It also stars Patricia Arquette, Josh Brolin, and Nick Nolte. This movie definitely had its slow parts. I guessed who the murderer was within 30 minutes. It was still intense and freakish and had me on my toes at the really scary parts! I was pretty much feeling suspenseful the whole time. This is an 1998 American remake of the 1994 Denmark psycho thriller 'Nattevagten' by the same director Ole Bornedal. I suggest it as a good dont-have-anything-else-to-do rental! One of the best thrillers I have seen in a while. Plus it was nice to see Ewan in a uniform, even if it was a security guard one, hahaha. I have noticed one thing about Ewan though... he really likes to get a nude scene into whatever movie he's in! 'Black Hawk Down' to be done tomorrow!                        If I could afford another bill, I would SOOOO get XM! Its only $2 a month though I probably can handle that. These guys are hilarious.  So I am driving down the road in lovely  Pasco County [read: 4x4 trucks bigger than their homes], and I happen upon a billboard that looks, loosely, like this one:   .    I made that, thats why it looks ghetto. I do not understand my photoshop. Anyway, first off, this kook's name sounds like a national holiday for masturbaters worldwide. Second, Vote for my day in COURT??? who the hell wants to be IN COURT?? who came up with this slogan!Someone who got PAID to, thats who! i cant believe it! oh wait yes i can this is FLORIDA. bass ackwards, USA. Typical non partisan!   One more thing. I found this person grading childrens pictures on a site and saying horrible things about them that were HILARIOUS. Here is my favorite:     Ding Ding! Here comes the shit-mobile. I've never seen a fire truck that needed to be shaved. I would rather be burned to death than be saved by this hairy piece of shit. F                    Just got back from Bonkerz. Man, If I-4 wasnt so FUBARed, It wouldnt take7 hours of my time. It took 2 1/2 hours to get to a place an 1 1/2 away, then 2 1/2 hours to get BACK home, plus the 2 we spent at the club, and we didnt even get to stay and see everyone do their thing. I love going there, because the guys are great and actually funny, and very supportive, but the crowd is really a captive audience. Its in a Holiday Inn near nothing so they dont have much of a choice :( . I tried some new jokes out but i forgot the beer one. Here it is for your enjoyment:  Have you ever gone to Busch Gardens [home of Budweiser besides St Louis, for those who may not be familiar] and ordered a Miller Lite just for fun? They glare at you like you just asked for a dead puppy in a chilled glass!  ok its sick but sometimes you just gotta go with it!  Im going to Coconuts tonight after i practice my set a billion times. Im going to have more pics soon too! Can you tell Im getting a little overworked here in the practice room @ USF ??    One more thing. I am not very happy with a few of my friends. For their protection, I will call them ERIC AND LORI from work.      Not only did Eric keep throwing trash out my window which I HATE with a passion (im a recycling earth friendly person! dont throw shit out the damn window!), they are messy drunks. I love my car more then some men do. Its my baby. These dingdongs got so drunk they spilled half their captain and cokes (yeah they were drinking in my car grrrrrr) all over, and crushed up those damned multicolored pepperidge farm goldfish during their shenanigans. Now my car smells like Captain Morgan and is decorated with a rainbow of salty snacks. I feel like a homosexual puerto rican driving around now.     IM MAD THAT MY CAR STINKS LIKE RUM!!!!! YOU GUYS SUCK!!!!!  WEDNESDAY 9:48 AM  The great part about falling asleep again only to wake up 2 hours later, if there is a great part, is you usually get a hilarious dream. I dreamed that my brother in law got a metal detector and made me follow him up to UT to use it. Then this guy who Ive said maybe 3 words to in my life, Antony, gets out of this strech limo surrounded by black cop cars, with a giant, cartoon like blunt in his hand, And hes dressed in like Roman Empire Kingwear LTD or something, robes and shit. Then his parents get out, each with a 5th, and hugs him goodbye (I guess he was going off to be king of UT). There was more to the story but i forgot it all by the time I wrote all that. I need a mind recorder. It was so weird and retarded!            \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
