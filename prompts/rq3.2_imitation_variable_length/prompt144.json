He's paying me to print off 500 copies of his band's CD, because I have a connection with a CD printing press. I called his house to update him and he wasn't home, but his mom wanted to speak with me, so she did. She made me feel like total crap. I hate that. When adults talk down to you. But whatever. I'm over it, sort've. I'll get the job done, he'll pay me and he'll get the CDs and I doubt I'll ever be working with them again. It's unfortunate because I really enjoy their music. But I don't need someone's mom telling me about the job I'm doing.  Bowling was fun tonight, don't you guys agree? Only, I was majorly disappointed with the lack of disco going on. And the fact that I got two strikes in a row at the END OF A GAME. They should've happened earlier on. Bummer. However, my spirits were uplifted during the sing and shout par-tay on the bus back to the church. Another thing that annoyed me though, is the new guys that were at the youth group. I'm all down for welcoming new people in the group and making new friends, but I thought it was so rude that they were abusing everything. Languages, attitudes, the church building... I'm trying not to make a big deal, but it bugs/hurts me so much to see someone yell something like, 'Praise the Lord!' knowing that they don't care anything for the three words they just said. It really, really hurts.  I think I'm mistreating this website. I'm ranting too much. I'm sorry, continue.                        After seven seasons with the San Jose Sharks, Mike Ricci will be leaving the Sharks for the phoenix Coyotes. Mark Recchi will be going back to his original team, Pittsburgh, and after a lot of thought, and lots of input, Goalie Matthew Robson has decided that he will not be joining RPC Youth in the Nanoose Bay Teen Camp.   There are many superlatives that you can use to describe Mike Ricci, but the most widely held is that of competitor,' general manager Michael Barnett said. 'He lays it on the line, every shift, every night.' He said he looks forward to joining his new club. 'The Coyotes have a great nucleus of young, talented players,' Ricci said.  Recchi's agent, Rick Curran, wouldn't provide details on the contract, but said the right wing is 'absolutely delighted' to be in Pittsburgh, where he has kept a home for several years.  After everything seemed to be a go, Matthew Robson has pulled out of Nanoose Bay teen camp. 'It's a tough decision for me' Robson said. 'I really wanted to go, but there were just certain details I had to work out.' Robson is expected to be working during the week he was going to be at camp and with the extra cash he has decided to insure his car.       \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
