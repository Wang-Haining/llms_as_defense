  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic:\n\n       the kind where every emotion you've ever had comes thru your throat as you scream and your face gets wet with tears and sweat? The kind that just bubbles up out of you and when your done you take a big breath and immedatly feel better?  Yeah, I need one of those cries right about now. Why? I haven't got a fucking clue. I wish I did. I mean I REALLY wish I did, but I don't.  Well I was writing a story were this chick is crying b/c shes on this plane and is going to Korea but she doesn't really want to, but its for her own safety, and then I was reading some poorly written fan fic and well, I just get so furstrated with my life that I feel like hurting someone. Or screaming at someone. Or just kicking AND screaming at the same time...at some one.  Yeah, I'm a freak, aren't I? Yeah well, I've also gotten into a band called DBShinki. I think they're a really cool ban-well more like pop group (think N*SYNC b4 the fro) and since they're in Korea (or Japan, but more than likely Korea) and I'm here in a small god forsaken town in the middle of Misery, all that this fasination with this group can pertain to is a simple crush. (Not like the one on what's-his-face who is now dating Ms. I bend over in my Short-shorts) Yeah, I'm uh, something of a freak, geek, loser combo.  Well, when my computer stops locking up, I'll post a picture of the group so I can stare at it to supress the scream.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
