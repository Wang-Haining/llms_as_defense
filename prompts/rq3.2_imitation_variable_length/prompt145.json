BlueAutumn  (...my bolt handle)  22/F/KN  Jul 27 2003 2:02AM   Well, Harry, you should realize that Bolt does not suck considering that it allowed you to air your personal angst towards some insurance company. It does not suck because it supports freedom of speech. If you were living in Communist China, someone would have already blown your brains off for merely voicing out your personal notion.  Remember that in most parts of impoverished Asia and Africa, people live in shacks, with no running water and they sleep on jute sacks and feed on dirt. All you, your family and your neighbors have to worry about is to move your shit out of your freakin' subdivision.   The world is way screwed up more than what you may have imagined. Quit complaining .      HarryPotter1219  16/M/US  Jul 27 2003 2:08AM    quit complaining? listen lady i know there's problems everywhere else in the world, but u know what, my family's in debt enough as we r, and if they change our land 2 commercial, and force us 2 sell, we might end up in a fucking shack 2! now i've yelled at enough ppl 2day, please dont b added 2 my hate list     *LOL* He can add me to his hate list and my world will go on turning.    Kids...                          Here is a 'campfire tale' I wrote to earn Bolt's Smorz badge        PHANTOM SHIVA    7:14 AM. Friday. She marched toward a bicycle chained to the mailbox post and with quivering, blue fingers unfastened the lock with the solitary key hanging from her sterling chain necklace. The rain was pouring incessantly, licking the make-up off her face,her eyes appeared as if it were bleeding caramel. She rode the bicycle and pedaled hard, bracing through the heavy downpour. In the same breath, without warning a vehicle shot out into the street. The engine screeches to a halt. Shattered glasses flew. A car alarm went off. And behind the cloudy haze, a body laid twisted agonizingly by the pavement. The road was the color of blood.  He was sitting in the corner booth in some lonely cafe, fingering his half eaten bagel. The clock on the wall read half past eight. Out of overwhelming boredom, he rose from his seat, gathered his books and left a message at the counter. He put on his coat and under the rain, walked back to the dormitory.  9:12 AM. She found him curled up on the couch, his right foot bobbing up and down to the beat of a Bob Marley song. 'I left Coffee World. 'Can't stand the cold.', he mumbled under his breath. 'I hate the rain.' was all she responded and crouched by the fire. Her hair was still dripping. 'Shiva,' he said, 'I'll meet you after History class.' and gathered his coat resting atop a battered console chair. '6:30', she whispered. '6:30.', he echoed.  6:34 PM. He was stranded in Luxemburg Hall, the water flooded the quadrangle situated infront of the building by 3 feet. He was beginning to grow frustrated and contemplated an excuse. The sound of footsteps padding down the hallway distracted him from his vacation. He turned around. 'Professor Rausch.' he greeted. 'Keith, how are you doing.' the man responded. 'Have you heard of what happened...this morning...to your friend, Shiva.' The boy returned a bewildered stare.   'She met an accident at Francis Street...'  'You are mistaken Professor Rausch...'  'I'm sorry, Keith, she's gone. Severe hemmorhage. The paramedics concluded she passed away a few minutes after the accident. The memorial service will be at Saint Joseph. Let me take you...'                    I was extremely depressed this afternoon that I sat in the bathtub, soaking in the salted water. A thin line of rust stained the root of the silver hand rail and part of the beige porcelain. It appeared as if the silver hand rail bled caramel and stained the tub forever. I let my limbs float on the water, my toes bobbing up and down like tiny red submarines. Then, I got bored, sat up and assumed a fetal position.  After not speaking with Eurydike for nearly 15 days, a result of my annoyance because of her wanton ways, I called her up finally last night and we ended up discussing her urogenital infection and how she spent a handsome amount of money on suppository. She's still casting blame on the chauvinistic cretin, her 'male whore', for her urogenital problem which she is incredibly ashamed of.  The X-Files episode last night was brilliant. I wonder if they have grilled chicken guts in Quantico, Virginia (yes, chicken meat nauseates me but I am a huge fan of grilled chicken guts---a Filipino delicacy usually sold in side streets.)                 Out of sheer boredom, I took a few of Quizilla's quizzes. Here are the results of my personality test:     urlLink       Take the  urlLink What High School Stereotype Are You?  quiz, by  urlLink Angel    True.  Here's another one:       You are every secretary's nightmare    urlLink   Which Ultimate Beautiful Woman are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Uh oh. Paul will decapitate me.      You're depressed. Really you are. And you definitely have a reason. You often space out and stare at things blankly, even if you're normally hyper and energetic. This is because nothing really seems important anymore. You might just be sad right now, or you might be manic depressive. Don't worry. Have some cocoa and stuff'll be ok.    urlLink   How Depressed are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     Cocoa makes me choke.    This journal entry is dedicated to Jandi Marie. So far, she haven't stoned me to death for acting demented because she's pretty demented herself *lol* I love ya Sissy Poo!!!!                    The following, I gathered from my notebook, written sometime last year. I posted this entry upon request of my friend T---.       I befriended an odd girl, T--- from room 314. T--- brings me to complete contemplation sometimes. I wonder if she epitomizes the typical forlorn girl of my childhood novels (which I never finished writing). She had long, unbecoming tresses of a depressed, overworked housewife, the clothes of a financially challeged country girl and the facial expression of someone who had gone through a litany of emotional bancruptcy brought about by abortive romances and bad financial troubles. She posseses the beautiful and scholarly yet naive mind I claimed having during my years in college, with the hopes that I would trick people---pseudo-intellectuals or otherwise into reciprocating my friendship.   Her shoes were white, the thick soles smudged with road dirt and its velcro straps almost losing their grip around her pale ankles. I knew I have seen those white shoes before and when I forced myself to ponder deeply where I have seen them before, I recalled seeing them in my mother's wedding album--she was wearing the same, exact pair under her wedding gown.  T--- is the brown Fiona Apple of my youth.                 I created a post about anti-atheism entiled 'The Skeptic Tank' and quite a handful spouted their so-called intellectual arguments about atheism and theism. One dribbling moron who goes by the name of Grebsnig wrote this out of the subject post:   'Has anyone here read this fruitcake's profile? She claims to have dated Eddie Vedder nine years ago, when she was 13. Even that astounding age difference isn't? the most convincing piece of information that leads one to believe that this affair is nonexistence, what solidifies this as a lie for me is that Eddie Vedder would never date some dope who listens to the Dave Matthews Band. Despite my loathing for [her] moronic absurdity, [I] thank [her] for giving me a good laugh.'   Ha ha...I'm sorry Grebsnig but you are not a winner. When I claimed to have dated Eddie Vedder, it was ABSOLUTELY, DEFINITELY and APPARENTLY a JOKE. Now, you are the dope because you didn't realize that. I suggest that you find yourself a support group for crackbrains.  Anyhow, here are some of the arguments that were presented:  1)Perhaps you can justify your belief in the existence of God, but how do you propose to go about justifying It's existence? There is no subjective (or objective? I'm not sure which word to use) way to prove God. You can say that I exist, so there must be a God, but I would tell you that my existence is due to billions of years of evolution. The point is, you can not give irrefutable proof for or against the existence of God.  2)Why must something proceed from something else in order to exist? Was the CED created? What created the CED? What created the thing that created the CED? What created that?  I am not posting all of the replies because they are too many and will consume a lot of space. Here is my argument:       THE SKEPTIC TANK      All of us, at one point in our lives (I am also refering to the atheists even before they became atheists) have a clear and distinct idea of God. But all of these ideas are the effects of causes. Then there must be some cause of our idea of God. I came across my old notes and read something my man Descartes wrote: The three self evident propositions about causes:  -there must be as much reality in the cause as in the effect -something can not proceed from nothing -what is more perfect can not proceed from the less perfect  With the help of Descartes' three propositions about causes, I therefore say that nothing could cause my idea of God as a perfect substance that is not as perfect as the idea. Although I could be the cause of my ideas of physical objects or animals or man--since there is nothing so great or perfect in these ideas that I could not have caused them--I could not, however,have caused the idea of God because I am only a finite, imperfect being, whereas the idea of God is of a perfect and infinite being. So, something else greater than me must have caused my Idea of God, something which is at least as great as the effect, can only be an infinite,perfect being namely God Himself. Therefore, God exists as the only possible cause of my idea of Him.              \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
