Maybe when I was 25 with a job and stuff. I never expected it to be with most of the general population. In high school.  Blogs can sometimes be good things. They keep friends informed of how they fell and what they have been doing. They can be filled with joy and fun and love.  They also can be the thing that makes a person think. The causes might be sickness, death, or love.  I say this because it is the truth.  Most guys (except movie stars and hot guys) will never ever have more than 1 person like or love him at one time. I am an exception to this case. I thought this happened before, but then I wasn't really sure of things. I made decisions on only partial information. Some of those decisions were right, some were wrong. I thought I had that all under control.  I was mistaken.  I now face the exact same thing again. But this time, I really like them both. But as the same from before, one of them wants 2 people. So now I am faced with a gigantic decision. A life-altering decision that the consequences of are unknown. Why can't I just the 'eject' or 'bail out button'. That seems the easiest way. But I need something to drive me forward in life. Work and money aren't strong enough right now. Worst to worst, I'll maybe attempt to start again. A fresh mind. A fresh body. A different time. Different people.  What I am saying is that I have come to an intersection of life. There are 3 different directions to choose from, and the ability to have a fatal car crash. I am at this intersection not knowing what to do. I need help, guidance, from someone who knows the intersection. My family is of no help to me for this decision. I need help from my friends, the people that read this blog.  Therefore please talk to me. I am lost in a world where lost=bad. If you see me online, please make me talk. I won't feel like talking, but I need it. Please help me, your my only hope.                  Yawn. I just woke up. I have finally gotten some sleep. This week was pretty good, and everyone has been tired, even teachers.  Tues we had clinicians in band and we had our usual guy, who is the best tuba player in calgary. He's been playing for 28 years. He has 6 tubas. Some of them have 5 valves! In english we all got fortune cookies and we had to write about them. I still don't know what to write. Jazz was tiring, cuz I had Double band earlier. Anyways wed we had another guset conductor. Dr. Hopkins must be a busy man.  Thursday was a lot better than i thought it to be. We reherse in the mornings 1 1/2 hours, then we have band class. We played for the first hour, then all the brass got sent away for the last 1/2 hour. Then in class we had a practise theory test. If you got 100%, you got the rest of the period as a spare. I did, so a few of us went outside and started playing killer (hacki-sack game). Jazz we had clinicians, which was very helpful. Jo stole my trombone! Urrg, i'll get it back for tuesday!  Friday was very ez. We finsihed off a video in english that we had been watching since wednesday. It was 'The Power Of One'. I think too many people died in it. Today I woke up at 12! New Record for me!           \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
