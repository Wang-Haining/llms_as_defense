Stuff has just been soo overly crap at the moment. I'm *trying* to not let it get to me... eating and sleeping right, trying not to get stressed over it and stuff. but ugh i'm just so over it.  I keep thinking about that stupid stupid stupid person. that  seriously  harshly pissed me off. 'whatever' my 'problems are' i should talk to 'someone' ( yeh heaven forbid he asks wats up . before, of course, i 'take it out' on him. thats such a ducking joke! Oh, my bad... i forgot i 'm disturbed. silly me! he toally sickens me now. yeah i know its lame.   I just dont know where to turn... im stuck in the middle again. not so much now, things calmed down after avoca and everyones cool again, but yeh sometimes it feels like everyone has just trivial stupid crap to worry about. i dont even feel like talking to anyone at home. it just doesnt feel supportive at all..  then on friday i got this lovely message from my ducked up boss.  i felt sick for like the whole of friday night, but that was also out of stress because i just kept thinking about things... and i lost my job. yeah way to find out too, on VOICEMAIL!!! argh! fcuk that, it wasnt my fault. i expect a damn fricken good reference from that pot smoking rich-ass tosser. I keep telling myself that its okay, because I'M not the one who's gonna be stuck THERE for the rest of my life. i mean i don't see my future working there. I was so pissed tho, because i found out off the chik whos working sundays now... i mean my 'boss' (who couldnt organise himself out of a paper bag) didnt even call me! SO i called work and spoke to this stupid girl who works there, and she was  so  condescending. you know those people who talk to u on the phone at a shop or something and try to sound nice, but are  so  totally insincere? ugh! so then i left a message for him to call me, and 2 days later i got a mesaage on voicemail saying that rachel* is working instead of me, because she needs her hours for her vet nursing course. the only reason shes doing vet nursing is cos she failed her HSC anyways. fuck that. i worked there for volunteer for like 1.5 years, and he throws it back in my fucking face because its easier for him to get a vet nurse for him to work than me. me who has been working there for ages and knows how everything is done. well he can go to hell. everyone hates him anyway :)    hmm i hope that post want too bitchy. *her name isnt really rachel but i feel funny posting real names. lol. \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
