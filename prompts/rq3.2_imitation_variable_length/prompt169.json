(oh i feel im repeating myself here. haha) i felt as though i revisited my life. over the past half a year, then another year more. i suddenly see why things happen. things happen for a reason, and most of the time the reason is to help u mature. yupz. im finally able to smile a real smile today, and joke wif everyone sincerly and laugh a hearty laugh today. im glad.  and im glad for everyone else. and everyone else's paths whom im going to cross, i hope to brighten up their days when i see them. and lighten everyone's load (tho my shoulder hurts too. haha) and also give everyone a reason to smile and laugh, and forget all their worries.  i feel like a kid all over again, discovering my happiness. and its just like 2 years back when i got the fated results. and i can say its for the good. gosh. smile everyone. and i promise, everyone who meets me, will get nothing less then a sincere bright smile, and a cheery (or lunatic) hello wave.   =o)   HIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII!!!!!!!!!!!   -Chee           \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
