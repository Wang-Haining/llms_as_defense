As usual, Russel took the centerstage with his crying bouts over his mom, who now we learn has cancer and annabel, an ex gf from high school he is yakking about. Russel is not like that in his normal self, bibo yan eh, makulit, autistic. It seems that drinking is a form of release for him, sakin ayos lang yon.  Some girls can be strange as in psycho strange...isa lang masasabi ko. Ang tahimik ang pinaka mabangis. Kawawa naman si eric.   On a lighter note, I seem to have developed this little crush over a guy who looks like Mr. Robb of Hoobastank. And its funny coz he sings as well and i cant help but admire his singing one time when we were in the food court on our very light and cheap moments. Cheap fun is enjoyable, i cant help but be mused by other poeple s drunken ways. I have the weirdest fellers in the food court one guy there lasts a whole drinking session by singing 'its my life ' by Bon Jovi all through. One guys singing to death as if it was one of his concert series (me kasama pa yong welcome to blah blah blah this is blah yada yada) And us, we laugh at no end and shout.  Me and condrad once asked our selves over beer,   'bakit di natin maiwan ang globalstride'   sabi ko kasi parang college at high school eto pinakamasarap na trabahong napasukan ko kahit di ganun kataas ang sweldo compared sa iba. Sabi naman nya   'Global kasi parang skul bukul'          .     AND THERE HE WAS AGAIN, Andre the giant a.k.a My father, Mario     He came back from where he came from, wreaking havoc to the house hold with his alalay again. His purpose: To get materials for his shop back there. He yakks about shit, pesters us to hell, wakes us up in our sleeping hours and blast unsolicited hurtful comments on how you act PLUS textes my mother every now and then siraan kami and stuff then makes my mother call us and curse us from the other end. How stupid and childish can a grown moron get diba?   We just acted the normal person not minding him, escaping his route every single minute, forcing ourselves to go to the office even if its a forced leave. Creating false lakad on a sunday or saturday wag lang syang makasama sa mga invites nya, like that time when he wanted to go to my Lolo s place or when he asked me to go with him to buy perfume. Nung sa perfume shit sinabi ko na lang na ako na lang bibili at mamimili ng perfume for him, he thought it was sweet when i was thinking lang na fuck i dont want to have a bonding moment with you. We tried bonding a couple of times already pero hes still the same ass of a dad. There was even this one time when me migs and soy went to work na we didnt witness a very monumental event, migs' evil dad had a drinking session with my evil dad I wonder if satan conjoined them there or whatev.  And at long last he went away, then there i had a party. A sort of celebration of his voyage and at the same time a time for a reunion with mamita and a bonding moment for joey and russel na me alitan.                                                COME ON RAIN IN MY PARADE  inde, joke lang!    i transfered house already! Finished the company website! ...but     i just spoke to a friend of mine wilbert and we discussed things about my virtual hand project. this is a project na virtual assistance start up company and as olay (he-bitch) as he is i took the chance to ask his honest opinion in the whole concept of things and we kinda had a heated debate on the matter. It was good that i asked him of all poeple dahil nagkaroon ng pagtatalunan ang utak ko. I know he hates me for being stupid as he stresses his points but again im not stupid, i shouldnt be stupid kasi galit ako sa mga stupid na tao diba pero kasi nachachallenge lang ako sa nangyaring to. But then again indi lang to ang rely ko sa buhay kaya kebs.   Just transfered to a house here in u.p. with my friend noel and it just struck me that in those times that i have lived independently away from my parents, its just now that i am scared. It's weird i never felt so scared and alone all my life. oh well. But then again i will get by as always.   Anyway im here on the internet shack because my housemate has something going on back there in the house and i dont want to listen to their thing and sink deeper into the feeling of being alone.                      Today is monday, suppossedly me class ako, i had a nasty hangover and a dysmenoreah so bad i couldnt get up. I decided to just go in tomorrow. Thats business math and english 101b that i am missing. But heck i dont fickin care.  Anyway i had a very good discussion with gerald, a friend of mine over the phone about silly girls and boys. Why silly girls drop their silly guys like a hot potato, the concept of love and all. Honestly for me i am not taking these seriously, love and how other poeple percieve it. Basta ako I have so much love to give to everybody. I am ms. friendly. Noel and I thought of it as the safest thing towards the opposite sex. And that is the way that i am most comfortable with.  I have been so very single for 3 years already and enjoying it. And yeah siguro im a scared fart that i wanted to keep every guy a friend. Pero masaya naman ako eh. Tama nga naman si gerald you can get sex by charm and paying for it pero hindi sya human. Nacocompensate nya lang yung times na feeling mo nagiisa ka at kelangan mo ng pisikalan. Its so nice to hear from a lot of guys tungkol sa honest opinions nila about women and their feelings. Yun nga lang nahihirapan ako mag guage ng lalaki para sakin dahil na ooverwhelm ako sa mga information na binibigay sakin mismo ng  mga opposite sex. Lagi na lang ako natatakot dahil babae ako. Would it be easier for me if i was one of them? ehehhehe. If i was indeed gay?   Hay nay, excited na ako later.                          Yesterday wasnt my day.. pci was all fucked up for a couple of hours and i am dying of famine. I was reliant on the atm machine in keeping my money and they fuck up and i get hungry...pci equitable havent heard of back up systems i guess.. but what the fuck i got my money 7pm na. I was dying from hunger and so i went to jollibee and ate my dinner breakfast lunch represented by the chickenjoy meal then off to glorietta to meet geeta my cousin. We were headed for paranaque to drink, even though i still couldnt get it i joined them. The place was nice tho,  martys  , as they call it. It has a live band that will send you in a manic deppressive state due to the que of their songs. I met geetas friends and their okay. bitin nga eh sayang pero okay lang. Twas nice to meet other poeple again. Best of the best, marty's supa cheap! we were drinking up our guts and eating at the same time and man the bill was ultra cheap.  best place for manic depression, go to marty's thats in paranaque, read it QC folks, drink cheap go to marty's paranaque! AHAHAHAHA!   Shet long time no post in this bloggy o mine. Im quite busy with work and some stuff. Its near xmas time and its getting colder and colder. i have been drinking a whole fucken lot to ease the tension.. ever wonder what we look like when drinkin drunk? here are pics...:     thats elton, me and larry ever drinkin as could be. later we will again be merry.                      one week wonder    One week wonder? nah my blog entry has got nothing to do with that. Just cant think of a title.   One week , one week one week of pure fickin shit from the office, a couple of gossip hungry folks, leeches and dirt accumulated mind spirit and body. Me and noel and went off to some shack to buy us some aromatheraphy kit for our house and later on we re heading off to st lukes for a check up coz i think we had our lungs chunked up with toxins due to the smell of fresh paint in the place were sleeping in. We have nio choice but to be absent again we cant force our selves to work in our condition. Noel had nose bleeding and i.....i just felt enundated with work that i had to rest .   And why wouldnt you feel enundated? employees like me in my company seem to loose what i feel naging reason ko in sticking despite of my so underpaid status, the fact that it was an open door policy in the office before and that we can stretch our earnings with commisions na ngayon ang hirap na ma achieve and take note they are slowly taking that away from us. i feel as though i am in a sweat shop. Consider this underpaid ka na, di ka na nga makakacommision, andami pang rules na nakakasakal whats next? i have to wear semi formal in the office????? take away the commision privelege???????? you have to smile even though u dont feel like it or else would be sanctioned??????? oh well fuck those strict floor rules the fuck with *BLEEP*. the fuck with em all. I started to send my applications to diff companies already. GlobalStride is draining me.   Oh well i have to gets my self henergayzd. I have to gather my strength monday. i have an interview in sykes asia at 2pm. And then i go straight ahead to libis for some hypocracy in action.                        ass kissing was never my game and never will be.period.  ____________________________________________________________  Quite an interesting week. First, in the very heart of katipunan, where the usual traffic is, we saw 2 very cute guys in their not so cute and OA car last thursday ( a baby blue 'over shocked' civic esi with that pathetic www.blahblah.com/his name sticker shit, to make it look like a racing car) one in the passenger seat is married (reez saw the ring) and the free one was the driver named jmariano. 3 girls at the back, thats moi, gen my friend and reez my sisters friend got a little bit infatuated so we were turning our heads in the car's direction. Migs on the other hand felt empathy and started to make us write down our names in a paper...the only brave soul to have her number written there was gen, not because she wanted to fool with the guy but to help us, mga friends nya na scared shit to give out our numbers. And so it happened, migs gave gen s number to the guy in the baby blue pathetic car and we started texting... tonight is when were finally going to meet the man.  Anyway after the flirting-with-the-other-car thing I decided to have a decent night out with my girlfriends way back UST soccer days, had a ball drank beer to death until 2:30 with them then made senti with carlo in whistlestop until 5 am. My crew (naks crew!) went to a different party where i was supposed to go as well but opted not to for the simple reason that i dont want to see the arrogant whore that made a fool out of my 2 friends for i was in the verge of giving her yung sampal na makakaitsa sa kanya hanggang mars you know. So there, temper was in a a real high nung gabi ba yun kaya i decided to take a break and unglobal myself for the weekend (UNGLOBAL HUH).  Sunday I recieved a text message from Ivan for some strange reason. Got pissed coz theres a possibility na me nag trip sakin. Its either gary or some guy who knew i liked him. If I get to see who that is Ima tear him to peices i swear. To text him back for that instance is an embarrasing thing for me, since ima be breaking my code. The responsible guys gonna pay who ever that is i swear.  So yun lang         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
