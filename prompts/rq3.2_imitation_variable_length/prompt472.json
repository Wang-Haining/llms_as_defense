I received this devotional yesterday,  (below)  and it made me reflect on the message at Emerge  (GREAT JOB JOHN!) .. and, also what Koinonia means... and, most importantly, community and the freedom that comes from just being real and open with people.. I think it is hard to be open with everyone.. if you think about it Christ had 12 disciples and only 3 that it seems like he was closer to (or at least the relationship is mentioned more in the Bible)..  So, to be free, and to be authentic... after reading this little devotional, and also reading John's blog.. I kind of think that just like we are to train ourselves to pray, walk in the Spirit, but to be real, authentic... we also have to train ourselves to be that..   And, I don't think it is something that will just happen if we attempt to be that way on a Friday night.. but, it is something that we must practice in our everyday lives..  Just like in Acts, they were devoted to fellowship...  [nice reference to Lord of the Rings, John.. ]  but, since I am on verge of a crazy schedule again with work/school.. I guess, I wonder how do I continue to have that fellowship and being devoted to others, when in reality, I know that i really must focus on my teens in my student teaching experience, and also working.. and, I will have very little free time?  Just a thought... God Bless!    RELATIONSHIP, NOT REGIMEN  'The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and of death' - (Romans 8:2).  Walking according to the Spirit is more a relationship than a  regimen. Think about prayer. Perhaps you learned to pray using the simple acrostic ACTS: adoration, confession, thanksgiving, supplication. But if you have been a Christian for a few years and your prayer life is no deeper than an acrostic, you've missed the point of prayer. Prayer is not a formula; it's the language of your relationship with God. Similarly, walking in the Spirit is essentially a relationship with the indwelling Spirit which defies quantification.  Even though Scripture doesn't give us a formula, it does help us see what the Spirit-filled walk is and what it is not. Helpful parameters are found in Galatians 5:16-18: 'Walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the desire of the flesh. For the flesh sets its desire against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are in opposition to one another, so that you may not do the things that you please. But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the Law.'  So how do you walk by the Spirit? If I answered by giving you a rigid formula, I would be putting you back under the law. The Spirit is not an 'it'; the Holy Spirit is a 'He'--a person. Walking by the Spirit is a relationship issue, not a legal issue or ritualistic exercise. It is a walk with God.
