It is one of the premiere centers of tropical marine research in the world and so has a first-rate science library as well. Every once and again, I like to wonder in and cruise the bookshelves, nosing into tomes of indecipherable scientific complexity. Sharing as most humans do, a fascination for pelagic creatures that are bold enough to swim right up to you and eat you, I was drawn one day towards the collection of books detailing the life and behavior of sharks. I am happy to report many works on this subject lined the shelves. My perverted attention was lured to the books that featured more illustrative content rather than narrative. I was certainly not disappointed. Ghastly photographic evidence of human trauma after shark encounters was there by the score and I shall refrain from detailing the images of mangled arms, legs, torsos &c. But the one photo which clearly beat them hands down, strangely did not involve a man-eating  carcharodon  at all. No, the photo in question was one of a captured Nile crocodile. It was a magnificent specimen, measuring well over fifteen feet. It had been captured and killed and it rested on its side on the muddy shore bank. Its massive pale underbelly had been neatly slit open from throat-to-anus and the contents of its stomach partially exposed. I had to blink twice and refocus my eyes before I was willing to concede what it was I was gawking at. There, staring back at me from the ruptured and partially-spilled guts of the mighty saurian beast was a human head! Apparently, some poor native had fallen prey to the croc not too long before and paid the ultimate price. Stomach acids had halfway digested the flesh from the skull, but enough remained to give a general impression of the previous owner’s features. The eyes, appearing to be closed, were in fact pulled wide due I suppose to the overall shrinkage of the skin. It gave the face a vague oriental look about it, as if the eyes carried the epicanthic folds of an Asian. The lips likewise were partially drawn back and open, exposing a rictal maw. Somewhere in the depths of that expression, frozen in death, you could vaguely make out its living counterpart. I would hazard to guess that the last expression of the unfortunate victim was somewhat alike with its teeth bared in an expression of pure terror. Now, the head in its present state was just an inanimate object, stripped of any aura of humanity. Who among us can even begin to conjure what nightmarish feelings this poor native was fated to endure as the creature’s vice-like jaws snapped shut around his head? Anyway, the image of that grisly item peering balefully from its frame of glistening viscera more than satisfied whatever latent  Grand Guignol -type of fascination I possess for such things. --kak        Frankly, an average ten-hour shift guarding nervous critters in an animal theme park was not the most pleasurable way to pass one’s time. Thus, I devised numerous antics to help stave off the continuous onslaughts of boredom. One of the better ones I recall was when I explored the buildings at the rear of The Park and there, discovered several large freezer units. Inside these were kept the various food items for the big cats. Being particularly bored on this particular day, I lifted a cover on one of the freezers and was surprised by what I found there: dozens of horse hooves. Frozen-solid horse hooves. God knows how they were procured, but I knew where they were headed: into the caged compound as snacks for the lions and tigers.  Immediately, my warped mind hit upon another use for these grisly items. And grisly they undoubtedly were. Although frozen through-and-through, with hanging tendrils of sinew and muscle clinging to the bone, they looked suspiciously like the mangled stumps of human limbs. I nearly cried out with joy at the idea which hit me that instant and hurried back to the guard shack to test my new theory on unsuspecting employees who had to pass by me before entering the rear gate of The Park. I had no trouble slipping the frozen hoof into my right jacket sleeve while holding it with my hand that was now completely hidden inside the arm of the coat.  As the employees walked through the gate and waved, I waved back, using my recently acquired “mangled stump of a hand”! The initial shock on their faces was most amusing and well worth the risk I ran of allowing the frozen hoof to partially thaw and ruin the sleeve of my jacket. It was especially fun to watch their reaction when I leaned out of the shack and waved my stump while admonishing them: “Don’t get too close to them tiger cages!” --kak      …My next topic for discussion is the joys of java. In deference to being an honored guest at your humble abode recently I held my tongue and did not unduly chastise you for keeping in your house (much less preparing and drinking) that odious brew that laughably masquerades under the moniker of coffee. To true java connoisseurs coffee from a can is a no-no. Yes, I know you will argue that it’s just fine for you and you are used to drinking it that way, but my dear friend, I think of your present plight as it pertains to the famous literary allusion of Plato’s Cave and the denizens that dwelt within, conscious only of the shadows flitting by on the wall they stared at, unbeknownst that the shadows are actually pale representations of the true world existing just behind them. Thought of in these terms, it might make more sense to you: drinking coffee is a luxury. We certainly don’t need the daily pleasures we derive from drinking it, and yet it is something we go out of our way to do each morning. Why then, if you’ve made the conscious choice to partake in this luxury, why isn’t the luxury at all luxurious? When you come here, I wish to introduce you to real coffee, prepared from freshly ground beans, kept safe from the debilitating attributes of light and air by being kept in an air-tight porcelain container until the moment of grinding. Only thus can you truly taste the dark roasted bean in all its glory. That pulverized brown chalk that claims to be the same thing is most certainly not. Go ahead… laugh… call me a snooty elitist bastard if you must. But I’m betting you will overwhelmingly enjoy and prefer the taste of my home brew to anything you can create from an aluminum can and that less-than-perfect method of slow drip brewing you adhere to. I’m not going to lie to you. I’m not going to sugar-coat the situation and say that in order to enjoy true coffee; it is an easier thing to accomplish than doing it your way. That is not the case. Mine is more time consuming, more entailed. Yet, what in life that is truly good is not also worth the extra effort?   And while we are on the subject of fine coffee, you might as well kiss that powdered creamer good-bye too. I can turn you on to the beauties of half-n-half which is the only civilized way to temper the more robust flavors inherent in true, freshly-ground coffee. Why go through the trouble of creating a little masterpiece in your cup when you sully it with powdered cream? This is the essence of tragedy. You should start buying your coffee in a sealed foil pouch, whole bean. But already I take this subject to untenable lengths. When you arrive, I will have plenty of opportunity to berate you for your former life styles.  --kak  \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
