However, one in particular made me start thinking. Don't laugh, but it was Steelheart's 'I'll Never Let You Go.' How many of you even remember that song? It's the one hit from those guys. The singer belts out those super high notes in various points throughout the song.   'Angel Eyes, you have angel eyes/Such a smile that lights up my life ...  I'll never let you go/You're always on my mind/You're the only one for me/You're all I see/And I'll never, never let you go.'   Anyhow, I got to thinking that of all those 80s hair metal bands, they  all  had their one power ballad it seemed. It was a guaranteed hit because the public ate them up. I goof around on my guitar and have shown some folks my 80s power ballad medley. Every Rose/Heaven/Don't Know what You Got/I Remember You, etc., etc. They all sounded the same but they were all monster hits back in the day. Now, I know you're thinking that the power ballad died when 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' hit the airwaves with a vengeance in 1991. You would be oh so wrong my friend. The power ballad only went into hiding for a brief few years. Check out some of the songs I've noticed that were hits in the last few years. These are  all  power ballads. Maybe they don't have the glass-breaking notes of the 80s songs, but they all fit the standard format: begin soft-big chorus-soft again-big chorus again-possible inclusion of a guitar solo and/or string section-big chorus.  'Here Without You' - 3 Doors Down 'The Reason' - Hoobastank 'Like A Stone' - Audioslave 'I Am The Highway' - Audioslave 'Hero' - Chad Kroeger & Josey Scott (Spiderman soundtrack) Creed had a whole mess of them ('With Arms Wide Open,' 'My Sacrifice,' 'My Own Prison,' 'One Last Breath') Evanescence - 'My Immortal' (at least the radio version was) Fuel - 'Hemorrhage (In My Hands),' 'Innocent' Lenny Kravitz - 'Again' Switchfoot - 'Dare You to Move' Seether Featuring Amy Lee - 'Broken'   These are just some examples. All of the above were hits in the very recent past or are hits now. In fact, many of today's praise & worship songs for churches are nothing more than power ballads with 'Christian' lyrics.   I guess the more things change, the more they stay them same. Just a piece of advice to all the bands out there; if you need a hit, you can't go wrong with a good, solid power ballad. :-)                   urlLink      I miss the guitar solo.   I know that I'm biased because I'm a guitar player but I always felt like a good butt-kickin' guitar solo took a song to a whole new level. Notice how 'Stairway To Heaven' utilizes Jimmy Page's beautiful solo to kick the song into fifth gear. Classic.  Recently, a guy at work loaned me his copy of  urlLink G3: Live in Concert  featuring Joe Satriani, Steve Vai and Eric Johnson. A veritable smorgasbord of gutar solos. My friend, Daniel Copeland, and I saw Satriani in concert in 1998 and we left just amazed at the level of technical skill displayed. However, the downside of the guitar solo was also on display that night. It can be too much of a good thing if it's done with no soul. It's hard for Satriani, Vai and the like to achieve the proper amount of soul because their songs are nothing but a big solo. But I digress â€¦  Think about your average '80s glam metal song and there's a good example of a soul-less solo. The solo took the song nowhere and was just an excuse for the guitar player to show his chops (think most any Poison song). Eddie Van Halen kind of started this trend but EVH had a little more soul to his playing than the average knock-off. Slash, of Guns 'n Roses, started to reverse this trend with his more bluesy leads and the way he played for the song instead of playing against it (think November Rain or Sweet Child O' Mine). Then came grunge.   Many think Nirvana et al. eliminated the guitar solo but they really just minimized it it. 'Smells Like Teen Spirit'  does  have a guitar solo. Albeit a repeat of the melody line. Pearl Jam had lots of guitar solos, just not in every song and they were always tasteful I thought. Then came the rap-metal phase of rock and guitar solos went the way of the T-Rex. Emphasis was now on groove and riffs. Players with any skill were sidelined and had to be content churning out the riffs. I always liked Creed's guitar player, Mark Tremonti because he came up with some monster riffs. Only on a few occasions did he have the chance to rip off a solo and when he did, it was always a good one. I wonder how many Creed songs could have been improved if Scott Stapp had shut up a little more and let Tremonti play a bit more. I'm hoping his post-Creed band will feature more of his playing and less of the posing that plagued Creed.  This is getting to be more of a ramble than anything so I will end it with a question. What are a few of your your favorite guitar solos? I'll answer mine in the first comment.                   Since I am new to having my own blog, here are some notes for anyone who visits Alien Soil. 1. Sorry about having to register to leave coments with your name attached. As far as I know, blogspot (who hosts this site) wants this to be done. You can always post as 'Anonymous' and leave your name at the end of your comment. Please don't avoid the site because of this. That would make me very sad :-( 2. Hopefully, soon, I can make a little sidebar with some of my favorite links. For now, here are some of my favorite sites:  urlLink Christian Church of Jasper  This is the church where I am a member and part of the worship team.  urlLink The Thinklings Weblog  This is where I got my blogging start. They are great guys so please check that site out.  urlLink Mysterium Tremendum  This is Thinkling Jared's solo blog. Jared is the only Thinkling I have ever met personally. He and I had several religion classes together at Middle Tennessee State University. Jared is a great guy so check his site out too.  urlLink Thunderstruck  'A Truckstop for the soul.' This is a site that collects articles from across the Web that (sometimes) relate to Christians making an impact in the culture.  Thanks again for visiting.                 I haven't gotten near enough sleep over the past few nights. It's really only a matter of going to bed earlier. There's always something to keep me up it seems. My eyes are getting heavy sitting in front of this computer at work. Anybody got a good suggestion for waking up (besides drinking coffee - blech!)?  I was in our community's Strassenfest (a town's celebration of its German heritage and an excuse for a lot of people to get really loaded at the beer garden) parade over the weekend. I haven't been in one since I was in Jr. High. Our church band played on a float. It was an outreach-type idea to the community. I think it went over pretty well. We made a lot of noise at least and we got to cover Switchfoot's  Meant to Live  about a half dozen times along the route. As weird as it may sound, it was quite fun. We got some puzzled looks but we got a lot more smiles and head-nodding along with the music and quite a few thumbs-up from the community. I think it was a good idea. Read more about it  urlLink here.   My sister is getting married in a little more than a week down in Nashville. I am supposed to scan in a bunch of photos for a slide show. I was expecting her to send me 20-30 total. I got about 70. I guess I'll be busy on that this week as I've only scanned in about 6 so far. I love Nashville(I lived there for 5 years) and I wish we could stay a little bit longer but this is a wedding-only type trip for the most part. I may be able to see a few people while we are there though. Hopefully.  My 1-year-old daughter is a wildcat. She is going through the 'pull everything out' phase. Everything that isn't bolted down is going to get scattered. I installed some child latches on cabinets the other night. If you ever want to hear me curse, come to my house while I'm doing some sort of home repair. The Super Handyman, I am not. I hate it but I really wish I was better at that type of stuff. I did manage to fix my broken toilet a week back with some assistance from drummer Mike Weisensteiner (tied for fifth on the Bonus Points Board). I was pretty proud of myself for that one.  My wife is now a blonde. She bleached her hair a few weeks back. It took some getting used to but it looks nice I think. I still say she married lower than she could have. ;-)  I read some Flannery O'Conner for the first time over the past few weeks. She's a great storyteller and she often uses the South as a setting, which is nice.  TV sucks in the summer. It's pretty bad when  I would rather watch 4 re-runs of  Everybody Loves Raymond  on TBS than new programming on the other channels.  There are a few new albums out that I want to listen to but, since CD money is not even on the family budget, I'll have to hear about it from you all. Anybody heard the post-Creed group Alter Bridge yet? (No smarmy comments, Copeland) ;-) How about the Nickel Creek/Toad the Wet Sprocket mash-up Mutual Admiration Society?  Hope everyone is healthy, wealthy and wise.          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
