Luckily it did finally come before I fell over, and I managed to get my stream rip software up and running before that too. :)  I also caught the new single “Popular” in that show. It’s a pretty good song, with an even better  urlLink video , as I found out today. I’m very much looking forward to its release on the 23rd of August. Hopefully the whole album called ' urlLink The Tension and the Spark ' will be equally good, but I think I’ll have wait and see until mid September something. It’s funny though, I’ve been waiting for new releases from both Darren and Bryan Adams for years, more actively the past 12 months, and when they finally do get around to releasing their new material they do it basically at the same time. Bryan’s new single “Open Road” should be getting some airplay already now, as it was released yesterday, and his album “Room Service” should be available in the second half of September sometime. I’m not so sure about the musical value of this release though, I wouldn’t go recommending it to anyone at this point.                                Right now I'm left wondering why is it that I'm supposed to think for everybody else? Why is it, that when I make a tiny mistake, or not even a mistake actually, maybe just I'm a little less careful, I don't spell everything out 100% and repeat and repeat and repeat all over again... Why is it that I feel like the world is crumbling down after that? Why is that if a person receives a paper that she doesn't know what to do with, she doesn't start wondering that if she didn't request it, maybe someone else did? I can sit here and sigh as much as I want to, but the truth is, I sent out requests for submitting IT training tenders 6 weeks ago. The date for submitting the tenders was 5 weeks ago, and today I find out that the one tender I received by e-mail wasn't actually the only one after all... there was another one that the personnel manager has graciously sat on until this very moment, I only found out about it from a third party. What else is there to do really, but sigh...                               Can you imagine that – I was actually working almost non-stop from last Friday afternoon until now, that is Wednesday lunchtime. Even did a few hours worth of overtime. If I had any guts I’d go ahead and ask Christmas Eve off work next week, because it is supposed to be a shorter working day anyways, and with them almost three hours of overtime – I’m thinking I deserve it. Most probably there won’t be anything to do here anyways… but we’ll see. I can’t actually imagine working on Christmas Eve – last few years I’ve had quite many last minute shopping obligations, but overall, Christmas Eve in Estonia is basically the most important day of Christmas, so the perspective of getting up before 7 on that special day to do something I’d rather not be doing is not a pleasant one.  Other than that – I should really be thinking about Christmas presents – I have a few ideas, which is surprising, but many of them are rather expensive and I’m not quite sure – maybe too expensive. Perhaps I should look for collaborators as I have done during previous years; just because I can’t really afford a good gift is also not a good enough reason to give someone a crappy one.             \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
