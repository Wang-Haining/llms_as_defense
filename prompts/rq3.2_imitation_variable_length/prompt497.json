Now use a bit of creative license and randomly place pedestrians on aforementioned pavement. With me so far? Good. Now, continue in your minds eye and lets get all these people moving in the same direction, sticking rigidly within their own lanes but have some move at slightly different speeds(nothing drastic mind, just small variations). Now comes the tricky part, once a person catches up with someone in front, you will need to imagine them into the next lane  as long  (now this bits important) as they do not obstruct anyone in doing so (if they do, simply imagine their speed down a bit). Now step back (mentally of course) and admire your creation, looks simple doesn't it, and effective too. Keep the image to mind though, we are going to need it shortly.  So, you have a load of people walking down a pavement, all in the same direction, all roughly the same speed. If one of those people accidently bumped into someone, they would look very silly wouldn't they? I mean, its not often people bump into each other walking through town (and not many pavements have our deluxe three lane design) In fact it would take an act of sheer ignorance/stupidity to get two pedestrians to collide in this collective mental image we have created. Okay, so clearly its easy, the  system  works, one might even say its fool proof.  So why the hell do vehicles collide on the motorway then???  Because when your average fool gets behind the wheel of a car, normal fool physics go out of the window. They change, they evolve. Welcome, dear friends to the Super Breed of Fool, I give you..... The Motorway Driver.  The Motorway Driver would never dream of pushing in the queue of your local supermarket but once he is in a car, he will happily zoom past a large line of traffic waiting to come off and then at the last possible moment signal, stop then push in. The Motorway Driver thinks he is indestructible. Wagons, coaches and other large vehicles are soft and sqidgy so what possible danger could arise from pulling out in front of them? The Motorway Driver doesn't need lights on in bad weather conditions,  he  can see fine, what does it matter? The Motorway Driver doesn't need indicators whilst traveling,  he  sure as hell knows where he is going, isn't it obvious to other drivers too? The Motorway Driver fears nothing, knows exactly where he going and slows for no-one, unless of course there has been an accident on the  other side  of the motorway.                      Moving on from the the king of the jungle we encounter some true harmonisation of nature, as we walk slowly and carefully towards the deepest, darkest depths of the jungle. Here, surrounded by cardboard trees and animals of all shapes and sizes we see the indigenous&nbsp;pigmies of the&nbsp; pickerpacker  tribe. Somehow managing to live in perfect unison with their surroundings, the pickerpacker people have learnt to survive on the most basic of diets. They have many customs and dressed in baggy clothing and woolly headpieces most civilised members of the western world would find them bizarre to say the least. As we approach we can clearly see the two main tribesmen  suffuros gladly  and  torturous loudly  begining the daily dance around the hi-fi. Strange noises can be heard eminating from the device, to which the tribesmen seem entranced by.&nbsp;These noises are the tribesmens way of keeping the many beasts away from their emcampment as most animals find the noises horrible to the ears. A quick journey away from the pygmy home and we get to see a rare sight indeed! Here, hiding behind a plethora of boxes, we see the lesser spotted  wherus davus.  Seldom seen in these parts, the wherus davus is a timid and shy beast, preferring solitude and quiet to the normal social noisy lifestyle of your average jungle dweller.                            CVs have always baffled me. Now your average interviewer must know most of what they are reading should be filed under 'creative writing' in their cabinet and the interviewee sure as hell knows the words composed on that document  are about as factually correct as Robert Maxwells 100metre swimming certicate. Yet, bizarrely, the pretense is kept up by both parties during an actual interview. I recently had to write a CV and of course i kept the essentials in and lied about nothing (you never know, my new boss may read&nbsp;this) but when i got to the section headed 'personal interests' i was in two minds as to whether or not i should be brutally honest or do the usual and put more spin on it than your average US government hawk. Here were the options.     &nbsp;    What they want to hear&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     I am self motivated and organised.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     The Truth     I&nbsp;find it hard dragging myself to the kitchen to actually eat most days, and have no idea where my socks are kept.     What they want to hear     I consider myself pro-active.     The Truth     I went outside once...it was cold.     What they want to to hear     I am a team player and work well with people.     The Truth     Please give me a job where i get to work alone, and dont even think about taking things from my desk.     What they want to hear     I am ambitious, driven and have a will to succeed.     The Truth     Pay me each month and im happy.     What they want to hear     I am an outgoing, confident person.     The Truth     I will talk to you, but i will be thinking about whats on TV that night and nodding. oh and i really actually dispise you, but hey, no use making enemies at work.     &nbsp;   As you can imagine i went for what they wanted to hear.   &nbsp;    &nbsp;  &nbsp;                         Moths Do Not Kill People. There I have said it. I am so glad I got that out of the way. Only I feel the effort was a futile one as Seonaid (like many people) will still see them as the flying incarnation of Satan. What the hell is it with those things anyway? Why single moths out for such speciesism? I mean, lets be honest here if you were a pair of pants or a particularly expensive shirt I could understand the phobia (those buggers go through clothes like George Bush goes through crayons) but for the humans amongst us, a fear of something so small and relatively harmless just seems absurd. Imagine how the moth feels being chased around the room with a magazine, getting smacked about and squashed whilst having to deal with high pitched human noises like 'ohmygodohmygod killitandynowpleeeease, arrghitsthereitthereohmygod!'. Its not easy being a moth you know, they aren't considered as cute and photogenic as their butterfly cousins, they don't frolic in the fields and pastures on an idyllic summers day. They have to fly round rooms at subsonic speeds kamakaziing into any available light source whilst making loud noises (much to the annoyance of the rooms occupiers). So please, spare a thought for the moth, give it a chance, don't get miffed by a moth, killer moths are a myth. (I see a teeshirt in the pipelines there!)      Oh and Part three of the Cardboard Jungle will be published in the next day or two, and that's a KinPromise(tm)                      I can hardly type. I am actually shaking all over in excitement. This morning I received a highly confidental email off a well-to-do ethopian banker. Apparently this guy was waiting for one of his investors to transfer 25 million dollars into his bank, but discovered that the investor had actually been killed in a car crash! Now this man left no will, but clearly the banker still had the smell of uber cash in his nostrils and came up with a plan. He needed someone from the UK to act on the investors behalf (according to ethiopian law it has to be a foreigner, imagine that) and transfer all that money into this reputable mans bank. And can you guess who this ethiopian chose for this enterprise? Yes, that's right, of all the people in all the world, he sends ME an email asking ME PERSONALLY to help sort this situation out, and I am going to get a whopping TWENTY PERCENT of that cash!!!  Now that's pretty lucky I hear you shout. But wait, it gets better. I returned home from work today to find another email. This one was from a big cheese in the Nigerian oil industry, the story goes that this man needs investment into his petroleum ventures, the email states everything quite clearly that any investment, no matter how small, would bring unbelievable returns. Now, at this point I have to admit I was pretty flabbergasted, I couldn't believe my luck, I had only just that day been told I am the proud owner of five million dollars and then along comes a completely sound airtight business venture for me to sink my teeth into.   The world is a funny place, but I have a feeling about these emails, they simply ooze legitimacy. Ill keep you all posted.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
