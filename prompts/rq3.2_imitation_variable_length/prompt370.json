  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic:\n\n           What I find deeply disturbing atm is that in a month, I have written more blogs than people who have been on this thing for a year. Shocking eh. Scary for me... I think the reasons for this travesty being:  1) Whenever I begin something, which is very rare, I enter it with a passion and go to extremes (yep that's right, even online blogs...) 2) Evidently, I have too much free time on my hands, this being the summer holiday 3) I talk a lot and have far too much random and boring crap to say...  Btw, I take thos oppurtunity to DEFEND NEIL DIAMOND, who has been defined as crappy old music and an old geyser by a charming friend of mine... OK, whatever you think of the man, (I don't like *him* for goodness' sake), the following songs are, in my humble opinion, excellent:   Play Me  (  HAS   to be a classic I   LOVE   it)  Kentucky Woman   Solitary Man   I'm A Believer   Shilo   Girl, You'll Be a Woman Soon     Give it a chance, eh? At least listen with an open mind before coming out with judgemental inadvised crap...                       Just saw Shrek 2 again, it's so damn good! I love it when they do 'Holding Out For A Hero' at the end, I want the soundtrack... although in fact I *do* have the original version by Bonnie Tyler, which I'm listening 2 right now... Not many cds our family doesn't have between us!!  Puss In Boots is so damn cool, I love Antonio Banderas (and his wonderful voice) anyway, and tis a marvellous part! Just a pity he has 2 be an animated cat instead of his usual self *sigh* hehe!! But the cat is *great*!  Wearing my new top, tis ver' nice if a bit over-revealing, methinks for home use only! Got 2 start reading 'The Poisonwood Bible'....  Can't seem 2 sleep anymore, tis ver' bizarre.... Ah well, *such is life*. Was up til 5am this morning, tis nicht so gut. /Me yawns!  Ever heard Genesis? No probably not... /damn my varied and unrecognised musical tastes!!  Damn this infernal icecream, etcetera, my diet has flown away on the wind... ah screw it.  Bttr go ... purely because i can't think of anything to say   [first time this has ever occurred in my lifetime]                      Ah, good, loud music, and what can beat it we ask ourselves? Not much, although I *can* think of a few.   Anyway...  Parents are having a bit of a freakout with me, never fun, while my baby brother (ha!) is in the foullest and most grotesque mood known to man...  Ah well, /ignore mayhem around self! hehe.  Stayed at Chris' house then Alison's house recently, which was ver' fun, and we saw Spiderman 2, which I deeply recommend to those underprivileged souls who have not yet seen it. Also walked through a thunderstorm, and that, also, is most sincerely recommended (apart from lightning risks of course...) Got soaked to the skin and arrived back at Christina's with our clothes apparently glued to our skin!! Hehe twas ver' amusing though!  Queen off now, listening to 'Shout!' by the Isley Brothers. ver' good!  Anyway, intended to write something deep, philisophical and totally unconnected to my boring life, but cannae... brain *appears* (:p now you just look stupid!) to have fried, so bye!          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
