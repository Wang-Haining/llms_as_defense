I thought it  was (predictably) great, and I (predictably) kicked myself for having not seeing it on the big screen. I'll probably watch it again tonight so I can see all the parts I missed while Melissa was chatting, cheering, crying etc.     Tonight when I watch it though I'm going to drink... and from the looks of things heavily. Tim and I made up a few rules to a Lord of the Rings drinking game today during lunch time. Let me know the results if you end up trying it out yourself. Use the comments feature on this site to suggest/add your own rules too.   Every time someone falls off a cliff... take a drink  Every time  urlLink Sam  cries... take a drink  Every time a close-up of  urlLink Frodo's  eyes takes up more than 50% of the screen... take a drink  Every time you mistake  urlLink the (male) elf  briefly for a hot blonde chick... take a drink (NOTE: your ability to distinguish between the two is sure to diminish the longer you play this game, making this particular rule a very slippery slope)   Trying watching all three  urlLink The Lord of the Rings  movies...  urlLink The Fellowship of the Ring ,  urlLink The Two Towers , and  urlLink The Return of the King ... sequentially while playing this game and you have a whole weekend full of entertainment right there!                     I have such great friends. Knowing that my company has recently been acquired and that likely that will mean the end of a job I've really enjoyed... my friends have started to rally and help me find a great new job. Here's one I received from someone who was very well intentioned, but must not have thought about how difficult and depressing the position could be.  Job title: Manager Marketing Communications North America  Name of company: ChevronTexaco  PR and Marcom for Chevron? Heh! Ya right.     What happens when another drunk boat captain crashes another tanker into an iceberg? I sure as hell have more important things in my life to deal with then helping a mega corporation save face in a situation like that. Or what happens when some African nation that company has been exploiting for it's resources rises up and kills all the American contractors working on the oil rig there. Can you imagine? No thx!  I really do appreciate the help guys. Don't get me wrong... keep the leads flowing. But, come on, anyone who knows me even a little bit well knows there isn't enough cash in the world to pay me to be the corporate mouth-piece for an organization like Chevron.                     From time to time inevitably everyone has to justify their existence within a corporation. 'What do you do exactly?' 'What value do you provide the organization?' 'What impact would it have on 'us' if 'we' didn't have 'you'?'      When it comes to design, measuring quantifiable value can be difficult and we are often forced to use more qualitative metrics to measure the value that good aesthetics and proper design brings to a company.   In the past couple days I've found a couple good resources that attempt to illustrate in quantifiable terms the impact of design on an enterprise. The net net of both is a conclusion that most of us who work in the applied arts field already know... companies that are design-driven outperform those that are not. Now bring on the charts and figures!    urlLink Impact of Design on Stock Market Performance   -  The Design Council  The design council has produced an excellent research report documenting the valuation of companies considered to be 'design-driven' vis-a-vis those that are not over a period of 10 years. A great test in terms a CFO can understand. Over time what is the tangible effect of design on a company and it's shareholders  The results? Design driven companies outperform the market by 200%!   'Companies recognized as effective users of design strongly outperform their peers on the stock market - that is the key finding of a ground-breaking study which has tracked a total of 166 design-led companies over ten years of UK share price activity.   A group of 63 companies, grouped into a 'Design Portfolio' for their consistent showing in various design award schemes, outperformed both the FTSE All Share and FTSE 100 indices by around 200% between 1994 and 2003, the study reveals.'      urlLink The Power of Design   -  Business Week  A great feature on design house IDEO and some case studies on how they have made their clients money through good design and design process.                      urlLink Google  launched a cool new service called  urlLink Gmail . I've landed a beta account and it seems pretty hot. You get 1000megs of space vs. MSN Hotmails 2megs making it an actually useful mailbox. It's pretty interesting how it turns back and forth barrage of short emails into threads or 'conversations'. It also takes advantage of Google search technology to keep my email life organized. I've set up my  urlLink kk@burnkit.com  address to forward there. Gmail would be really cool though if you could POP several accounts like you can over at Hotmail where I had been popping my old  urlLink TWU  mail, my  urlLink Burnkit  mail, and my groovy.com mail. Anyway, I'm hooked. Checked it out when it becomes generally available.  I've also been expiramenting with this other online networking tool called  urlLink LinkedIn . I got turned onto it from a good friend,  urlLink Ean Jackson , in  urlLink Vancouver  who always seems to be on the cutting edge of this type of thing... he got me up and running on  urlLink Plaxo  too. It kinda seems like  urlLink Friendster  but for business contacts. You upload information about yourself and your professional experience and jobs you've held. People who have worked with you in the past can write testimonials or references. It's kinda fun to mess with and a good way to 'practice' marketing oneself, but I'm still skeptical that I'll get any good job leads or new contacts from it... we'll see. Lemme know if any of you guys sign up and I'll write you up a little reference and beg you for one for me as well. :P Here's my  urlLink work-in-progress page .                      Time for some shout-outs. It's been way too long.  My friend  urlLink Cris  is now a  urlLink rockstar .  urlLink Josh's  company  urlLink Burnkit  redesigned.  urlLink Boris  is working hard at  urlLink urbanvancouver.com .  urlLink Cameron  took a wicked Marketing job with  urlLink Playground .

New York Times Magazine published a great new in-depth look inside life and legacy of North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il.  A few paragraphs are pasted below... but the  urlLink full text  is definitely worth a read. It sounds like we're going to be hearing lots more  Dear Leader  in next couple years.   urlLink    The Dear Leader is a workaholic. Kim Jong Il sleeps four hours a night, or if he works through the night, as he sometimes does, he sleeps four hours a day. His office is a hive of activity; reports cross his desk at all hours. Dressed as always in his signature khaki jumpsuit, he reads them all, issuing instructions to aides, dashing off handwritten notes or picking up the phone at 3 a.m. and telling subordinates what should lead the news broadcasts or whom to dispatch to a prison camp. His micromanaging style is less Caligula, with whom he has often been compared, and more Jimmy Carter on an authoritarian tear.    The Dear Leader, as the North Korean media refer to him, wishes to be viewed as a modern leader. He has boasted to visitors that he has three computers in his office, though it's not known if he operates them himself or has aides who do so. His eldest son is reputed to be a computer whiz and, like sons the world over, is credited with bringing his father into the digital age. When Madeleine K. Albright, then the secretary of state, visited North Korea in 2000, Kim asked her, as he said farewell, to give him the State Department's e-mail address.   Because of weakening eyesight, the Dear Leader rarely reads newspapers; for keeping abreast of world affairs, he relies on television. It is a safe bet that he is well aware of the uproar caused by his government's confirmation, earlier this month, that it has begun making nuclear bombs from reprocessed plutonium. In a meeting a few years ago with a group of South Korean media executives, Kim explained that he began watching South Korean television in 1979. A media junkie, he also watches NHK from Japan, as well as CCTV from China and CNN. Having led his nation into chronic poverty and famine, what does he make of the enormous wealth he sees in the broadcasts and commercials?   urlLink Full Text >>                       urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink      Check out this series of QuickTime videos by Eman Laerton. This guy is too funny. He goes around to concert parking lots and tells fans that the bands they like are inauthentic, fake, and just plain suck. He stands up with a soapbox and bull-horn and tries to reform the fans of what he considers bad music with his public service announcements. His message is simple. Don't go to this concert. Stop listening to bad music. Turn off your radio and tv.  After getting a crowd of partying Linkin Park fans to dance and chant 'Linkin Park is a roller-coaster' he proceeds to tell them that like a roller coaster Linkin park may seem dangerous or appear rebellious while in fact it's perfectly safe for family fun, the danger is an illusion, and they've been duped by marketing hype. He goes farther claiming the lead singer writes in fictionalized cliches and calling him fraudulent.  I would love to go see this guy do his act at one of these upcoming shows in LA  urlLink posted on his website .                        JeffMacIntyre.com  Well,  urlLink Jeffie is writing again  (cheer!) and has a couple new blog posts up.  However, I like this post from the peanut gallery the best. :)   You are starting to sound like the automated 'phone-lady' at Telus. 'We're all really busy right now, but if you'll just hang on a little longer....' Nobody gives a shit about the day job JP. Entertain me dammit!  Posted by Big Brother at October 21, 2003 08:30 AM      AListApart.com  Zeldman and Co. have  urlLink re-launched AListApart.com  with a new look and new content. I fear I'm in the minority on this one but I don't really like the new design... it's just nice to have the site back up though. Good work guys.   BurnKit.com  Best known for their tragically hip bible design, off-da-hook anniversary parties, and hedonistic road trips... JSHDNFRD and and Adam Neilson have added another supa-star artist to their design team...  urlLink Jeremy Crowle .
