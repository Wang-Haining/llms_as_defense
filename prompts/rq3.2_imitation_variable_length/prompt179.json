With you, I fall so fast  I can hardly catch my breath, I hope it lasts  [Chorus:]  Ohhhhh  It seems like I can finally rest my head on something real  I like the way that feels  Ohhhhh  It's as if you've known me better than I ever knew myself  I love how you can tell  All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me  All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me  I am moody, messy  I get restless, and it's senseless  How you never seem to care  When I'm angry, you listen  When youre happy, it's a mission  And you wont stop 'til I'm there  Fall... Sometimes I fall so fast  Well, I hit that bottom  Crash, you're all I have  [Chorus:]  Ohhhhh  It seems like I can finally rest my head on something real  I like the way that feels  Ohhhhh  It's as if you known me better than I ever knew myself  I love how you can tell  All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me  All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me  How do you know everything I'm about to say?  Am I that obvious?  And if it's written on my face...  I hope it never goes away... yeah  On a Monday, I am waiting  And by Tuesday, I am fading into your arms...  So I can breathe  [Chorus:]  Ohhhhh  It seems like I can finally rest my head on something real  I love the way that feels  Ohhhhh  It's as if you've know me better than I ever knew myself  I love how you can tell  Ohhhhh  I love how you can tell  Ohhhhh  I love how you can tell  All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me  All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me...                           *sighs* i 4got to  upd8  my blog last night. nwwala na kc sa isip ko eh!
