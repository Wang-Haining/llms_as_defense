On Saturday, Somrat and I went apartment hunting with our friend Gautam, a fellow plan 2 graduate who is moving out here, and then we went to the beach at outer sunset. It was freezing and we dipped our toes in the water for about 2 seconds before running back to Gautam's car. Yesterday we walked all day long. We went out to Golden Gate park for a few hours. Then we walked to the marina for lunch and over to the wharf. On our way back home, we stopped in at the cable car museum which was really fascinating. It is actually the power station for all three cable car lines and it had a bunch of old cable cars and information about how it all works. Evidently in 1947 the city almost put the cable cars out of commission with the advent of city buses. But, the city rallied around the cable cars and they decided to keep them. I am now well-versed in cable car trivia. Did you know the cables have to be replaced once every 70-200 days? Now you do.                      Today we visited islamic cairo... the old medieval area of the city that is filled with 9th-13th century mosqes and markets in dark alleys. We started the day by visiting El-Ahzar mosque, one of the few that tourists can enter. Our guide profusely praised tourists for donating money that restored the mosque after a 1992 earthquake. He was seriously impressed that I knew there were 5 minarets for the 5 pillars but was later blown away when Jerry started chatting him up in Arabic. The markets here are just crazy... we saw everything from gold and jewels to chickens having their heads lopped off (fresh food). Later in the day we visited the Citadel... built by Saladin and the home to the Egyptian government for over 700 years. It is a huge fortress built on a hill that would overlook the nile if it wasn't for the urban sprawl that also houses a number of stunning mosques. Jerry and I felt silly for not knowing about such a treasure until we came across it in the guidebook; it easily compared to european landmarks like westminster abbey and yet we didn't even know it existed. It is fascinating to see what the Egyptians have been capable of building since 3500 bc through 1300 ad... but then you think that all they do today is cash in from the past successes through the tourism industry, not the pioneers of architecture, arts, language, science that they once were.                      So! We got to Kariba and the first thing we did is head to a party. It was a huge buffet and open bar... we met the entire town and it was a lot of fun. We went to have a drink at a hotel afterwards and a hippo came up onto the shore. It was literally 10 feet away from us and Jerry and I were running up the stairs to the pool area. Did you know hippos kill more people than any other animal in Africa? The next day, Kumbie our host, got us a trip on a fishing boat on the lake. He works for a tilapia fishery, the biggest fishery in Africa. We went out for like&nbsp; hours and watched them harvest the fish and enjoyed the view. Kumbie and his friend took us around looking for elephants. We drove around for a while and saw none and then we saw them walking right across the road... like 10 feet from us again. It is such a rush to see the animals that close up. We saw tons of baboons too. The next day we just bummed around Kariba and took a tour of a crocodile farm (associated with the fishery) and the factory... interesting to see how we get our food. Last night there was yet another party... this is definitely a party town. Everyone was so great.                       Yesterday Jerry and I went to the Israel Museum and it was just insane. The only way I can describe it is to take about 4 of the Smithsonians in DC and put it into a single museum and then you'll have the Israel Museum. We went mostly to see the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Judaica collection, and the archaeology exhibit for the region... which was all excellent. Seeing the Dead Sea Scrolls was really amazing... for those of you who don't know what they are, they are a collection of Jewish writings from the 3rd century BC to the 1st century AD that contain among other things an entire set of the Old Testament/Hebrew Scriptures of the bible. Kind of puts the Gutenburg bible to shame... There was lots of other cool stuff. The museum had actually also brought three old synagogues into the museum from Italy, Poland, and India. They had an amazing art collection from old masters to impressionists to modern and contemporary art. They had a temporary exhibit of Turkish artifacts, one of Japanese design, and an exhibit of Russian avant-garde art. Anyways, we wandered around for over 4 hours and didn't see nearly everything. In the afternoon we hiked up to the Mount of Olives past the Garden of Gethsamane and the Gethsamane Bascillica to get a view of the Old City. Today we are going back to Tel Aviv to catch our flight to Istanbul.                      Jerry and I figure that all of our travels from here on out take us one step closer to home. And so we flew from Johannesburg to Cairo yesterday via Nairobi and Khartoum... at least 1000 miles closer... which means less painful flights to get back. Here are some thoughts on yesterday. First, we were watching BBC world on the airplane and seeing all the reports of the humanitarian crisis in Darfur, Sudan thinking, wow, our plane is going to be touching down in that country in a few hours. We didn't get off but it was still strange. Second, the Nairobi airport is the most disorganized place I have ever seen. They took our boarding pass at the gate and we wandered across the tarmac and could have boarded any plane we so chose... they never checked our boarding pass again and the only way we even found our plane was that there was a small sign by the stairway up to it. Crazy! That would never go over in America... no security there. Pick a plane any plane. But, we made it safely, even early to Egypt and got to our hotel easily. This morning we made all our travel plans including overnight trains to Aswan and an overnight train back to Cairo and a bus ticket to Israel. So we are all set. And, it is SOOOO cheap here. We spent less on all our transportation than for our first bus ticket in Africa. Wow!
