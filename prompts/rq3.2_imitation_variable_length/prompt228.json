Radiohead sings this song on their   OK Computer   album.  I like this song because it accsensuates their entire album by concerning itself with a busy and comfortable human heart that is full of waste as a landfill and is happy to settle for the quiet life, the poisonous fumes and a life of   no alarms and no surprises please.    It seems that at the end of the day a pretty house and a pretty garden and no suprises are the desires of the day.  It is almost as if we are handed a sentence unaware, then hating the stale walls of our prison, and finally getting used to them as the only way it can be.  As Red, Andy Dufrain's cell-mate in the movie   Shawshank Redemption   said, 'At first you hate these walls, then you accept them, and eventually you become dependent on them.'    I pray that we don't allow life to trap us into its monotonous haze.  That we don't ask for any alarms or suprises.  Let us not make our life, our country a hotel civilization obsessed with comfort and convenience and contentment. \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
