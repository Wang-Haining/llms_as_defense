This morning, Kohler and I went to play tennis once again.&nbsp; We actually didn't do too bad and were both surprised at our performance, considering Tuesday's wonderful time.&nbsp; We also shot some hoops too.&nbsp; That wasn't all that great for once.&nbsp; Usually, I love to play b-ball (as long as the Vanilla Gorilla is not playing) but this time, it was all about tennis.&nbsp; I have learned to like tennis, thank you Kohler.   Today, as I was about to leave for Kohler's place, I noticed something.&nbsp; In our living room, there are individual pictures of each family member, with&nbsp;each picture next to the others to form one giant&nbsp;family picture,&nbsp;on the wall, each one updated every school year.&nbsp; I happened to glance at the wall and it occurred to me.&nbsp; My picture hasn't been on that wall for years.&nbsp; I don't even recall seeing it up there at all.&nbsp; My dad has even told me before that this wall was for pictures of each person in the family.&nbsp; As I looked at the wall, that came to mind.&nbsp; I thought to myself 'Ok, so my picture isn't even worthy enough to be on that wall now.&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; I can see when I'm definitely wanted.'&nbsp; Usually, this type of thing would enduce a depression of sorts, but I just became very very neutral about it.&nbsp; It didn't even phase me a bit.&nbsp; I think I am joining Derek on the 'cold, cruel, and soulless' list.&nbsp; But that's fine.   Random thoughts: I remember what my best friend from 6th grade ( that was 5 years ago!!!) &nbsp;was like back in the day.&nbsp; We did absolutely everything together.&nbsp; The summer 'tween 6th and 7th grades, I think I stayed at his place at least once every week.&nbsp; Now, he is one of the most prolific stoners of C-town.&nbsp; This makes me think.&nbsp; If my best friend can change like that over the course of 5 years, then where are my present friends and I going to end up in 5 years down the road?&nbsp; Hopefully, not the same as the one described.  After thinking about that, it got me to start thinking about myself.&nbsp; Maybe my friend wasn't the one who changed.&nbsp; Wait.&nbsp; That's completely stupid.&nbsp; He  IS  the one who changed.&nbsp; But anyways, after thinking about that, I wondered how much have I changed in the past X years?&nbsp; It's impossible for me to not have changed but how much?&nbsp; How much am I going to change in the up and coming future?&nbsp; Am I even going to remember C-town? ... Do I really want to?&nbsp;   I think that's enough thinking for the day.&nbsp; It felt good to express myself like that.&nbsp; And that, Karl, is a reason for blogging.                                  i am back from the bs. and that can stand for either bullshit or boy's state, depending on your preference. but the week went well. made quite a few new acquaintances. by the way, Poker Guru, do you know an Adam Fitzpatrick of Forks? and sophie, do you know a certain person by the name of Andy Swenson? he seemed to be a cool person, though he was located in the town of stillwater at BS. stillwater and my city of austin weren't on the best of terms. 1 in the morn and we were running down the halls, opening the doors to their rooms, chucking balled-up, wet paper towels at them... hehehe... RHINO!! haha... sorry. but anyways.  it felt as if we were at more of a boot camp then a governmental camp of sorts. our counselors consisted of a fruit, a hardass, and another fruit. but we did impeach and try our mayor for fraternization with the ladies (that's illegal). oh and he resisted arrest as well. but eventually we got him tried. guilty. haha... but we had so many assemblies throughout the week in an auditorium that had about 6 inches of leg room, combined with no arm room, monotonous speakers, and being awake since 5 that morning. all of this together led to a full BS nap time during the assemblies.   our volleyball team sucked it up though. we did win the toilet bowl. RHINO!! PETER!! hahaha... inside joke that absolutely no one that reads this will get. we did hold many a game of ultimate frisbee though. we tried tackle style but... ouch. i also sprained my knee doing monkey rolls during cal. great fun.   as for other entertainment subjects, i played chess many times. i ended up with a 9-2 record. not bad but could be better. plus we played hackysack plenty of times. that was fun.   some people decided to thouroughly piss off the minnesota sec of state though. somebody asked her what her opinion on gay marriage is and she responded ' marriage is a bond between a man and a woman. done.' many people then went up to the mic's and proceeded to tell her about their own opinions on gay marriage. now these mic's were set up for questions, not debates. let me tell you this, the sec of state was not a happy camper when about 15 people kept telling her that it was a person's choice to who they marry and trying to change her opinion. not good. counselors were pissed.   on another note, our city won the war with minneapolis. after they decided to dump water on our counselors outside, we agreed on a cadence run at 5 in the morning the next day. we went to sleep early, then at 5, we were outside. as we ran past their dorms, with open windows, we yelled out ' HEY YOU!! MINNEAPOLIS!! WAKE UP!! MINNEAPOLIS!!' and let me tell you, we saw many birds that morning.  we were told at the beginning of the week that we would most likely leave BS with a new view on things. oddly enough, it's true. but i don't know how. i just feel like i am a new person, as if i am reborn. eh. i'm not going to waste many brain cells on that issue.  oh by the way Penelope, bill and i did recieve your guys' letter. we were going to write back but it would've been pointless because there weren't going to be any more speakers traveling between BS and GS. so i decided i would just talk to you later. and tell Acceb that we can take the death threats.   well anyways, i am going to go write in my real journal. more info in there. and now i have 70 bucks. yay... hehehe... TYRONE... the plan is going as planned? shoi.  poopscotch.             \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
