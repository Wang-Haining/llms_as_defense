A Prince if you will, who would come to her aid, A gentleman of sorts, whose love would not fade.  Her hair was of gold, and her skin was soft as snow, Her eyes shown like diamonds, like Marilyn Monroe. All the time thinking, of her future and her life, Her ambition of becoming, a mother and a wife.  All that she wants, is the prince that she dreamt of, To ride off together, and fall madly in love. They will live forever, in each other's heart, They can never be divided, never split apart.  Their love was so great, it was the envy of all, Nothing could compare, the rest seemed so small. Her dream came true, she had found her prince, Life is grand now, more enjoyable since.  An addition to the family, is the only thing that's missing, Something she's always wanted, thinking back, and reminiscing. A small bundle of joy, to bring into the world, Maybe she can say, 'There's my little girl.'                       Well, as much has I HATE dayshift, I'm up now and I feel somewhat optomistic about getting some shit done.  I don't know what, just stuff.  I need to do an oil change, get my timing belt & tensioner changed, fix a damn broken bulb (that I bought 2 days ago!), and I feel like spending some money on computer shit, but I hate waiting for shipping, so I may just go carrouse around town and see what's up.  I'm feeling a little better than meloncholy, not sure why...I guess cuz I got off early today, but then I think, 'hey dammit, we got off early and that's all fine and dandy, but why did swing shift get off COMPLETELY?!  WTF WILLIS?!!'  God I miss swingshift.  Ok, I also need to pickup dry cleaning, I better not forget that shit.  I need to buy some food too.  Not sure what, but I'm getting sick of cooking shit.  I need to buy some premade, no-cooking-req'd food.  Snack food kicks ass.  Damn,  urlLink Jane Leeves  (on my desktop) is fucking hot.  I need this picture blown up and put on my wall.                       So I saw spiderman2 tonight.  kick ass flick.  go see it.  I'd say it's like 85% as good as the first one, but it's always hard to meet or beat the original.  anyway...I'm not going to ruin anything for you fuckers, so just chill.  all I'm going to say is that they talk some about how everyone needs a hero, and that you shouldn't change who you are.  you are who you are.  I really took that to heart, and yes that's lame of me, but it makes sense, and I sorta got some glimmer of hope from it.  I think I'm hanging from a single thread here, and I'm _this_ close to cutting it myself instead of letting it break.  I'm sick of just hanging here, for all to see, and mock, and laugh at.  It's BULLSHIT.  but yet again, I see a sign.  not a fucking sign from god in a religeous aspect, but in a 'haha, you fucker. take this. in your face' aspect.  prick.  Let me explain.  tonight, in my boredom (not so much boredom as pitiful me), I'm browsing the personals on yahoo, as I do every now and then, and I'm like, fuck goldsboro, this place sux.  so I go search Columbus, OH, where I used to live.  I'm moving back there when I get out of this monotonus, ass-kissing excuse we call a job.  I'm sorry, but I kiss no one's ass to move up the ladder.  I will work for my pay, and not by making my knees sore.  I prefer to earn what I reap, not skim the top.  anyway, I'm moving back to cols.  so I'm browsing, and I come across this ad.   urlLink Nicole (I hope she doesn't mind)  She is absolutely gorgeous.  And the intellect to go with.  I tried my damnedest to get in touch w/her.  Icebreaker.  searching the member directory, and finally, actually (attempting to) PAY YAHOO to email her.  Yes, I was actually going to spend $20 to send an email.  That's the level I have reached, and it's not the first time.  only THIS TIME, this is where god, murphy, and who the fuck know who else intervened and as a group got on a microphone and yelled in my face 'F U C K   Y O U,   S E T H'.  Yeah, the shit wouldn't go through, so I couldn't even send a goddamn email.  why does god hate me?  he must.  someone does, and I'm sorry for being stupid, but what did I do to piss him off?  he must be a woman, because I don't understand what I did wrong, so I don't know how to fix it or not do whatever I did.  it's fucking stupid.  this is the part where I stop giving a shit.  I don't need to spend anymore energy watching my hopes become the hindenburg.  I just can't take the ups & downs, the stress, the bullshit anymore.  i give up                       Yes, I think I'm going to kill someone.  I found out today that I'm on dayshift next week.  And probably for a lot of weeks to come.  SON OF A BITCH.  I just do not understand why they want to kill me this way.  I am a night owl, mornings beat the shit out of me.  I swear to god, like every morning I have to wake up at some god-forsaken hour, it must take like a year off my life.  YES, that much.  So I woke up today at like noon (swing shift is THE SHIT, YO!) and I was all good and chillin, right, and then I get to work and I find out I'm on days next week and then for like the next 3 or 4 hrs I was the worst person in the world to talk to.  Not even  urlLink Lewis Black  could make me smile, I was so pissed off.  I could barely concentrate, let alone talk to someone in a civil manner.  But I guess it wore off...at least I'll be out of the shop learning new things.  ...fucking dayshift....makes me wanna puke....  And yes, I have to go in tomm morning, so I shouldn't be up right now typing this shit, but I felt I owed it to all ONE of you readers.  That's all she wrote, folks...                       You know, right after lunch today, I started getting kinda depressed, and I thought about why.  It sorta came to me (and I've thought of this before), but I really have no purpose in life.  WTF am I here for, if not myself?  I need to have someone else that I wake up in the morning for, goto work for, LIVE for.  I feel like all my efforts so far have been wasted, spent.  Yes, there is a reason why I drive a Volvo; because I know it's the safest car on the road and I want my loved ones to be safe.  I try to enjoy the finer things in life because I want my family to have the best there is.  And I want my future wife to see all that I've done for her *before* I've even met her.  I can say, 'look, I did this for you', without actually saying that - she'll just see it and know.  But until that day happens, I could care less what kind of car I drive, how I live, etc.  I don't care about myself, but I have this small sliver of hope still there that tells me the day after I quit doing these things will be the day I meet her, and then all is lost; Murphy wins. Again.  That is my life and it sucks.                       Yes, I'm typing this drunk...you don't know how many times I've hit the backspace key to fix my damn grammatical errors :)  5 beers as of...NOW.   ha HA!  damn, nobody better let me drive now....  Hey, I gotta give a shout out to my buddy Dick in Garret, IN!! Thanks for being bored enough to read this shit, man!  That's fucking awesome; now I know this blog has purpose in life ;)  Ok, so I'm playing yahoo pool at the moment, and can't help but beat the living shit out of my friend...I'm sorry 'willis'!  ;)  (You know who I'm talking about.)  OK, well since I know I actually have readers out there, I guess I better put some shit up here...ok...I'm probably drunk enough I shouldn't drive, but I don't actually feel that bad........my better judgment says 'don't'....but I say...'don't'... :)   ok, fuck it. pretzels it is (dammit, the junior bacon cheese burgers can wait til tomm).  Now I have to decide whether (sp?) or not to drink my last beer, as I KNOW It won't get me drunk by itself, or fuck it and goto bed...you be the judge (j/k :)  ............(time ticking away)........fuck it... might as well not 'waste' it _not_ getting drunk, right :)  ok, fuckers, I guess I'm out.
