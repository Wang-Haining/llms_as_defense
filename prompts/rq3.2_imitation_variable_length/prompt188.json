Im 16 and seeing my frens up there takin their O's later tis yr.. it realli saddens me that i cant be there to graduate together.but i feel quite proud that i noe these ppl and i feel so happy for them..well..back to myself.  Im in a family of 6..im the third child out of 4.I have an older bro,he's 22 i tink and is currently serving his NS and my older sis hus 20 is in NUS..yeah,she's damn bloody clever bt sometimes i tink she's stupid,when it cums to choosing boyfriends.Im not gonna go into that.All i can say is that I dun LiKE her boyfriend!okay..moving on..My younger sis is onli 12..and taking her PSLE later tis yr..She better not slack and go into my bloody school..I'll screw her if that happens.My mom is one of the ppl i love in the world.Of cos,she gave birth to me.And i appreciate her for everything she has done 4 me.She has done alot for me.Im not good in showing my love,but if she ever comes across this blog of mine,i hope she noes how much i really love her despite giving her hard times and rocky turbulences in our family the last 2 yrs.That brings me to my father.He loves me in his own way,that i know and i love him too.I love him so much now bt yeah..I cant seem to express my love to my family tt easy.Bottomline: Im a i-love-my-family girl.  Yet,im so stubborn.And naive.And emotional.And bloody noisy.And egoistic.U'll tend to noe more abt me in times to come..                 ~Put my soul on hold,let it drop like my heart,cos thats the way you want it to be~   &nbsp;   Well.. i've done my work. All finished. Got pretty time on my hands to spare. And i don't know what to do. Ahhz.. Well,i might as just stop here for awhile. Currently,listening to Nickleback's How&nbsp;You Remind Me. The band rocks and so&nbsp;does the song. Owh,I love Nickleback. I mean,the music. I dont worship the band. Lol.&nbsp;My fav part of the song:&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;   It's not like you didn't know that    I said I love you and I swear I still do    And it must have been so bad    Cause living with me must have damn near killed you    And this is how you remind me of what I really am    This is how you remind me of what I really am   &nbsp;   Im so not looking forward to tomorrow. Its gonna be a draggy Monday.. Have to the final design for my art project. Sucky. The only thing Im looking forward for tomorrow is the end of the school lessons.. So i can go home and sleep straight away. Oh yeah.. Have i mentioned I missed yayi badly? =) I miss you Yayi.. Love u so much. Wish that i can dream of u every night. Or every minute when im sleeping. In that case, I dont mind&nbsp;sleeping always. Ooops.. These days, Im getting more n more lethargic. Cant seem to handle my eyes like I used to last time. Sleepy~    Orites.. Let my lethargic-ness (is there ever such a word aniwae?) take over me and I shall let dreamland conquer my world in like 8 mins time when I'll close my eyes and see perfectness of this beautiful world,sleeping.Gnitez.   &nbsp;   ~Put my soul on hold,let it drop like my heart,cos thats the way you want it to be~                 ~Put my soul on hold,let it drop like my heart,cos thats the way you want it to be~   &nbsp;   Okays..

Damn, if i slim down, i mite be able to wear that next yr but trust me, i dun think i'll be wearing any cheongsams from now on. No originality. Played alot in front of zakiah's camera. Thanx to Moon. My funny faces ended up saved in Zak's camera. Lols. I didnt take any fotos with alot of guys tis time. Only with Weihan, Ismail and Amirhadi ( is that how u spell the name?) haha.. cos&nbsp;Ismail looks so much like my ex, Irwan frm S'pore Poly. Weihan.. Haix.. No need to explain la. If not for his bloody pea-brain antics, i wld have thot he's one of the gorgeous guys arnd. But,i take back&nbsp;my words. Hahaha.. Took a pic with amirhadi la. Yeah..&nbsp;He's one of the only 2 guys i find handsome in school. Bt i shall stop there and say no more. Haha. = My lips are sealed and tight. The other handsome guy.. Nowhere to be seen. But heckz~     &nbsp;   After school, we went to Tampines BK to eat! Hungry like hell.. Whopper meal each. Then we went to finish up my film and took pics at the Standard Chartered Building. Da abes lik dat.. Went home la.. At arnd 5 plus i think. Tired. I wore heels but strangely, my feet didnt hurt a single bit. Lols. Reached home, took a bath and went to bed straight.
