Anyway, a brief synopsis and observations:   1) The sea  - Jesus, the sea is COLD. Even in a wetsuit!  2 ) Balance  - Balance is a wonderful possession, it's just that neither I nor my dad possess it. First of all, I, following the lead of others making fools of themselves, took a running jump from the harbour to land on the board. I landed on it, but not only did it tip over (like it did for everyone else) but it flipped up and hit me on the head :S Great. Then, on the donut with my dad behind the speedboat (great fun at 25 mph), my dad gets his toes stuck in the water and flies of the donut. Now, what happens to me sitting on one side of the donut if I suddenly lose 85kg from the other side? Splash. Great.   3) Sherbet straws  - I don't get how 340 sherbet straws can bring so much happiness to the lives of 3 12-year-olds.   4) Water pistols  - Long story short, girl with water pistol - with 5 nozzles, person annoying her. She shoots. She hits him with the right 3. Guess who's standing beside him...and where the other two went. :S   5) Random people  - The cousin of the person who owns the caravan 2 across for the one I was staying in was up to visit. Apparently she's in my year at Methody, yet we didn't recognise each other. Strange.   6) School of Rock  - We watched this last night. Is quite funny, especially James as the role of Laurence the keyboard player - 'now is not a time for reading Laurence, now is the time for rocking' - hehehe. Bloody annoying Chinese subtitles on it though - why do they have random English characters in it though?  That was my weekend in a nutshell.  Simon - Don't laugh at me, don't look away (Keane)             Meh...:P  Don't worry Jamie, I won't take a rager as such.. just remove you from the writer list :P  I admit the 'Meh' and 'Bleh's may get a bit boring...but hey... I might be dictionarily challenged... but I don't tell girls they're weird on a first date :P or talk about the weather *muffled laughter*  anyhoo... I've changed the descrip about the blog... to something more appropriate... considering what it started as, (me ranting...and rambling) to what it is now, (the three of us having a go at each other), so why not...  Sit back folks, and enjoy the show...   By the way, I was never the happiest man in the world, ask anyone I know...  the normal reply is that I'm constantly in a depressed mood... which isn't all that far off...  Everything going okay in the land of nod... or more commonly known as Canada... althoguh I did learn something about them today...  Today was Canada day...think... 4th of July for (obviously) Canada... and we went to a park where they were celebrating... it was all quite normal until the speeches came... they had this Health Minister Guy... Here was the general gist of the speech:   Canada is a great country... blahblahblah... I'm honoured to be with you all to celebrate the 137th birthday of our country...blahblahblah...Canada is greatest country in the world...What is the greatest country in the world? yes... Canada... etc etc    Canada is the greatest country in the world???  Gimme a break... and I thought Americans were self centred... :/  That's it from me for now...   Miss Emma... :(  Bleh...            Meh...  Now I seriously Pissed off...  I've had to post this one again cuz of my stupidity... Or rather, my lack of understanding of Blogger... Its a long story, adn i still want to get some CS in before I get kicked off the comp...  Anyway... Long time since I last posted, well, *check blog*  4 days... seems like an eternity... anywho...  here goes  Friday: Not much of note, my plan of ripping of second years in trades suffered a major setback as i realised Yao had already taken everything that was worth anything off them. for that matter, this isn't a major setback, more like a fatal one... :/  Saturday: Saturday we had the Chess thingy... we came second and Sullivan won... surprise surprise...  Only real thing that is worth mentioning is that Simon lost in like 10 moves to a crappy guy from St Malachy's  Sunday: *rubs hands in glee* Oh ho ho, don't get me started on Sunday, *realises* oh wait I already have got myself started on Sunday... in fact I think I'll devote a *drum roll* WHOLE post on Sunday, *listens to sound of one hand clapping*  Bleh...             Bleh...     &nbsp;   Went to do a bit of shopping today, (or possibly more accurately, got dragged to the mall, per Mother's orders for Aunt to get me clothes...)     &nbsp;   During my wanderings I came across a pet shop...     &nbsp;   Before I continue I must stress that I wouldn't count myself as a Radical Animal Rights Activist,     &nbsp;   For that matter I wouldn't call myself a pet lover...Or even Pet Owner &nbsp; ( ever)    &nbsp;   but still, it was quite disturbing seeing the dogs in 1m by 1m by 1m perspex boxes...     &nbsp;   There were 2 or 3 dogs in each box, and it was a row of boxes, with another row directly on top...     &nbsp;   Wire lined the bottom of each box, presumably air holes have been drilled somewhere...     &nbsp;   and it was  filthy      &nbsp;   Some of the puppys were rolling in their own excrement, others were busy licking the behinds of their compatriots...     &nbsp;   A young girl pointed her finger at one puppy, who immediately started to lick the spot where her finger was pressed against the glass...     &nbsp;   This continued, even long after the girl had left...     &nbsp;   Two guys walked past,     &nbsp;    Ha! look at that fucked up dog!     &nbsp;   Strange how animal rights activists never got on the case of pet shops...     &nbsp;   :/     &nbsp;   Until next time:     &nbsp;   God doesn't protect fools or young children...     &nbsp;   No, He leaves that for Persons with a charitable mentality and Parents...     &nbsp;   Thank NEEITS (that's Non Existing Entity In The Sky, 'Thank You' to Claire for that term ^^;;) I'm neither...     &nbsp;   Meh...                   Bleh...&nbsp;   A visit to Niagara Falls today, and about 150m into American Territory before deciding it was to much effort and giving up...  &nbsp;  Pictures will be up...  &nbsp;   eventually   &nbsp;  Since I won't be home till the 21st of August...  &nbsp;  Only... 26 days left...  &nbsp;  :/  &nbsp;  On to other news...  &nbsp;  My assessment of Uncle's driving has been changed,  &nbsp;  He's  suicidal ...  &nbsp;  He went and tried to take on a 16 wheeler lorry...  &nbsp;  No, seriously...  &nbsp;  Its a 3 lane motorway, we're in the&nbsp;lane at the very left, the lorry was  at the one on the right...  &nbsp;  And we both wanted to change to the centre...  &nbsp;  At one point I could see the ring on the lorry driver's extended middle finger...  &nbsp;  :/  &nbsp;  And yes, all of this at about 80 miles an hour...  &nbsp;  The other thing I learned today was   never   trust a female with navigation...  &nbsp;  Yes, I'm well aware of how stereotypical/sexist/chauvinistic that comment seems and I apologise, but hear me out first...  &nbsp;  To get back to Toronto&nbsp;from Niagara Falls we had to get back on the&nbsp;motorway, we had no idea how and decided to look at the map, that yielded&nbsp;no clues either, so we drove along until we saw a sign that pointed us in the right direction, so we followed it along, and sure enough there was a junction to turn right ahead&nbsp;to lead us up onto the motorway.  &nbsp;  While the driving was going on&nbsp;Aunt was looking quizzically at the map, and as the turn came she suddenly told us we were going to the wrong way, and she'd explain, but we definitely shouldn't turn right... So we listened to her (as she was rather hysterical at this stage and was complaining about how we didn't listen) and turned left, doing a rather large circuit of the neighbourhood.  &nbsp;  We were completely confused by her explanation and decided to ask a police officer...&nbsp;   'Get back to Toronto? Sure, just follow that road until you get to the junction, then&nbsp;turn right, it'll lead you straight&nbsp;onto the&nbsp;Expressway'   If anyone wants to prove me wrong on this point, feel free...  &nbsp;  Meh...                  Before...   kinda bored right now >:/ Gonna cycle around the place for a while. See if i can get the m00k3s to run after me :) then they probably thow rocks at me >:| Nah, better not. I'll just cycle to the park... nah, prob full of mo- how about the corner shop - nah, prob full of- erm, the lake? prob full o- eerm, erm, the local roundabout? prob ful- AGH why the hell are the annoying bas***ds running the area?!  Anyway, did some more on the flash. Go to my other blog to see a small gif anim :)  Too bad, I'll leave this half typed and go outside anyway.   After...   Back - just went to the park, only a wee m00k3 there, better than I thought. Sorta cycled in loops, got bored and tried some wheelies and some other crap and *nearly* fell off. [note to self - do not try a BMX biker for a career] Then i hit the curb at high speed and fell off. I was like ' holy ****! ', but lucky landed okay on the grass, as I twisted around with my n1nja speed and skillz (correction: uber lucky to land not too badly, although on my knees which dont look too healthy, being wrecked and bloody). Grr, must not wear shorts when cycling next time :/ My left hand is sore cos it smacked off a tree quite fast. Whos the stupid retard who planted it there anyways? Overall, a good trip nonetheless, the pain flows, but it does some good >:)    Tribute to thy retardedbastardwhoplantedthytreeness,  Jamie             Got a job at the Asian Supermarket. Have to work 9 hours a day at Â£3 an hour. Its the basics, such as packaging, bagging, etc etc. 9 hours seems to take 12 hours. Time slows down in the building just to piss me off. I was so bored and tired that I made a comp to see who had thew biggest orders (i baggage the food into guess what plastic bags). Its kinda joint at the top :)   At number 3...  A fat guy walks into the shop. Real fat. He was six times the width of me, and a lot more times heavier. I swear, i felt the ground shake when he walked past. His order?  Â£450 of packaged burgers, hot dogs, meat, and coke and fanta . It was delivered from the warehouse in boxes, so i luckily didnt have to package it. Funny thing was, the guy couldnt get in/out threw the normal door, so he had to go in/out through the warehouse doors X-D   At number 2...  A woman takes 2 trolley worths of food plus a mass order from the warehouse. I was like holy fuck! I was busily for 5 minutes packaging her stuff and then her husband comes through with another trolley worth. :'( Total order?  Â£790  It must have been their shopping for the year or something.   At number 1...  A man comes on Wednesday with a Â£450+ order of food. Not that big. He then comes on Saturday with another Â£450+ order. Â£ 900+ worth of food in four days ? I'll use a James qoute: ' Go figure :/ '  At least i'm getting paid for this. At the end of 8 weeks I will have around Â£400 for working 2 days a week. Enough for a Nice Gryffin or Dita hockey stick and a iPod maybe?  Its all fun I tell yer >    Tribute to thy baggagingness,  Dragontail       \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
