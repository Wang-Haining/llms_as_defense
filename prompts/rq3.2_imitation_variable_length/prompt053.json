In other news I dug up a O/S map remember a dream I had many years ago. I look out of my bed room window and realize that the true love on my life lies out in that very direction. So I go off to find her - I can't see it from my window but I soon discover that to reach her I must cross some very steep hills but eventually I find her in a small one roomed hovel and we live happily ever after. Now this dream occurred 5 years ago I estimate but it holds significance for two reasons;  -5 degrees in the direction of my window lies the house of an ex-girlfriend [who happens to live in a bungalow [the closest to a hovel really in terms of size]... I once cycled to her and discovered the route to involve going up [and down] many hills  +10 degrees in the direction my window lives a close friend who lives very far away and subsequently between us lie many hills  While the second is a very vague coincidence I can't help to shake off a feeling on the first one may have a little fate in it... just a shame her title is  ex -girlfriend.            Quite out of the blue ( mem. find the origin of that phrase) I have decided on several things; 1. To stop doing the Live Journal-esque things at the bottom 2. To try and put some things on the side bar 3. To use '()' instead of '[]' so much when doing brackets Of little consequence really, but this will be the last post of being in the style of Live Journal. Don't cry too much children.  Anyway; to the present, it's Sunday afternoon and I have nothing to do. Revision is always there, but that can be tiresome, I don't have a job, and haven't since I completed my work for  urlLink Hunter Seeds' website  and I haven't been able to buy myself a bass guitar yet.  A glance over today's 'world news stories' showed every one of them to be war-related. Seems that's all which is important today is war. Global Warming is of little consequence - in fact, it’s rather good if you’re Russia [warmer climate is better for their agriculture] and you don't really care if you’re America [because you ARE America and if it wasn't for them there would be a global depression]. Which I think is very thoughtful of the latter: economic depression soon or apocalypse later.

I mean there was nothing unusual, nothing to cause any emotion in me. Subsequently I am feeling quite tired for having had such an uninspiring day. Tomorrow I have my German oral exam, after calling my examiner a dragon last week (and yes, she did hear me) I am not entirely looking forward to it. On hindsight I think she not really like a dragon - more like  urlLink The Watcher  from Lord of the Rings [I'm not a big Tolkien fan, just someone bought me the game at Christmas which I felt obliged to play].  In other news a small ray of sunshine hit my inbox this morning with news that Ross Noble has returned from Australia to unveil his new show 'Noodlemeister'. Which is a good thing but it now makes my t-shirt for the 'Unrealtime' tour look somewhat dated. If anyone does want that t-shirt they can buy it off the site at the bottom as well as find listings for the new tour.  Music: REM - Low Mood: Alone Site:  urlLink http://www.rossnoble.co.uk/             I think I have this sorted out; Careers advisers only interview people as they feel they have failed to get a ‘real’ career and must validate themselves by interviewing others. Yes, today I was chosen quite randomly to be interviewed. It seems to be a matter of stating the obvious ['so your good at maths and your taking economics... have you ever thought of being an accountant?']. Eventually I decided that I would make out that engineering would be the career for me so she wouldn't have to continue guessing jobs for me - the plan seemed to work as the interview was concluded fairly quickly after that.  4 Days until the end now; I had two random second or third years [they all look so alike] randomly scream in my face today. Perhaps it’s a hormone thing, I don't know but I remember not doing it to year 11s when I was a little second year. They should have more respect for their elders!
