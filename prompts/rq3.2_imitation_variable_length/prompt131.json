It was one of the earlier words that I learned (thank you Amy), it being, in my vocabulary at least, an important one. The funny thing is, for those who know me even reasonably well, is that people keep saying that I am a pretty girl, which invariably makes me laugh due to my 'habit' of telling everyone just how pretty I am!!! (And of course, you know that I'm kidding when I say it, but I suspect that if I start running around Japan telling everyone 'watashi wa kawaii' I might get even more funny looks than I do at home!) And truly, I think I keep getting the comments about being pretty simply because the last ALT they had was a tall, skinny, dark guy from Los Angeles.  Anyhoo, that just occurred to me because when I went to buy my car just now (oh yes!! car car car!!) the women at the garage were talking about me being pretty. It is just so funny to me!  So car... It is a Honda Minica, and as the name implies, it is tiny and cute and wonderful. It is sparkly silver-ish, and they are going to put a cd player in it for me. I don't get it until the end of the month because that is when I get paid and they want me to pay all at once, but it's all good because the next few weeks are going to fly by anyway, I suspect. I never in a million years thought that the first car I would ever own would be in Japan!! And although it is a bit more expensive than I was hoping, it is still a great price, plus it's automatic so I don't have the added problem of learning standard while I try to navigate on the opposite side of the road, opposite side of the car (notice I said 'opposite' rather than 'wrong' - I have been making an effort not to be so Canada-centric, difficult as that is sometimes).  Okay, that's all.                           So said the tshirt of one of the kids I was doing taiko drumming with this morning at the elementary school. Today is my first full day in Ikegawa Town, though how they call it a town is far beyond me. I was woken at sunrise (literally) by a crowing rooster, followed at 6am by the town chime. Oh yes, welcome to rural Japan! The view from my home is stunning: mountains on all sides, but not hard, grey mountains; these are&nbsp;lush and green, mostly evergreens, but the forest area behind the elementary school is enormous bamboo trees as far as the eye can see. My apartment is a good size, not sure yet how many tatami mats, but I will let you know when I count them. The staff is all very friendly and between them speak about 10 words of English, so once Dara (the current ALT) leaves on Wednesday, I will be left to fend for myself. I am certain we will figure it out. We had a few days in Tokyo for orientation, and it was quite helpful in many ways. Lots of seminars... I roomed with a really nice girl from Montreal, Emilie, who reminded me soooo much of Marie from my Katimavik group. Tokyo is ENORMOUS like nothing I have ever seen before. I didn:t go out and about very much because I was suffering fairly extensively from the JET lag, but will make a point of checking things out at a later time when I am hopefully more human feeling. I cannot access my yahoo right now, which is more than a little bit frustrating; it seems to be something&nbsp;about the server, so I will not be reading any email until it gets sorted out. For now, this will have to do. Some highlights of my time in Japan so far: the toilets in the Keio Plaza hotel, which offered cold or warm bidet with thin or thick spray, as well as some heated seats (!!)... The cab ride to the Canadian Embassy on our last night, when I got to see a good portion of the area for the first time (followed by Moosehead!)... Our plane ride from Tokyo to Kochi, when we flew right beside Mt Fuji!!!... Going into my first Japanese mall, and eating Italian food because they didn`t know what to feed&nbsp;me, as a vegetarian... The drive to Ikegaw, through the mountains... Swimming (and cliff jumping)&nbsp;&nbsp;in the crystal clear river last night with Dara to cool down from the horrifically oppressive humidity... And then this morning, honestly, meeting some of the kids and sitting on the floor drumming with them was one of my favourite moments ever, quite possibly. I cannot believe I am actually here.                         today was the first day I slept through the f***ing rooster and the town chime. Hurray! I was overjoyed, mostly because 5:30am is simply too early for me to start my day. The chime actually goes off 6am, 12pm, 5pm, and 9pm, each time playing a different melody, the final one being the ever popular 'Taps' - it reminds me of Sonja and highschool Remembrance Day ceremonies, except it's not a solo trumpet.  Dara left this afternoon, after spending three full years in Ikegawa. It was quite the send-off: everyone from this office (board of ed) and the town office went down to the van to see him off and waved as he was driven away. Tonight I will go home, to my  real  new home and unpack and do some cleaning. And maybe watch some tv. I would like to do laundry, but as it is STILL raining, that may not be the best idea. At least if I would like my clothes to be dry when I put them on for work tomorrow.  Now comes the real challenge of communication with my co-workers,  sans  Dara to translate. It should be an interesting endeavour, to say the least.                          Or at least a dancing gaijin (foreigner)!! Remember how I said last week something about going to dance with a bunch of young men with Miki-sensei?? Well I went last night. It was a practice. To dance at the festival on the weekend. I did not really understand what I was getting roped into when she asked me, and I am still not sure I am comfortable with doing it, but it seems I have little choice. It is a very small group of people around my age, and we are doing what is called Yosakoi dancing, which is very pretty and involves clacking wooden things. They all look so graceful and natural doing it. I am such a clod!! I will suck it up, though, and go off to practice every night this week (and sweat like I have never sweat before - it is on the second floor of the elementary school gym and it is hotter than hot in there!!), and pray to every god and goddess there is that I don't look like a complete fool when we dance our way through the streets of Ikegawa. And, just because I am not ashamed of the fact that I am a dork, using the video function on my sassie new camera, I will record my dancing for posterity and share it with you once I figure out how to move things from camera to internet. (Any hints would be appreciated - somehow the Japanese manual is less helpful than I would like!! Ha ha!)  Today my supervisor, the Deputy Superintendent of the Board of Ed and another one of the men in my office came to my house, rolled up their sleeves and rid the outside of my apartment of the junk my predecessor had left behind. They take such responsibility, it is really nice in some ways, but for someone like me who is quite used to just doing things on my own, it is a bit hard to accustom to. I know they mean well, but I feel bad sitting there watching while the 'men' do the dirty work. And I was warned about this before, but one of the women in the office brings everyone tea a couple times a day. Again, it's nice, but not something I am used to. I guess I really am in Japan, aren't I?! (And not just sitting in my parents' backyard in Lindsay like Tasha likes to think!!)         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
