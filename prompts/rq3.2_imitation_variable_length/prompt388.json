Lately her daddy would play with her and do the war cry on her, she loves it. Every time we would pat our hand over her mouth she would make noises. And she loves attention, I think all babies do but whenever someone would notice her, her face would shine and her eyes gets bigger and a big smile opens up. I am grateful for a happy baby. This morning after I took my shower, I was cleaning out my ears with the q tips as I always do, Mercy was crying. I checked on her and she was laughing at the q tip as I was playing with it. She is very easy to please. And so sweet. I look forward into the days of being separated from her daddy and moving on our lives without him. I just hope that I will have the courage to be away from him and to fight him off when he begs for forgiveness. I am willing to give him another chance but not living with me, he won’t have that kind of chance. Paying me child support and visiting with the kids, fine. And setting up dates like normal couple should do.  But so far I am chatting with another man whom seems to be really nice and sweet. He has a lot of good sense of humor, not to mention dirty mind!                                   Mercy Love Herrington-Kelly was born on July 18, 2003 at 12:50pm. The contractions started on Tuesday and I went to the hospital on Wednesday, thinking this is it.  But they let me go home saying it not time. Thursday morning I had the appointment with my doctor… and I was crying because of the contractions. She said I was in the early stage labor, but because Mercy wasn’t born yet, she sent me over to St. John for an ultra sound to measure the baby to make sure she can fit through my pelvis and birth canal.  My friend was with me, who also was my coach through the labor. She took me to St. John and waited for me while I was having the ultra sound. We found out we are having a girl that time.  But I didn’t have time to call anyone or to even email anyone the good news, because I went to stay with my friend for a while and then at almost 5pm, I wanted to go back to the hospital.  For a few hours, I stayed in the triage, having signs of labor… but it was too early… and they let me go again. My friend was going to drop me off at my house but then we decided it would be a good idea I stay over at her house because it seems that I am in labor.  Ian, the baby’s father and I went to bed at about 10:30pm. But I was tossing and turning, like the last three days before that with bad cramping (contractions). I couldn’t eat anything either.  I was exhausted and frustrated with the pain. At 2am, I gave up. I cried and cried, saying this has to be it. I told my friend to take me back to the hospital. I was doing the breathing, deep in and slowly let it out.  When I arrived at the hospital, they put me in the labor and delivery room. My contractions got stronger and closer together. When I reached to 4cm, the doctor came in with the epidural.  I didn’t want to have one because I really want to try natural. But I am so glad I had it anyway, because if it wasn’t for epidural, I would have just given up and may have ended up in the c-section.  Even with the epidural, it was really hard. I can feel the baby’s head in my pelvis. I wanted to push her out so bad but they told me it wasn’t time yet. Every once in a while I freaked out and panicked.  12:40pm, it was time to push her; I was somewhat about 9 and a half cm. With only three push and ten minutes, she popped out. But when her head was out, as I was later informed, I wasn’t supposed to push her out yet.  But I wanted her out fast. And I found out, hours later, that the doctor wouldn’t tell me at the moment that they had to get Mercy out anyway. Her head was purple, because the cord was wrapped around her neck twice.  We were lucky the cord was long, and that it only happened at that time. Before she was born, I was told her body was facing up. She was supposed to be facing down. So I was suggested before she came out to turn positions to help her turn the right place.  That could be when the cord wrapped around her neck.  But she made it. You can see her picture on the website at WWW.CoxHealth.com, and just enter July 18, 2003 and look for Mercy H.  She got daddy’s hair ( alot of it. the doctors told me she is the first that need a haircut), his eyes, his chin and his ears. She got my nose, my mouth and my chubby cheeks. The doctor told me that there is a chance of her having a down syndrome. But as soon as she told me that, I didn’t care. What does it matter if she has one or not, she is my baby and I made her for ten months. (she was born two days overdue.) And what really is matter is that she made it out alive and healthy.  I tried to breastfeed her for two days, but it was not a very easy task. Yesterday I came home at about noon. And every time she cried, I tried to feed her. But I was frustrated with her rejecting me, pushing me away and crying, squealing every time I tried to feed her.  I began to cry and finally at 9pm, I had given up. She had same dry diaper since she came home with us. I was concern and got to thinking that, I would just have to feed her formula. I don’t want her to starve and not have any dirty diaper.  It was hard, because I felt hurt and discouraged. But I did my best and I told myself that when I gave her the bottle, she was happier and knocked out.  So I just thought you all want to know. Hope you can find the picture and enjoy seeing her as much as I do. I thank God for having her. Every babies are precious.                                   Lord, I seek for your face But everywhere I go, I sin And you hide your face in shames Lord, I only want to make myself feel good And in all the things I do Are wrongful in your eyes  I know you are forgiving God A loving and patient But Lord, I got no love or patient I am hurting in all over the places  You have given me what I needed And what I have always wanted But Lord, I still feel sad Because I know I am not saved  You provide what I need just in the nick of time Almost when I was about to give up You always answer my calls Either when I do cry or not Oh, Lord, I want to be with you  But in everything I do Are wrongful in your eyes You protected me otherwise And stood by my side Heart aching, you walked with me Shameful, you stayed with me  Why do you love, God when so much are hurting you? I have two children now I want them to know what is right But in doing so, I have to set the example Already, they are learning Crawling, standing and feeding themselves  Help me to find my way back to you Lord, I want to be saved again Forgive me And give me what I have needed so long I want them back Your love and protection! - Kaytee ‘04                \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
