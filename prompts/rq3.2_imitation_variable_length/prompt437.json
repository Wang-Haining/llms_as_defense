  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic:\n\n       Tattooing in of itself is a tolerable form of self expression. But of course there are many ways to screw it up. Some common examples of this are putting some dumb whore's name on your ass for the rest of your existence, having more symbols on the body than pores, and marking yourself with a college university's logo that you have never even attended. Then there is one that surpasses them all, tattooing yourself with the cross.  These same people that do that infathomably idiotic thing are also proud supporters of their local church. This means that they are some form of catholic or christian. In these two forms of religion, the only source of knowledge is The Bible. Now let me pose this simple question, what does The Holy Bible say about tattooing oneself? From  urlLink Bible.com :  'Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print or tattoo any marks upon you: I am the Lord.' So basically they affirm their religious beliefs by sinning against that same religion. That is like saying you love someone and the way you show it is slap in them in the face twenty times (unless of course they are into bondage).  After you consume that conundrum, I must ask you this simple question. What is the last thing Jesus wants to see when he comes back (if he returns)? You guessed it, a cross.  So by what they believe to by an avouchment towards their beliefs, they in reality sin against their religion in general and also piss off their Lord on a personal level.   I can see it now up in heavens:   Angels : Um, Jesus weren't you supposed to return to Earth like four years ago.  Jesus : Well as long as my supposed believers keep showing off those damned crosses, I am never going to return. I hope they all burn in hell.             Once again, I am bringing out the classics. So once again, he is one more former post.  Well not much happened today except for this one little thing that I would like to quibble about.  Today the person that inspired me to create this blog said that she would like to read a book about my life. Well I was very appreciative and was about to thank her when this imbecile next to me chimed in to say something to the effect of “I would not like to read that, he does not do anything.” (well it was more derogatory but you get the idea)  Well this had incensed me because it follows this basic idea, 'I go out more and try to socialize with my fellow idiots, so my life is better than yours.' Well thank you moron. I cannot believe that anyone would believe this once you know more about who said this. You see the person that said that comment is a wannabe. He is so much of a wannabe that he goes out and drinks (alcohol) about every night and then comes to school the next day and tries to make it seem like he had a blast.  Now I have been under the influence of alcohol before and lets just say that I am never going to do that again. (Now for all you alcoholics who say that it gets better well bullshit because I know many former drunks that always ponder why they continued to drink.) First of all the only sensation you get from this is becoming an utter simpleton. Now there is many better solutions that I will suggest for people that like to drink. You could get a gun out and shoot yourself in the head because you are a complete idiot or you could bungee jump off a bridge and forgot to bring a rope. Now those would be fun times wouldn't they?  With all those joyous things that come out of being drunk you also get all those damn deficiencies that come to your body. Now I will not list off all of these because I bet you remember some of these from those stupid DARE classes, but here is what you lose when you get liver cancer.   What the liver does  Stores and Mobilizes Energy Controls Blood Sugar (Glucose) Regulates Glycogen Regulates Fat Storage Aids Digestion Produces Bile Regulates Blood Clotting Produces Several (Non-Reproductive) Hormones Manufactures Cholesterol (a certain amount of cholesterol is beneficial) Filters Blood Eliminates Bacteria Breaks down Drugs Produces Vitamins Stores Minerals Produces Essential Immune System Factors Monitors, as Well as Manufactures, Countless other Blood Proteins, to Maintain the Proper Levels of Numerous Chemicals in the Body  Then once you are done with all those little things like debilitating cancers you have to face the wrath of having to lay down some money for this precious liquid. Now how do you get this money, well you have to work. And with this retard the only job that he can do is hard labor. So a basic synopsis of his life goes like this:  1. Work 10-12 hours a day lifting 100 lb bags 2. Waste his money on the great alcohol 3. Become a complete moron 4. Pass out 5. Wake up 3 hours later 6. Continue cycle until age 35 when death is upon him.  Oh hurray with all those benefits (being a moron) isn't it time you thought about drinking your life away and complaining about my peaceful life you completely useless fool.             urlLink Scientists say eating far less food will extend your lifespan . They even go as far to say,   'In the fractious field of aging research, the benefit of reducing calories is one of the few areas of agreement. This means much more than just skipping dessert. It's taking relatively severe steps, such as slashing calories by as much as two-thirds or eating only every other day, which increases life span, studies suggest.'   As a person that once only ate one meal per day with no snacking at all, I find it would be very difficult to not succumb to eating at least one thing per day. Of course, that is not to say that I do not believe it will work. So as I sit here doing nothing productive, I feel I might as well try out the extreme experiment. So from this point on I will not eat anything else the entire day and continue that every other day.  Another related note is that there is  urlLink another study suggests many cosmetic items actually might cause cancer . (Sorry, for the registration thing. Just use ihateregistration@dumpit.com as e-mail and thissucks as password)  Unlike the first story, I don't believe that these items are the cause of cancer. It is more of the person using them than the products themselves. In my personal belief, the people using these are very stressed about their love lives and thus resort to using cosmetics to attract that story book lover. When they cannot find this person, they result to becoming increasingly more stressed about their lives. With more and more stress, the body develops some agents that fight and fight against itself which results in cancer. Of course I am no doctor nor am I even intelligent, so what do I know?            The now defunct archives of this blog used to carry something that I feel very strongly about. That is the whole same sex marriage argument ( urlLink Missouri, being the first in line, has banned this type of marriage ). Now most believe that the argument is for or against the banning of gay marriages across this nation. I believe that to be complete blasphemy. The third option on this should be for the government to deregulate marriage.  One of the fundamentalist qualities of this democracy is the separation of state and religion (now that is not what the republic was for, but that a whole other topic). Now can anyone please explain to me why the government regulates the holy sanctuary of marriage?  The only reason why a person should get married in this country is because of the tax benefits that belong with it.If this were the case, the majority of the people in this country would find marriage a waste of time. Now you could say that people want to adhere to their religion, but lets face it people, the majority do not follow their religion too wholeheartedly. Just take for example the percentage of people that have pre-marriage sex. That is not condoned by any major religion, but yet the overwhelming majority does it.  So again, I must ask why is marriage still regulated by the government? Please if anyone has an answer to this, post it in the comments section. I will be intrigued by the answers to this.    \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
