Without sender authentication, verification, and traceability, email providers can never know for certain if a message is legitimate or forged and will therefore have to continually make educated guesses on behalf of their users on what to deliver, what to block, and what to quarantine, in the pursuit of the best possible user experience.   DomainKeys is a technology proposal that can bring black and white back to this decision process by giving email providers a mechanism for verifying both the domain of each email sender and the integrity of the messages sent (i.e,. that they were not altered during transit). And, once the domain can be verified, it can be compared to the domain used by the sender in the From: field of the message to detect forgeries. If it's a forgery, then it's spam or fraud, and it can be dropped without impact to the user. If it's not a forgery, then the domain is known, and a persistent reputation profile can be established for that sending domain that can be tied into anti-spam policy systems, shared between service providers, and even exposed to the user.                         Missing Names - India Votes 2004      This election, I have seen more name missing from the voters list then any other elections before. Who is responsible, definitely the Election Commission. They are unprepared for this election. They are expecting it to be around august and got screwed up when the ruling government dissolved the parliament early - to capitalize on their recent election victories across four states. But what are the EC doing all these day. Why do they want to compile the voter list at the last moment. India is called the information technology super-power, all western and developed countries look toward India for their software services. But, Indian government departments and ministries aren't able to use the these services effectively. Every now and then they talk about e-governance in India. What kind of governance are the going to achieve if various ministries and departments aren't going to communicate among themselves and make sure the fundamental privilege of democracy - voting - is provided to all eligible voters.                       The da Vinci Project is using CFX and ANSYS ICEM CFD in their design process.   The da Vinci Project recently implemented CFX, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software, to aid in the development of processes involving fluid flow, heat transfer and chemical reaction. Also added from the ANSYS software suite was ANSYS ICEM CFD, a post-processing tool to help streamline product development. ANSYS first partnered with the Canadian team in 2002, offering a broad-range of structural simulation software tools that have helped the da Vinci Project in the development of the first privately funded, reusable spacecraft. These applications are essential tools used to substantially minimize costs and improve time-to-market for designers and engineers, and are still used by the da Vinci Project today, complementing the two new ANSYS additions.  'The da Vinci team has relied on ANSYS software for over a year now, so we were thrilled to implement the CFX and ANSYS ICEM CFD products,' said Brian Feeney, team leader and pilot at the da Vinci Project. 'With these additions, our team is working with some of the most comprehensive and advanced simulation tools available, enabling us to build our spacecraft from design to final-stage testing and performance validation. CFX is currently helping us evaluate external aerodynamics of the vehicle at subsonic and super-sonic speeds and the internal heat transfer in the fuel tanks and storage systems. Our engineers can do this all right from their desktops -- this provides us with a major edge on the competition.'    urlLink  News from da Vinci Project                 Recently, while reading a news group in Tamil.net, I came across an interesting theory.  The language of Sumerians was from an archaic Tamil. Many people have argued in similar lines as both the languages ( Tamil and Sumerian ) shared words and many similarities - yet to established with any certainties. Interestingly - at least to me - the theory put forth by Prof. BV Ventatakrishna Sastry of Hindu university of America, goes on to state that Rigkrit ( Sanskrit used in RigVeda I think ) branched off from the Archaic Tamil and Current Tamil is continuation of it. My efforts to accress the authors web page ended in vein - hope I get lucky in future. There seem to be at least another person  - Dr. K. Loganathan (probably from Malaysia) - working on the same theory. You can read part on research from the following link (you may need to have TSC compatible font installed to be able to view the tamil text on this page).   http://arutkural.tripod.com/sumstudies/sum-incan-1.html  One can also read their discussion on Tamil.net mailing list.  PS: I used the spelling TAMIL to be in consistent with the authors otherwise I always use the spelling THAMIZH - I think this spells proper than other one. Unfortunately everybody seem to follow the former.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
