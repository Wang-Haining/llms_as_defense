A couple of friends, Rich & Halie, were staying there for the night, so I joined them for some 5 dollar prime ribs (actually the already ate, so they just watched me) and some gamblin'.  I started off playing The Price is Right (nickel slot... I always play conservatively :P ), and I accidentally hit the wrong button, of all things the Max Bet button!  This sent me on an emotional roller-coaster ride- at first I was like oh shit, that's a lot of money... 90 nickels wasted in one instant.  But then to my utter glee and astonishment the machine started making all kinds of noise and the graphics started going bonkers.  I got 50 bucks out of that errant spin, and it was off of the first 5 bucks that they gave me for registering for their Players Club.  Then I played some DDR (I suck at it, but Rich was tearing it up) and some virtual boxing where you actually have to move your body to duck and jab.  Weird shit. Yesterday @ work the third guy on the crew arrived... seems pretty cool.  On our transect we found all kinds of huge fresh wolf prints in the snow.  Today we did our first real surveys, with data forms and all, but the drumming season hasn't started yet so I only found one grouse on my route (well, three if you count the 2 remains I stumbled over that were most likely eaten by a raptor).  The grouse flushed from like 5 feet away from me and scared the shit out of me, but hey... it's better than finding another boring carcass :P I hauled my TV and Game Cube up on Sunday, so now I'm off to play some videogames.  I'm pretty beat from a long day, so I'm in the mood for an aggressive fighting game.  Hasta later!                 Ok, now that it's been so long I have a lot to go over as briefly as possible.&nbsp; Hung out with ThrusH from WA! a couple Thursdays ago at his pad in Duluth... had a couple beers and watched SmackDown, and played some SD:SYM, which we ended up drawing&nbsp;every game :P&nbsp;&nbsp; It was cool to hang out with someone whom I only knew thus far from a computer game-&nbsp;it was weird actually talking to someone about WA! strategies, players, etc. in person too :P&nbsp; Still on WA!-related news I ended up actually winning my first WA! title the following weekend&nbsp;too, scoring the US Championship in a tournament&nbsp;^_^&nbsp;  Went with Mike, Laura &amp; Marc to Mystic Lake Casino and lost 15 bucks but had a good time.&nbsp; Work = still sucky... hot and bug-infested.  hmm.. that brings us to this weekend and I'll be done (I don't really feel like typing too much... just want to get things down quick).&nbsp; Went to Little Havana's with a bunch of friends Mike got together to have drinks in downtown Minneapolis... cool but overpriced.&nbsp; Then we went to Laura's apartment and&nbsp;finished getting drunk, before going&nbsp;to IHOP and&nbsp;sobering up ^_^&nbsp; Sunday I stopped @ WineHaven to wish good luck to my bro-in-law's brother who's got some surgery coming up (ugh).&nbsp; I'm sure he'll be fine but it's not the kind of thing that's ever fun to go through.&nbsp; I was going to lend him my GameBoy SP, but just as I got there he showed off the brand new one he just bought along with the new Mario Golf :P&nbsp; At least he can still borrow games from me, plus that means there's one more person to link to&nbsp;:)  Last night I was on the lake of one of the forest manager guys&nbsp;around here, Ron Severs,&nbsp;fishing along with my co-worker... between three of us we got a few smallish Northerns, a Walleye and a Blue-gill... enough to fill us up with a heavy dinner.&nbsp; Now I'm back at work, in my 2nd to last week... waiting for the torture to end.&nbsp; It sucks that such a cool job has to go out on such a bad note just because of the damn bugs and heat throughout the last month or so.                   lalala... went to Duluth again yesterday.  Rather than cool and foggy like Memorial Day was with no people, it was warm and sunny with lots of traffic (including the &#9792; jogger variety ^_^).  I went to Fitger's Brewhouse and had a couple pints of some very tasty IPA that Gut recommended I try, skipped rocks off Lake Superior, went to the Great Lakes Aquarium (neat, but way overpriced.. I'd rather spend the money to go to the Minnesota Zoo), and walked around the shops on Canal Park. Toward the end of my stay, as I was having a coffee on a park bench, some homeless guy threw down his duffel bags on the bench next to me and started talking to me.  His introduction line was, 'HEY! Do I know you from prison, man?'  uh... no :P  Then he kept going on about how the government shouldn't be able to tell you what kind of plants you can and can't grow, how he thought necrophilia is worse than raping a live person, and then asked me how I felt about violent criminals.  Good thing this all took place on a busy street.. I was happy to finally get away from him :P Tonight is Sig's graduation from her medical residency, which I unfortunately have to miss, being that I'm 2.5 hours away and have to work tomorrow.  At least I'll be able to catch her grad party on Saturday. Now I have to cut it off short, Gut and his friend who lives around here are making elk tacos for dinner.  Free food = yes ^_^                 OK! I'm finally done for the day @ 7:00 PM!  I just saw a grouse up close dancing around and screaming, trying to distract me from her brood. She was getting stressed, so I just took a couple of pictures of her and moved on.  That's about all I've seen for grouse action in the past week... things are really slowed down.  Starting next week all we will be doing is vegetation surveys for the next 2 months.  I also saw a pileated woodpecker (the really big ones that look like Woody Woodpecker) swoop really close to me. On Saturday was Sig's graduation party which turned out AWESOME.  Most of Sig's in-laws were over (except for Troy, who unfortunately couldn't come, being that he works at Target where a lot of the workers were at their own graduations), a couple influential teachers out of her past, some friends, lots of beer, great food and WineHaven wine ^_^  So now she's a real doctor! Crazy to think about, but I'm impressed as all heck, and so happy that things worked out so well for her getting a real life established.  Hopefully I'll get there someday too.  For now I just need to worry about taking the GREs.  I studied a little bit today but kept dozing off.  Either tomorrow or the next day, depending on my work schedule, I'll head down to the Caribou (where that creepy homeless dude came up to me last time) and hit the books hard for a few hours. Yesterday I had brunch with my folks & a couple of their friends in Prior Lake... got stuffed as all hell.  Later on I picked up a used copy of Final Fantasy Origins from EBGames.  It kicks major ass.  They redid the original Final Fantasy 1 & 2 for NES with all new graphics a while back for PS1, and updated the original musical score to sound more symphonic than the original 8-bit beeping.  The games themselves, however, are 100% intact from a gameplay and storyline perspective, so it's kind of a cool mix of modern and retro gaming.  Being that Final Fantasy is my favorite game series of all time, I figured it was well worth the $16 bucks I paid for it ^_^         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
