We had a great Father's Day - Benjy and Frankie mice made nice gifts for Arthur and we also bought him a new golf bag and some sandals (to replace his 8 year-old Nike's (phew!).  And, dum dum da dum...I wrote a couple of pages this weekend! Excellent. My biggest problem is that I'm really motivated to start new chapters, and get about 3 pages into them, before I lose interest. Then, I wait a few days and start another chapter. I lack even one finished chapter. It's a disgrace, but I'm willing to bet that I'm not the only one who writes like that. The good news is that I have the entire plot in my head (it might be better on paper, I know), so I can jump around from chapter to chapter, but wouldn't it be nice if I  finished  one? Who knows? Do you know?  Alas, I'm in an excellent mood. I fear that such a great mood will lead to a lack of productivity in the novel arena - as most of my inspiration for it comes from a sense of panic, stress, and doom. (Not that my current job inspires those feelings (at least most of the time), but it's easier for me to recall Project Management events when I'm in a state of learned helplessness, which I'm currently not). Perhaps I'll have to invent some stress.... healthy!                      I don't mean to judge, (ya, right! This statement is only ever made by those who  do  wish to judge but don't want others to judge them) but (see!) I had a little lunch with a marginally annoying friend who was so absolutely rude during the lunch that it took all of my strength not to smack her and send her to her room.  It's not that she had 2 beers during a lunch that was less than one hour when she has to drive back to the office. That's a whole different rant that's far more serious and important than my actual rant, which is trivial and more in line with my overall nature.  She took not one, but  5  phonecalls during our 45 minute lunch!!!!! I abhore mobile phones in general (it's an aversion stemming from my previous life as a PM when I had one surgically attached to my hip by my company), and believe that in particular they have no place in:  restaurants golf courses movie theaters cars anywhere where they might annoy me I don't like hearing a mobile go off in any of these places, let alone be  with  the person who's rude enough to be the cause of the interruption! Holy shmoly!  Arthur, as you may or may not know is a Financial Planner. When he goes golfing with his colleagues (which is often, don't kid yourself), if anyone takes or makes a call on the course, the other members of the party take the phone and throw it in the water hazard. I should have dunked the mobile in her soy latte, but I don't think it would have had the same impact.  Whew. That's better. I'm done now                     As you may, or may not know, there's a federal election in Canada on June 28th. I have no idea who I'm voting for since all of the parties suck hugely. Having said that, I've made it my busniess to understand the platforms of the three main parties ( urlLink Conservative ,  urlLink Liberal , and  urlLink NDP ) as well as the  urlLink Green Party , who've been able to run candidates in every riding across Canada.  I will eventually come to a decision (I've narrowed it down to  not the Conservatives ), and it will be based on my research and my gut feelings. Apparently a family friend is basing her decision solely on the party's name. Since she thinks she's conservative, she's voting for them. She has no idea about their policies, who is running in her riding, or what the other parties' policies are. It's pathetic. I asked her if she agreed with Stephan Harper's (leader of Conservatives) anti-Kyoto, anti-gay rights, pro-Iraq involvement stance, and she said that they didn't affect her, so she didn't care.  Nice .  What makes it even worse is that she's otherwise a very nice person - she's just apathetic and uninformed.  So - what's my point? My point is that if you can't be bothered to at least find out what the candidates stand for, then you shouldn't be able to cast a vote on June 28th. She doesn't get it. I'd rather have a well informed prisoner vote than an uninformed civilian.  Maybe if I'd explained that it would be akin to blindly voting for someone on  urlLink  Canadian Idol   without ever having watched the show she would have understood.           \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
