So im at borders the other day (umm..yesterday) and im paying for this really nice hard cover copy of 'slaughterhouse five'.  the cashier was this totally cute girl must have been about 20, strawberry blond, shoulder lenght hair and blue/green eyes, perfect for me(am i shallow?).  so we talk for about 15 miniutes about vonnegut and hard cover verses soft cover (i like hard cover so did she) and kosinsky.  it was probably the best and most intellegent conversation ive had with a girl in over a year(probably since high skool)...but i totally wussed out what the hell i used to be sooo smooth and able to ask girls out and stuff, what happend ? well i need work i guess ive been out of the game for too long i need practice but.....well aahck.                i was looking at the paper yesterday and i noticed that the lizzie maguire movie beat out the new john cusak and ray liotta (im not sure i spelt liotta correctly) movie. who would want to go see 'lizzie maguire' rather than 'identity' well she is kinda cute.......iguess i just answered my own question, dammit! why do i have to be such a dirty old man.                      chris you got all the equipment  for allgrain brewing?  if so sweet then maybe this summer we can do some all grain brews and save some cash  oh yeah sarah talked her father in to starting up brewing again since he is retiring  he used to brew but then the wife was complaining tomuch but sarah convinced him and he went out and bought new Equipment  .... sweet huh? hopefully we'll be sharing resipes and stuff anywho hope the red goes well  peace   oh yeah so our vending machines dont have root beer so i desided to ask on of the vending guys and he said he didnt do drinks but if i leave a message on the machine they should be able to stock it so here is the letter i left:   Could you please stock one of our machines with Root Beer?  Root beer is a traditional beverage which has been enjoyed for many, many years and in recent times me and my fellow colleagues have been noticing the decline in popularity of this traditional beverage. We at NCSA (school of design and production) like to hold on to our traditional roots hence this humble request.  Thank you greatly  -School of design and production    posted by mark                      Man, once I get settled in at Iowa, and if I have any spare time (if all goes according to my evil plan I will) I'll be starting up the Iowa City extension of North Shore Brewery.  Of course, there aren't really any shores around there, except for the Coralville Reservoir, but that's alright.  I know a bunch of people out there already who like a good beer, or many good beers, and could probably very easily be convinced to join in the brewing.  In fact, the first drink I had when I went out to visit was a home-brew, and pretty good too, although I didn't the fine artisan who concocted it.  It was still not as good as the NSB chocolate stout, or the Smashing Pumpkin Ale that I loved so well, but it was good.  We need to get together and make some POWER-LLAGER, or possibly PILSNER-LLOYD.  Perhaps when this whole stupid college thing blows over, and all of us (me, Chris, Mark, Pete and Noah) live together and have a rockin' band, which would be even more amazing than the Traveling Wilburys for its amalgamation of rock geniuses, and me.  Well, now I've strayed from the topic of beer, the first of many more to do so on this blog, I'm sure.  But of course, beer and rock are inseparable, like strands of thread that intertwine to form a rope, a rope that binds us all together, even though we are distant geographically.  Wow, that was deep.  I need a beer.  - posted by jason          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
