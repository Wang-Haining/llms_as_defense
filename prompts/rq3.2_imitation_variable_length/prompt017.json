This is sooo wrong on so many levels, I scarecly know where to begin.  1. Originally, the Baptists [writ large] were the staunchest adherents to strict separation of church and state. The church was not to be about 'earthly' matters but to remain focused on the Kingdom of God. Any proposed mixture of the two was seen at best as problematic, at worst, literally the work of the devil.  2. The SBC has not be a font of Christian brotherhood. While their antipathy towards Muslims is well documented, they've not exactly been too welcoming of Roman Catholics. Hence, one would think they'd be a bit put off by Bush's papal trip only 2 weeks ago.  3. Fundamentalist Baptists were the most stringent proponents of separatism--Many did not even vote until the 1970s.  While I was raised in the American Baptist Convention, the basic tenet of separatism was very strong. In fact, as a HS student, I objected to reciting the Pledge of Alliegence, largely on religious grounds. I objected to the 'Under God' phrase. Since humans cannot deign to know the mind of God, we can't make that claim. To do so, would invite God's wrath upon our collective hubris.  I can see that opinion would not gain favor with our current court system.    urlLink The New York Times > Washington > Campaign 2004 > Strategy: Bush Allies Till Fertile Soil, Among Baptists, for Votes                      No! Not THAT one silly, the former head of the Florida Christian Coalition, who now works for Mel Martinez's senatorial campaign.  What a PIECE of work.   From the Washington Blade.  Just a fast snip: ************* Throughout his career, both at the Christian Coalition and after, Dowless has had a long history of pushing an anti-gay agenda.  As far back as 1994, Dowless, then the director of the Christian Coalition of Florida, was quoted in the New York Times opposing the popular Gay Days event at Disney World in Orlando because it allegedly was a threat to kids.  “This whole day is focusing on sex,” Dowless was quoted as saying, “and when you put these elements together, there is the greater possibility of illegal activities on children or some harassment.”  In 1997, Dowless, still in his role as director of the state’s Christian Coalition, cheered when the University of Florida rescinded a student spouse ID card that had been given to the partner of a lesbian student. The card gave spouses of students special advantages, such as use of the university’s libraries and recreational facilities.  “Marriage should be reserved for a man and a woman,” Dowless told the Alligator, the student publication.  In 1998, Dowless successfully blocked a move by the state legislature to write the Religious Freedom Restoration Act into the state Constitution. The move would have prohibited discrimination based on a variety of attributes, including gender.   But, according to the St. Petersburg Times, Dowless opposed the gender provision, saying it would be a possible loophole for allowing same-sex marriages.  And in 2002, Dowless created a misleading phone message for Gov. Jeb Bush. The message, sent to 50,000 social conservatives in the state, claimed that voters should cast their lot with Bush over Democratic rival Bill McBride because Bush was “the only candidate who supports traditional marriage.”  But the statement was false. McBride did oppose same-sex marriage, and after a public controversy, the phone message campaign was pulled.  Just last year, Dowless was scheduled as one of 25 guest speakers at a “Reclaiming America for Christ” conference held Oct. 24-25 in Fort Lauderdale. Promotional materials indicate he spoke about grassroots organizing among conservative Christians.  ****** Now, would some one please explain again why outing is a bad thing??????    urlLink Washington Blade Online          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
