The mission: To take 2 Chinese girls from Xiamen University, 20 and 21-years old, around Intramuros for a little tour.  Only Jen ended up going (lakwatsera kasi, hahaha). Buti na lang at least she was able to go kung hindi mahihirapan talaga ako mag-translate ng stuff. The two girls, Cathy and Trellis (yes, she knows the meaning of her English name) are on practicum from Xiamen U, and are two of 80-something teachers assigned to different Tsinoy schools around the Philippines.  After bribing Jen with glitter tattooing, we proceed to Paco Citizen school to pick up the girls. Only Cathy ended up going because it turned out that Trellis overslept from watching soccer till 5 AM that morning.  First stop, San Agustin Church. As usual, may wedding in progress, and another wedding party waiting to go on the next hour. Next stop, Casa Manila, my favorite museum in Intramuros. Must've been there like 4 times already.   Outside amongst the piedra china-lined road was a block of stone like this:    Hmm...curious kami ni Jentot, kasi last 2 weeks ago pa namin nakikita yun sa Baluarte San Diego.    Next, we went to the Manila Cathedral (yet with another wedding). The kocheros outside were offering to take us on a ride... with a substantial P250 fee (oops, tawad na daw to P150). We declined, and proceed to go to the National Museum.  It turns out that the NaMu (naks, parang MoMa sa New York) was closed for repairs (the one with the Spolarium), and we were then directed to the new one, the renovated old Finance Building behind it. I'd have to say the museum is not of the musty, dark museum-variety you have encountered during grade-school field trips. The new NaMu is definitely one where you can bring foreign guests with pride.  Medyo nahilo lang kami ni Jenova sa dami ng jars on display. Especially Chinese jars unearthed from dive sites. Si Cathy rin siguro, nadamihan sa jars. hehehe. Out in the courtyard pala was an actual igorot bahay kubo, saya!    Afterwards, it was lunch time at the Orchidarium just next door. Amidst the gardens nestled the Lush Life resto. We tried the longganisa and kesong puti pizza. I am very much NOT a longganisa fan, but I had to admit this one was kinda okay. The tomato and basil pasta was still as yummy as before, and we washed it all down with dalandan shake.    At 1pm we drove to Bahay Tsinoy back in Intramuros again. I made an earlier arrangement with my friend Ivan, who writes for Tulay, to give us a personal tour. Ivan was a great guide, explaining in Mandarin for Cathy everything interesting to know about Tsinoy history. Ivan, it turns out had the answer to my puzzlement about the Chinese-inscribed piedra china. They were old tombstones pala of Spanish-era Chinese. On the upper left and upper right are Chinese characters indicating what province in China did the deceased come from. Engot ko, but of course!-->I see those characters on tombstones every November 1. The piedra china were so hardy that they were used as road paving, stair steps, etc. Ivan said that the people who laid the stones probably didn't know they were grave markers. So there was a bit of controversy there about the desecration of tombstones, oh well.  Ivan also brought us to the Kaisa museum (not the same as Bahay Tsinoy), and the Kaisa library, showing us this room where all the oldest volumes were kept. There was also this edition of Sun Tzu's Art of War, with painted pictures on cloth-like pages we were forbidden to touch, lest we smudge it with oily fingers.  On the way home, we passed by St Peter, so bumaba na rin kami to show her the old alma mater. We went inside the church and showed Cathy our Virgin Mary statue with the Heart Evangelista eyes.  We weren't able to go Fort Santiago anymore and the Rizal Shrine. We were tired, having been gone out from 9 AM to 4 PM. That's for another trip. That, and the Chinese Cemetery (Ma Mon Luk's mausoleum, anyone?), Corregidor, UST, Paco Park...           \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
