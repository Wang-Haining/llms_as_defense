The assistant manager tells me the AC is broken... But! Afew hours later I have to go into the managers office to deliver some paperwork and guess what?... Her office room is cold!! Like a nice little igloo!! AC broken my ass!! I dont get it.. Anyway.. Here comes the great part.. The store was SO freaking hot that almost all of our refrigerated sections ( Deli, Meat and Produce ) burned themselves out trying to keep up with the temperature!.. I was supposed to go home at 10:30 but I ended up staying alil past midnight, I had to help pull  ALL  of the product out of the deli and the meat departments. And the meat department was thee worst! Everything was all hot and soggy and leaking and stinking. Especially the chickens and the fishes.. It was disgusting.. Im so glad im not working in the morning.. I feel so sorry for whoever has to sort through all that crap, and put back whatever can be saved..    D'OHH!!! ~Homer Simpson                    Ahoy yah swabbies! My blogs are new and improved with comments! Yes folks, You can now leave comments here and know that its STILL 60% less fat than regular peanut butter! Amazing!  Only 2 more days till the mini-vacation starts and it turns out I might make it to Vegas afterall, but I dunno, we will see what happens.  My friend Scott is all excited and was talking about the drive there, he cracks me up, check this out...    Azmordius:  should I bring CDs?  SHADOW6214:  yeah, the trip will prolly be 6-7 hours long..... If Brenton drives it will take 7 hours, if you or me drive it will take maybe 5, if Justin drives it will prolly be 3 hours..... If we live through it.  Azmordius:  HAHAHAH! Ill go with door #3.    Speaking of CDs.. I gave in and ordered a CD tonight from Amazon! ' Nine Inch Nails  -  Pretty Hate Machine '  Bonus!  I been looking all over town for the damn thang and it turns out that its out of print! Zounds!.. But the guy I bought it from says its still in its original package so woo!  bonus again!  I really hope this all goes smoothly, I dont like ordering things online, makes me nervous.. Hmm only time will tell.. * crosses fingers *    Yanno' what else?... I wish Sparo would clean up his panda's poop...  JUST ONCE MAN! JEEBUS CRIPES!  haha, Take care kids! And Love for the lovey!   This is your life.. And its ending one minute at a time ~Fight Club                          Weeeell, I got everything on my list done today, How great is that?..... Real great, Thats how great.  I picked up my paycheck and made the bill collectors happy.  Then I took my car to the shop for its recall checkup and had over 100 bucks of work done for free,  Woo!   Then went to my favorite toy store, BestBuy, and snatched up some new music, You were so right Laurren, Thanks.   I got ' Zeromancer ' and ' 30 Seconds to Mars '  Very cool stuff if your into bands like Orgy, NIN or GrivityKills.  Finally I stopped at home for Gyros, Yumm.    I think after I finish blogging and munching on applesauce,  I am going to go try to finish cleaning and sorting my apartment. I still need to make extra room for Cheryl and I have tons to go through... Yeah, im a bit of a packrat...  But anyway, Have a great night folks! And remember, Dont pet the kobalds!   I memorized how warm your body felt  as you lay half asleep beside me.  And I memorized the way the sunlight  filled the room and played upon your body  I miss.. God I miss, Waking up beside you. ~Stabbing Westward                     Here I am! Yeah yall know ya missed me.....  yanno whats nuts!? I read an article that Andy Kauffman ( sp? ) is alive! The crazy goober faked his death for 20 years just to secure his place as the greatest comic prankster ever. The wildest thing about it is that he even kept his own family in the dark! What could you possibly say to your family after doing something like that? ' Hi mom, Im home.. I was just kidding..'   Its just insane to me..  Today was so.. Eh, I didnt get done anything I needed to, I just slept in way too late * stares at Cheryl accusingly * hahaha JK hun.  It was a total slack day! I worked on more pictures, went out gaming with the guys, Cheated and ate more than I should have, I should run extra tomorrow for that. hmm.  Tomorrow its back to the salt mines.. Maybe ill stop at home after work, my dad is obsessed with putting this 'special wax' on my car.. haha dont ask, I dunno jack about car care..  Oh well, the pillow calls and I must answer, Ta'   I got my head, but my head is unraveling  Can't keep control, can't keep track of where it's traveling  I got my heart but my heart is no good  And you're the only one that's understood ~NIN                     My CD didnt come today! For the lova gawd I am so cursed! So I decided to e-mail my seller about it... And I hope I hear back.  I drew another pic today, but now I really need to stop with the personal creations for a bit. I need to start working on my request list before it gets out of hand. Also I have to get back to reading my friend Sarah's book before I forget what the hells goin on or she thinks I didnt like it, haha. One of the requests im really excited about is a logo for my cousin Jamie's metal band 'Grip'.  Everything I do ill continue to post at DA of course.     http://azraiel.deviantart.com/  On my way home I stopped to get gas and had the same cashier girl I had last time. She looks so familiar to me and I dont know why.. I have such a bad memory.. I think ill ask her about it next time, though im sure she will just laugh.  Then as I was coming upto my door a moth attacked me... But I didnt squeal like a woman this time!  Score!  haha! Be safe kids.   which one of yalls Neebol?..  Yooooo Mamma! ~MiB2                  If you have not gone to see  Spider-Man2 . Go. Right now. Seriously.  Tomorrow is my only day off this week and wow its felt like forever. Im starting to think they are making me suffer for having a vacation this month. Only 9 more days too.. Mmmm, ok anyway.. Where are all these perverted old women coming from lately?! Yesterday a group of them came thru my line arguing over who had the dirtiest shirt, then one of them suggested that I let them have mine.. Then they start arguing over who should be the one to take it off me..  EWWWWW!!  Then this afternoon, this old woman needed a pen, so as I was digging through my apron pockets I said.. ' There is one somewhere in this mess ' she replies with.. ' Ooh can I help feel around? '  EWWWWW!!  Just remembering all this again makes my tummy twist, and makes me want a transfer to Flagstaff even more!... Hmm its getting pretty late, I think im gonna go crash so I dont sleep away my one day of freedom.. Remember kids, dont let them ' lil ole ladies ' fool you..   Defense is paper thin. Just one touch and I'd be in. Too deep now to ever swim against the current. So let me slip away.  ~Dashboard Confessional                   I think this whole being-more-healthy-thing is working! As I was cleaning out my closet I found that I was able to fit into jeans I had to stop wearing last year, I have more energy, Even people at my work have started asking ' are you loosing weight? '. haha, Maybe I wont have this lil pudge tummy when Cheryl sees me next month. =)   Speaking of Cheryl, This Friday I need to go buy state maps for whatever is between Wisconsin and Arizona, I have them all written down someplace.. I think with those and MapQuest directions we should do fine. After that I need to do some Birthday shopping. Then I dont know, I would like to go see  Troy  or  KillBill2 .. hmm..   Grr.. I would be off on Thursday but I swapped days with another stocker so he could go out of town * sigh * oh well, lets just say its my good deed for the year.  I think im gonna go watch me some Conan O'Brian and then hit the hay. Eat more kiwi!   So I run.. Hide.. Tell myself..  I'll start.. Again.. Brand new name.. And eyes.. That see.. Into infinity.. ~30 Seconds to Mars                   Ahoy ya salty dogs! Today is payday!.. But it sorta sucks cause half of it has to goto rent this week..  Vultures!!  Anyway. My art page is down, aint that some crap? They have to do maintenance work and its taking forever.. I feel so naked and cold! Im almost done with my list of scribble requests, tho this last one is taking awhile.. I have draw a silverback gorilla's face in color and as realistic as possible. I hope I can have it finished by this weekend. I got my haircut yesterday and the woman decided to go nuts, so I lost about a week of growing. I really wish I could do it my damn self.. Cause you suck Sasha at GreatClips! I think from now on, if barbers dont do a good job we should be able to cut THEIR hair.. With big ass hedge clippers! I think I best be on my way now, gotta meet some folks for Chinese.. mmm Shrimp fried rice..  Aight be coo! * Salute *   Jansox: so you watching those movies alone or with friends? Azmordius: just me, my couch and my long john silvers Jansox: ...Is that your penis?
