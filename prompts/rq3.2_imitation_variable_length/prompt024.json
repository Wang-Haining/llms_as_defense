'Hey, look down there!' exclaims Foxy. They all look down and see a red cat. 'Hey, you're the girl I saw in the last part of the story!' *Danggit, you've already burned it down and thrown its ashes into the wind! Will ya give it a rest?!* *Geez, sorry!* 'Yeah, and my name is Katt. And that's the Reex.' 'So  that's  why it was called Reex Cave...,' said Sa2b. 'NO FREAKIN' DUH!!' everyone yells. 'Don't worry, I'll help you!' said Katt. Suddenly, she tears out a flat section of a stalagmite and picks up a few rocks. Strange thing is, she didn't use her hands! 'Hey, how are you doing that?' inquires Foxy. 'I'm telekinetic.' 'Oh, so you can move things with your mi-' 'SHUT UP!!' they all yell. Katt jumps up on the section of rock she tore off and floats up to the Reex while holding the rest of the rocks with her mind. She flings the rocks at the Reex and it lets out a roar of pain. Sa2b and company are dropped to the ground. 'Thanks for saving us,' says Camo. 'No prob,' says Katt. The Reex lets out another huge roar and everyone runs away in fear. Suprisingly, they all run at the same speed. 'Hey, you wanna come back to our apartment? I don't think you want to stay here any longer...,' asks Camo. 'Sure, that'd be nice,' says Katt, as she kisses Camo. Just before Camo accidentally trips from being distracted, Sa2b teleports them all out of the cave.
