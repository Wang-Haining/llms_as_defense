It is hilarious. I don't care if your not country or redneck you HAVE to see it. It's a fix for depression too. Here's a little tid bit out from the 'you may be a redneck if-' 'if someone says you've got something in your teeth and you take them out to see what it is,you may be a redneck' 'if your idea of fastfood is hitting a deer with your truck at 65 miles an hour you may be a redneck' 'if your momma says your lying through your tooth, you may be a redneck' And here's a bit from 'here's your sign'(retard sign i guess) 'the airport has lost my luggage and you go to the lost luggage place and the person working there says 'has your flight landed yet?' and i reply' no they just dropped me off by parachute. There's your sign' 'I went shopping and went up to pay for them,i dropped them on the counter by the cash register and the lady working there goes 'you buyin those?' i replied 'no i'm gonna steal 'em i'm just lettin' you see 'em first. There's your sign' It's great you've gotta see it.             Hehe I said pizzel.    &nbsp;  Today went alright even though the realization of how far behind christian school put me, keeps clicking in.&nbsp; My dad is taking me to talk to the counselors tomorrow about my classes.&nbsp; I'm nervous.&nbsp; I know they're going to have to look at my grades from last year and I shouldn't have failed.&nbsp; I passed everything with flying colors and I know there is a reason why they won't let me have my end of the year exams back.&nbsp; I know what you're thinking:&nbsp; Man is she paranoid.&nbsp; Typically I'd laugh and say 'You're right, what am I doing?' but christian school is screwed up in too many ways and its definately a possibility that they failed me because I wasn't coming back.&nbsp; The teachers would constantly ask me 'are you coming back?' no.&nbsp; I'm not you crappers, and you wanna know why biotch?&nbsp; Guess.    &nbsp;  Anyways, I don't feel like talking about this because I get mad beyond all recognition and then shut myself in my room for days.    &nbsp;  Catch you all tomorrow,    BETH               Today was really an OK day. I went and got signed up for school. I made sure I knew where all my classes were. Grandma(yes, I made grandma come with me, I wasn't about to go with just my mom)met some people at school, Dale and Virginia, they're janitors and since grandma knows the kind of work, she decided to say hello, it's a way of saying thank you, somehow. But I always so 'hi' or smile when I see Dale in the halls, he's really nice and so is his wife(Virginia). It's so cute, they always where matching shirts. Didn't see anyone I knew. I managed to get my mom away from the PTSA(whew! that was a close one)so she didn't sign herself up for any colunteer crap. If my mom was not a drug addict I would've cared less how many things she sined up to do, but she is. The last time she signed up for that kind of stuff was in elementary school. It went as follows: She came into my third grade class to help us paint Christmas knomes or 'Holiday' knomes. I don't remember if she was high or not but I think she just coming off of something. Anyways, you were supposed to make two and paint all of it one color(red or green) and leave a little circle for it's face. I forgot to leave a circle. Big mistake. My mom flies off the handle screaming at me at the top of her lungs-'YOU STUPID! FOLLOW THE FUCKIN' DIRECTIONS!' blah blah blah and so on and so on. I look around the room at all the faces looking at us. I start bawling and run into the bookbag place(you know the place that was like a closet that you slide the door open and put your coats and bookbag? that thing). And I refused to come out. It was sooo embarrassing. Mrs. Lile, one of my favorite teachers by the way, finally got me to come out and I can just remember everyone s eyes on me and how hot my face was. So, you can see my desperation to avoid her volunteering at all cost.    I had a nice little wrestling match with Luke and Logan upstairs on the floor. Haven't had one of those since.... I can't remember, but it was kinda like a way to lose myself. I was happy. It felt nice. Me and Maddy played peekabo. :-D. She would put her hands over her eyes and I would go-'Where's Maddy?' in my stupid little kid voice and she would put her hands down real fast and I would act surprised and go 'AHH! There you are!' and she would giggle and do it again. I love my cousins. Cousins are grand.      \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
