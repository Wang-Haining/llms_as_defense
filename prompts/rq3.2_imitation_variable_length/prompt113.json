Seren was petting a woman's dog (with her permission), and I was asking her about her cat and her children. As many of you know, we are having a problem with ours. This woman said that her kids love to play with the cat, and the cat doesn't mind in the least bit. What struck me as odd was that she was talking about how she lets her kids watch tv, and she instantly said, 'I just let them watch a little.' I was surprised that she was trying to justify her parenting to me, a complete stranger. I don't care how much tv her kids watch. I'm not here to judge her. God knows how much tv Seren watches. But is that what we are like? Are all parents worried about what other parents think about what they let their children do? (Yes) We are suppose to lift one another up, not criticize and judge. Don't get me wrong, I'm no perfect angel, I've judged people a time or two. Parents need support, and we have to feel like we can get it from one another. (Okay maybe not from strangers, but you catch my drift.)  Okay, I need to get back to work. They don't pay me to blog (but gosh, I wish they did!).        Well, to all my local readers, my summer school is taught by the local weather man, AJ Fox. Too bad it wasn't Kopi! :) Before I took the class, I thought he was going to be cool because he is on TV. But in reality, he is nothing more than a odd person. I say this because he is not too funny, and just kinda weird. He sure is not someone who I would be friends with. Then again, who really cares? I'm mean.   Some other issues on my mind. School. Okay, yes I'm in school now. But what about when I get my Bachelors? What will I do next? I wanted to be a teacher for a long time, but then changed my mind. For a couple reasons, but mainly for Seren. If I am a teacher, I will not be able to volunteer at her class. I will not be able to go on field trips with her. I will spend a lot of extra time working. Plus, will I really be a good teacher? So I decided that I would try to attend a Master's program at Fresno State (Early Childhood Education). I called a woman who is in charge of the program. She tried to tell me that I should not attend and get my teaching credential instead. Gee, thanks for the advice. On the other hand, I have people at work who tell me that I should go to school to get my Library Science degree, and become a children's librarian. But the question is, what do I want to do?       Well, it's been a while since I've written. I was sick and didn't feel like it. Sorry dear blog, I will not neglect you again. :) I have added my email to my profile, so feel free to go in and email me personally. I also added one more movie to my favorites. I have seen so many movies that I love, but I cannot think of any of them. So as I do, I'll add them.   I have two things down at the bottom of my page, that&nbsp;I am not sure anyone is aware of. One is the fresno family ring. This is a group of three (as of now) other moms. We are all apart of an Attachment Parenting group. So feel free to go to the list and check out their blogs.   The other thing at the bottom of my page is a weather pixie. I love it!! She changes her clothes with the weather. It keeps track of the weather here in Fresno. I tried to put her on my sidebar, but can't figure out how to do it. So it's easier to put it at the bottom. But if anyone can help me, please offer assistance. :)   Well, that's it for now.        Let me preface this next blog. This blog is mainly for me. Yes the pictures are for others, but the text is my journal. So I want to talk about Seren and some of the things she has been doing. I am not trying to tell others of how great she is (she is), or how smart she is (she is that too), but I am only documenting some of the wonderful things she has been up to lately. :)  Today at my grandparent's, grandpa gave Seren some money. I guess he is the only one thinking about her college education! :) Only kidding. Anyway, she was playing with the money. She counted it, 'for, fi, ehh (eight)...'. Then she began picking it up, holding it in one hand, while picking up the coins with her fingers. What great fine motor skills for the little one. I am so excited about it. The when we were leaving, she put the money in her pocket all by herself. When we got home, she put the money in her piggy bank. She saw the whole process. She knew where it came from and where it belongs. She knows it is hers now. I guess that means I have to actually leave it in there now. :)  Seren has been talking more lately. She repeats everything we say!! I now realize that I have to be careful. There are somethings that are said in this house that I do not want repeated. She announces when we burp or 'faht', followed by a 'pee u'. That's my girl!   She has been growing so much lately, that I have forgotten all that I wanted to write about. Oh well, that means there will be more later.  :)     I saw this girl at Savemart yesterday. I wanted to save her. At first glance she looked like she was a dirty little girl. Then I looked at her closely. Her hair had been shaved recently, but it was growing back-in some areas. There were areas where it looked like it had fallen out, or had been pulled out. My first thought was that she had had lice and that was the only way to fix it. Then I noticed the loss of hair. She was probably 7 or 8. She was nothing but bones. He clothes were baggy and filthy. He feet where black. She was with a woman whom I can assume was her mother. There were three other girls. One was a teenager who was dressed okay. The teen was holding a baby. Then there was another girl who was probably 10 or so. The one who caught my attention looked like she had it worse off. It reminded me of the book 'A child called it'. The book is about a man who was abused as a child. He gave an example of one time when he went to the store with his mothers and brothers. He acted crazy because he knew his mother would not do anything to him in public. That is what this girl was doing. She was running through the store, with a smile on her face. I wondered, was she abused? Was the mother neglectful? The mother looked like a druggie. Why do women have children if they will not take care of them? Something was wrong with that girl. No matter what it was, I wanted to help her. I looked at Seren and she was eating a cookie with a smile on her face. I wish all children were happy. It makes me sick to think how some children are treated. I'm sad. I am hopeful that the girl gets out of that life. I pray that she is strong and will survive to become a wonderful woman. I have to be optimistic about it, otherwise it will make me sick. All I can do is love my daughter, and pray for all others.          Today after work Seren and I spent some time together. She generally acts up after I get home. I think she just wants some alone time with me. So we went to WalMart, oh boy! Before I say how much fun we had, let me first say this......if your child cries, PICK IT UP! Children cry because they need something. I am tired of parents who just let their children cry. I just want to go up to the child and give him/her a big ole hug. While Seren and I were trying to pick out a pair of water socks (we settled on a pink Wiggles pair), this mother was pushing her screaming daughter along. The poor girl was crying like she needed love. Seren heard the girl and said, 'oh baby'. To which I replied with, 'yes the baby wants to be loved'. It didn't work, the mother just kept on pushing the stroller and looking for shoes. Okay, just so we are all clear here, you CANNOT spoil a child. Holding a child will not spoil it. Holding a child will only promote a healthy relationship, and will show the child how much he/she is loved. :)  The rest of the WalMart trip was filled with ways to try to entertain Seren. She smelled the fake flowers. :) We stopped by the toy aisle, where Seren picked out 5 or 6 stuffed animals. My favorite part was when she hugged Cookie Monster, a bright orange frog and a really soft bear all at the same time. She is learning how to love. And for the record, we put the stuffed animals back.  Right before Seren fell asleep, she gave me a kiss. She puckers her lips like she making the 'F' sound. Too cute, and a great way to end the day.      I came home from work today with a smile on my face. :) I loved being at work. Today I worked at the new library in Fresno. Everything was new! The rows were clean, the books were clean, the carpet was clean, it all was clean. Everything was perfect. The people were friendly. I hate working with unfriendly people. I usually work with these type of people when I am at the Clovis branch. :( One co-worker had made me so mad that I am having a hard time getting past it. She didn't want me to bring my child into the library with me tomorrow. Granted, I'll be working (for only a couple hours doing decorating stuff), but I was going to bring someone to watch her. So this woman (who shall remain nameless only because I should show some respect), complained to a head staff member that I had better not bring my child with me. Okay, I understand that she does not like children, but for crying out loud.....it is a library!!!! Children should be able to come into the library!! I know I should be nice to her, but she has made me mad one too many times and I have had it. This is why I loved being at the new library today. Everyone is friendly and there is no back-stabbing.   \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
