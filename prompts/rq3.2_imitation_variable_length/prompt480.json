So close that a kid 3 seats down from us got nailed in the arm with a broken bat. Good times. His dad was so excited that he caught the bat that he failed to notive his son sitting there bleeding profusely from the arm. Pretty rich!  After the game dkl;asfj and after a 5 watery Miller Lights, the Qdog and I rendezvoused with a couple of young ladies from the Red Sox legal department. The jury is still out, but the Qdog did no one any favors by belligerently yelling at passerby's to 'Get a haircut' and 'lose some weight.' He was inspired. There were some rich stories exchanged though and times were good. Good up ntil the 20 minute walk home where the Qdog repeatedly offered passing girls donuts from our recent purchase at Store 24. Most people aren't friendly at 1230am - don't know what their problems is, but the Qdog was really in fine form.   On a sidenote - I am getting harrassed by someone who claims that I hit his car -- when I was at work with my car. I might need legal services shortly if he keeps badgering me. As if white paint on the bumper is enough to incriminate!? I have hit cars klj;sdf but not his! CHRIST. Lucky for me I now know a couple good lawyers alk;dfj  Other than that, the summer is in full swing in the Back Bay. I'm exhausted and probably going to sleep at 730pm tonight. I can't take it anymore.  I'm washed up.   mjwern                 As of today, I am strangely detached from the reality  of the news. But I want to pass something along for  those who may need it: the ability to feel what I  attempt to describe below in the final sentences of  this writing - if indeed, you are one of the fortunate  and can feel it - will never leave, and will never  become any less vivid.   I have a different persective than many of you - what  is happening to you today happend to me, in a  different form, in August of 1995, when Jerry died.  The pain subsides, new routines and musical fixes are  found, some family stays with you and some does not -  but I am here to tell you that the detail never  leaves. On most Phish nights, when the lights dimmed,  I always had my eyes closed, and was again watching  Jerry walk out. Those stolen moments were never sad,  but always ecstatic for me. The energy, and the  passion never fade. The love never dims. The lessons  become clearer, and the music even sweeter. You'll  see. In decades to come, the little trick I try to use  below, at the end of this self indulgence, will work  just as well . . .   Regarding Phish: You've gotten what you paid for. And  you got off cheap.   Regardless of how much you paid - to Phish Inc.  directly, to the scene, in your relationships, with  your health or soul - you're in on the bargain of the  century. You bought the stock at .01 a share, and have  sold it at 1,000.00 per. Perhaps you don't know this .  . .   Now, the incidental fringe benefits are not to be  overlooked, nor disrespected: friends, lovers,  spouses, self-knowledge, expanded compassion, honed  capitalist skills, an amazing cd collection, travel,  adversity defeats and victories, maturation, blessed  emotional retarding to the joyous child-like levels,  and of course, lots and lots and lots of really  freakin' amazing music.   But. Allow me to remind you of the Great Intangible.  Of the Priceless Gift that you perhaps weren't even  aware you'd received - of the Holy (in all that that  word evokes for you) Unarticulable: The Magic.   I cannot describe it. I cannot relate it to a  particular show, or to my or your favorite YEM or Tube  or Divided Sky. It is beyond definition, beyond grasp,  beyond description, and beyond value. But not - never  ever ever - beyond perception. Here it is:   It is preceeded by that moment, as you wait for the  lights to go down - you know it will be any second  now, and its killing you in the bestest possible way,  as if you were 6 years old at 5am on Christmas Morn -  and the earthly realm and its horribly heavy (and  light) luggage are about to melt away, completely. In  what surely is the most tremendous understatement in  the history of human language, you consciously or  unconsciously feel and think: 'All is right. There is  no where in the universe I would rather be right now.'   Then, the Great Inarticulable - you can hear it RIGHT  NOW, as loud as if you were in the moment, as real as  its ever been, capable of literally raising the hair  on the back of your neck, and hardening your nipples,  at *this very second*. See if you got what you paid  for all these years, and then some. Right now, quiet  your head for a second, close your eyes, and imagine:   The lights go down. The crowds roars, to the point of  physical and aural immersion, and the energy - The  Magic - fills your very DNA.   Did you hear it? If you're one of the lucky ones, The  Magic resonates so clearly in memory that it is as  real for you at your desk right now that it ever was  in any venue you've visited. And if so, you got so  much more than you ever bargained for. Congratulations  on your fine, fine, unintended purchase. It carries a  lifetime satisfaction guaranteed warranty.   Grateful,  -p.                  So I was not out with Cusick last night, but was in constant touch by cell phone and he had some gems last night - classic Qdog:  I get a call about 10pm from Qdog who is at the quasi-swank (for Boston at least) Whiskey Park. He's in a huff telling me that the whole Yankees team is there in the VIP section and that he's standing shoulder to shoulder with AROD and Bernie Williams.   15 minutes later he calls me up and says that he introduced himself to AROD and that AROD blew him off. Great stuff. According to him though he said something like 'Hi Mr. Rodriguez, it's really great to meet you - GOOD Luck this weekend.'  Sickening. Nice going Cusick. You fucking pussy.   2 hours later I get a call from Cusick saying he's been in a fight. This is where the drunken Qdog takes over and the details are still extremely vague. Something to do with his buddy hitting on some girl with a boyfriend. etc.   An hour after that I get a call from Cusick saying that he is now solo watching girls come out of Daisy Buchanans.&nbsp;I'm speechless at this point...  Minutes later he's finally back at the apartment eating doritos and pounding gatorade on our couch throwing out gems like: 'The Qdog is in trouble-- repeat the Qdog is in trouble'   I left him watching Strip Poker on the Playboy channel at&nbsp;3 am.   &nbsp;                  So I've been thinking a lot lately about the collars up look that is sweeping white upper and middle class american men who also tend to wear nantucket red pants, whale belts, lobster belts, summer in the vineyard, have names like Bosworth, chain smoke, go to schools like Colgate and think they are ivy league, etc.   Found this gem on fratty.net:  The single greatest thing to come out&nbsp;in the 80's besides George Michael is the 'collar up' method of wearing a polo.&nbsp;While not invented in the 80's, it was brought back and truly revolutionized then.&nbsp;There isn't much about the 80's that isn't frat (which explains how every sorority has an 80's party at least once a year), but the 'collar up' is by far the greatest. But you can't just go prancing around town with your collar up every day, you have to do it correctly.&nbsp;Here are some easy to follow guidlines for popping your collar.  1).&nbsp; Pop the collar only on a two or three button polo...button down shirts just don't work, as much as you might want them to. Other pieces of attire can be substituted from time to time, such as the fleece, but can only be ruled on in&nbsp;a case by case basis, so pop at your own discretion, or those of a brother with better fashion sense than you. Multiple polos worn in layers must have both collars popped at all times.  2).&nbsp; Popping the collar causes you to look cool, but do NOT&nbsp;act as if you think you are cool- you will be trying too hard.&nbsp;Act as if you frat on a daily basis.   3).&nbsp; Do not pop the collar at any event in which you don't know at least 5-10 people.&nbsp;You run the risk of being ostracized, and must have multiple other fratties to back you up, in style or physically.  4).&nbsp; When popping the collar, do not button the top button. This&nbsp;produces the look of a dog halo, and is very unapealing.  5).&nbsp; When popping the collar, you must walk around with a completely lost look on your face, as if you are really hammered, even when you're not.&nbsp; This is frat.                  The Blog has hit the low point - but things are picking up. A couple of side projects have kept me sidetracked, and I'll have to explain at a later date.  I spent the weekend in Oyster Bay, New York. Hometown of Teddy Roosevelt and some of the richest people in the Northeast. People I met had the following names: Bostwick, CW, O'Donnell, Mouse, Motty, just to name a few. My friend's place was right on Oyster Bay and also had a pool overlooking the Bay. Amazing. Both nights were capped off by a nice glass of Jack on the rocks. That's my new closer. Really caps the night off in style - and in case you weren't already about to pass out, it finishes the job well.   I don't bang enough chicks.   Last night, I saw Dodgeball with Coosi. Horrible, Horrible movie. Never let Vince Vaughn try to carry a movie because he can't -- great side character, horrible lead. Stiller continues his streak of playing the same exact character. His wife does look the best I've seen her since the days of Hey Dude. That said, I can't wait for Anchorman - the Legend of Ron Burgundy. Looks hilarious. Also saw the trailer for The Village - which looks fantastic.   Back to not banging enough chicks. I simply don't. Some people do. Some people don't. I don't. Why not? I'm not a bad looking guy...I'm not Brad Pitt, but I'm not Brad Stapleton either. So what gives? I don't try hard enough? I think I don't make enough moneyadfs;. That's neither here nor there. I think I need a name change as well - Matt Werner just ain't cuttin it anymore. I should either start going by MJ and eating at more steakhouses, or make up something poetic like McFarlane.   Huge series for the Sox tonight. If they don't take 2 out of 3, the race for the AL East is over in June.
