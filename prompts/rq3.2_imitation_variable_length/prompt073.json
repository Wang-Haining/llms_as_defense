They brought me some newcastle, which of course i had to drink. 4 bottles worth.  Yesterday...punk rock brunch at the T-rock with coffee and bloody's(i have to wake up , and take care of the hangover from the night before) talking of Boots and fetishes. An aborted trip to the smitten Kitten which was closed, than studying at Bobs for like four hours or so. (I got to wear my hot new red boots) and then home where i sat on my couch, in the midst of my filth and crocheted while i watched pbs shows on nature. I am so going to end up with 40 cats and a neighborhood of children scared of me. woke up this morning two hours and twenty minutes after my alarm should have gone off, but it did not. Managed to get to class just in time. Payed my tuition, and than went to lecture, where hot guy i had a crush on last fall was all like 'come sit by me' and then awkwardness and stuff. So hot though...mmmmmm tyler...mmmmm. cheers devin                 I had forgotten to talk about the staple the staple? you say. Yes, the staple i found in a bowl of rice, allowing F. and i to eat fine Indian food for the price of two beers. I am not naming the place, as they were nice and hooked us up, the food was good, and i really think this was a rare type of mishap, but free dinners, what could be nicer. missed school this morning. Slept through both my alarm and the herd of waterbuffalo that live upstairs. It begins again. I will never win perfect attendance.  Am officially a regular at the tower. The servers called f. and i regulars. I hope that does not make us as scary as the other regulars. I am meeting K. tonight after my night class for an annie's evening of the sort we have not had in years. It will be nice to catch up with him, haven't beenseeing him much recently because of school. All i have been seeing alot is F. because we study together, and she makes me leave my house so that i actually study. Thanks to her i haven't fallen behind. well, back to work cheers                   So I have been avoiding dairy for a while because i am pretty lactose intolerant, and have stepped it up recently because i think i am getting allergic, I get all itchy and hivey after dairy these days. It has not been much of a problem,  never liked milk and yoghurt is good, but also not always my thing. But, cheese is so a different story. I love cheese, a lot. A Lot. But no more for me, i am tired of being ill all the time, and since i have been avoiding cheese as well as other dairy i feel much better.  Have stopped eating meat as well, just does not seem to agree with me. I do like it though, but again, tired of feeling ill.  So i guess i have turned vegan, though not for the reasons every other vegani know did. I still wear leather without feeling like a hypocrite. I don't have moral qualms about eating animal products. In fact, I probably still will from time to time, but healthwise for me it seems to be best to avoid them. More's the pity. Has not been too difficult though, albeit i haven't been eating out much, that might get tiresome, but most of my cooking was pretty Vegan as it was so that was not a drastic change. Not sure what to call myself now, I am sure I will slip and eat animal stuff every once in a while, and i won't feel guilty, so no really big moral reason to avoid it. But, that makes me not a Vegan? Part time Vegan? Predominantly Vegan? What?                 well kids today is the first midterm of the semester...should not be too hard, but keep your fingers crossed. Talked to a proff today about my big paper...got a ton of more sources and it is embarrasing to share just how excited i got from some new places to find journal articles she showed me...i am such a geek. back on the pain-a-lates bandwagon after a weeks hiatus...ouch...and damn....i am so weak, it feels like i am starting over. Thanks, J. for making me finish last night:) Okay, so i swore off this whole internet dating thing, stopped e-mailing people whose profiles i found interesting, and lo and behold someone e-mailed me...having fun with this correspondance.He at least is not the type of person who writes a two line e-mail...so that is fun. been really feeling my vices recently...though have not been indulging them as relentlessly as before, so that is good. started a new story on sunday, i like it, even though i think it might be a tear jerker for some folks as it is rather pathetically sad just now. But don't worry, i have the feeling everything will turn out just right in the end. anyways, off to take a midterm,  cheers d                  sleep deprivation and happiness have conspired to make me the most hyperactive little fag right now. Sooo fun. Tonight is outkast inklusion  at the T. Rock, which should be a blast. Lots of Queers listening to good punk and rock and drinking. Hooray. R. and i will get to hang out with everyone, and they can see us together and be disguted at the sweetness. So fun. Was supposed to do research today, but both of my papers are now delayed(legitimately), so i hung out at my coffee shop, played solitaire, went to the thrift shop and bought some stuff--a fly coat, a hat and the hotest wool pants, they are almost indecent in how they cling. Yay. Have been e-mailing a lot with my sister D. and we are developing a nice relationship which i am happy for. She is really cool , and really supportive of my life. It is really nice. Strange tho, i was always raised as an only child, and now i really do feel that i have a sibling. Well, anything else i write will be too incoherent to read due to my sleepiness, so Happy Thanksgiving everyone cheers d                 Okay watching the BBC news last night and one of the headlines are 'Opec head says that 'oil prices are crazy'' and for some reason this struck me as hilarious and I giggled for a good few minutes, after which i decided this had to be blogged. Am feeling a little more human and a little less like Gollum after pilates and chatting with J.H. last night. Somehow everything looks a little less bleak.  Am thinking of going out tonight, just me, and see if i can't strike up conversation with anyone. I am a sort of social parapalegic, and really need to practice my skills of interaction if i don't want to be a wallflower(any longer) The humidity has abated somewhat, which is a godsend, and hopefully will remain out of the stratosphere. Looks like I will get a bunch of food from the garden when i see Mum and Jan this weekend, Beans, Peas, Eggplants, Hot peppers, Lemon cucumbers, herbs, collards, lettuce, swiss chard. That will certainly help out the I Hate Being Poor fund, produce is so expensive, especially organic produce. d                 seriously ....it was....i mean, i pity anyone who was not there. I have no idea what turnout was, 40 or so maybe, i think? who knows. 2004 is shaping up to be a great year, starting out with a kiss from my sweetie, great beginning. R. and I were the prettiest girls on the street, though A.'s dress was amazing and her shoes...all i have to say is dangerous(in the best sense of the word) She brought a couple of cats that i knew from Art's High, had not seen them since graduation...seriously this world is just getting smaller. Had brunch at the T-rock than yesterday, great time, ran into a couple of people i know. That F, and M. and Hall helped me clean the post party mess up...thanks you guys, really appreciate it.  sledding tonight at J's and i am fully intending to flask it. decided against resolutions this year...though i do have goals 1. really put an effort in to quitting smoking  by r's birthday, since the two of are are both quitting i am hoping it should be easier. 2. keep up with school 3. budget budget budget I am tempted to add more to the list but that would just set me up for failure Happy New Years Everyone cheers devin                 Today is Mum and Jan's fourteen? year anniversary. COngratulations. Went to their house for a bbq with the aunties in honor of it on saturday. That was great fun. yesterday was spent in a meth addict style scrub o my kitchen and domestic happiness. I cooked a goose. Really.  A friend of Mum hunts and gave Mum and Jan a couple o wild geese, which they didn't want so i had them in my freezer and so yesterday i roasted it in the oven, in my Romertopf stuffed with chopped apples and onions and on a bed of the same, and doused with a little bit of vermouth (Noilly Prat of course)  It was super tasty, and leftovers are for tonight. The geese are very small, cooked they look like a slightly above avarage cornish game hen. In general i am avoiding meat, but i justified this as it was avoiding wast, it was wild and therefore somehow better then domesticated, and besides, i just like game. Today was the first day o summer class, should be an interesting six weeks. Let's hope i make it through. I think i will.                 So i got an e-mail back from the straight ex today, in response to a sappy one i sent whilst drunk a few weeks ago. Why do i do that? It is much better to daydream about them daydreaming about you then to be struck in the face with the cold reality. His e-mail was short, chatty, upbeat, and utterly soulless. The type one would send to a highschool friend who contacts you out of the blue. Doesn't make me sad, but...hmmm...doesn't make me really angry either, it feels like a total cop-out, especially since this was one of the many without closure. I sure do know how to pick 'em. I repeat my mantra....Boys are Dumb( I am incuding me in that) Speaking of. J.C. was supposed to take me out last weekend, but mixed up a work thing and couldn't but was all chatty and complimenting me and flirtatious and saying how he had to make it up sometime this week, and now has fallen off the face of the planet. Again!! Did not go out last night, just sat on my porch, chain smoking, reading, and glaring at the block-party. Because of the rain on tuesday they had it last ngiht and the whole street was full of community, children, puppies, good intentions, and involvement. Needless to say it put me in a foul mood, but didn't want to pub or coffee shop it either...tried to frind a friend to rescue me but everyone was gone. it is times like that when i feel that the rapture has happened and i am in hell. skittles          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
