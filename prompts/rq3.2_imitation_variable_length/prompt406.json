It was fun except we only stayed a day, I'd like to go there and hang out for like a week but I don't have the time. We went to a They Might Be Giants concert in Prospect Park in Brooklyn, it was really fun. I then went to a wedding in Connecticut. It went well. Overly emotional but that might be because I didn't know the cousin that was getting married as well as other people did. It's funny, the whole Powell/ Rinell side of my family (my stepdad and older stepbrothers' family which I still consider family since I ignore the step-anything crap) is al the same. Everyone looks similar and everyone seems to study either religion or science. It is really, really... different. On the plus side I discovered three new cousins (one thet I've never met and two from marriage) which means I need to re-tally my family (I think I'm somewhere near 35 cousins and counting) and I also found out I have some fun family... really I found out one of my cousins, Karen, is fun and was the only person I talked to much the entire time.  There's other stuff I'm sure I could write and I'm sure I could m,ake this post more coherent but I'm lazy and I'll write more this week I'm sure. Peace. <>             Hmm... well I saw Andy in the hospital this week, he seems to be doing well (or at least as well as a guy with pnemonia in the hospital for a week can be). Either way it sucks and I hope he gets better.  So I figured I was over liking Amanda, then I went to her house today to watch some movies and I realized, I'm not and I'm actually worse off now than I was before. I dunno, what gets me is that it isn't like I don't have other options... I do, I just never have any urge to pursue any once I start to work up the balls to. (For those unaware, it takes me a suprisingly long ass time to get the balls to do anything involving women.) And every now and then she says something about being alone or needing a boyfriend and I want to just ask, but I don't since I know the answer. I dunno, I think I'm going crazy (well, crazy in a new way, not the way you are all familiar with). I don't get it. Argh, this blows my ass. I'm so close to what I want yet so freaking far away. Ah bugger!  Either way I'm ending this one with a quote: Love sought is good, but given unsought is better  --William Shakespeare          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
