And that's just the basic stuff: snorkel, mask, fins (the biggest chunk of that money), booties, and gloves.  I start the lessons in late September - the classroom and pool sessions are Tuesday and Thursday nights for two weeks, then the open water dives are both days on the following weekend.  Underwater Sports had their big Divers Fair this weekend, so everything (including the lessons) was on sale, but wow, this could be an expensive hobby!  I've heard that Puget Sound has some of the best diving around, but the cold is also legendary.  The plan is to get PADI certified before I go to New Zealand in November.  Should be fun, at any rate, and it's yet another cool new thing to try.  I guess if I'm going to get seriously into diving around here I'll eventually need a dry suit, but I'm going to let my credit card recover for a while!  Everything else I need for the class (wetsuit, tank, regulator, etc.) will be provided by the class.                                 20 minutes elliptical 45 minutes strength training/stretching   There must be something about Wednesday as 'bad body image day.' I got all up in it again at the gym tonight - hating the way my track pants fit, focusing in on the areas I hate - my upper arms, my thighs, and (ugh) my stomach. Focusing in on the sad reality that in certain places on my body, no matter how hard I work to lose weight and tone, I may have done irreparable damage to my body by carrying around all that extra weight for so long.  I've always thought cosmetic surgery was impossibly vain (or at the very least, an external fix for internal problems). I've always maintained that plastic surgery was justifiable only in cases where someone's been disfigured or injured. But this has gotten me to thinking? Have I disfigured my own body to the point where I can justify plastic surgery to myself?  It's not something I'll think seriously about until at least a year after I've reached my goal weight. Everything I've read says that you need to wait that long to see how your skin springs back. But it's something I wonder about.  It's definitely the vanity that's driving these body image issues. It's my desire to feel beautiful, to feel attractive, to be validated for my body. I suppose not being single would help that, but I also know that I need to find that peace with my own body. I'm not sure how to get there on the pure 'looking in the mirror' side of things.  I can focus on what I can do with my body that I couldn't 18 months ago. Tonight, Carrie, who works at the gym, asked me if I was planning to snowboard again this year. I said 'Heck yeah!' She said 'Set up some time with me and I'll put together a training program for you to get you ready.' She's also trying to get a ski and snowboard conditioning class added to the schedule at the gym. Snowboarding. Yeah, that's something I couldn't have done.  On Saturday, after I got back from skydiving, Parker asked me 'A year ago, would you have pictured yourself doing this?' A year ago I might have hoped I could, but no, I definitely wouldn't have been able to. Not only because at the time I was over the weight limit, but because I wouldn't have had the confidence in my own body.  'A year ago' is an interesting time to think about, because my accident was almost exactly a year ago. I got to thinking at the gym today - I should do something big to mark the occasion. Celebrate the fact that despite the long road back, I'm fully, 100%  back , weird-ass leg scars and all. My body was bruised and battered, but not broken. On September 5, 2003, I couldn't even stand, let alone skydive, so I'm thinking I need to schedule a dive for September 5, 2004. It' s the Sunday of Labor Day weekend, and I was thinking of taking advantage of that weekend to get some of my dives in anyway.  Maybe I'll make a really huge deal of it and invite some friends to come out and see me dive then get lunch or something in Snohomish. Make a toast to survivors!  So I'll try to focus on that. I'll try to focus on all the things I can do with my body, and all the power it gives me. It's hard to do that though, when what I really crave is validation that it is an attractive body. I know most of that has to come from inside... I can't wait around to get it from others (though, damn, it would be nice to be objectified!).                                 5 minute warmup 20 minutes run/walk 5 minute cooldown/stretch Energy level: good    Brisk five-minute warmup walk, then do two repetitions of the following:      Jog 200 yards (or 90 seconds)  .  Walk 200 yards (or 90 seconds).    Jog 400 yards (or 3 minutes).    Walk 400 yards (or three minutes).   Finally I did a full Week 3 workout for  urlLink Couch-to-5K . I got through that nagging second 3-minute running interval. Woo hoo! I'll do it again on Saturday, and assuming that goes well, I'll attempt Week 4 next week. I think Week 4's going to take a while, too.   It looks pretty brutal:   Brisk five-minute warmup walk, then:       Jog 1/4 mile (or 3 minutes)    Walk 1/8 mile (or 90 seconds)    Jog 1/2 mile (or 5 minutes)    Walk 1/4 mile (or 2-1/2 minutes)    Jog 1/4 mile (or 3 minutes)    Walk 1/8 mile (or 90 seconds)    Jog 1/2 mile (or 5 minutes)     I did poke around the Coolrunning discussion boards and while there are some people who can do C25K in 9 weeks, there seem to be quite a number who repeat weeks. I'll get there... eventually.                                 5 minute warmup 20 minutes run/walk 5 minute cooldown/stretch Energy level: good   From the C25K site: Brisk five-minute warmup walk. Then alternate 90 seconds of jogging and two minutes of walking for a total of 20 minutes.  So today was the first time I had to work  really  hard to talk myself into getting up to run.  Angel Krisanne: The alarm went off.  Get up. Devil Krisanne: That was just the first one.  Hit snooze. AK: Okay  10 minutes later  AK: It went off again. DK: Hit snooze again.  10 minutes later  AK: Okay, this time we really have to get up. DK: But I don't wanna! AK: Yes, yes you do. DK: What would be so bad if I didn't? AK: You'd be behind. DK: I could run Thursday and Saturday AK: You know you won't do that. DK: I could run tonight! AK: You  really  know you won't do that. DK: But we're already 15 minutes late and there's the big meeting this morning. AK: And the meeting's not till 10:30!  Not an excuse.  And we'll feel better if we run. DK: Grumblegrumblegrumbleokay.  So before I went out I decided to take a motivational picture in my newest gear. Granted, taking a picture in black probably isn't the best move - as black is pretty flattering and spandex sucks EVERYTHING in, but it'll give me a rough idea of the baseline here (and this is one of the most ... umm... supportive tops I've owned.  Damn it makes me look flat-chested!). These days the changes are more subtle, so I'm hoping I can compare photos a few months from now and at least see some difference. I took a front and side photo because one of my biggest regrets is how few side photos I have from before I started losing weight, and I think that's where the difference really shows up. Please ignore the bedhead :)           I noticed that my recovery time felt a little faster today. My heart rate immediately after the running interval was about 156-164, at the end of the walking interval it was down to 128-136. I played a little game to get through the running intervals - trying to guess exactly where I would end up at 90 seconds. It'll be an interesting informal way to tell if I'm getting any faster as I progress.                                 5 minute warmup 20 minutes run/walk 5 minute cooldown/stretch Energy level: good   Well, didn't  quite make it through Week 3, Day 1.  Here's what the site says I'm supposed to do:   Brisk five-minute warmup walk, then do two repetitions of the following:        Jog 200 yards (or 90 seconds)    Walk 200 yards (or 90 seconds)    Jog 400 yards (or 3 minutes)    Walk 400 yards (or three minutes)     I made it almost all the way through the second 3-minute running interval - about 2:15. I substituted walking, but I need to get all the way to 3 minutes before I move on. I'll just keep trying it every morning till I can get it. Then I'll move on. So I may or may not repeat weeks - I'll just keep trying to stretch it.  Largely sluggy weekend - went up to Vancouver, didn't eat all that well and didn't exercise (except running on Saturday). The way I ate this weekend was practically the equivalent of mainlining carbs for me - I can't do that and expect to continue to meet my weight goals. The scale reflected it this morning, so I need to go back to very very strict low-carb for a bit to shake things up. Ugh. Just goes to show that after 18 months of doing this, I still need to make good decisions  every single day .  I get on autopilot and I think I can handle it, and it's a slippery slope to making bad choices again.                                  5 minute warmup 20 minutes run/walk 5 minute cooldown/stretch Energy level: good    Brisk five-minute warmup walk, then do two repetitions of the following:      Jog 200 yards (or 90 seconds)  .  Walk 200 yards (or 90 seconds).    Jog 400 yards (or 3 minutes).    Walk 400 yards (or three minutes).   So I'm still working on Week 3 of  urlLink Couch-to-5K . I inched a little closer today - I got to 2:40 on the second 3-minute running interval. I also noticed that the recovery time for the 90 second intervals and the first 3-minute interval seemed faster today (though I didn't verify that by actually taking my heart rate).  If I do actually get through the Week 3 intervals this week, I peeked ahead to Week 4 and shuddered. And Week 5 is an even bigger leap. I'm starting to confirm this isn't a realistic plan for me to complete in 9 weeks. It makes me wonder: how many people *do* find this a realistic plan? I should pop around the Cool Running discussion boards a little more and see.  Edit: I checked the boards and found  urlLink this  thread (among many others).  I need to hang out there more :)              \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
