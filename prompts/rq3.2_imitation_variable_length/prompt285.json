  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic:\n\n       Today as it has been soo far this summer was another completly uneventful day.  Nothing really occured of any value at all.  I believe I woke up around 2 or 3 due to talking to Roxanne 'til about 5:40 or so.  I still don't usually wake up that late, but oh well.  From then on, I did nothing, until about 6 when my parent's almost made me go to my little sister's dance recital.  I ended up being stubborn, and didn't try to get dressed, and by the time they were leaving I was still not dressed.  So, they left without me.  So it was an ok day I suppose, it could be worse.  I could be sitting watch a boring dance recital.  Oh, I almost forgot, my phone call to Stormy cost me $104.  My dad was pissed about that.  He said I have to do things around the house to pay it back.  Hopefully I'll get a job VERY soon so I can pay that off without having to do random things around the house.  But other than that, nothing at all happened today.  Oh well, I'm off, I hope you're glad you can now comment Rox, I didn't like that Xanga, too 'busy' so to speak.  I like this one, nice and simple:)            'tis been quite a while now hasn't it?  Missed me?  Heh, I didn't think so.  Man, nothing has been going on lately, as usual, I've just started school last week.  Very tiring it is.  I thought U.S. Hisotry AP would be harder than it is now.  I mean our History class last year was much harder, but oh well.  I haven't talked to much anyone on the phone here at home.  It's kind of weird, I was just used to it I guess.  Band practice has been tiring as hell as usual.  Very hot, I turned black, heh.  Yeah, and I'm going to fix our drumline website, I recruited Josh to help: )  We'll see if he's really that good at graphics, heh.  I haven't talked to Mona since......Hmmm, I can't even remember the last time I talked to her.  I see her in the halls every now and then, I don't say hi, neither does she.  Sad, really, but I've seemed to finally cope with it.  Heh, this song reminds me of her, yes I know I sound like a loser, but it's kinda hard not talking or not seeing  someone you're that close to.  Just sometimes there are certain moments, when I think about it, and it really bothers me.  But I'll do fine, I think.  I have a football game to perform at today, heh, be at the band hall by 4 PM.  I've been awake since 4 AM, and now it's 7:17 AM.  Suprisingly enough I'm not that tired.  I'm going to go to sleep for a bit soon, I should get some rest before the game, if not, I'd stay on 'till my parents told me to get offline.  Yup, life is boring, and I've yet to meet anyone intresting.  As far as girls that is.  I was looking up colleges about two days, found quite a few with the my major, but they ended up being vocational schools:(  I want to go to a college, o university, take other classes as well, like psychology or philosophy.  Oh well, heh, yesterday was Fili's birthday, we tried putting him in the quint case, but he wouldn't go.  Sophie bought him this cake and gift basket, very cute it was.  Once I start getting the Drumline site up, I'll post the pictures.  But as for now I think I'm going to go sleep, there isn't anything else to do online.  Well there is, but as I said before I need sleep, even though I'm not that tired.  I know I will be later, maybe?   Adieu Mon ami.            Hmm..I sitting on my bed at 5:30 or so A.M. and for some reason has the idea to write this.  And so I did, and this is what I came up with, so tell me what do you think?    GodSlave Machine    So lifeless, dull it may seem  Though with a push of a button  You, the God of the machine have brought it to life.  It exists ONLY for you.  Electricity pulses through the silvery solder and forest green boards  to enhance your life, and not its own.  So vivid and dead all at the same time.  The  lackluster keyboard in which you use to convey emotion  The monitor which shows you things you may never see in real life,  and will never know the TRUE  beauty of.  Yet, this satisfies you.  Soon you grow to have no care, but commanding this machine.  Nothing seems as real anymore, and conversations without a keyboard  leave you open and vulnerable.  And soon the machine controls YOU,  it breathes life into YOU,  you know longer know what it is to be real.  You are merely a slave...to the MACHINE.    \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
