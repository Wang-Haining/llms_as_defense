A very normal saturday. Work at Harcombe and then now its 12 at night and I'm in java city doing timepass. Work at harcombe was very light. All the student had gone home for easter and so the crowd was minimal. Good for us. Been to the easter mass in brooks center in the morning. I was to go there with Annie but she ditched me. She first woke me up from sleep at 8.55 asking me to accompany her for the 11.30 mass and when I went to pick her up at 11.15 she was sleeping. Was pretty bored to walk alone but didn't want to miss the mass. When I reached there I was happy because I had taken the right decision. I'm not a religious person but I like going for masses. I like the choir, the priest's sermon, the wierd ppl that come up and do the readings. I also like it because churches are beautiful, especially during easter and christmas when it is decorated. It was beautiful at brooks. Flowers of diff hues adorned the altar. Everyone there was well dressed and the mass was conducted very well. Everything was taken care of. Liked todays mass a lot.     After Harcombe went to Waffle House to have coffee. I went there with Vipul(Bulli) and Viraj. Bulli and myself go there often. I get this huge kick of paying for coffee once and having 4-5 refills.Hahaha.... Believe me thats the only reason I go there.     Had some fun at harcombe. Deep my roommate was using tongs and pretending to pinch Sawant nipples and sawant being short tempered started chasing him and then they started running over that part of the floor which Amos had just mopped. Amos was pretty pissed. To make things worse I started calling sawant stiff nipples and he started throwing ice cubes at me hahhaha and guess where all the ice cubes landed.... Amos's mopped floor. He then gave us a strict warning. hahhaha...     I have to get back to work now.   Till tom                             I just bought a brand new Palm top from amazon - Palm i705 for 100$. Its has wireless connectivity + all the classic features in a palm. Wireless connectivity wld cost me 20$/month which is optional and I dont think I'm gonna buy that, atleast not now. But once I have some money i'll do that. Its soo cool like a PC combined with your cell. I would be working in Barnes and Nobel for around 15-20 hrs/week in summer and wld be research for Mcneill for the remaining 20 hrs. So hope to earn some moolah. I am planning on two trips. One to florida with my undergrad friends and with my clemson friends somewhere else. I had gone to Charleston with my clemson friends during spring brk and I really enjoyed it. They are pretty cool. We all share the same funda in life- ENJOY.        I have had a lot of friends. Everyone have seriously affected the way I go about living my life. Friendship is something which I cherish dearly.       I hope I have them around all the while, as long as possible    will write in tom               \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
