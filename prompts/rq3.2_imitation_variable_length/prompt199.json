Albert Gore has a few nasty comments concerning the President. Again I am completely amazed at how liberals like Gore are unable or worse yet unwilling to grasp the big picture. Here are a few of the more obnoxious quotes I haven't heard discussed yet.   George Bush promised to change the tone in Washington. And indeed he did. As many as 37 prisoners may have been murdered while in captivity, though the numbers are difficult to rely upon because in many cases involving violent death, there were no autopsies.  How dare they blame their misdeeds on enlisted personnel from a Reserve unit in upstate New York. President Bush owes more than one apology. On the list of those he let down are the young soldiers who are themselves apparently culpable, but who were clearly put into a moral cesspool. The perpetrators as well as the victims were both placed in their relationship to one another by the policies of George W. Bush.   Just so I have this clear some Fascists who have acted against America and/or the Iraqi people in Iraq die in jail and this has changed the tone in Washington for the worst? As if the tone in Washington prior to this “unfortunate” incident was something akin to the REM video Shiny Happy People. Isn’t Moveon.org the same bunch of idiots that months ago published Ads that compared Bush to Hitler? Ah…the good old days. What the hell is this “moral cesspool”? Iraq is a moral cesspool because they for the most part like Bush and want freedom? That sounds like hate speech. As for responsibility of both the perpetrators and the “victims” well I have some questions there too. How are the policies of a four year old administration responsible for Islamic hatred of America forget about the actions of the prison guards who are probably filled with a understandable level of anger towards enemy? Note that Gore neglected to point out any real policies that state “kill, torture and otherwise abuse prisoners in the name of America”. Even if our policies are indirectly responsible, and they aren't, if Bush is directly responsible for these deaths, and he isn't, I would like to see the Democrats take direct responsibility for Alger Hiss. They are undeniably guilty of letting Communist spies run free in the government throughout the 20th century putting America’s standing in the world in jeopardy on a level far beyond the 'loss of respect' we've supposedly suffered in this case. So what is worse: an American policy that lets Fascist die in jail or one that hires them to make policy?    In my religious tradition, I have been taught that 'ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? Even so, every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit... Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.'    Ok, a bit about Gore's supposed “religious tradition” [note he didn’t say beliefs]. Democrats say they support America but historically have sided with the enemy. They opposed invading Afghanistan, so did the Taliban. They opposed overthrowing Sadam, so did Al Qaeda. No sooner did Al Qaeda rear its ugly head in Iraq did the Democrats start screaming for retreat. If we were to only look at the 'fruit' of Democrats, say their positions on issues/their votes, the people they choose to support or the policies they put in place then we would be inclined to believe they side with forces opposed to America. They are the first to defend the enemy [sometimes even ahead of France]. Siding with the enemy when the enemy has stated they hate you and will kill you is an action that will only bring about ruin. Make no mistake here Fascist Islam hates Liberal values. Liberals will be the first ones killed. All of Islam’s arguments against American culture are focused on our crumbling morality, something Liberals champion. They are ideological lemmings at heart. Thank God there are enough Republicans around to keep them from driving us all off the bridge with them. So on this point I guess I do agree with Gore. By thier fruit you  will  know them.                 Now that I’m back I’ve just got to get my two cents in on this whole Kerry/Vietnam thing. Let’s face it Kerry has been setting himself up for a long time and this situation is a prime example of how Liberals persist in believing they can have things both ways. This man is a hero only in his own mind and the minds of some seriously diluted people. According to his own words Kerry is simultaneously: a war criminal and a war hero. He served in and protested against the war a trend we see continued throughout his career. This alone, for me, calls into question his ability to lead Americans. Waffles are for breakfast not politics, and John Kerry is a consummate waffler.  urlLink After seeing this commercial however I am quite certain this man is a walking disaster in addition to a waffler.  Two of his three Purple Hearts were received due to Kerry injuring himself through stupidity. It is truly hard not to laugh out laud just explaining that to people. If this is the best the Liberals can nominate then they are worst off then one might first believe.                  The last few years haven't been very good to Star Trek. Voyager was the worst Star Trek show ever, Deep Space 9 didn't get any promotion, and the first two years of Enterprise sucked. A lot of people blame two people in particular, Rick Berman and Brannon Braga. Rick Berman took over as producer of Star Trek after the death of the series founder, Gene Roddenberry. Brannon Braga was a writer during the days of The Next Generation, and was promoted to producer for Voyager. Together, the two have run the series into the ground. In an interview with Ronald D. Moore, writer on The Next Generation and Deep Space 9, he revealed that the writing staff had to lie to Berman in order to do the show the way envisioned it. There were a couple of great ideas they had which they never could do, because Berman felt that they pushed the envelope too far. As for Braga, he has never seen an episode of the original Star Trek. He has violated continuity countless times, recycled old episodes repeatedly, and cheapened the show by putting as much sex in as possible in an attempt to grab ratings. Instead of expanding the audience, all they have done is alienated long time fans, many of which have turned to other shows. Fortunately, the two are stepping back from day to day involvement in Star Trek, and the series will be handed over to Manny Coto, who joined the writing staff of Enterprise for Season 3. I, for one, am very excited, for Manny Coto has written some of the best science fiction on TV in a long time. He was the series creator of Odyssey 5, which ran on Showtime for a season before it cancelation. Odyssey 5 was one of the most original shows I have seen in a long time, and the decision to cancel it was monumentally stupid. It was the second highest rated show on Showtime, but they decided they didn't want to do science fiction. That's just like when Sci-Fi channel canceled their highest rated show, Farscape, because it's ratings weren't as high as Stargate. More on that some other time. Coto also wrote some of the best scripts not only of this season of Enterprise, but one of the best episodes in all Star Trek. I am very confident that under his direction, the show will get even better next season.             urlLink Al Qaeda has been working for sometime to obtain nuclear weapons.  I saw this link on LGF and I hope this article helps to put things back in perspective to anyone who is starting to relax [I know I was]. We are by no means out of the woods.    If a 10-kiloton nuclear weapon, a midget even smaller than the one that destroyed Hiroshima, exploded in Times Square, the fireball would reach tens of millions of degrees Fahrenheit It would vaporize or destroy the theater district, Madison Square Garden, the Empire State Building, Grand Central Terminal and Carnegie Hall (along with me and my building). The blast would partly destroy a much larger area, including the United Nations. On a weekday some 500,000 people would be killed.   Could this happen?   Unfortunately, it could - and many experts believe that such an attack, somewhere, is likely. The Aspen Strategy Group, a bipartisan assortment of policy mavens, focused on nuclear risks at its annual meeting here last week, and the consensus was twofold: the danger of nuclear terrorism is much greater than the public believes, and our government hasn't done nearly enough to reduce it. Graham Allison, a Harvard professor whose terrifying new book, 'Nuclear Terrorism,' offers the example cited above, notes that he did not pluck it from thin air. He writes that on Oct. 11, 2001, exactly a month after 9/11, aides told President Bush that a C.I.A. source code-named Dragonfire had reported that Al Qaeda had obtained a 10-kiloton nuclear weapon and smuggled it into New York City.             \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
