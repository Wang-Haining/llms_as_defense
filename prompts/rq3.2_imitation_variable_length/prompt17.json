This is sooo wrong on so many levels, I scarecly know where to begin.  1. Originally, the Baptists [writ large] were the staunchest adherents to strict separation of church and state. The church was not to be about 'earthly' matters but to remain focused on the Kingdom of God. Any proposed mixture of the two was seen at best as problematic, at worst, literally the work of the devil.  2. The SBC has not be a font of Christian brotherhood. While their antipathy towards Muslims is well documented, they've not exactly been too welcoming of Roman Catholics. Hence, one would think they'd be a bit put off by Bush's papal trip only 2 weeks ago.  3. Fundamentalist Baptists were the most stringent proponents of separatism--Many did not even vote until the 1970s.  While I was raised in the American Baptist Convention, the basic tenet of separatism was very strong. In fact, as a HS student, I objected to reciting the Pledge of Alliegence, largely on religious grounds. I objected to the 'Under God' phrase. Since humans cannot deign to know the mind of God, we can't make that claim. To do so, would invite God's wrath upon our collective hubris.  I can see that opinion would not gain favor with our current court system.    urlLink The New York Times > Washington > Campaign 2004 > Strategy: Bush Allies Till Fertile Soil, Among Baptists, for Votes                      Today's Washington Post has an article that examines young people and rural poverty.   Briefly, while the percentage of urban poor is 16%, for the rural poor it's over 20%. Furthermore, poor rural children have less access to medical care, dental care, and a host of social services, governmental and non-profit.  This is consistent with what I've been seeing in my home town, which is located in Northern PA, in the foothills of Appalachia.   I've seen families devasted by the lack of health insurance, particularly when a child is diagnosed with cancer. The local people will do their best for the family running all manner of fundraisers, but as they saying goes, 'You can't get blood from a stone.'  Needless to say, the area leads the nation in per-capita military enlistments. With the military, a person gets a regular salary, regular health and dental care (the quality is questionable, but something is generally better than nothing), and somewhat decent housing. Of course, you do run the rise of going to Iraq. But the benefits are more than what many of these kids have ever seen.

The era of strategic deception  Sun, July 18, 2004   The era of strategic deception  By Eric Margolis -- Contributing Foreign Editor  HAVING PRESIDED over the two worst intelligence disasters since Pearl Harbor -- 9/11 and the misbegotten invasion of Iraq -- the Bush Administration and its apologists are now whining, 'Okay, we were wrong about Iraq's weapons and supposed threat, but so was everybody else. Besides, it was all the CIA's fault.'   No way. The Iraq weapons fiasco was absolutely not caused by an 'intelligence failure,' as the White House and the recent Senate whitewash claim.   U.S. national security and CIA were corrupted and blinded by extremist ideology, cowardice, and careerism.      Nor was everyone wrong about Iraq.   Scores of Mideast professionals, this writer included, insisted from Day 1 that Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction, posed no threat to the U.S., and had no link to al-Qaida   urlLink Toronto Sun Columnist: Eric Margolis - The era of strategic deception                      Check out the fabulous op-ed by Mark Morford.  Here's a snip: ******** You know it's time for a serious change when the president of the United States actually mutters the infantile, instantly infamous line, 'Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we. They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we,' just after finishing phonetically spelling out his name, in his favoritest red crayon, on yet another budget-reaming $417 billion defense-spending bill.  And you know it's time for a change when not a single one of the rigid and spiritually curdled military yes men standing around the ceremonial signing table, those sad automatons with their wooden smiles and stiff spines and bone-dry souls, not one broke into a hysterical bout of sad, suicidal laughter, followed by uncontrolled wailing and the rending of flesh and the muttering of oh my freaking God what the hell is this man doing as leader of the free world.   You know it's time for a change when you hear that Kerry and Edwards both wrote their own riveting, galvanizing acceptance speeches at the Democratic National Convention, heartfelt and effective rhetoric that gives you hope not for the quality of polished oratory but for genuine, refreshing political intellect, and verbal acumen, as you offer deep thanks that at least some politicians can still speak coherently and cogently without mangling the goddamn language at every adjectival clause.   Whereas you just know Dubya isn't capable of writing a single word of his own speeches, and will employ entire squadrons of lackeys to do it for him at the RNC, and will regardless still insist on mispronouncing 'nukuler' and ''Murka' and 'terrist' and 'gin bender at Yale,' and will doubtlessly say something like, 'We must stamp out evil in all its forms because evil wants to do evil things to us and evil don't know the depths of its own, uh, evilnesses. Praise Jesus.'   ****** It gets to the heart of why I'm personally disgusted with W. He's incompetent to lead a prayer circle, much less the US.   urlLink Time To Get Out The Bush / How do you know it's time for a major change in American leadership? Let us count the signs                      Bush has a serious problem with the NAACP and it's HIS problem.   1. He blows off the annual convention, the first president who's refused to attend a single convention during his 4-year term.  2. Then he decides to be insulting. To quote the article in the Chicago Tribune, 'There are a lot of people I admire in the NAACP,' Bush said. But he added, 'I describe my relationship with the current leadership as basically non-existent because of their rhetoric.'  Ok...Mr. Bush name one person. C'mon.... you can do it. We're waiting.... Uh huh...I thought so.   W has employed the old, 'The group is ok, but the leadership is lousy' canard when dissing a long-established African American social justice organization. He makes himself transparent when he says, 'there are a lot of people..'  BTW: This is also the same weekend that Bush endorsed the Federal Marriage Amendment, which would ban 'gay-marriages' in the US.   What a bigot!    urlLink Chicago Tribune | Bush criticizes NAACP leaders          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
