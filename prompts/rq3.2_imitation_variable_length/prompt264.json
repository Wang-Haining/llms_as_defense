OMG!  sunday was booty...family day..yeah..but monday was fun because me and alysia went to mall and what not for some much needed bonding time.  o m g.......tuesday..wow some funny stuff happened on that day which i won't forget for awhile...so jul came over and we went to the corner store and then to her house and jumped on the tramp for awhile avec po. then we dedcided to go for another walk which led us to this playground kinda near my house in..duh duh dum-cheektowaga!! lol newyas so we wwere there just chillin on the tire swing when this creepy little  boy just came out of the shadows. it was evident that he was a litle slow so we decided to be nice to him...but then he like assaulted me and rubbed alysia's sandals on his penis!! he was like'i rubbed them on my penis' and like wouldn't get off of me...then he goes up to a dawg and is like will u marry me? and tries to take her class ring off of her finger....we decided that this was an opportune moment to depart...but the little bastard kung fu gripped jul's arm and was like 'YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE-DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM?' we were so scared so i went to jul's rescue and we ran home away from that scary little boy....we think that he escaped from this group home a few houses away from the park...but just imagine if he had been older!  wednesday i saw spiderman with cara...man i love her soooo much and i hope she knows it...it was pretty good.  today i went to darien lake with cara meryl and courtney who i hadn't seen in a really long time...i miss her alot and i looove her 2!!! we went kayaking haha meryl but had to leave early cause cara had a softball game and i had cheerleading which felt like it was 4 hours long even tho it was only a little over 2....me and tracy kept getting yelled at but alysia always yells at me lol  meg left tuesday.... i miss her lots but apparently shes coming home early cause ehr cousin is being a fool?...however i wouldn't know because that loser meg didn't call me....jkizzle meg i love u!  yah know what else? these past few days have been really good for me...yah know why? I HAVEN'T BEEN HOME!!!i've been kinda busy!! lol how pathetic...my mom keeps calling me like fat but has she looked in the mirror? i blame all the self esteem issues i have and will have on her because i don't ever get picked on by my friends.....grrrrrrrr mother grrrrr  i miss the lunch bunch......emmmy you have to call me!!!!!!!!!!! i lost my directory!!  well will and grace is on so i'm out like a fetus at planned parenthood. xoxox Ari-holy shit this is long                    so this is the second time im writing today because the first time it didnt publish for some reason. alot of shit has been going on lately, so i think that this is a good way to vent. its seems like my life is out of my control. the only thing that keeps me sane is dancing...but sometimes i think im not that good....so whats the point? i dunno i feel like my studdio is holding me back from being the best dancer i can be....but i guess if i keep loving to do it it will all be ok.   So i honestly have no idea what happened to my realtionship with my mom. we used to be so close and we used have such a good relationship? what the hell happened. ever since i started school it seems like she doesnt wanna let me grow or experience new things...and i want to have new friends. she doesnt trust me and she thinks im just gonna drink and smoke and have sex. but i wont. lately we cant be in  a room with each other for more than five minutes without yelling at each other or getting into a fight. i think she hates me, in fact i kno she does cuase shes told me enough times. it seems she'll do anything to make me miserable and i dont kno what i did, except not take her shit. i love her...i truly do..but our relationship is deteriorating before my eyes and it seems theres absolutley nothing i can do about it.   Don't get me wrong i still love all my friends from my old school: cara sarah courtney po ryan jacob and nikki. for a while me and cara were drifting but were cool now thank god, shes one of my bestest friends. i kno u guys care about me and ill always love you.    I just really like change...but sometimes its not a good thing.....today i read meryl's journal and i wasnt mentioned in it at all....i havent realized how long its been since we've hung out. i miss her..but things have been so different since our stupid 'drama' and i dont know how to fix it....i love chs and the people there but sometimes i cant tell...i just wish people werent so fake.     lately ive been so annoyed with a particular person i cant take it anymore nad i dont know how long ill last before i just flip out. this person is just so god damn sensitive i have no idea how to say anything...and how can u tell someone to just buzz off when youve known them for so long and they consider you their best friend?     School has been insane. exams are coming up. there must be something wrong with me because i studied for so long for one geometry test and i still got a 69. fuck. a good number, yes, but not for a test. people have such high expectations of me. its just been really hard for me to pretend to be happy lately, and i think maybe people have started to notice.     Today i did nothing but homework and sleep. it seems like i could sleep for ten days and maybe no one would no the difference. maybe i could wake up and everything would be perfect again....but i doubt that could ever happen....and why do guys play games? i guess ill never kno      To all my close friends dont even worry bout me....i just really needed to vent...this is exactly what i needed.....its really hard for me to open up to people, and when i do im constantly worried about the fact that theyll say something or think differently of me....i really needed to just lay it all out.....i dont care anymore.....people knowing how i feel is important to me...                        this week has been crazy but fun i love katie and justine!! this week is going to be just as crazy tuesday is my only free day cause i have cheer camp wed-sun so i have to skip a day of ub for that shit!!  but it should be alrite and oi love the 90s is on 2morro!! then camping with cara emmy and meggie next week!! yesterday i saw kate in rocky horrow picture show with alysia and connor and jack was there with chris jr!! bleh ick but kates so cute and it was a fun play. today i had mad fun with cara j/c and goin to a lawn fete with sarah m!  this week was going so well with my mom.....we didn't fight...but today she just went [psycho again...i know wut causes it...she's unhappy with my dad so she takes it out on me and alysia....we can't take it anymore...i want to go live with my unvle in wisconsin when he was in town i was happy....yesterday me and alsia joked about how we were going to have to go to counseling because of her shit..her constant screaming and flipping out about nothing...i can't even talk about the rest of it...so i have a psycho mother and a father who doesn't care cause he is half in the bag constantly....what does that leave me?  meryl left for camp 2day...i dunno....she didnt even come to say good bye...and then she kinda blew me off on the phone...i feel like im just like a second rate friend to her...she made her journal friends only.....whatever..  i miss meggie!! camping should be fun....meg call me when yah get home! emmy i love u!! cara u already know u my girl man (lol!) stay away from rapist eric  love always Ari         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
