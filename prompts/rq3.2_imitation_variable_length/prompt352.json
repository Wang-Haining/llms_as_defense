The thing about it is that we don't have HBO. Dean was apart of this thing called Netflix. It was a pretty good deal. He found the first season of it on DVD, so we got hooked. The problem is that we had to wait almost a year to see the second season. Now I just finished watching the second season, and how long will I have to wait for season 3 to come out on DVD? This is what's wrong with society. We want things now, at least I do. I don't want to have to wait for anything. Instead of watching this show like a normal person, that is, one show a week throughout a season, I watched it all within a matter of a week or so. Talk about a glutton. *sigh* Anyway, it's a great show, about a family who runs a funeral home. It sounds morbid, but it's more about relationships than about actual death. Check it out, but keep in mind it's from HBO so there's sex, cursing and drugs involved.  You know I realized that all people want in this world is to be loved. It's all I want. I want to feel special and loved. I like to be liked by others. I like to make people happy. The other day I bought a homeless man a bottle water, and I felt bad I didn't get him something to eat. I felt so sorry for him. It was probably close to a 100 that day, and he looked like he could use something to eat. But I was at 7-11, and it didn't occur to me to get something other than water for him. I wonder how people let their lives get to that point. Does he have a drug or alcohol problem? Did his family throw him out? Does he have a family? What would be the one thing he would want to do over? What would be the one thing I would want to do over? I haven't lived that long, but I do have some regrets. Maybe not regrets per se, but more like missed opportunities. I know one thing that I wish I could change about myself....I wish I had more guts. I wish I had learned how to stand up for myself. I blame that on my step-father, a man who always shot me down. Maybe it's just who I am. Do I really let people walk over me, or am I just being nice? It's a fine line.  I know this is suppose to be my journal, but I think I have revealed too much. Now my soul is out there to be read by you all. Well, be nice and think nice thoughts. I actually like this whole idea of a blog. You know, some really cool people have blogs. Yup, it's true! :)  Take care dear blog, till morning........      Today Seren and I went to the park. We went in the evening, when it was cool. Plus, I had to work in the morning. The whole time we were there I stayed by Seren so that she would not fall. She had a serious fall one time, and I like to stay close to her. Then I was looking around and noticed that no other moms stayed so close to their children. I started to worry. Am I smothering Seren? Is she going to think that she can't do anything on her own? I didn't stop her from doing anything, but I did stay behind her so that she didn't fall. After worrying about that, Seren and I strolled over to a different area. We then saw a little boy fall down, and he fell pretty hard. The mom waited before comforting him, then the dad said, 'It's okay, walk it off. Is there any blood? No, then go play'. I couldn't believe my ears. I didn't think that men really said that to boys. Then I started to wonder if Seren were a boy, would I stay behind her like I do? Would I comfort a boy like I comfort Seren? I don't know....just something to think about.   Today I had someone tell me that I should be a Children's Librarian. That was the 4th person in a week. I don't know about that. But then again, what am I going to do with this degree that shall be mine soon?! Just one more %#*@ing class!!!! Please pray I have the smarts and time to pass it. *Sigh* You know what I would like to do is teach a parenting class to teens. They could really benefit from something like that.   Well, Leno is almost on.......and I need some beauty sleep (no comments from the peanut gallery).       ....Jepoardy!    &nbsp;  I was talking with my aunt this evening, and we began talking about Jepoardy. If you even know how to turn the tv on, then you should know about the guy who is on a winning streak. He makes all of us look dumb. I think he has won enough money. And if he says that he needs more, let me send him my address. I could use some money. I have bills up the wazoo! I could use a good $5000. Oh, I'm in debt more than that (thank you student loans), but 5 grand will get me caught up with other little bills, and I can put $100. or 2 aside for a rainy day. :) I should do what that one kid did. I think some kid put his name on the internet looking for sponsers for college. Hey, can I have a sponser for life? I'm willing to wear Nike for the rest of my life. Heck, my daughter already has a pair of Nike sandals (and she's not even 2 yet). They were only $20.00, and I bought them back in April or May,&nbsp;and they still fit. Barely.     &nbsp;  Anyway, the guy still won.    \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
