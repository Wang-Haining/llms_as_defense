Considering it was their FIRST EVER Final they did pretty good.  Anyway, enough of all that, Lisa spent a grand total of £500 (shock horror)...on 2 pairs of shoes, 3 dresses & nice handbag (also some lacy undies ;)).  OZONE - Dragost Din Tei (got to be my fave song today and yesterday too it seems)# Metallica - Sanitarium  (hell cool song, get it) Metallica - Fade To Black (song for the moment) Camel - Stationary Traveller (if you need to relax or practice your guitar skills this is for you) Barenaked Ladies - Another Postcard (Chimpanzees)  (a must for a good laugh) C&C Red Alert - Hell March (too cool for it's own good)  Here are a few Lyrics to inspire you...  Life it seems, will fade away Drifting further every day Getting lost within myself Nothing matters no one else I have lost the will to live Simply nothing more to give There is nothing more for me Need the end to set me free  Things are not what they used to be Missing one inside of me Deathly lost, this can't be real Cannot stand this hell i feel Emptiness is filling me To the point of agony Growing darkness taking dawn I was me, but now he's gone  No one but me can save myself, but it's too late Now i can't think, think why i should even try  Yesterday seems as though it never existed Death greets me warm, now i will just say good-bye    PS: I love you Jess!!! Ant                 Well, I was playing Kings of Chaos until today.&nbsp; One of my officers deserted me to join my enemy.&nbsp; If that is how friends treat me then I don't want any.&nbsp; It's not just that sghe deserted, but she had to rub my nose in it, that was not nice, not nice at all.&nbsp; Right now I do not care about anything, life sucks, love sucks, everything sucks.  &nbsp;  It is at times like these that I get out my boxing gloves and beat the living hell out of my bag again.&nbsp; I am not going to, i'm just going to bathe in the anger, in the hatred for my fellow human beings.&nbsp; Why can't people be honest about things?&nbsp; What I wanted yesterday I no longer want, and what I want today I won't want tomorrow.  &nbsp;  SOil - Obsession  SOil - Love Hate Game  PanterA - I'm Broken  Godsmack - I Stand Alone  Ozzy Osbourne - Suicide Solution  Puff Daddy &amp; Faith - I'll Be Missing You  Linkin Park - Lying From You  KoRn - Falling Away From Me  Metallica - Fade To Black  Metallica - Sanitarium  Our Lady Peace - Life    urlLink http://www.hotornot.com/r/?eid=GRS8BSE&amp;key=TMV                        Even though it feels like I am fighting a constant uphill battle - I am still determined to make this work - decisions have been made now I just need to find a way to make them happen - I won't give up now I have already done so much to start this & love is helping to keep the dream alive.  Behold the heart of mine in flames A top the highest mountain Below the darkest depths In the valley of hate I wander My frost bitten heart is set ablaze, set ablaze  Ravage my soul Plunder my mind Branded by thunder, fire and ice  Trampled in fury by hordes of the light I am crushed by the hand of my sky My sky has forsaken me  Rivers of crimson lead me now Trail of fire In a place of fire eternal Left in flames  Scattered in a world of thorns Torn from my earthly self Aggrieved in tears and bitterness I fall beyond stars, beyond stars  Ravage my soul Plunder my mind Branded by thunder, fire and ice Trampled in fury by hordes of the light My fiery heart is stronger than ever It's stronger than ever before  My heart in flames  In Flames   The air tastes just like you, it's the smell of june A sensory shock that jolts my spirit, i slowly swallow you A spray of little droplets, a fragrance so refined The spirit of nostalgia is passing me by  Opium and poison, jasmine and rose Dream of ambrosia, all flavours glow, it's sensual,it's sensual, sensual  It all began so easy, with you on the floor Against your willing flanks and knocking down your door Until the day it crumbled, no game of win and lose You told me nothing, you left me confused  Expelled like poison, a trim of the dose, A limb disposed of, in a whim she chose,so rigorous,she's vigorous  She's vigorous,  Heart of the hardest world, it's just the thought of you All those variations, the air is full of you The smell of summer rain, once more the scent of june This sweet concentration ,brings me back to you Opium and poison My taste of june, my taste of you Inhale, inhale your trail Opium and poison, jasmine and rose, dream of escape with me, all flavours go, It's sensual, it's sensual, it's sensual  What was ours will drift away, a simple breeze on a humid day  Oh, nothing lasts, nothing lasts, forever   Clan of Xymox - Jasmine & Rose                        I wish I could breath, I wish I could stand.  I wish I had a chance here holding your hand.  Wish I could speak, I wish could talk  I wish I could breath   Since the first day, I was alive,  I feared we would meet here in the misty outside  I wanted to run, I wanted to hide  I wish I could breath   I fear I can't over come this place  I know your face, your hands  I wish I could breath.   I feel a chill deep in my bones,  Nothing can heal, the way my blood moans.  Nothing can quench, My bitter thirst  I wish I could breathe.   I grasp at my heart, That burns in my chest,  It's your precious art, That makes my soul stressed.  I run short of blood, light headed I swoon.  I wish I could breathe.  Breathe - Abney Park     There is no need of words when pain can be felt in every song - they are superfluous - although I did almost choose Trapped Under Ice.     Life it seems, will fade away  Drifting further every day  Getting lost within myself  Nothing matters no one else  I have lost the will to live  Simply nothing more to give  There is nothing more for me  Need the end to set me free   Things are not what they used to be  Missing one inside of me  Deathly lost, this can't be real  Cannot stand this hell I feel  Emptiness is filling me  To the point of agony  Growing darkness taking dawn  I was me, but now He's gone   No one but me can save myself, but its too late  Now I can't think, think why I should even try  Yesterday seems as though it never existed  Death Greets me warm, now I will just say good-bye   Fade to Black - Metallica                          The prey of the beast screamed Bloody murder The line is so fine between Hoping and hurting Former believers they beg for release As love looking down on them Smiles and picks his teeth Trapped in between heaven and hell He knows all the secrets And don’t want to tell There’s nowhere to run and there’s Nowhere to hide Love knows you all too well He will find you  Love is the ghost haunting your head Love is the killer you thought Was your friend Love is the creature who lives In the dark Sneaks up, will stick you And painfully pick you apart  Love is a poet, love sings the songs Pointing his finger you follow along Voice are calling, The monster wants out of you Paws you and claws you, you try not to fall  Love is the leech, sucking you up Love is a vampire, drunk on your blood Love is the beast that will Tear out your heart Hungrily lick it and Painfully pick it apart  Love is a ghost, haunting your head Love is the killer you thought Was your friend Love is the teacher who lives in the dark Sneak up and stick you And painfully pick you apart    Concrete Blonde - The Beast                       Desire: known by many different names and manifestations   -    admiration, ambition, appetite, ardor, aspiration, attraction, avidity, concupiscence, covetousness, craving, craze, cupidity, devotion, doting, eagerness, fancy, fascination, fervor, fondness, frenzy, greed, hankering, hunger, inclination, infatuation, itch, lasciviousness, lechery, libido, liking, longing, love, lust, mania, motive, need, passion, predilection, proclivity, propensity, rapaciousness, rapture, ravenousness, relish, salacity, solicitude, thirst, urge, voracity, will, wish, yearning  The one thing it is not is always sexual....the longing to live a life of happiness, the rapture of a goal being met, the aspiration to be a success in whatever you choose, the voracity used to attain your wants and needs, the admiration of those that have overcome all obstacles to be able to relish their thirst for life.    Love is the driving force - love for others, love for yourself, love of live, love can be pure passion and desire it can take you to heights never known before and it can drive you lower than you ever thought you could go - in the end all you have is you and the honesty that should always remain - love is not a game, love is not a weapon - love is an emotion that can rule your life and should never be given carelessly or to the unworthy  adulation, affection, allegiance, amity, amorousness, amour, appreciation, ardency, ardor, attachment, case, cherishing, crash, crush, delight, devotedness, devotion, emotion, enchantment, enjoyment, fervor, fidelity, flame, fondness, friendship, hankering, idolatry, inclination, infatuation, involvement, like, liking, lust, mad for, mash, partiality, pash, passion, piety, rapture, regard, relish, respect, sentiment, soft spot, taste, tenderness, the hots, weakness, wild for, worship, yearning, zeal  Love will feed the fire of desire and allow your passion to burn bright, hot and true.  When you feel true love for another there is no mistaking it - it is better to follow your heart and allow yourself to live then it is to stay static and always wonder what could have been. Love me forever,or not at all, End of our tether, backs to the wall, Give me your hand, Don't you ever ask why, Promise me nothing, live 'till we die,  Everything changes, Live all stays the same, Everyone guilty, no one to blame, Every way out, Brings you back to the start, Everyone dies To break somebody's heart, We are the system, we are the law, We are corruption,worm in the core, One of another, laugh'til you cry, Faith unto death or knife in the eye.

Doro Pesch and Lemmy                       Rofl....*ouch*...bloody hell - Is everyone around me giving up?  First actual communication with soon to be ex husband and I get the above - WTF? We have not even seen each other in over 2 years and only very brief phone conversations to try to get the seperation papers rolling.    Dare to live, dare to follow your heart, dare to find your path and never look back and you will have your reason to live - there is no courage in dying - choose death and you extinguish the fire within - you choose to give up - hypocrytical statement? perhaps but I lived through an attempt I should not have - I will never take my life for granted again.  I feel as though I am being put through a test of strength - why must it be now?  There are still days where I barely have strength enough to hold myself up much less everyone around me - but if I am needed I will be there if it is my tenacity that is needed by my friends and loved ones than it will always be there - I will take it from wherever I can draw it from and give what I can.  There is always hope, there is always love - there is always something to reach for.    Even in the fog of darkness I found one man - and my heart is safe in his hands as his is safe in mine.     Angel of the night In my mind you're by my side See you - wherever you are I feel you're touching my skin The time stands still just for us Without you there's no hope in my darkness  You give me the moment Which is never ending Let me feel your heart And I'll go with you to the end of this world  My angel of the night I'm forever by your side fly with me to eternity hold me in your arms and kiss me I close my eyes and dream with you Carry me so far away Never let me down and kiss me  Angel of the night Unite in one soul You lead me on the way, the way of our shadows Show me your burning desire I follow you I follow you into the garden of pleasures   Angel of the Night - Blutengel                 \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
