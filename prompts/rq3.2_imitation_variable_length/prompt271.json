Oooo that's right I changed my blog! Do you like it? I kinda got sick of the old one, even though I had it for like 2 weeks! Oh well, I like this one now.  This evening was really fun! I went to track and did a good workout.&nbsp;I did a 1000m model. A 500m, 300m, and a 200m. Pretty good pace too. 1:37, :56, :35. I'm all set to break 5! But seriosuly my coach doubts I'll break 5 this weekend cause the track is a cinder track! This sucks, cause cinder tracks are always slower. So my new goal is just to win. Who cares about the time? I just wanna kick some ass! I have to get 12's for my spikes now too. Geez. Thats like cross country style. Damn cinder tracks. Considering I wear 7's on a normal track, 12's are going to seem so long. Hahaha! Oh well, its all good. This weekend should rock!  So tonight after track Corky came over and we went to starbucks. She needed to vent after her hellish day at work. One of her kids at her daycamp was the devil! By the end of the day he had sprained her wrist and been kicked out of the camp! Oh man! We had a good time at starbucks eating cookies and drinking our mocha lattes and Strawberry frappacinos though! YUM! Good times, good times! We sat there and talked for like an hour, then I came home and now I'm here! I love how we can talk for hours and never run out of things to laugh about and make fun of. Its so great to have a best friend! The world is a very scary place without that one friend you know will never let you down. Anyways I've written in this blog WAY too much today! I'm outta here! ;)          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
