Which, of course, confused me so much cause I knew it wasn't Wednesday.  But as I woke up, I realized that it was a fantastic idea.  If it caught all of us off guard, it certainly caught all the bad guys off guard.  Paul Bremer only knew 30 minutes before we did.  In fact, I went to my normal monday meeting with the Iraqis in our area, and THEY didn't even know.  I had to tell them.  Hey, congrats.  You're in charge of your country now.  Enjoy!   They seemed all happy at first, but then, I think they realized all the things the Coalition was doing for them, they had to do now.  For themselves!  I'm pretty sure they wanted to give their soverignty back.  Lol.  Unfortunately, we're pretty sure the bad guys will still try to do lots of damage, but at least they can't impact the change in soverignty.  That's the good thing.  So, that's about all that's going on right now.  Tomorrow should be a very interesting day.  Stay tuned!  B                 With what's been going on here, I got tasked to work night checkpoint last night.  Wow, what a tedious boring shift.  I stood up in one of the guard towers and watched traffic.  Woo hoo.  I ate so many sunflower seeds it wasn't even funny.  But, it was pointed out to me that being bored is much better than the alternative.  I was so glad to get back and fall asleep.  Especially since I hadn't really slept in like 3 days.  Anyway.  So, Baghdad.  There's just this...tension right now and we're still FIVE days away from the transfer of power.  And there's not guarantee that things will calm down after that.  Some here think it's going to be just like the year 2000 thing.  Lots of freaking out before hand and absolutely nothing happens on the actual day.  I sure hope that'll be the case.  But, I can't shake the feeling that the really bad attacks are still to come.  And for the most part, it isn't even Iraqis causing all these problems.  It's these foreign fighters who are scared to death of a healthy powerful Iraq.  They will do whatever it takes to keep Iraq down and fighting with itself.  Even Al Sadr, once he talked with the Iraqi President, agreed to stand down his militia and become a political power instead of a military one.  But, we'll just have to wait and see what happens.  (I have to admit, it is pretty cool to be here at the 'birth of Iraq' and witnessing all this first hand.)  I'll keep ya'll updated.
