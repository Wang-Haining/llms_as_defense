Two-If I do attain an adminstrator position through the other candidate, I will have to clear all policy changes and additions through her.&nbsp;   Three-If I do attain administrator position with full site access, then I will require&nbsp;a temporary, but quite possibly permanent, a volunteer web coder/master (Sorry, but I'm a little low on cash at the moment.).&nbsp;   Four-Sending messages to me will require a stricter abidement when composing in sending (Again, I apologize, but I'm one of those people who get's frustrated and explodes if I get overwhelmed from being unorganized.).   Five-My time will be very limited to each site I manage, including this one.&nbsp; I will do my best to keep you all up to date with the anime/gaming world.&nbsp; Any volunteer help will be appreciated (Perhaps once I get some more cash, I can begin paying people that help, but at this point it doesn't look likely.).   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, let's get back to what I'm here for.&nbsp; Sorry guys, but nothing outstanding in the gaming world.&nbsp; As for the anime world, check this out:        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A new television station is coming soon to Cable & Satellite!
