Fortunately it was just the latest Email from  The Butt  The Bus. The PDX progs preached their usual message, then provided a link to this:   urlLink  Avoiding Federal Fiscal Catastrophe: Honest Politics and Health Care Reform .  Here's a taste:   Since Aaron was addressing a progressive audience, he took pains to point out that these projections dont allow for any increases in programs that progressives would support  subsidized child care, more low-income housing, high-speed rail, insuring the uninsured. His message was that if progressives dont want the deficit to drown out any hope for their goals, theyd better start addressing long-term problems now.  For instance, start supporting the crazy notion of self-sufficiency. The majority of the people who will be facing the 2060 federal budget haven't been born yet. Prevent them from being slack-asses and needing subsidized child care, low-income housing, and free insurance by being  parents! Now!     The audience was stunned. Essentially, Aaron was saying that we should be advocating massive tax increases just to hold onto the programs we have now. That didnt seem very appealing to anyone.   It didn't? Wait, there's a rift in the ideology here. Who's usually  for  tax hikes so that these social programs can flourish? Where is this money going to come from? The cleanup of government waste?  (Insert Nelson catchphrase here. {see update} )    But nobody disagreed with Aarons math.   That's because no one there made it past algebra. After all, college is for art and music and Marxist professors and homosexual experimentation.      She was a lonely voice, but shes obviously right. Progressives need to launch a Manhattan Project on health care cost controls. Whether its  adopting a single payer system, rationing, nationalizing the drug companies, restricting the amount of expensive machinery   whatever it is  we cannot talk about health care without talking about how the hell we are going to prevent health care costs of current programs from growing to 14%% of GDP.     single payer system  - healthy people pay as much (probably more) as 2 pack a day smokers  rationing  - 'So sorry that your cancer has returned, old chap, but that's all the therapy you are allotted. Good day.'   nationalizing the drug companies  - Yeah, I'm sure pharm R&D will stay at the current level when they no longer have any revenue.  restricting the amount of expensive machinery  - This is the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Has this idiot ever been in a hospital? 'Well, we weren't able to buy a new x-ray machine, but we can see if you have a broken bone the old fashioned way. Here, hold this piece of Radium and I'll hold the film. Madame Curie would be proud.'   The last line of this article should be over the door at the DNC:   Aarons presentation left little room for hope. But maybe we can get somewhere with rage.     Because look what rage has done for the credibility of Al Gore and Howard Dean.     Update:  urlLink click here.                    urlLink This article  got my blood pumping.   50 years ago, The Isaac Walton League set up a gun range in what was then the middle of nowhere.   Now, the area is becoming gentrified.  Some of their more histrionic new neighbors have been harassing the club in courts for years.    Didn't those newcomers notice that they were building their yuppie palaces near a shooting range? Didn't they wonder why the land was so cheap?  Perhaps they should be suing their realtors?  In the latest round of litigation,  12 of Eugene's wise citizens have awarded the neighbors 28-grand in damages, because the nearby creek  might be polluted with lead.    EVEN THOUGH NO FEDERAL, STATE, OR PRIVATE AGENCY HAS EVER FOUND ANY!!!   The Neighbor's claims have NO BASIS in science or fact.  I do hope that the club will persist through to the state level.  I am confident that they will get the judgment overturned.  Maybe they'll even recover their legal fees.  In a perfect world, one particular ambulance chaser would be disbarred.   Another way the left is undermining the second amendment is by litigating against any business that helps an ordinary citizen gain the necessary proficiency to bear arms.  We see lawsuits against manufacturers,  impossible zoning requirements for gun shops, and all sorts of bogus noise and pollution complaints against ranges.    I wonder who's next?                     So Whoopi acted like a half-drunk hack in order to drum up the I-wanna-be-an-outspoken-dreadlock-hipster-with-a-successful-acting-career crowd. Well done. We'd all like to hang out downtown at the elite coffee shop all day long, getting rich in the background. Unfortunately, sometime someone has to get off the Friends couch and WORK, otherwise nothing gets done. If there is a theme I hope to write along when talking about left-wing idiots, it's that their vain attempt to be hip supersedes their ability to make logical decisions based on previous results. That said, it's important to also remember the popular saying, 'Past performance is no guarantee of future results.' Gee, I'm starting to sound like a logical independent.     Newman took off on his fiscal policies, saying, 'I think that tax cuts for worried, wealthy thugs like me are borderline criminal,' and the notion they produce trickle-down benefits for the poor is 'rubbish.'   Hillary's income redistribution will work so much better than trickle-down theory, I'm sure. Hey Paul, I know you are a champion of charity, and I applaud you for that. But if that wealth-induced guilt is too much for ya, perhaps what would work much better than the money-sucking government programs who help no one would be a private assistance society (read: Hull House.) Be a Jane Addams philanthropist. Remember, regime change begins at home. (Man, I hate threadbares.)  Update: mmmK,  urlLink someone did this better than me . Goldberg is a decent actress IMO, but she's not funny, as pointed out by Ace Of Spades. But I beat him/her to the HW squares ref (I think).                  I took my last final Friday morning (and was too busy to blog all weekend), so I'm officially done with the 2003-2004 school year. The atmosphere in the library Friday morning was indicative of finals week; about 20 people using the computer area that accommodates 150, and work study kids behind the information desk eyeing passersby with solemn contempt ( 'Would you people hurry up and leave so that I can go DRINK already!' )Unfortunately for them, happy hour was a long way off, and a slow day was in the way - no one checks out books or needs help finding a certain journal on the last day of the school year. Well, maybe grad students. Nerds.   'The  urlLink Kelley Engineering Center  is going up quickly', I think to myself. Looking at the giant crane I was reminded of last fall, when my vector calc class was migrating to another building on campus. As we passed, we all watched this massive structure being erected by a smaller, yet still massive mobile crane. My thoughts go back to the progress of the build. There was a time when I would have considered the notion that experts -- quality thinkers and doers -- were due credit for what's been done in that amount of time. From the engineering team to the welder on the frame of the 2nd floor, these guys have a work ethic and a desire for excellence so strong that the physical evidence (the building) was the progress.  But instead, in a loathful voice I said, 'Bet the state's burning huge sums of money to get this thing done so fast.' My faith in the tireless proud worker is beaten with a stick when the state of OR gets involved.                   urlLink Burning a lumberyard  to protest deforestation and sprawl is like......well......OK I don't have a good comparison. But common sense analysis says, 'don't do anything that will cause the other side to do MORE of what you're opposed to (in this case, harvesting trees), ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE NOT WINNING, and YOU'RE THE EXTREME MINORITY!'   The ELF has targeted lumberyards in the past, claiming they contribute to ecological destruction and sprawl.  Lumberyards cause sprawl like spoons cause obesity.   In other  urlLink tree-hugging news , crews got to start 7 hours late after GreenPeas wasted resources on a shipping container.  After authorities removed three protesters locked inside and outside the shipping container to prevent its movement, loggers  hooked a chain to the back of a pickup truck  and dragged the 20-foot container to the side of the road, getting to work seven hours late on the Soukow timber sale about five miles west of Glendale (emphasis mine.)    HAH! They moved it with a pickup truck! Y'know for about the same price, you could've dumped a bunch or rock in the middle of the road; at least they would've had to use equipment (other than what the men drove to work in) to take care of it. You might've put them behind a whole day!   I wonder how many beached whales one could stuff into said container? Or how many pounds of Little Lisa's Fish Slurry one would hold?                   urlLink Barbie is damaging to American girls with her materialistic ways  - you've heard this before. While I agree with the anti-Barbie crowd (to a very limited extent) that she could use a little smartnin' up sometimes, this stickery article reflects the local tone toward, well, frankly, what we'll call 'an American toy'.    So what's on Barbie's mind these days?  The November election? Holes in the ozone? Stephen Hawking's recent reversal on subatomic theory?   Well, these  are  all things on the minds of most 5 year old girls in America.   Nope - she's looking for just the right pair of floral-design pumps.   Girls buying shoes! What next!?   A wonderfully shameless display of cross-branding is one thing. But a Barbie who pigeonholes girls in an antiquated stereotype?   Young slender women at the mall carrying bags is now a stereotype, says the guy whose ideals probably include the loathing of any center of commerce.     'How do you spell 'ugh'?' asked Debbie Newman, a stand-up comic in Eugene. 'But what are you going to do? That's what advertisers tell little girls they want: Little boys want to play with guns and little girls want to play with makeup. It's just not letting  women  be as much as they can be.'   Any 'women' who purchase and play with this doll have  this doll  to blame for their lack of success in life. Got it. Please continue.    But Newman, an office manager with Schnitzer Steel, would rather see the toy company introduce 'Office Manager' Barbie.  'She'd be just crabby all the time,' Newman said. 'And outside her little Barbie office would be 17 people lined up needing something from her.'   She'd be crabby, indicating that 5 year olds should carry that attitude, while being as much as they can be. If Barbie's life sucks as an office manager, could I suggest Barbie Community College? Moving on.    'Mayor Barbie,' the doll dreamed up by Kitty Piercy, 62-year-old nominee for the post in Eugene.   Piercy, although absent the shopping gene, said she's OK with shopping Barbie ... as just one manifestation of the countless roles that women play in society.  'I'd like to see 'President Barbie,' ' she said. 'I'd like to see Barbies in different sizes, shapes and colors, Barbies of different ages - and there's no limitation to what a Barbie can be or do.'   Because every kid wants 'Golden Age Barbie'. Hey Kitty, how about pro-choice Barbie? I won't go into a description, I just can't do it. All I'll say is, abdomen made of pliable material.  This  is how you spell 'UGH'. I can't believe I'm posting this.     Sally Sheklow, a 53-year-old founding member of the Eugene women's comedy troupe, WYMPROV!, said 'Improv Barbie' would have 'a belly and a butt and hips, nipples.'  'Improv Barbie' would use props and shop the garage sales, not ALDO, Sheklow said. Above all else, she would enjoy free license to speak her mind ... for laughs.  'She could get away with saying anything about the need for regime change without fear of repercussion,' Sheklow said, 'because she'd be a comic.'   Because we know all Barbie can say now is:  I wish they taught shopping in school! Let's bake some cookies for the boys! Don't ask me, I'm just a girl. Let's buy makeup so the boys will like us. Now low let's forget our troubles with a big bowl of strawberry ice cream! (episode 1F12)  Too bad Barbie wouldn't be calling for regime change, that 'regime''s ideals made her a household name.   I guess all I have to do is proclaim my status as a comic, to avoid the 'Wrath-croft' of the government.  (Yeah, g'head and use it.)          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
