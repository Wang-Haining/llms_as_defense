On Wednesday, she sold her Pontiac Grand Prix for $2000, which isn't so bad considering in my opinion, it needs a new radiator.  So yesterday, she stopped down in Madison to a local car dealership and bought a '99 black Dodge Intrepid.  It is a very nice looking car and it runs great with 85,000 miles on it.  She picked it up for $5,200.  Now for the 'downs.'  Katie works at the local Dairy Queen, passing her time until I can get out of school so she can do her thing at cosmetology school in Minnesota.  She deals with a lot of wackos everyday, and I usually hear about it, until a couple of days ago when a really weird guy showed up in the drive thru.  This guy shows up at the drive thru window with a porn mag in the passenger seat, opened up to a centerfold.  This is no Playboy magazine, but one of the more 'hard core' magazines where a person can usually see a woman's kidneys through an opening in her body (kidding).  This has happened two days in a row to Katie and rightfully so, she became a little worried.  This guy has been telling Katie stories about driving to Salem (to a strip club) and trying to kick guys out of town so he has a shot at some of the ladies who live there.  This guy is also employed within the city limits of Madison, and he's been going around telling guys there had he likes 'younger women,' and actually told our landlord's son who works there about how some of the girls who work at Dairy Queen are 'hot.'  Katie told our landlord's wife about it and wouldn't you know -- the stories matched.  Katie's all freaking out, so she is now locking the doors to our house and since I will be gone this weekend in Spencer, IA, she will be staying with her parents.  The Madison Police Department has been notified about this little pervert, and they're on the lookout for him.  Katie really didn't want it to turn into this because she is afraid it'll get back to her that she's saying stuff about the whole situation.  I told her that she shouldn't worry too much about it, but on the other hand it would be a good idea to keep the doors locked and be on the lookout for the guy at all costs.  I'm sure this little situation will blow over, but for right now, we're taking it a little seriously right now.                       It was a bleak outlook on Ryan's situation going into Pocono.  Rains had poured upon the north-eastern part of Pennsylvania and practice was limited for Ryan and the rest of the Mobil 1/ALLTEL team.  Ryan only got one practice in, and that was Friday morning before qualifying.  Ryan ended up qualifying 30th (one of his worst starting positions) and the practices were scrubbed for Saturday due to rain.  In the beginning of the race, Ryan was having problems with the handling of his race car.  He would shuffle back in forth in the 30's, then pitting for an adjustment and tires, then pitted early again when he thought he had a flat tire.  During a restart, when Ryan was a lap down, Ryan started in the lead lap line, and was black flagged and had to take a drive-thru penalty.  Cripes -- two laps down.  Finally, the car came around.  Ryan benefitted from the 'Lucky Dog' rule, when there's a caution, the first car a lap down or more will get a lap back.  Ryan got back on the lead lap and made the charge forward to finish 13th.  Overall, a stressful day.  Ryan was in 10th place in the points, only 100 ahead of Jeremy Mayfield.  There will be 6 more races until the cut-off, when the Top 10 in points will move to 'The Chase for the Championship,' starting at Richmond.  Ryan looked at danger throughout most of the day, especially when Mayfield had a great car, finishing Top 10, and if Ryan would have finished 30th or worse, his lead over 11th place would be cut from 100 to 40.  But there were so many cars in the Top 10 that had problems, like Kevin Harvick (engine overheated), Kurt Busch (tranmission), Bobby Labonte (crash) and Tony Stewart (crash).  Ryan ended up moving to the 8th spot in the standings, but still maintains a 100-point lead over the 11th place person, Mayfield.  It's a confusing point system at times, but it'll make for some exciting racing for the last ten races.  Next week, the Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis.  The Crown Jewel Race for the Summer.  Ryan placed 11th there last year after started 2nd.  Harvick won the race.                       We all know by now that Dolphins running back Ricky Williams retired.&nbsp; Eh, so what.&nbsp; The guy really wasn't right in the head anyway.  I'll give it up to Ricky anyway.&nbsp; He had the NCAA D-I record for rushing yards until Ron Dayne (Wisconsin) broke it, played a couple of mediocre years in New Orleans until he was traded to Miami.&nbsp; Five seasons of pro ball -- that's it!  But, I could care less.&nbsp; We Viking fans are used to it -- Robert Smith leaving after having tremendous seasons, but that was understandable, having 4 knee operations and puking all over the field.&nbsp; The only shock to me was when Barry Sanders retired, who in my opinion, is the best running back EVER to play in the NFL.  Good ol' Barry had some comments about Ricky leaving the game, saying something like 'we haven't seen the last of Ricky.'&nbsp; I was kind of taken aback by this.&nbsp; Barry was only like 1,500 yards away from breaking Walter Payton's old rushing record (now surpassed by Emmitt Smith) and he walked away with millions of dollars offered to him by the Detroit Lions.&nbsp; Why couldn't Barry come back, even under the new GM leadership of Matt Millen?&nbsp; So what gets Barry off, spouting that Ricky could make a return?&nbsp; Only that he's played 5 years?  It's a dead argument.&nbsp; Barry is never coming back, in fact, he's going to Canton.&nbsp; Adios, Ricky -- I could care less!                        Some of you may know what Crash Productions is.&nbsp; For those you don't ... here's a 'crash' course.   Crash Productions, Inc. is a little company that I incorportated in 2003, in which whatever I produce visually -- it falls under that company.&nbsp; If I were ever to make any movies some day, they would all be viewed under that banner, Crash Productions, Inc.   I also have a subsidiary called Crash Publications, Inc.&nbsp; This is for all my stories, or simply anything written down by myself (or others) would fall under this company.  I'm simply doing this just in case if I actually wanted to publish something.&nbsp; You could say this blog here belongs to myself and to Crash Publications, Inc.&nbsp; All of my home movies, or anything that I created with the computer visually would be under Crash Productions, Inc.  My future plans are this:&nbsp; I want to buy a new computer, preferrably a Sony Vaio -- which has to have a good movie program and a DVD burner.&nbsp; The reason why I chose Sony is because of the compatibility with other Sony components, like a Sony Handycam or a Sony Cybershot digital camera.&nbsp; Also, the Vaio can have a VCR hooked up to it, importing an analog signal and transferring it to a digital signal, which makes the images or motion pictures easy to deal with -- as in creating movies.  I can tell you that I have several tapes with home movies, whether it is the Dawson Road Trip, The New Year's Bash of '96, or all of the footage of The Owl Garden.&nbsp; I have created highlight tapes in the past just using a VCR alone, but with a computer, I can start all over -- have digital sound and have better transitions to the motion captured.  My future project is this:&nbsp; an Owl Garden documentary, like a 5th or 10th anniversary type of thing.&nbsp; As far as I know, The Owl Garden has existed since '93 or '94, and we've got tons of footage, either from Mike's old camera or mine.&nbsp; With that, make a whole new DVD with new music, interviews from the basketball players themselves, and so on.  I am a man of history and I have to say for all of the players who played at The Owl Garden, those memories will not fade.&nbsp; The competitiveness, the comraderie, and more importantly the friendships made on that grass-and-dirt court are there to stay.&nbsp; It's my mission, along with a few others, to make the memories live on because we simply cannot go back to the past and re-live them again.           \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
