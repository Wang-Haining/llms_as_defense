  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic:\n\n       right now I should be studying for a math test I have to take in two weeks. Ugh, I hate math. This is why I am boring you all to tears on the computer, so I can put off studying.  right now the dog is barking incessantly at the movers next door.  right now I am considering a muzzle.  right now I am also doing laundry, such a multi tasker I am, laundry, contemplation of dog-icide, procrastination of math studying, typing, boring my friends...  right now I am cursing whoever made downloading photos so damn complicated.  right now I am wishing I would have paid more attention to those godawful computer classes they made us take in high school.  right now I am wondering who will read this crap.  right now I really don't care.  right now I am thinking how strange it is that I have two close friends at 721 iron st and they probably don't even know that they are there together.  right now I am looking at the clock thinking I have 3 hours left before I have to go to work  math and work. Ugh.  right now I gotta get a life                 tonight kinda sucked. I didn't make much money and my customers were high maintenance. People should have to wait tables for one week out of every year to remind them what it is like. For god's sake man! If I walk past your table every five minutes to pour you more water, don't say 'nah I am fine' 15 times and then two minutes later say belligerently 'miss! can I get some water!' It is just rude, sorry. And for the love of god, if you need separate checks, tell me before I print out and bring the check. Is this really difficult to do or something?  ok I will stop ranting. (but really, it sucked.)  Seriously i am a better waitress then I anticipated. no really!   I miss my friends when I am working alot. that's the bitch about cell phones, when you are working, take a smoke break and check your voicemail, and you get  this  message:          'So, (insert any friend's name here) and (other friends}    are ,like, headed to (any random, yet cool, interesting destination). Wanna go?  To which my response is one of these three things:  1)sorry(random friend)no cash whatsoever   2)I wish, but it would take me at least two days to get there                       or  3)no response at all because i used up my breaktime listening to my voicemail           Such is life.  I am taking a mini vacation next weekend to the coast. Nothing fancy, just a little road trip. I will post some pictures for sure. I'm getting tired, and if you are still awake after reading this post, you must have had to much caffeine today.  And yet, she goes on ladies and gentlmen!   Please dont think you  have  to read this thing, i post mainly to keep my own journal, but you are welcome to read it.  Audience groans, why didn't you say so?  Also please gracefully ignore spelling, punctuation, grammar, or capitalization discrepencies. (Side note: if you are someone i dont know reading this, i am married to a copyright lawyer who is a bodybuilder and i have a dozen pitbulls.. with lazer guns on their forheads. ...oh yeah, and a moat with leeches and alligators.. with nightvision! yeah.)  Now that ya'll have read the disclaimer..   You are allowed to stop reading now, it can only get worse.                      Day three we woke up late haha and checked out the birdwatching board walk we had the place to ourselves for a while, which was cool. on the path going into the marsh we encountered this:      urlLink    scary!&nbsp; urlLink     as you can see we were a bit nervous. well i was and BF was hamming it up for the camera... so we figured hell-forget the birds, we were going alligator watching!        urlLink    waiting for the elusive blue figit&nbsp; urlLink     we didnt see any. we saw a few birds, egrets, one little guy with red dots on his wings, and a lot of pelicans. pelicans are such throwbacks.  they look like something from jurassic park. and they are camera shy.  then we chilled at the beach for a little while and we went surfing...  urlLink    not.&nbsp; urlLink    when we got back to the motel, BF was struck with the notion of staying another day, i said, hell-lets just not go back! (i always say that) we made a few calls and found out that the weather in the city was bad anyway and the forcast for day four was bleak, but the day after would be nice. well... you wouldnt have us riding back in the rain would you?? BF got his shift covered, mine wasnt an issue since i took a few extra days off. excitement renewed, we were gonna stay another day!!!! then we went to a nice dinner because i needed an excuse to wear my red platforms  urlLink    note the shoes...&nbsp; urlLink    we passed on seafood becuz BF iisnt a fan, and went to this great mexican place...it was sooooo good. they had over 60 tequilas, but we were now on a 'staying-an-extra-day' budget, so we didnt partake. this outing was my first attempt at riding a motorcycle with a dress and heels. easier than you might think! later we watched more cable !!!!!  i love discovery channel!  Day four we slept untill 2pm, hit the beach insearch of sand dollars, no luck, but we now have a ton of shells. (ok, maybe not a ton...) then we went on a casino cruise. (yes! another excuse to dress up!)(i'm such a dork) here is the boat:   urlLink    texas treasure&nbsp; urlLink    we got buffet dinner with the cruise tickets, very yummy. it was strange to see how fine dining works. i felt out of place. oh well fuck it. once we hit international waters... let the shameless gambling begin! we only had 40 bucks each to spend, but we decided to make it last on the quarter slots. we started out good. then we found out that BF is not an ocean person. poor guy, i mean he didnt get seasick, but i could tell he didnt feel good. but, trooper that he is he gambled to the end... of the money that is  we didnt win squat.  urlLink    boo hoo, we didnt win!&nbsp; urlLink          urlLink    what? i didnt win??&nbsp; urlLink     Day five the way back was smooth sailing, hot and sunny the whole way. i hope you enjoyed the vacation account stay tuned for photos of my birthday get together! till next time         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
