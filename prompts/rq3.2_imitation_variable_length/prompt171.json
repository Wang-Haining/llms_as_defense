As for other stuff, everything is very ..urm in between ok and shit, I am not as busy as I make it it sound sometimes, because I don't work that hard on my projects these days, but I'm just so mentally exhausted, I cant seem to do much anymore, I'm fed up...well not to say fed up...but maybe just a frustrated with people around me, people I love, people I care about.... It's not that they did anything, I guess I just need a break away, somewhere by myself, away from family, friends and everyone else around me, I devote so much time and effort into satisfying everyone..that in the end it does the opposite, and makes everyone uncomfortable, I want my independence, I want a steady regular sleeping pattern, I want to be able to wake up at 6am everyday and feel great, like I used to when I was 17, I want to be inspired again, I used to hate sleeping and I used to wake up early and start drawing and going swimming and so on, and now its odd, that I have or am on my way to getting the things I always wanted so badly, I feel the exact opposite =/ I don't get it, no amount of coffee or guarana energy drinks is gona heal my tiredness now.....a break, that's all, Not having to think about anything for at least a week, but then Id have a limit to that ! heh... I don't know I'm loosing my chain of thought now..                 Today is not a good day, me and my dad came close to dying in a car crash, but I will go back a bit more, first I put all my college work aside so I can spend some time with my Carly, (precious as always) and more time for some casual work that I do for Film and Tv as an extra, So anyway Im out Friday night I come home at around 4am I rest for a bit, without much sleep at all I just pack my bag and leave for work, the time now is a little over 5:AM, So my dad decides to wake up before the sun is out and give me a lift, what a great guy, I was going to drive, but two things 1: I have my Learner's licence =( ( I know it's sick for a 20year old ) and 2: I was still a little drunk :/ ...so we are coming close to our destination, and I have my head resting on the passenger's side and all of the sudden I tilt my head back up and I notice my dad is doing about 80 k's an hour, going through a RED light and a giant Petrol truck comes from the left road turning into the main road and I scream 'DAD, RED LIGHT' and he breaks, the car swerves and leaves a nice big burnout mark on the road, we are only a couple of metres away from the truck with the car smelling of burnt rubber, then we realise that we have got to stay awake, at 5am..DAMMM I was a little freaked out, but stranger things have happened, anyhow I get there and I slowly sip back about 4 coffes over 2 to 3 hours while Im watching the sunrise and waiting for the film crew to get everyone ready to do their shit, then the rest is details just Cut...Go..blah blah you know how it works, for about 6 to 7 hours, So im having a hangover, havent slept and still tired from working on my college work all freakin week and what happens?...I get lost, I never been in this area before, so it only takes me about 35 minutes to find a near by train station, So I practicly fall asleep, and all of the sudden I start to feel like crying, I was feeling odd, It wasn't like normal crying I was just having a little panic attack or something, lucky for me the train came and I made it through the way home, by now all the caffeine I had during the day starts to kick in and I decide to do my work for college and have a chat to Carly online, It is now 10:30pm as I am writing this, I have only slept an hour and a half today, and im feeling very depressed, but in a small mellow way, any bad feeling is an ok feeling when your at home, I think so, The next 3 weeks are going to be alot busier then this, I hope I can survive till the holidays, It would also help If I was doing ok at college :/, I just haven't been able, to put enough time and effort into it lately, I have been focusing my time on people around me, and earning money, as I am broke. Someone in my street saw me running to the train station at 7am a few days ago and screamed out 'Stop trying to please everyone' and I have been thinking about that since, and I guess that is the reason I am home now instead of being at another 21st birthday party of a college friend, So after I finish publishing this, Im probably going to hit the bed, I have so many thoughts, so many new views, another time for change is coming and I can feel it, so let's see how I feel tomorrow, and If I am up for another full day of last minute college assigments, by for now people.                  Gawd...what a year this has been so far, looking for work and not getting it, I spent so many years training myself in graphic design and now it seems I will never get anything because I dont have enough commercial experience according to the Suits, well I will keep going nonetheless, I know for a fact that I can do better design and graphics than most of the yuppies out there in Sydney in the so called CBD, but for some reason they are afraid to take someone on without a huge list of previous work for other companies, now I kept my mouth shut all year, I tried being a 'normal' jobseeker but its getting on my god damm nerves, NOT even working for free. Hey I get some clients for freelance webdesign so There I do work, but all I want is to get a job in a nice design company to put my print skills to work. So since this is my post and my blog I can scream my thoughts around, here is one email I got as a reply from an internet job placement site:  'From the details you have supplied it appears that you do not unfortunately,have quite enough experience at this time for us to actively seek suitable employment for you. Current demand and client expectation in the marketplace requires our candidates to have at least one year of industry-based computer experience for permanent work and two years industry-based experience for temporary work.'.   Ok if 4 to 5 years using Adobe Photoshop and whatever crap they ask for, including Hands on design and art history is not enough for them what is? for crying out loud you gotta give someone an opening dont you? I will try as hard as I can everyday to get the job I want but if the design companies keep up this snobbish attitude then I just think I might take up the job offerings as an Illustrator reprographic in the Australian Army. And then they are never accurate, when they ask for designers what they really want is programmers, and vice versa, Well I hope for the future this system goes close to the right way.                  Another long awaited...post, my journal, my home to my thoughts...to often have I taken advantage of it. and raped it with useless words of philosophy, hatred, guilt, negativity and in some cases, sheer happiness, today this is either one of them or all of them, My hair is starting to look afro and growing into my ears, I havent shaved for almost 2 weeks, I just dont care...all over again I repeat these words...Im starting to realise every journal entry here sounds as if Im narrating my life story.. Oh well I jump online to type here because I hit rock bottom of depression, and I use it as a replacement for sleeping pills or alcohol, So many time I explained the feelings of atmosphere. And fuck all that, I cant seem to find a good one that lasts for more then a few hours, I dont want to blame my dad for leaving Australia or blame my girlfriend or even my friends for feeling like shit, but sometimes I do...although I guess thats normal to react this way...I guess the people I rely on...are just. Well so focused on my life...when they go away or show a little frustration towards me...i react very sensitve or depressive. Is it selfish of me to think negative about life, because I never get my way? Hopefully theres someone out there who is so addicted to unhappiness...as me.  so many times we hear about depression, different names, different cures...different ages and reasons...well Im tired of coming up with reason. I simply cannot have the energy to create or smile about anything. Thrown in a family.. Nope still not happy...throw in a beautiful girl that loves you...nope still not happy...throw in a shit load of friends who constantly support you. Nothing...how bout some skill...no we dont want that.  Thats right. Lost confused...how much longer can I say 'Im young and stupid' is 15 young, 21?..or maybe 30?..Tell me, id like to know what is the age...i grow out of this negativity...and why oh why wont it go away. I want to be 15 again.. As usual.
