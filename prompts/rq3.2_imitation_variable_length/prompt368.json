I've been following Gmail for a while now, google's new email service. At the moment it's in beta mode, and is not publicly available. Well, I found out that another guy on the floor had managed to get an account somehow, so I asked him how it went. He told me that he had been referred by another friend who had gotten one through blogger.com, google-owned blogging service.  Well, if you are reading this than you know that I also have a blog through blogger.com. So I'm thinkin', hmm, I didn't get any offer like that. I told Telman that if he ever got a chance to refer someone, could he please refer me? He told me that he had already promised that to another friend if the chance presented itself. So I talked to Ben, the guy he had promised to refer, hoping to get somewhere in the string of referrals, with no idea if Gmail would even continue the referring process that long. Well, Ben already had someone else in line, so my hope was pretty much shot.  That was at lunch today. After lunch I came back to my room, went to the blogger homepage, and right there was an offer for me to sign up with Gmail. It said that because I was an active blogger I was being given this opportunity. I couldn't believe it. So I signed up, wondering if this was really happening. And now I have a Gmail account, so you can all write to me there!  The address is adam.griffis[at]gmail.com.                       Work is going well so far. I don't have my office yet - it's full of file cabinets at the moment. And I don't have my computer yet - they just ordered it today. But it's ok. Right now I'm sharing an office with another guy who started two months ago, and they hooked me up with a nice and slow PIII laptop so I can still do stuff until my new machine (a desktop) comes in.    Apart from that, life is pretty much the same. I'm still amazed at how quickly things happened out here, both the bad AND the good.    Yadda, yadda, yadda - it's just linkin park lyrics. I like the song.    'My{Dsmbr' (feat. Mickey P., Kelli Ali)    This is my December  This is my time of the year  This is my December  This is all so clear    This is my December  This is my snow-covered home  This is my December  This is me alone    And I  Just wish that I didn’t feel  Like there was something I missed  And I  Take back all the things I said  To make you feel like that  And I  Just wish that I didn't feel  Like there was something I missed  And I  Take back all the things I said to you    And I’d give it all away  Just to have somewhere to go to  Give it all away  To have someone to come home to    This is my December  These are my snow-covered trees  This is me pretending  This is all I need                       Spring Break is over. Easter Break is over. We are now in the final stretch. No more breaks. Just five weeks of classes, four days of finals, and then graduation.  Time is flying.  I'm ready to go. Rather than look at this last little stretch as something I don't want to do, I'm trying my best to take advantage of the time I have left here. So many people that I may never see again.  'First Day Of The Rest Of Our Lives' - MxPx  Not a lot right now makes sense to me And it won’t go quietly Not a lot right now makes sense to me And it won’t sit patiently  I’m gonna chase my dreams and catch up to them I’m gonna find you some how, some way, somewhere, some day  First day of the rest of our lives, I miss you already Last time I saw that look in your eyes, I miss you already First day of the rest of our lives, I miss you already Last time I saw that look in your eyes, I miss you already  I don’t want to spend the rest of my life alone Where’s life taking me? I don’t want to spend the rest of my life alone Always traveling  I’m gonna chase my dreams and catch up to them I’m gonna find you some how, some way, somewhere, some day  First day of the rest of our lives, I miss you already Last time I saw that look in your eyes, I miss you already First day of the rest of our lives, I miss you already Last time I saw that look in your eyes, I miss you already  I wanna love my job I wanna love my life But most of all, I wanna fall in love  First day of the rest of our lives, I miss you already Last time I saw that look in your eyes, I miss you already First day of the rest of our lives, I miss you already Last time I saw that look in your eyes, I miss you already                       Adam has arrived safely. He flew into Indy last night around 7:40, I picked him up around 7:55, and after a stop for food we arrived back up at Taylor around 9:35. In the car on the way back here from the airport, we realized that it's been 11 months since we saw eachother last, but now that we're together it feels like it was just last month. It's incredible how good friendships aren't lost due to time and distance. Out of sight out of mind is not always the case after all...  It's really cool to have him around, and to let him see where I've been living for the past 4 years. It's crazy because he was denied leave two times before finally having it approved on the third try. So at first it was looking like he was coming, then it was looking like he wasn't. When he finally told me he had gotten leave, I still didn't get my hopes too high - I was waiting till he stepped off the plane and was here in Indiana.  Well, now he's here. And the rest of my family / friends will get here on Friday. It's an exciting time, and yet I'm still sad about leaving this place.  And the rest of you, I CAN'T WAIT for you to get here! :-)                       Ok, so this is what happened. Three years ago I was riding my bike to work and this idiot in a Jeep Grand Cherokee backed out from a little corner convenience store without looking both directions. To avoid being hit, I turned my handlebars all the way to the right to veer around him. Due to attempting such a sharp turn, I was about to fall over, so I put my left foot on the ground to stop myself.  Well, I didn't fall over, and the guy didn't hit me full out, but his front left wheel (engine end of the vehicle, mind you) thumped over my left foot. Being stupid like I am, I put off going to the doctor even though my foot was killing me. I limped around for a month or so before it felt somewhat better, but even then it still hurt most of the time. Finally around two months after the incident, I went to get it checked out.  At that point it was too late to tell from the x-ray what had happened, so the doctor just supposed that my foot had been pretty much flattened against the road, stretching things that aren't meant to be stretched and possibly breaking things. Well, he gave me an arch brace and told me to wear it for a while. I'm not sure that it really helped at all.  Well now, almost three years later, it's really been hurting again. I find myself limping as I walk around campus. I can't pinpoint the pain, it's just somewhere  inside  my foot. Dang it. Why didn't I just go to the doctor when it happened??? So really, it's not my foot that is stupid, but me.  Well, hopefully it will just go away and get better. Somehow I doubt it.                       And things are going fairly well.  My car broke down in the middle of PA on the drive out here. I stopped at a gas station, filled up, went inside and paid, and when I came back outside my engine coolant was all over the ground instead of in my radiator. Yay for old cars!  But God was looking out for me. At this point in the trip, exits were 10-15 miles apart, and I just happened to stop at the ONE gas station that had a truck garage in the back. I got my car over there, they checked it out, ordered a new radiator, and 4 hours later I was back on the road. I ended up getting to Dan and Abby's place at 11:30 at night, so even with the 4 hour delay it wasn't so bad. Good thing I started the trip at 4 in the morning...  So anyhow, I'm here, and I've already had some time to hang out with friends, and things are going fairly well. I've had some kind of crazy sinus headache or something for about a week now, but I picked up some drugs (advil wasn't touching it) and hopefully I'll be better in a few days. We'll see - it's been a real pain so far.  On another note, I've started talking to people here and hopefully the connections I have will lead to a job before toooo long. I was thinking about not starting a job until August, but now I'm thinking that once I find a job, I'll start whenever. Hopefully something will open up soon.  I'm out. It's been a while since my last post, but I still plan on keeping this updated.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
