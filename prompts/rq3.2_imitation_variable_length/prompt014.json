Support John Kerry  --  Its 10:36 , for multiple reasons I have hit a bit of a low point. So much going on, so little time, and what I had in mind to do is not what is going to happen. UGGG.     What am I looking for right now?     Maybe a girl friend from somewhere else then Barlow. God how I latelty despise people from Barlow. Barlow is becoming a hell hole. I looke at Barlow , i think of a reunion in 10 years or what ever, I say fuck 90% of em.  I just look in the yearbook and think, I need to get to college, new faces and a new start.     Getting back on topic, mainly I want relaxation, fun, to stay somewhat busy unless im away somehwhere. I am busy but I have had these awful on going migraines. i will be on meds Monday for it thank god.      A few things need to happen :  1 : Liscense , not till im 18 , Jan 16th 2004.  ( due to legalitys)  2 : I need to cycle more   3: I need to enjoy life a lot more  4 : Make more $   5 : Get some guidance from above , lord knows I need it lately.                              Support our troops!  --   I got to thinking what it would be like if life had a ' rewind ' or ' pause ' button. Would you know when to use it ?   If you were to pause time trying to keep and capture a cherrished unstained moment that you will spend the rest of your life to reclaim , is it worth it, is it reality? These are some of the questions I ask. Some say memories are just images of good and bad. Memories are not just that but a taste of what was. Its a sense of of imagery that provides good and bad emotions , sentiment and soul. Sure the times are gone , but is it not worth it to rekindle a time that may once have been the summit of your life?   Would you change anything that was bad or good? And if so , what would be changed. After reading thus far , you may be thinking , whats the point of this because its impossible to rewind or pause time. Well I say to that , its provides reflection , rumination,speculation and  consideration.   I am not saying I would try to change the world but I would think twice on many actions of which I have taken. Ahh! But now I think that maybe what I want to change would cause more damage then good. The course of time etc would easily be off balance by changing the date I was born and my mom (med advacement reasons). Realistically I wish I could have changed the relationship with my father. I continue to think it was my fault that our reltionship is the way it is. Though I dont know exactly how I would start there, for that would alter my life so much for the good.    I have entertained the thought of being in specific places at certain times before something tragic occured.   This is just thoughts that have run through my head and I wanted to see them in writing. Ofcourse I can not do any of these things. Given what I would change I would probably try to apply the circumstance to the present time and deal with it from there.           \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
