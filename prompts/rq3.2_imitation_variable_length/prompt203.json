Today went to dinner with him and the rest of the SG ppl at this restuarant specialising in Moqueca (stew sour spicy seafood). It was great and fun. But I was abit upset when he said that he wants to make me the first woman project manager in Keppel Fels.  Wah lau, if i dun live up to the expectation then isn't it very 'throw face'. of cos happy that he has such high hopes on me, but must he tell everyone or not... Nevermind. say whatever he wants.  After dinner we went to a disco pub. It was nice, but the crowd is abit old (hang out with old men, what to expect. haha) Then Melissa told me that a fat man next to us while ordering drinks at the bar told her that he loves me! so funny, and he was yakking 'Chinatown Chinatown' to her. hahah... Then the night proceed on quite ok, danced with the SG ppl, and at the dance floor a young boy wanted to get to know me. Why do i keep attracting the WRONG ppl?  Went to Leblon and stayed for the weekend at Sam's apt. There was porn channel. Of cos watched it (a bit only huh, just to see why the males are so fascinated about it). so gross. just like animals.                      17 more days to go.   been out with frens and spending as much time at home as possible. the jabs been making me feel very tired. i took a total of 4 jabs - 3 on thursday (tetanus, hep A, Typhoid) and 1 on friday (Rabies, 1st shot out of 3).  talked to the manager i will be reporting to in Brazil, he came back to endorse his visa. My queries have more or less been answered:  Internet Access - Will apply for me, so should not be a problem  Accomodation - Will stay with another girl temporary, until we have found the new location to move into. Yes, single. Me, Myself and I.  Telephone - Very expensive to call back. Looks like i have to rely on internet then. Company will provide a local mobile phone. hehe. You guys in SG can still con't sms-ing or calling me on my SG mobile since i have decided to apply autoroaming. but i will have to pay the bucks.   Food - Yes yes... trying to incorporate meat into my diet now. but if there are much veggie or grass to be grazed, i might just go back to being veggie! the servings usually go by kg, and for a simple lunch will cost abt SG$7-8. Good resturants will cost abt SG$30 ($1 Reais = $0.6 SG) or more. I will try cooking. probably will lose another 10 kg from the lack of nourishing and edible food (my cooking).  Clothes - Office wear similar to SG. so it's casual + smart. and during the weekends, dress shorts and t-shirt. no fancy orchard-road fashion show here...   Climate - Brazil is in the same latitude as in Aussie. so now it's winter. it won't get lower than 15Deg in the day, and 12Deg in the night. and i am staying near the coast, so it will not be that bad.   Safety - will be travelling together with my colleagues to and fro work as we have a car sharing system. no pepper spray needed.. apparently not that bad. but will be mindful.  Well, looks like it's pretty much on my own now... Pls give me strength. HIKES!                     another day in office. nothing much to do, but to wait for vendors to come back with quotations.   another 22 days left in SG before hopping onto a 30 hour flight to Brazil. feelings: frightened (50%), nervous (48%), anxious (1%), excited (0.8%), eager (0.2%) (yes, in this order)  never been away from home for so long. the longest was to my India expedition trip in 2002, and that was for 3 weeks. still remember the time i went for my 1st overseas trip without mommy and daddy - 1994. geography trip to perth in secondary 2. teared when i went pass the gates, and mommy's eyes were red too. and i was away for one week only.  sometimes it takes an event to happen to realise how much u are loved or would be missed, or otherwise. some have remained pretty much quiet over my posting, except with a few words of blessings. of cos many many good friends, jie meis, buddies have shown concern, care and love over this adventure i am about to embark. they made me feel that this life has not been wasted because of our friendship. you know who you are. =0) cheers to our friendship.                         Rio 12 Jul 04 Monday   Friday 9 July we had a farewell dinner for Larry at a Chinese restaurant. It was not too bad, and I had the good chance to talk to my colleagues. (and the owner’s cat is sooooooooo cute!)  The topic on Affairs of the heart came up. South Americans are known to be more passionate and possessive. Melissa, a local colleague said she thinks that passion can come and go, but not love. She believes that one can rekindle the passion that is gone. I argued: how would u know the passion will come back once it is gone. It’s the same issue as how would you know when to let go of a relationship when it’s stale? Guess… you just know it.  My input is that Asians tend to have passion only in courtship. Once family is set up, the passion is taken over by commitment to feed the family. Isn’t it true. Till now I have only seen a few cases where the passion is shown to each other, where love is for only each other and commitment is to stay with him/ her even with temptations around.   Gaffore said lust and love are inter-related. (somehow he always gives me the creeps. Especially now that he say this… yew!)  Melissa is with a guy for more than 3 years and they hardly see each other except during the weekend. So I asked what is passion? “it’s looking at that person and you go ‘WOW, she’s gorgeous’”.   I wonder, really, if anyone of my friends is that blissfully in love, in passion and in commitment. I will be truly happy (and envious, to be frank) for him/ her, and for myself too – because I will be convinced that such relationship exist not only in the Samba country. Maybe I will not be that lucky to have this kind of life… but hey, no one gets the best of everything! I am fortunate to know there is such thing. But till then I will keep hoping, and praying for my love ones to get such happiness.                      5 July 2004 Brazil RJ   Yo people!!!!  I just got internet access at my workplace!   it was a very tiring but fun weekend.  We reach Paris in the morning at abt 7am. checked into a day hotel (Euro 89 for that few hours!!!!) and went to Eiffel Tower. my 2 idiotic colleagues think they could just ask around in the sub way station while i thot they knew the way... so i went back and ask the receptionist. anyway french are snobbish assholes who think that French is the best language so if u speak english ' sorry i don't understand you' urgh! but we were lucky to bump into an old couple who were going in that direction and we figured out the way to get there altogether. after the effiel tower trip we went back to hotel in taxi (no train. won~t be able to make it for teh plane if we did!) i was napping and when i woke up, my legs were so jelly that i fell on the carpet and scratch myself!!!! my knee bled! hahahahhaaa.. was too tired on the 13 hour flight.   then another 12 uneventful hours and we reached Rio at 630, 2 of us stay at 2 different apt in Rio city while the other colleague went to our yard 3 hours away. went shopping with 3 uncles and at nite attended a party. the brazilian gals are BEAUTIFUL with GREAT bodies. now i am thinking, i won~t be able to achieve my goal: to find a boyfriend here... sob sob...  sunday went to another town, where our yard is based at. the aptments where one of the colleague is staying face the BLUE sea. oh my goodness. it~s really 'got money also can't buy'. really really beautiful but out of the way. it's almost a 3 hour drive to town  my apt is great too, facing the famous sugar loaf cliff and the jesus christ statue. really FACING. but next to us are slums... and last nite i heard gun shots for teh 1st time. the nite is lited up by the slums located in the hills... the city is so beautiful with the colourful stars. but it's ironic that the nite beauty of brazil is shone by the poorest.   today 1st day of work. already anticipating lots of things to come my way. will show u all the pics next time, i loaded into my laptop.   AND DID I MENTION THAT MY COLLEAGUES ARE SO CUTE! THERE' S THIS GUY I BE WORKING WITH ON A PROJECT WHO LOOKS LIKE THE CLARKE KEN SUPERMAN?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I LOVE BRAZIL!!! hahhahaha love you all. muaks  Greetings from RJ Brazil. PS: I still be accessing this email. but just in case this is my other working acc: DaChin@technip.com sounds stupid hor.                      have you ever felt so stupid sometimes that you wished the earth would just swallow you up? or that you feel you don't deserve to live cos you screw up exactly the same mistake the SECOND time? stupid right?  not only by being stupid makes you feel idiotic, it also hurts you.   been upset about some stuff happening in my life recently. this incident just made me rethink what kind of person i am: stupid, stupid and stupid.  this was meant for someone to read but i doubt he will. see, how stupid i am. writing all my thots and feelings and yet the person targetted will never bother to even click on this link to read.  i should be hung for believing in somethings so easily. hope i will survive in brazil, me being so naive and gullible.   i noe i am sinking into soft ground. yet i am hanging onto some weeds at the side, cos i don't wan to let go. Stupid huh. i noe the weeds are snapping any moment, or probably there weren't any to start with in the first place! it's all my imagination and wishful thinking! now i am more than stupid - i am blind and i hallucinate.  i am giving myself until this week to settle this issue with stupidity. it's about time i snap out of it and spend more of my energy and time on worthwhile things and people. Give me strength to get out of the trap. a trap which i can't decide it has been laid by the predator or by myself.          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
