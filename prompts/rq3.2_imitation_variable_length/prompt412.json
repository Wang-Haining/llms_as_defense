I've got tons I want to do tomorrow before work; some of it is more important than other things, but hey, if I can't enjoy myself a little then what's the point?  At my new job, we get paid biweekly on Thursdays. So I got paid today, I've already dished out the cash for the car payment, and so I will be saving a bit for the insurance, but for now, I can splurge. I'll have to factor in for food and gasoline for the next couple of weeks, but still I think I can enjoy myself a bit. I want to start a checking account, but I'm planning to wait until things level out before I do that, which should be in a month or two.  I won't be able to attend the Cherokee National Holiday this year because of work, which is kind of a downer, but I haven't been in many years, so I can live with that. I very much would have liked to go, but it's not looking good in the future for that.  I'm beginning to see how the job's taking a toll on me. During church, I've had to learn to keep occupied with writing at times to stay awake. It's not boring at all, but lately when I become idle I get sleepy. It's easiest to doze off during a special song, as there is nothing to do but close your eyes and listen.  I suppose I am going to have to verify a possible error I made in a form I completed. I won't go into details with that, but it could have an effect in the future if not resolved.  Slowly I am getting the hang of the days in relation to my workweek. For example, I can more quickly say that it's Thursday (actually Friday), but it's my Sunday. Friday (today) I will go back to work ( shudder ), but with the friends I have there it is bearable. I may transfer as soon as I can, which some of them have the intention of doing also, but I certainly hope we are able to continue the relationships that we have achieved thus far. I'm very fond of these new friends, and I hope that the feeling is mutual.  Well, I think I will try to go to bed now.     \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
