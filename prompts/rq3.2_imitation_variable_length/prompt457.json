I gotta go paint the kitchen.&nbsp; ttyl &nbsp; Jak da awesomest eva                      Man, I am so tired.  we went to the taming of the shrew last night.  Pretty darn good.  Though I do think that if Shakespeare had lived today, some of his jokes would have been censored by mothers.  hehehe.   Went to pond day yesterday at Kylan's (sp?) house.  It was really fun-o!! haha.  I dripped water inside of the house and made Kylan clean it up.  Muahahaha.  And then Kylan's mom made him go and get a little dead bird from outside so she could identify it.  It looked like it flew into the ground.  Pretty funny.  Ashley said it commited suicide 'cause his wife cheated on him.  I got laughed at alot by everyone.  *sniff* poor ol' little me.  hehehehe.  Yeah............. And we went garage saling too... got a nifty saronge (sp?).  It's Hawiaan and still had the tag on it.  Was tempted to buy another fish tank, but I figured that I already had enough.  so yeah...........  Got a sand lizard to... Named it Max Nardo (or Nerdo for short.  haha)   Then we finished Hangman's Curse.  THe end's pretty good.......  Not as good as the book, but not bad.  The book ruins it all though.  Bloom does not commit suicide.... 'Dude, that's not how you throw a frizbee!!' haha better to to church now, Going down with a bang.... Jack the Mighty                      aaaaaah!!  Breath, breath!!  *gasp*  AHHHHHHHHHH!! Okay, okay, I'm alright now.  It's just that the play's tonight and I don't have a fiddle to play!!!!!!  See, yesterday I broke my brand new E string.  It must have had a weak spot, 'cause they AREN'T supposed to break the second time you use em'!!!  So now, I'm counting the seconds until the play.  Sue SAID she's getting me one when she goes to Chico for her appointment, but what if she forgets??  Or what if I ruin the violin since it' the first time I've ever changed a string by myself??? I even lost sleep over it... well actually... I couldn't go to sleep for any number of reasons.  And then I kicked my alarm clock out of my bed (so what I sleep wit my alarm clock??????????) and broke it (I think). Seriously, I think God made my hair out of spounges.  I washed and braided my hair last night so it'd be all cool and crinkly for the play, and it STILL isn't dry this morning.  After sleeping on it ALL night.  Better be dry by tonight.... Oooooo....  Here's a site on changing fiddle strings........  drat, no picts.   Oh man, the computer keeps freezing up.  I hope the power surge yesterday didn't bust it.   Dang... Doesn't anyone tell you how to change a violin string with pictures???????  How a hurdy-gurdy works with pictures... not what I'm looking for...  Signing off - Jack the Still Tired                       Today was the second to the last day of lots of stuff. To Kevin and Eric being here, till we go camping, and the second to the last day of camp. Had a fun time at Sue's camp today. I love all the kids there. Went swimmin' all day long 'cause there weren't many peeps there. Chelsea didn't show. Brian was like an hour late and when he showed he was dead tired. I wonder why. He wasn't in a very good mood either.  Oh! There was this guy from copper creek there, he was like 16 and had cool sk8ter boi curly hair, and he was wearing these totally ugly, colorful short shorts. It was SOOOO funny!! He walks past us councilers and we're all staring at him. He turns around and says to us, 'Just to let you guys know, I don't usually wear these.' I guess it was some inside joke, or a dare or something. It was pretty funny though. They barly reached his finger tips. buahahaha. For Mandy and Ashes: catagory=slug. hehehehe.  My dives were really really bad today. Nothing that felt even remotly like flying, and that's what a good dive's s'possed to feel like. Sat around mainly and teased people. It was fun.
