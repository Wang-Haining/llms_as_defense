The main line in question is  urlLink Nat Nast .  A line that is run by the titular man's two daughters, who's only involvement in the company up to his death was in the shipping department.  Which only lasted one summer I may add.  MSN decides that these shirts are 'cool' because Larry David and Ted Danson fought over one on TV.  And while Larry is funny and Ted has sweet hair plugs, neither is really known for their trendsetting wardrobes, or trendsetting anything.  No, if you want to be at the pulse of everything hip, you pay attention to  urlLink the man .  That's right the Gutte.  Not only was he the man in the Police Academy movies, but he also held his own against a  urlLink gay robot  in Short Curcuit and the  urlLink Olsen Twins  in  urlLink It Takes Two .  Now sure he's taken some time off, but he's also a member of the  urlLink Stonecutter's , and the honorary mayor of the Pacific Palisades out he in California.  And if you don't believe yet, just read his  urlLink induction speech .  I personally enjoy where he wants to rename Sunset Boulevard and put his dog on a stamp.                         Rock n Roll Dancing Shoes   If you've got 'em put them on.  There seems to be some backlash against the  urlLink Franz Ferdinand  boys, so I'm here to suggest a few bands for you if you're looking to put FF by the wayside so that  urlLink Uncle Grambo  and  urlLink Damore  will still think your best.  I understand the willingness to do this, as everyone wants to hang with these two, and rightfully so.  They are to bloggers what  urlLink Llody Dobler is to women . (thanks to  urlLink the blueprint  for the Klosterman ref).  So I present to you different yet similar music:   urlLink Pink Grease  (the site's color scheme says enough.)   urlLink Chikinki  (I suggest checking out the video for 'Like it or Leave it')   urlLink Kings Have Long Arms  (this one is actually techno, but it's fun.  Check it out.  It's free so if you don't like it, no harm done.)   urlLink Pitty Sing  (good stuff from Boston.  In case you're sick of Euro bands.)   urlLink Young Heart Attack  (for those of you who could just go for some straight up rock)  If you don't like these bands, find your own music.   urlLink    Completely unrelated pic of The Gutte, prepared to take your order.&nbsp; urlLink                           Skool's in Session   Last night I headed to  urlLink the Roxy  to check out  urlLink Metal Skool .  Walking into the club was like traveling back to the time of Aquanet and Spandex.  Not only was the band decked out this way, so was more than half the crowd.  It was perhaps the raddest thing I've seen, since the old lady in Vegas that didn't quite make it to the vomitorium.  Metal Skool plays songs ranging from Bon Jovi to Guns n Roses.  They started the set with a rollicking cover of 'Rock You Like a Hurricane.'  Right there I knew the night would break the needle on the Awesometer.  The show is half rock and half comedy, as they talk inbetween songs for quite some time.  The  urlLink Hoobastank  lead singer was there, and they made fun of him because his band sucks.  But the dude was cool, and got up there with them and rocked some old school Van Halen.  Just as I was thinking the night was over, and it was cool although I was wishing someone cooler than the Hoobastank guy would have shown up, the Skoolers went straight from 'Sweet Child of Mine' into 'Night Train'.  This was bizarre.  They kept a pretty good mix until then, hopping from band to band.  Then who other than Axel effing Rose comes out on stage with them!  Who needs Velvet Revolver when you've got Axel playing with a cover band?  Let me tell you though, Axel needs to lay off the Cheetos.  They played 'Paradise City' next, and the Metal Skool lead singer pulled up about twenty girls to dance on stage with them.  This was pretty amazing, but the best part was that none of the girls went for Axel.  They all wanted the cover band guys.  That alone should have Axel on the treadmill this morning.  These dudes are singing your song, with you, but they're getting all the action.  What happened Axel?  It's not a dig against Axel (the man can still rock); it's a testament to how effin' hard the Metal Skool guys rock. They play every Monday and I suggest you check them out if you live in LA.   urlLink    The closest thing to time travel I've seen yet.  Who needs science when you've got Metal?&nbsp; urlLink                           Maybe there isn't a God afterall.   Apparently the radio's finally started to play too much good music, and somebody's trying to do something about it.   urlLink Three of the four former members of Creed have put together a new band, because there's just not enough crap to fill the void created once Creed left apparently.   They are calling themselves Alter Bridge and the first show is in Pontiac Michigan.  Now normally I wouldn't ask anyone to go to this show, but there is a recurring nightmare I've had after hearing of this and I need to make sure it doesn't happen.  You know how in  Spinal Tap   the guitarist leaves the band, but then later is standing backstage wishing he was out there and the lead singer asks him to come out and play and they reunite to play Japan?  Well, in this nightmare, it's the same thing only with Scott Suck (or whatever his name is, you know, Creed's old singer)coming from backstage to reunite with the band, only in the dream they don't get sent off to Japan.  So if anyone can go to this show, make sure Scott Suck doesn't get on that stage.  Take whatever means possible.  And if you have some spare time during the show, try your best to break-up this new act while your at it.  I'll send you a toaster if you can get any of them deported to Japan.  People of Michigan, you are our only hope.                         urlLink This can only hurt Kobe's testimony .   Most of the time I'm all for athletes talking all they want.  You're sure to get some real gems.  But if you're in Kobe's situation, just keep your mouth shut.  Don't you know the Miranda Rights?  Anything you say can and will be used against you in the court of law.  This is pretty much how I see things going now...  Eagle County, CO Courtroom Kobe is on the Stand, being cross-examined by the Prosecuting Attorney.   Attorney:   Mister Bryant, did you or...  Kobe:   I only want to be Kobe. (winks and smiles)  Attorney:   Okay... Kobe, did you or did you not guarantee that the Lakers would win game 5?  Kobe:   I promised?  Attorney:   I quote from your press interview 'we'll win Tuesday.'  Kobe:   I'll go with that. It's fine with me. We don't have a choice. We've got to win.  Attorney:   Well, you lost.  Making you a lair.  And now you expect us to believe you, when you tell us you're innocent?  Kobe:   I'm innocent, you know. I didn't force her to do anything against her will. I'm innocent.  Attorney:   Is that a guarantee?  Kobe:   I'll go with that. It's fine with me. We don't have a choice. We've got to win.  Attorney:   Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury, Kobe made a promise to you people that he would win game 5.  What did he do?  He lied.  And now he sits here, making another guarantee to you.  History has shown that he cannot be trusted.  The court has proven to you, that he is a liar.  Now I ask of you; are you going to let him get away with it again?  What do you have to say for yourself Kobe?   urlLink Kobe :   I just have so much energy. It was either go home or be the goalkeeper.     The courtroom explodes with shocked reactions. The Judge pounds his gavel, trying desperately to restore order.  Court Recesses.  The Press interviews a couple of Kobe's teammates.   Press:  Given his history as a liar, do you think Kobe is guilty?  Karl Malone:  History wasn't one of the subjects in college I liked. I'm not a big history buff.   Press:   Did Kobe do it?  Shaq:  That's sort of a trick question and I don't have a trick answer.   Press:   It's a simple question Shaq, yes or no?  Shaq:  It is simple. And if you don't stick to simplicity, you'll die a horrible death.    Press:   Do you think Kobe will be found guilty?  Shaq:   That question is a lot like my game.  Which is like the Pythagorean Theorem.  Nobody knows the answer.  Man, I can't wait for this trail to start.   urlLink    Kobe:  How 'bout I buy you all rings, and we make this all go away?  La:  You could have just won us rings instead.&nbsp; urlLink                            urlLink Spaceland ?...More like SWASSLAND!  For all of those that missed the show at Spaceland last night, I pity you. (which I know was all of you, as I went alone.) For they were serving up swass by the gallons, or in those Hardee's  urlLink Smurf glasses  if you asked politely. The first band of the night was  urlLink Tsar .  And these guys are  urlLink awesome !  Straight up rock and roll for the masses.  I'd give them 2 thumbs up if  urlLink I  had any.  The second band was pretty awful, and didn't even say their name, so I can't tell you not to go see them.  Unless you want to avoid all bands from Seattle.  Which I don't recommend.  The last band of the night was  urlLink Ambulance Ltd .  And the swass was back.  These guys are  urlLink solid .  Another note on the night, was that the Eve 6 singer kept walking around acting like he was all cool.  To which I kept walking up to him and saying, 'Dude, you're not cool.'  But  urlLink the man  is as  urlLink dense  as  urlLink osmium  so he didn't really take the hint. The singer for Tsar however, was the swassest person I've seen in LA for a long time.  Just how swass is he?  He wore a cape after the show.  That's right, he walked around the club the rest of the night with a cape on.  But not just any cape.  A cape with a large picture of  urlLink David Hasselhoff , with the word Hasselhoff written in large white letters next to the face just in case you weren't  urlLink German  and needed some help.                        More Gutte!  (You know you want it.)  I told you that you can't stop him.  I found this swass pic of the Gutte today, and it seemed fitting for reasons that make sense to those of you who know my darkest secrets.  I didn't really read the article I took it from,  urlLink but you can if you feel like it .  I think it has something to do with comparing the Gutte and the Police Academy movies to Judge Reinhold and his cop comedy.  I do know that Judge was up for the role of Mahoney and he didn't get it, so this comparison seems pointless.  The Gutte is obviously the better of the two, because:  1. He got the role.  2. I never heard of Judge's movie before. 3. He's the Gutte. 4. All people remember of Judge's most popular movie are Phoebe Cate's bare breasts and Sean Penn. 5. He's the Gutte.  I mean seriously.  It's like trying to compare Rex Morgan MD with Prince Valiant.  It's time that could be better spend reading today's Marmaduke (which is solid by the way).    urlLink    They couldn't even get a decent picture of Judge.&nbsp; urlLink            \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
