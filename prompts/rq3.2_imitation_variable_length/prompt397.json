Oh yes, I was able to play eventhough I am in a remote place of the country where the bars have happy meals, the movies are delayed, and where Sun Cellular's sun doesn't shine.  In our courtesy meeting with our regional director, AVP Johnny, he said that Caraga is a very poor region.  He told us about the history of Caraga, the problems they have in transportation, and other problems in the office.  I think he failed mention any problems in the peace and order.  When he was running out of stries, he asked if anybody wants to join him in the Cathedral for the Novena (since it was a Wednesday) and nobody answered, then he asked if anybody wants to join him play badminton the following night. Me! Me! Me!   Without second thoughts, I said yes to his offer, even if I don't have my racket with me.  After the seminar, he invited everybody for dinner and said he will send someone to pick us up in the hotel.  I thought he forgot about our game.  When we were about to leave the office, he said to the driver, 'bring them to the hotel and wait for Daday to change, bring her to the badminton court.'  Yeeehaaaaa! Doña ang lola mo! At the PPA (Philippine Ports Authority) abandoned warehouse, they built 2 badminton courts.  I was impressed by the quality painted cement court (better than some of the cement courts here in Manila).  I saw some staff from our regional office.  They are all good.  I hear 'whapack' everywhere!  I wish I could bring them all to Manila because we have a tournament in two weeks.  After losing 2 games in a row, I had a chance to talk to the nice lady who lend me her racket.  I asked her who maintains the court because I can't see any office or shop, not even a desk.  The courts are maintained by the Butuan Badminton Club, she said that they pay twenty pesos per hour. What?! Twenty pesos! Boy, you're lucky, we pay 150-300 pesos per hour back home!  She said, they were even complaining because it used to be just 11 pesos.  I learned that there are three badminton courts in Butuan.  Two in government land and one privately owned.  In the other government court you only have to pay 10 pesos which is good for one whole day.  The private court costs 75 pesos per hour, which they think is way too expensive.  No wonder they are all good in badminton, they can play all day without straining their wallets!  After two more power-packed games with Sir Johnny (we won 1 game hahahaha, 1-1), I was so tired and thirsty already.  I don't have water with me and I can't find a place to buy.  When I looked around I saw a mini-ref.  From its glass door I can see a big bottle of water.  Suddenly the court turned into a desert, I am so freakin' thirsty!  I can take the risk even if I'm not sure if the water inside the ref is potable.  The only problem is, the refrigerator is locked with big chains. Aaaaarrrggghhh!!!   How is badminton in Manila different from badminton in Butuan?  1.  The court fees! 2.  They all have good rackets (perhaps because they save a lot from the court fees) 3.  They play for only one reason -- pure love for the sport! Not for the 'japorms' or anything. 4.  No badminton politics. 5.  No pro-shops, canteens, and no masungit na bantay. 6.  The discipline.  Eventhough no one's taking care of the court full-time, the comfort rooms are clean and  there's no problem with the queueing eventhought there are only two courts. 7.  They all speak Visaya while playing, and I don't understand a thing they say! Pastilan!  Once again, badminton paved the way for me to reach out to other people.  People of different status and different origins.  I surely enjoyed playing badminton the Butuan style.                   Daday  . Do you think I like my name? Like it? I love it.   When I was in first year high school, turning thirteen and all, I said I don't want to use Daday anymore, it's immature, peculiar, and so pinoy.  I wanted to be called Rhory -- that’s my original nickname which I cannot pronounce when I was little.  Somehow Rhory didn't work for me, so I dropped it.  Daday is easier to say, easier to remember, it's down-to-earth, it's unique, and it's me.  So far, there's no one I know personally that has the same name.  The closest I know is Dada, and her brothers Dodo and Denden and sister Didith.  I should be a member of their family and together we can sing A-dadada-a-dududu.  My friends call me Daday, my teachers call me Daday, my classmates, my officemates, my boss, everybody does.  Some people are not comfortable with it at the beginning but they get the hang of it as soon as they see how well it fits me. Although, there is one person I know that finds my name unacceptable. I could never forget the day of my first class in Informatics, the first time my name will be in the schedule board.  She asked me, 'Uh, what name should I write? Daday? Don't you have another name? Can't you think of some other name?' HA! She surely tapped my bitchy nerves so I said slowly as I control myself from strangling her, 'Miss, my name is Daday, may problema ba? Put there Daday, that's D-A-D-A-Y.'  Everybody in Informatics know that messing up with me was the biggest mistake of her life hahahaha. (Any guess kung sino s'ya? Hahaha.)  Harold calls me Daday Doods, Gen and Abby calls me Daday Kups ('kupad' yun ha!), Cheche calls me and Gen 'C'mon-c'mon', Bel calls me Duday (sometimes Dudaykoy when I call her Belekoy), Kudz and Toti calls me Dadskie, my students invented Ma'am D, some call me Da, Dads, Dayday.  The only people who calls me Rhory are my cousins, at least three of them.  Whatever! I consider pet names as term of endearment, it's sweet and very personal.   You might ask where “Daday da Makulay” came from.  It's from a birthday card I received on my debut. Since then I embraced the name and lived up to it.  Life is colorful.  No matter how boring or how simple your life is, it's really a matter of how you take notice of the tiny details and appreciate its value.                    I want to write my own epitaph but I don't know the details yet, so this will do for now:   Rhodora Encarnacion Pascual    Daday_da_Makulay    System Shutdown: MM DD YYYY  though now in the grave, her colors will never fade  you may also visit me online at:  http://www.daday.com   ----------------------------------------------------------------  Here are some funny epitaphs I found on the web:   The children of Israel wanted bread  And the Lord sent them manna,  Old clerk Wallace wanted a wife,  And the Devil sent him Anna  --------------------------------------  Here lays Butch,  We planted him raw.  He was quick on the trigger,  But slow on the draw.   --------------------------------------  Here lies the body of our Anna  Done to death by a banana  It wasn't the fruit that laid her low  But the skin of the thing that made her go.   --------------------------------------  Here lies an Atheist  All dressed up  And no place to go.  --------------------------------------  Remember man, as you walk by, As you are now, so once was I, As I am now, so shall you be, Remember this and follow me.        - To which someone replied by writing on the tombstome:         To follow you I'll not consent,        Until I know which way you went.                 I will go to Butuan tomorrow to conduct a one-day seminar.  I really don't like to do that but my assistant and my supervisor really wants to travel so I lost.  It's not that I don't want to travel; I just don't like to go there and work.  The dark skies and the strong winds are now giving me the jitters.    Yesterday, my badminton buddies and I were talking about two of our officemates who passed away last year.  Both of them are badminton players too.  When the first one died from a motorcycle accident, the news spread in the office like wild fire.  Everybody was talking about Red  (let's call him Red because he's from the Red team).   There are about 2000 employees in our central office so it's hard to recall his face.  My friends were trying to describe him to me: 'Si Red, yung may highlights tapos medyo mahaba yung hair'. 'Yung laging kasama ni ano...'. 'Yung partner ni ano nung laro natin sa Sheridan'.  I still can't remember him so in desperation, Paolo tried to make a sketch.  I had a person in mind already based on his drawing but imagine my shock when I saw the guy I thought was Red in the canteen.  The other guy, Yellow, died of leukemia.  This one I am familiar with because I once had been in a meeting with him.  Now it's my turn to describe him to my friends.  'Si Sir Yellow, yung naka brush up yung hair, tisoy na taga 15th floor.' 'Siya yung tumalo sa min nung first game.'    Tomorrow I’m traveling by air and the sky doesn’t look too friendly.  My partner was teasing me, asking me on how he should describe me to those who will ask him.  “Si Daday, yung mataba, taga MIS sa 1407” “Kailan lang nakasabay ko pa sa elevator yun eh” “Naglaro pa nga yon ng badminton nung isang araw e.”  Creeeeepy!  I told them, if something happens to me, please refer them to my web site or to friendster. Please don’t try to describe me.  I would really hate it if you can’t describe me well.  I also warned Paolo not to draw my face.    It’s a funny conversation really, though a bit morbid.  Alone in the bus on my way home, it made me think, how would people describe me? How would they remember me? 'Si Daday yung taga orange. Yung nakipag rematch sa table tennis, yung nagbigay ng seminar sa `tin, yung kasama natin sa Tagaytay'.    Oh well, I better make good and lasting impressions while I can.  I hate to spend 8 hours sitting here in front of my desk.  I can end a day without talking to anybody.  How on earth would they remember me?!  Lord, please keep us safe! I haven’t updated my photo and profile in friendster yet.           \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
