We start moving stuff over in less than three weeks, and I can't wait.  We even did a little packing Saturday night, when I felt a little better.  Our current landlord did not give us the great reference she promised....big fricken surprise.  And now she wants half of June's rent because we were late in the first half of our lease.  We are also not surprised by this, but still pissed about it none the less.  My feeling is, if you were that adamant about it being on time, you either needed to write in a clause charging a late fee, or don't accept the money and evict us.  Don't offer to make arrangements if you're going to punish us with them later.  We are trying to work something out, but we just don't have the money to give her right now.  But, I'll less than freaked out about that part...just realizing that I have to pack up, clean everything, still take care of showers, getting arrangements with the new sitter worked out, homework for Addie, and everything else in life taken care of, in three weeks.  Eeeekkk!!!!                     So I started to write this big long post about loving men who drive big trucks.  Then work took over and I totally lost my train of thought.  Oh well.  That doesn't change the fact that the bigger the truck, the more I love it.   Old Herb drives a spectacular machine.  At lease he used to.  I've heard he's traded in the one we used to drive to lunch in.  That sucks.  I would have traded a lot of what I own to have that truck, even if I do only drive a mile to work.  She sat so tall and proud, it always took just the right amount of effort to climb up into her.  Well, in jeans at least...getting into that truck in a skirt could have been slightly obscene.  Ok, so you get the idea...I loved that truck.    T-minus 9 days until we get to start moving...but I'm not counting.  My sister is coming over Saturday.  I am FINALLY getting a haircut.  This mop is getting all ratty looking again.  Also gonna recolor it.  The red's almost completely faded now, and with five weeks until race time, I figure this gives me enough time to color and touch it up.  Other than moving, nearly everything I do in the next two months will revolve around the race.  Yes, I'm staying red.  I have to.  Whoever said blondes have more fun has obviously never been (or been with) a redhead....                      I guess I'll post another page of 'As the Stomach Turns'.  I've spent this week trying, finally successfully, to get the Java Development thingy installed and running properly on my 'puter.  Took three days, but at 11pm last night, I finally made it all happen.  And of course I was up at 6am today trying it out...now that it's 10:30am and I'm getting a headache, I think I'll stop learning for a bit.  Just to let you all know, it will be a glorious springy Seattle day here...low 60's and sunny by this afternoon.  Enjoy the read... :)   'Ha!  I didn’t dream about you last night.  I thought for sure, with everything that happened yesterday, that you would be tormenting me again.  But alas, maybe my head finally beat my heart out this time.  Just in time too.  I was starting to feel like I was going to jump out of my skin yesterday.  I feel so much better today.  No climbing the walls.  It really helped to vent to a friend last night.  Well, I just cleaned off all the emails from (and to) you.  Partly trying to save my butt, just in case someone ever saw them, and partly because I’m hoping for “outta sight, outta mind.”  Ok, well better until you wrote back.  Sucks that you’ve been sick, and now I understand why you’ve not been reading email (this time).  I wish I could come up with some new, witty things to say, but I still feel the same, so I just keep writing variations of the same stuff.  Sucks.    Alrighty…here’s a good one for ya.  Getting myself fired up for July.  I’m getting used to the colder weather, so I’m thinking it’ll feel really warm by then.  I’m thinking my plan is to see just how miserable I can make you.  I’ve got those great little gray shorts, and they’ll look cute with the Vans.  Just need a cute little crop top and I’m set.  I want to make you ache like I do.  I want to frustrate you, remind you that you want me, and why.  I want you to forget what you’re “supposed” to be doing, and do what I want you to.  I’m going to torture you so much worse than I EVER did in Phoenix.  You just have NO idea…..(evil laugh!!).  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   Well, I know I dreamt of you last night, but I don’t remember it.  Just remember rolling over and thinking of you.  So, it’s not so bad.  The edge is worn off now.  Although I am still plotting much evil and misery for you in July .  However, I’m worrying myself a bit.  I’m afraid that I will be so concerned with torturing you that I miss getting to spend time with you.  And then it will be another whole, long year.  Ok, so maybe I’ll just look really good, but maybe act a little nicer.  I guess first we’ll have to see if there will be any spouses.  AAAWWWW!!!!!!!!!  I just want to write.  I don’t know what, and I don’t know why, but I do.  I’m tired of talking about you.  You are all I talk about, think about, write about.  It’s quite annoying.  Like I wish someone would ask me a really good question.  I am having writer’s block trying to start from scratch and it’s bugging me.  But if someone would give me a good topic, I feel like I could just keep going and going today.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Handwritten 1/14/04  Tired of typing, feel like writing now.  It seems to make it more personal.  Part of me just wants to torture you, make you ache.  I want to look really nice, make you want me; then ignore you.  See, I can pretend you’re not there also.  Because you do.  But I don’t really want to waste the one chance this year I get to see you.  So, I guess I’ll just be a little evil.  Can’t be too bad with Michelle around.  You know, I’m actually not mad, just in a funky mood today.  My boss is having a really bad day; I’m wondering if it’s rubbing off on me.  I guess I just wish you could understand how frustrated and confused I am.  If you don’t want me anymore, that’s fine and I could handle that.  But it would sure be nice to know.  Then I could just obsess from afar without always bothering you.  What would really make life nice right now is just a few nice, normal conversations between us.  Considering all the problems it caused and other troubles at the time, I guess I just wish things could be like they used to be.  All around, just frustrated and really wishing I had a crystal ball; cause I’m really needing an answer to the “what if”.  There have been other people I’ve wondered about, but the feelings were never so strong, and never lasted so long.'         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
