Our annual 4th of July festivities includes the band playing in the town parade and at the picnic thereafter.  Naturally, everyone's cases are unattended for a brief time while they play on the stage in the park.    Someone (we think we know who it is, but to be on the safe side, I will assume that we do not) decided to take it upon themselves to settle a little personal conflict with a band member by taking a certain amount of horse waste and dumping it in their instrument case.    Now if that isn't stupid enough for you, there are a few witnesses that saw a particular individual with a cup full of the stuff walking around the area where the cases are.  Whatever happened to the good old days when a couple of kids would just have it out in the parking lot?  Vandalism like this is pathetic and is in my book a display of how there are simply too many people in society that will become a drain on the rest of us.   ...In case you were wondering, I believe we have gotten the smell out of the case.                       Okay, you may be thinking....6 posts in one day is a bit pathetic.  I have a few reasons for this:   1.  I feel compelled to provide some initial content for all to view.    2.  This has been the least productive day of my life.  I believe the day I was born was more productive and I can imagine that the day I die will also be more productive.  I came in because Tracy went to get certified as a Pathwise mentor.  I came in this morning around 8:30.  At around 9:30 a student strolls in for a tuba lesson (I WAS expecting him.) Another student comes in later for a lesson on percussion.  (I was also expecting her.) At around 11:30 I was finished and just sitting around.  I inventory all of our percussion equipment (that took me around 20 minutes) and then went back to sitting on my butt since everything else is just about finished up for the summer.  I do a little bit of work on the newsletter (everything I can without consulting Tracy) and am now waiting on 5:30 to get here so I can go eat Chinese and then go to choir practice.    We were SUPPOSED to have drumline at 3:00 but after Rallo drove an hour to get to Piggott it turns out that several of our kids FORGOT about it and therefore I had to cancel. (We will chastise them royally next Monday when we see them again.) Talk about making me feel embarrased.  'Sorry Rallo...our kids only have half a brain and therefore forgot about this obligation!'    ::sigh:: So now I sit on my butt watching the minutes pass.  I feel guilty for being this bored.  I shouldn't be bored, I'm generally much too busy for it.    But hey, at least it explains all the posts today.                       I have got some very gifted students.  Band tends to attract the more gifted individuals.  Of course we don't discriminate against anyone, but nevertheless, there are some very smart young folks in our band.    One particularly bright young man is going into the eighth grade and can carry on a conversation as if he were in college. He commented today that he is disgusted with the lack of desire on the part of his colleagues to be more intellegent.  Most particularly, he described improper grammer and a lack of varied vocabulary.    I found myself in agreement with much of what this young man had to say.  I'm not going to say that this is just with 'kids today' because it is clearly not.  There were a great number of twerps that couldn't intellegently discuss their way out of a paper bag.  I think society just has a way of weeding those folks out and making them inconsequential to those that want to accomplish something.    I am very pleased that this young man has noticed this and is compelled to tell his peers that say 'why do you use such big words' to 'open a book or simply listen to intellegent people speak.' It gives me great faith in our young people.                       Okay I love golf.  I mean I think there's no sport any better.  If you're thinking 'but Fulkie, you just chastised athletics in an entry yesterday' you make a good point.  I still feel that athletics should come COMPLETELY secondary in our school systems, but if there is one sport that you truly gain something other than athletic ability, it's golf!    Golf is a sport where even if you aren't any good, you can still really enjoy it.  There is a specific etiquette to the game and the professionals are truly gentlemen and ladies.  (There is of course always an exception.)  It is a quiet game where you can gain a great deal of insight to things going on in your life.  Golf requires a great deal of strategy and planning and nothing feels better than a well hit shot.    Sadly however I am still what you may call a 'duffer.'  I'm not that great at the game.  If I break a 100 on 18 holes I'm doing a victory dance like it's nobody's business!  I love playing though.  It's such a wonderful game because it's very noble.  I will always love the game and play it regardless of how good I am.                        I take for granted how lucky I was growing up and don't realize that everyone doesn't grow up as I did.  I had a wonderful childhood for the most part and can't really complain about too much.  But let me give you a little (non-specific) information about a young lady that truly amazes me.    There is a young lady that I got to spend some time with teaching this summer that really impressed me.  She had a wonderful personality and a work ethic that was quite superior.  This girl seemed to have not a worry in the world.  When I returned to my home, I began getting some email correspondence from her.  Without getting specific, this young lady asked for my prayers because a family member was having some very difficult times and it was causing strain on the entire family.    The more I read about this and received updates, the more I felt terrible that she was in that position.  She continually said that she wanted God's will to prevail and that she trusted in him.  I admire that depth of faith and would like to say that I share it with her.    I found out that all this started just BEFORE the period of time that I taught her.  How amazing!  This girl set aside all of her personal difficulties and gave 100% of her concentration to what I was trying to teach her.  This is very amazing to me and I know that she will go far.    It appears now that things are better with her family and I know that she seems to be more relieved.  I will keep praying for her, not only for relief of her personal difficulty, but also that she will succeed and go on to great things.            \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
