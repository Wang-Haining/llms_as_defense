Aaron, Regis, Mark, Pat, Sean, and I watched tv and played chess all night.  Today was even better!! NOT! I had to get up at 7 to take ACTs...some girl in Eric's room had a seizure! that's nuts, I wasn't THAT stressed about the tests. Anyways, after getting over the fact that I had to take the tests at Marshall, unfamiliar territory, I made my way to room 302 to check out how smart I really was. I'm predicting a 26...we'll see.  Aaron is sick today :(, poor thing...he sounds like he's got what I had... I think it's going around...being sick to your stomach and that stuff, but I have a feeling it's those noodles he ate last night! like 20 packages!!  Mom, Dad, and Sean are out of town til tomorrow at 10:30...PARTY AT JEN'S...j/k. I have to spend the night at my Aunt's house tonight, but it's cool because Laura and I will stay up all night talking about random guy things, hehe -- Girls' night. yey.  I jumped a whopping 4'8' at the Midland meet today...considering the weather and stress from ACTs, I think I did alright.  This research paper in English is killing me! Anyone with suggestions on how to express my understanding of owning a Bed-n-Breakfast....hmmmm...I'm stressed, oh well....deep breath.  Well, it's about time to head up to my Aunt's house so I'll catch ya'll on the flip side, hehe...ly Joey muah                     'A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush' Shit! I have no bird. I have no bush. God has taken my bird and my bush. I am left with a high mound of unorganized paper that is waiting for me to shuffle through and magically produce an 'A' grade AP paper. *sigh* Why does it seem like everything happens at once?  While everyone else has cute little quotes or quoted songs on their profiles, I refuse to mask the truth. Relationships are hard! And sometimes they suck, sometimes they are great. But mostly we just spend our time trying to fathom some unreal bonding experience between two people. I don't see any point in trying to hide it. We all know that our significant other isn't perfect, despite the multiple 'I love you's and the random 'I was just thinking about you' gifts. We push aside their imperfections, trying, hoping, praying that our relatioship will look better than the other person's. Or maybe we don't think we can do better, bullcrap, there is always someone better out there for you! If you have a feeling, then follow it. But don't try to be someone you aren't or turn someone else into something they aren't. Please, if anything, be true to yourself. I know it sounds cliche but really now, why put so much effort into a relationship that you KNOW is doomed from the start. All I'm saying is to see things for what they really are. Look deeper into someone's heart, look below the skin.   I need more caffine or compansion...one of the two...I'll be up all night working on this research paper.   Current Mood : I'm lost, I haven't a bird nor a bush  Currently Playing : Hopelessly Devoted to You - Olivia Newton John (for old times sake)                     He thinks I walk on water  He thinks I hung the moon  He tells me every mornin'  They just don't make girls like you  He thinks I've got it all together  He swears I'm as tough as nails  But I don't have the heart to tell him  He don't know me that well   He don't know how much I need him  He don't know I'd fall apart  Without his kiss  Without his touch  Without his faithful lovin' arms  He don't know that its all about him  He don't know I cant live without him  He's my world, he's my everything  And he thinks he needs me   Sometimes he cries on my shoulder  When he's lyin next to me  But he don't know that when I hold him  That he's really holdin' me And the funny thing is  He thinks he's the lucky one  God, that song perfectly describes me right now. Joey, just because we aren't dating doesn't mean I don't still love you. I do. Don't worry about that. I always will. And even though we aren't dating, you can still tell me you love me and I can still let you know how much you mean to me. It's not the end of the world. We live separate lives and I can't balance both, I'm sorry. Please give me time to find what I really want. And my answer to your question: I will be here for you to talk to when you decide you can be just my friend. I miss you, dating or not, when you aren't around. We've spent so much time together and no one can take that away - no new boyfriend, no new girl. Our things we have, that mean so much to you, are not shared with anyone else because they belong to us, and us alone. Without you these past two years, I know I'd still be back there listening to my parents fight or you'd still be dwelling on your grandmother's death. I might still be sitting at the top of the steps waiting for Allison to come back. Maybe you'd be back in your old house with the pool, shining your soon-to-be-taken graduation present. I don't want to lose the friendship we had but that's what scares me. When we started dating, we stopped being friends, I never wanted that. I still want to joke and laugh and giggle and wrestle like we did. I want to run to you and cry in your arms and know that everything will be ok and leave at the end of the night feeling better than ever, but maybe not so much. I wouldn't want to put you in any situation that would hurt you. And I'm sorry that the one time I decide to, it's this...but sometimes you gotta let it go.                     1st and 2nd Mod - Finished trig by taking a killer quiz and I'm praying I get atleast a 25/20 on it... 3rd Mod - watched some movie in sociology, found out I did extra work for NOTHING!...grrr 4th Mod - watched My Big Fat Greek Wedding and listened to Richard's IPod some more...watched people play 'bitch' 5th Mod - Last lunch of the year, *tear* last pizza sub for a while. 6th Mod - ugh, Ferg's monster test. Good lord. froze my ass off. 7th and 8th - listened to argument papers and got a piggy-back ride from Christian outside, that was exciting. passed notes with Katie about Aaron and Bean...hahahah! calculators and protractors rule man!  Track party after school wasn't all that exciting, I left early for Aaron's. I did some of his Foods homework and had to leave at 4:45 to get to work on time. At the Wal-Mart exit coming off the interstate, there was a HUGE accident and so Rachel and Andy were late, leaving Golden and I to handle everything. G (Rachel's pet name for him) is really cool. He helps me with everything and he doesn't stink   I'm so excited because tomorrow Eric, Megan, Scott, Katie, Katherine, Emily, Aaron, Pat, Lauren, and I are going to see Harry Potter!!!! EEEEK!  Current Mood : Upset, I got my pay check...yea $80...thats all I have for the cruise.  Currently Playing : Jackson 5 - I'll Be There                     Hey its my first day writing on this so just some background about me...  Jennifer Nicole Lucas is my name :) I am completely in love with my boyfriend of about 1 year, Joey and I go to Huntington High  I really only got this thing so I could vent all my stresses and traumas i experience thru-out the summer and stuff like that...

Hey ya'll! its been forever! i wa reading past posts and wow was I a dork. I was inspired by Rachel and Katie to start this thing back up in hopes that my far too stressful life with become...not so stressful? School was good today. We shared our 'Life Line' papers in english. basically, write some b/s story about someone who inspired you...yea so i was a rebel and wrote about someTHING that inspired me...$$MONEY$$. yea wow, Christian looked way cute today, so did Erica and Foster. Anyways, Joey comes back in town for ten days in 14 days! YEY! Tomorrow we (cool people going to the RASTLIN' tourny) get out early...i'll probably just check in and leave w/ Fo and Sean. Yea Sean...i'm pissed at him, he told Mom and Dad that he was spending the night at Evan's house and Evan was having a party for his birthday! Com'on kids, we dont tell our parents when our sister's friends are having a party w/o adults and includes alcohol! Dumb ass brother! grr....oh well, lesson learned.
