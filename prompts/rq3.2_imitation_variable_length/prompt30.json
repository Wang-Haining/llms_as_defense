Why, might you ask have I had so little sleep? I've been tossing and turning in bed trying to get to sleep till the wee hours of the morn. Just can't seem to get to sleep. Lots of thoughts were coming into and out of my mind.  The economics lecturer was pretty fast yesterday (no suprise there). For a few minutes there, I sat in the lecture theatre feeling as if someone had put a pillow over my head, trying to stifle me, but only in the intellectual sense. But thankfully I snapped out of it early enough to grasp the bulk that the lecturer was teaching.  Note: Never have only two hours of sleep before another econs lecture again. In fact, it's best to go over the lecture notes beforehand, preferably twice. It'll make everything go smoother during the lecture.  Oh and I think I got the real iq, which is 128. Nothing spectacular but at least it's in the 97th percentile. Pretty darned decent. In the gifted but not quite genius range. But lest I pat myself on the back, I should stop to remember that even the most intelligent person in the world would be useless to himself and the world if he procrastinates too god damned much.  Well, in hindsight, I would have prefered to have not learnt about iq tests. Personnally, I think they're much more trouble than they're worth. That's the last I'll write on  that  particular subject.  Well, what else have happened the past few day? Spent the better part of the day at school doing the marketing project (situational analysis & SWOT). Gonna go to school tomorrow to type it all out with the rest as we only wrote out a rough copy of it today.  Well, that's about it. *YAWN*. I guess it's about time to catch some quality shut eye time.                      It's a week and a half till the next semester begins. Man, the holidays flew past in a blink of an eye, didn't they. This is probably the last holiday that I will have to just laze around and do pretty much nothing.  The next holiday, at the end of this year, I'll probably be busy with the DPP project (one big mother of a research project) and with the starting up of the tuition centre. The following holiday, during mid 2005, I'll be in Melbourne at RMIT, for most of that month.  So that doesn't leave much time for breathers in between. Phew! From here on out, it'll be one mad rush. And that's just the beginning of life then.  I look toward it with mixed feelings really. On one hand, it'll be great to be able to start earning my keep. But on the other hand, I don't want to leave the security of school so soon.  But time marches on. And there is nothing anyone can do about it. All I can do is to face it head on and hope that life doesn't chew me up and spit me out. But that's just being pessimistic.
