  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic:\n\n       i had another bad dream.  bad, bad dream.  the dream begins with me and some friends on a high ledge.  The ledge was not connected to any other form of land (round, stand alone sort of), and i don't remember how we got there.  I think we were there doing an experiment of some sort or a field trip...maybe. some of the people in my dream are not closely associated to me, and i am confused as to why they were part of it.  in the dream, it was like we were all best friends.  one, an ex-boyfriend, is from out-of-town.  my best friend is also there.  we (us 3) are the main characters.   so, we're on the cliff, and i had chosen to stay in the middle, being afraid of high cliffs and sharp drops.  my ex boyfriend is standing by a  guard rail  (?on a deserted cliff?) and looking out into the horizon.  i shake with fear.  i stand up, wanting to maybe get over my fear, and everyone instantly comes over to me and grabs me and pushes me toward the guard rail.  (everyone except my best friend)  i'm shaking, crying, screaming...terrified of what my  friends  would do to me.  my best friend was standing in a clear area of the cliff, watching this happen.   the others managed to position me so that my legs were dangling off the cliff, and i am hanging on to the bottom rung of the guard rail.  i am so afraid, like nothing i ever felt before.  they clear away, and my ex leaves the guard rail, too.  they watch me like i am a circus animal.  after a while, my best friend comes over and drags me from my place on the cliff.  i lay in the middle gasping, hyperventilating, almost choking on my own tears.  then i blacked out.  the dream came clear again, and at this point, i am sitting in that place(legs dangling), somewhat at peace but quite nervous.  my bari sax-playing friend came up behind me and starts beating the hell out of me.  then she pushes me off the cliff.  i woke up, eyes wide and breathing heavily.  i think this is some sort of precursor to what is going to happen between me and someone (maybe even her) close to her.  i'm scared.  nervous off my ass.  this is making me crazy.  i hate (     ).    \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
