After dinner (and doing the dishes), I ran outside to try  urlLink my new birthday present .  I bought it on Wednesday thinking that surely I deserved another cheap imitation RC plane for my birthday this year.  Here's the one I bought:      Not worth the $49, definitely.  Actually, the plane flew really well - it took off right out of my hand and flew to the left as it's designed to do. Unfortunately, the controller wouldn't make it turn back to the right.  I lost sight of the plane about 10 seconds after I let go of it.  The sound of 'BANG' soon followed and I ran to see the fate of my new toy.  Sad.  God bless the folks at Wal-Mart who believe that I am not just an idiot and actually believe that something wrong happened to the plane. They took it back without question.  So, instead of investing in yet ANOTHER crappy plane, I focused my attention on the sporting goods department.  $20 later, I am the proud owner of a new SHIMANO R-2000 rod and reel. These will be used tomorrow morning over at Brackett Pond! I'm looking forward to relaxing at the pond on the day of my birth!  25 tomorrow. That's pretty cool.            Memories. Tonight, I opened up our new 3-CD set of Agapeland's Music Machine discs!  Incredible memories flooded back to our minds. It was great!  For those of you who've wanted a chance at replacing those worn-out cassette tapes that you had for many, many years - check out Agapeland's website:  urlLink www.agapelandmusic.com   Had a great Sunday. Today was Pastor Dan and Shelley's final service with us. It was a time of reflection and anticipation.  The congregation was given the announcement today that we will have a Pastoral Candidate with us next Sunday morning! I can't wait!  After services and a fairwell dinner banquet, I ran out to help Jeremy (one of my teens) put a CD player in his car, 'Gunther'. We had no trouble figuring out something that I've only done twice - both times about 4 years ago! It was good to sit in a car and sweat like a pig.  Big day tomorrow - tomorrow is my 'official' Spring Cleaning day at the office. I will be throwing away much of the 'I've just gotta save this' stuff that doesn't ever get filed - it just ends up in piles to 'look at later'. It will be a glorious opportunity to somehow bring order to my otherwise order-less office! There may even be some rearranging of furniture included in the festivities!  By the way: stevansheets.com received over 3900 unique hits in the month of June! That means over 130 page views by unique persons each and ever day for an entire month! This is a bit ridiculous - a guy who updates his site once a day and posts things about his own life can have more than a hundred people visiting his site every day!  For those of you who visit stevansheets.com on all 30+ office computers in your workplace, I say 'thank you'.            These two pictures tonight speak for themselves.  First: this guy thinks he's innocent.      He sure looks innocent to me!  Second: how about  THIS  waiting for you in your pool?!      I wish I could've been there to see the lady go in the air and land in that pool! (no, I am not being sexist - I heard on the news that it was a lady!)  Quite the day today - spent most of the afternoon printing camp handbooks. At about 5:15, Brandon Schenck called to say that he and Dave Mason and another guy - Will, were in the area and wanted to join me for dinner. They came over to the church, checked out the youth room and we enjoyed an evening meal at El Arriero - the best Mexican food in Warsaw.  I stopped at Blockbuster on the way home and rented THE LAST SAMURAI. Tomorrow we're going with Chris and Craig & Lindsay Helfrich to see Dodgeball!  Oh, one more thing - I caught a lightning bug and smashed it on Jess' arm. The mashed-up guts glowed when we entered our dark apartment! She wasn't really impressed.            So, today was a weird day. I woke up this morning with the symptoms of a migraine without the extensive head-pounding usually associated with a Stevan-migraine!  So, I got up out of bed, fell back down, and decided to be a man and get up anyways. In the shower, I had to hold onto the walls just to stay vertical.  After the shower and realizing that I really couldn't drive under this condition, I asked Jess to call the church and tell them that I was not going to be in this morning.  I hit the couch and covered my body with a blanket and my face with its own blanket. I slept soundly for two and a half hours.  I woke up sometime after 11 and decided, once again, to be a man and hit the road.  I worked under the weirdest conditions today. My vision was blurred and I was dizzy the entire day!  I went to Wal-Mart and checked my blood pressure - everything was okay. So, I'm guessing that my blood sugar was out of whack. I decided this because I ate some M&Ms and drank Mountain Dew and began to feel better!  This evening Jess and I drove down here to Indianapolis to visit my brother,  urlLink Kory Pence . We drove for the last hour or so through a pretty intense thunderstorm. Thankfully Jess was driving and I was putting on the 'let's stay calm' bit to keep things under control. She was great.  When we arrived to the wonderful Indianapolis, and to the home of the Pence's, we realized that we forgot to bring the bag of clothes. We'll leave it up for discussion WHO forgot to grab the bag of clothes on the way out, but still - we had no clothes. We DID have our two shirts that we had hanging in the car, but no pants, bed-time clothes, or pants, socks, or underwear!  So, off to Wal-Mart for the second time today. Different town, same store.  Did you know that a guy can buy a complete outfit at Wal-Mart for under $20 (jeans, 3-pair of boxers, 3 t-shirts, 6-pair of sox), but a girl can't for under $35 (jeans, shirt, underwear).  There's a problem there, folks. A REAL problem.  Who would have thought!  Oh well.  Long post tonight - sorry - I'm enjoying the wireless internet available here in the Pence-home!  Tomorrow: sleep in, headquarters tour, dinner with Kory, drive back to Warsaw!  It will be a good day. (as long as I'm not dizzy!)
