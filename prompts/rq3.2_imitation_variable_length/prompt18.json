I had a really really bad dream last nite. I know its not true, but it involved you and yeah, just sucked.  I also had to be up at 7 to go to the drum practice shit, so that didnt help either. then i came home and had to go cash money so i can pay my dad the $425 I owe him, great. THEN i had to do some real work cause apparently these pictures have to go back soon, so i scanned like 200 of those, which sucked. Then i had to do my summer reading, but that i cant complain about. that I am doing so I can spend more time with you. :) And I dunno, saw i robot today, cause i was that bored. and i kinda was hoping to hear from you, not like i expected it, would just help after last nites dream..... so yeah. But dont you dare feel bad cause i already feel bad for how big that fone bill is. Just, if you can, and ill pay for it all, i just want to talk to u once more before u leave for... here. *shrugs* im sillie. ive also been sick all day, tho trying to cover it up as much as possible. sorta half threw up last nite, but i think i know why now. at first i thot it was cause i had too much apple juice, but ive figured out its cause i ate 2 week old chips. cause i ate them again today and feel more sick now, blah. im an idiot. so in general, i feel like shit. hope your having a great time with your lesbians and dallas and all that, great big orgy ;) whatever, i can see you soon enough, so *shrugs* bye love *mwah*         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
