An official replywas received but said NOTHING about this letter nor any of the concernsit raises. Please mail this to ALL the people you know who vote. Theydeserve the truth!!! Soldier's Letter to KerryDear Senator Kerry:Since it has become clear that you will probably be the Democraticnominee for President, I have spent a great deal of time researchingyour war record and your record as a professional politician. Thereason is simple, you aspire to be the Commander in Chief who would lead mysons and their fellow soldiers in time of war. I simply wanted to knowif you possess the necessary qualifications to be trusted in that respect.You see, I belong to a family of proud U.S. veterans. I was a Captainin the Army Reserve, my father was a decorated Lieutenant in World War II;and I have four sons who have either served, or are currently servingin the military. The oldest is an Army Lieutenant still on active duty inAfghanistan after already being honored for his service in Iraq. Theyoungest is an E-4 with the military police. His National Guard unitjust finished their second tour of active duty, including six months inGuantanamo Bay. My two other sons have served in the national guardand the navy. In looking at your record I found myself comparing it not only to thatof my father and my sons, but to the people they served with. My fatherserved with the 87th Chemical Mortar Battalion in Europe. They landedon Utah Beach and fought for 317 straight days including the CherbourgPeninsula, Aachen, the Hurtgen Forest, and the Battle of the Bulge. You earned a Silver Star in Vietnam for chasing down and finishing off awounded and retreating enemy soldier. My father won a Bronze Star forsingle handedly charging and knocking out a German machine gun nestthat had his men pinned down. You received three purple hearts for whatappears to be three minor scratches. In fact you only missed a combinedtotal of two days of duty for these wounds. The men of my father'sunit, the 87th, had to be admonished by their commanding officerbecause: 'It has been brought to our attention that some men arecovering up wounds and refusing medical attention for fear of beingevacuated and permanently separated from this organization...' It wasalso a common problem for seriously wounded soldiers to go AWOL fromhospitals in order to rejoin their units. You used your three purplehearts to leave Vietnam early.My oldest boy came home from Iraq with numerous commendations and thenproceeded to volunteer to go to Afghanistan and from there back to Iraqagain. My sons and father have never had anything but the highestregard and respect for their fellow soldiers. Yet, you came home topublicly charge your fellow fighting men with being war criminals and tourge their defeat by the enemy. You even wrote a book that had a coverwhich mocked the heroism of the U.S. Marines who raised the flag onIwo Jima. Our current crop of soldiers has a philosophy that no one getsleft behind; and they have practiced that from Somalia to thebattlefields of the Middle East. Yet as chairman of a Senate committeelooking into allegations that many of your fellow servicemen had beenleft behind as prisoners in Vietnam, you chose to defend the brutalVietnamese regime. You even went so far as to refer to the families ofthe POWs and MIAs as Professional malcontents, conspiracy mongers, conartists, and dime-store Rambos.As a Senator you voted against the 1991 Gulf War, and have repeatedlyvoted against funds to supply our troops with the best equipment, andagainst money to improve our intelligence capability. I find thisparticularly ironic since as a Presidential candidate you are highlycritical of our pre-war intelligence in Iraq. However, you did vote toauthorize the President to go to war, but have since proceeded to doeverything you can to undermine the efforts of our government and ourtroops to win. Is this what our fighting men and women can expect ofyou if you are their Commander in Chief? Will you gladly send them to war,only to then aid the enemy by undermining the morale of our troops andcutting off the weapons they need to win?Our country is at war Senator, and as has been the case in every warsince the American Revolution, a member of my family is serving theircountry during the war Now you want me to trust you to lead my sons inthis fight.Sorry Senator, but when I compare your record to those who have foughtand died for this nation, and are currently fighting and dying, theanswer is not just no, but Hell No!Sincerely,Michael Connelly February 14, 2004 Dallas, Texas                                wat has this society come to. my sis was jus watchin 20/20 and they were interviewing this guy about why hes suing some bar for bein discriminatory cause they were having a grls night out. this used to be something kool. a night when the ladys get treated a little more special. so they went around to some bars an interviewed some ppl. the girls were like im sure no one cares, an mosta the guys were like 'i think its stupid that girls are gettin sumthing that guys arent'. what is going on here? i mean common!! are we a bunch of little 4 yr olds MOMMY HE GOT SOMETHING THAT I DIDNT!!! so you want everything that girls get is that what yer saying? all these load mouth liberals that dont have backbone. tearin the country apart is what they are doing. i hope they are happy when women get equal rights in the gang tribes when all law breaks down. cause EVERYone has to be protected. the criminal justice system is so screwed up in this country. but back to my original rant. is it discriminatory for us to have a kids menu to? or senor ppl discount? i mean life isnt fair and wats wrong with givin ppl that deserve a break a break sometimes. cause if everybody gets it then u hardly appreciate it as much. mosta the time that is. but me an my friend got some ideas bout how how some of the criminals should be punished for certain things. his blog is the world denominator.  :) i cant remember them all at the moment but i will post them later. im sure they would lower the crime rate but we would here lots more yellin and whinin from ppl like kerry who scratched himself to get his gay purple hearts to get sent home!!!                                well today started out nice and dandy!! i got up at 6:30 and got ready for school so i was there with jus enough time to play some GBC. i ended up beating a really hard boss. mwahahahaha class jus kinda draged on but, tomorrow is the test so i need to get up early and study and do some tonight. i think ill do fine. then i hung out and got some chow with a really good friend of mine. we talked and blabed for about an hour. it was all fun! :) then i had to get my car filled up. that thing sucks more gas than the space shuttle!!! i still love it though! :D im glad i stayed and talked to whit, cause who should i find when i walked through the door?!?! my ex-GF and her sis!!! dang wata way to ruin a good day!!! im sorta kool with her sis but my ex is butt to me, so i didnt even say or acknowlage that she was there. jus put my head phones on and cleaned the fish tank. which brings me to my next point. because i waited so long to clean the dang fish tank there was tons of crap in it and the fish was USED TO IT. he went into freakin shock after i was done!!!! so i had to get and air pump for the tank. 20 bucks man!! 20 BUCKS!!...........oy it was for a good cause though.
