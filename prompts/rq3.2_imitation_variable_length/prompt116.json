He never did get the message I sent him, that makes me very happy. We talked for quite a while yesterday and the subject of love never came up. God, I miss him so much. For todays agenda I'm gonna try to play B-ball with my friends. Hopefully they will be home today, cause they weren't yesturday. I might invite Benny over ot my house, but I'm not going to come right out with anything like I was planning on before. Now that I know Ryan doesn't know I'm not that desperate anymore.   I hate NC, its to f*cking hot. Its 90 already and its almost 1:00pm!! Well there's not much other news going on so I'm going to write on my Saiyuki fanic. Enjoy!   Saiyuki: Goku and Hakkai's Confrontation - Part 2  Hakkai and Goku wake up the next morning in eachothers arms. Goku feels a little uncomfortable and turns around, his back to Hakkai. He wonders if Hakkai really likes him, or was only horny. He thinks about the night before, and gets hard once again. But this time he gets out of bed and gets dressed. Hakkai is still asleep and Goku leans over him and kisses him gently on the lips. Hakkai's eyes open and with rage he pushes Goku away. Goku with tears in his eyes says 'I knew it, you don't love me....you bastard'. He then runs out of the room. Hakkai sitting up in bed tries to think what is going on, but he can't remember a thing from the night before. Hakkai says outloud 'Oh F*ck, it must have happened again, it was a full moon and I didn't notice it.' You see, Hakkai has this condition that on every full moon his personality changes completely and the next morning he can never remember a thing. This same think happened to him with Sanzo. Hakkai now knows what he must do, he has to fall in love with Goku or they will never be friends again. Hakkai walkes downstairs to find Goku sitting on a stool at the bar with his head burried in his hands. Hakkai puts his arm around Goku and says ' I'm sorry Goku, you just frightened me. I do love you and nothing will ever change that.' Goku looks at Hakkai with amazment, then he smiles and hugs Hakkai. 'I love you too'.   Thats the end, yeah, I know its a crappy ending. But it's my fic so deal with it. So only one person reads my blog, thats OK because thats more than 0. Thanks for making everything clear to me Ryo. Hey, it sure is hard trying to talk to you. I guess its because you have school. How about you give me your email and we can talk that way. Thats all I have to say for today. TTYL            Today was m’kay, I had marching band this afternoon. I didn’t talk to Ryan much, I’m not sure why. I guess I am just getting a little pissed that I can’t be with him. I wish I had a boyfriend, I have never had one before. I’ve only had girlfriends and that’s to keep my reputation. I had no feelings for the girl, which is pretty rude. I guess it would be called using them, but I have stopped going out with girls. Now that we are older all they want to do is kiss. Just the thought of kissing a girl makes me gag.  After marching band I had to go to a meeting for fall sports. I signed up for soccer for the second year. I played on JV last year and I will be doing the same this year. I guess its true what they say about soccer boys. hehe. My stupid step-mom was supposed to go, but she didn’t and I was forced to get a ride home from the coach.  Tomorrow is a very good day. I get to go to a concert. It’s the Southern Tier Swing Band, they are awesome. My band teacher plays bass in the band. I can’t wait, but it doesn’t start until 7:00pm. I can’t wait to hear the swinging trumpet players.  OMG, I am drinking tea, I hate tea. I only like it when there is no sugar, and I still don't really like it. Maybe I will get my hair cut tomorrow, whatever happens, happens. Well thats all for now. TTYL              Yay, tomorrow is my blogs 1 month anniversary. Over 4,000 words written and 20 posts later(not to mention one loyal fan, *cheers for Ryo* thanks Ryo, you kept me blogging) we are finally here. Today was a good day, I got to play B-ball with Benny. He is supposed to come over tomorrow, but I found out I'm going to a theme park with one of my friends. I'm going with my friend Chris, he's pretty cool and he used to be my favorite friend until Benny moved in at Easter time. I feel really bad changing my best friends, but Chris isn't gay and Benny might be. It makes you wonder 'How do you know Chris isn't gay?' Well I guess he is the first guy I tried to be with. It didn't work out to well, and for some reason Chris doesn't think I'm gay witch is supprising since I tried to screw him a few years ago. He just pushed me away and thought I was joking I guess. I've got all the Gravitation finally downloaded, now all I have to do is watch it all. Shuichi is my favorite, he is the best looking. Yuki is also pretty hot. I've got another good yaoi website. Its  urlLink YaoiHell , and its full of good yummy yaoi. Well I better get to bed so I'm not tired tomorrow. TTYL              Sorry I haven’t posted in a while. I was a little busy; in other words I was being lazy enjoying my summer. :D I didn’t screw up my solo at the parade, and I think we may have got 1st place but I won’t find out until tomorrow. I got to sit with Ryan on the bus to the parade, I really wanted to confess my love to him, but I am to much of a goddamn wuss. I love him so much I would die if I could be with him in the afterlife. I found another pic that I like of Shinji and Kaworu; I will post it later. I started writing a fanfiction the other night but when I was done writing my browser crashed and I lost everything. I really didn’t feel like typing it again so maybe I will get to it later. This Saturday I have to go to graduation and play, then I have to go to a graduation party. It going to suck, but luckily the day before I get to go to a county fair. That will be somewhat enjoyable. But I have to go with my 3 cousins, which really blows. Other than that not much is going on.
