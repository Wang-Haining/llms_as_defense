But yesterday was alright. Tony came out here for the first time in almost 6 months. Tony is my good friend that lived out here but he moved away when we went into 8th grade. He used to come out about every weekend but it's been a while, I'm glad I get to chill with him again. When he got here I walked to this girl maggie's house. After chillin there for a while we went to this jessica girls house. She's pretty good lookin, I used to be friend with her and chill back a few years a go but haven't talked to her ina few years, so it was cool to see and chill with her. We chilled for a while there, there was like 8 or 10 people. While at jess's we went across the street to some russian girl's house to smoke. While tony, jake, adam and me were in the basement I was punching the punching bag they had and tony kept telling me to hit it harder so I did, and then *snap* the chain ripped right out of the cealing! I felt kinda bad, but at the same time it was really funny. It was also all white and cloth and when jake was hittin it before me he had a cut on his knuckle and stained blood all over it lol. So after that we walked on over to my house where we sat for a second, then we walked on over to jakes. After sittin at jakes for a while we got pick up and went to matt's. It was matt, nikki, christina, dave, janiene, jake, adam, tony, and me. We discussed if were going camping this weekend. Me and jake agreed to go if we went to nelson's ledges, so I'm waiting to hear from nikki on how much it is and if were going. After matt's we got a ride home and adam and tony came to my house to spend the night. Around 11:30 danielle came over, she stayed for like an hour or two and then took me to taco bell at like 1:30 then dropped me back off at home and she left. I really am starting to hate her so much, shes such a lier and a bad person >_ If you have never seen the show 'Travel Sick' you need to. Some guy from britian is travling around the world and they make him do horrable things. It's about 10 times worse than jackass I'd say. Last night he had to brush a crocadile's teeth with a regular toothbrush, he had a to kiss a dead corpse (this was sick!) and because he failed one of his missions he had to eat a fresh fryed scorpian. Well my last 2 days haven't been too bad. I been going out and doing a lot I guess. Well today I'll might see dani for a little but then I wanna either wanna go to jess's or hang out with jenn or something. Well have a good weekend everyone :)   Music: Too early I'm not awake yet Mood: It's summer  Face: :) Learned: Hrmm, well nothing I've just been sittin around havin fun                    Well around 3 me adam and jake went outside and smoked a pipe. About 5 minutes after we got inside I hear jake go 'it's the cops!' I thought he was joking at first but then heard someone knocking at the door. Appearently one of my neighbors (and theres only 1 possable neighbor that could have seen us) called the police on us for smoking. They said they saw us smoking pot out of a pipe. Now of course I said we were just smoking cigarettes. The cops seemed satisfyed until one of them saw an empty pack of papers laying there. He said they couldn't do anythign because they didn't see us, but next time if they do catch us someone is going to be arrested. Well fuck them lol, I'm a minor and have under 100 grams, so they can kiss my sweet I'll only get probation balls :) Althought this isn't a good start to a good summer. The cops have been here about 6 times in the last month or 2 for various reasons including the time we were shooting a bb gun and they came thinking we were carrying a shotgun around the back yard!     Music: none right now Mood: I hate people Face: -_- Learned: Watch out to see who's lookin!                     On the 4th me adam and jake went to jake's house around 9 and were greeted with a nice steak dinner and salad for us all. I must say thanks again jake's dad :) Yesterday was a lot of walking, a lot. I walked from my house to matt's (3 mi.) then from matt's to jake's (2.5 mi.) and I walked as few other places plus at matt's most of us being there was us just runnin around outside. I'm starting to get worried though, I think I'm gunna have a scare on the back of my foot cause the plastic insdie my vans was bent and sharp and for a while was rubbing my foot and cut it up. even though I got new shoes they still rub the shit all the time and it hurts :/ now I know how woman feel, lol. Me and danielle are at the end of our relationship I think. We have been ina fight for a few days now and every day that goes by makes me wanna talk to her again less and less. like 2 weeks a go she was about to go to this guys house after work and we got ina fight about it, so she didn't go. well a few days a go she called me when she was off work and left me a voice mail saying 'Please don't get mad but I'm going to wayne's house.' This was after we went to a 2 day party and I left all my shit in her car (including my toothbrush) and I was just gunna get it when she was off work. But I don't know, danielle is not the person she used to be at all. I don't even feel like I know her anymore, which sucks really bad because I love her so much, yet I have zero trust for her and I sometimes can't even stand to be around here anymore. Well I guess theres nothing I can do about it now and I might as well start trying to get over it... my first time coming out of a relationship this long, 2 years.   Music: Jay-z - Moment of clarity Mood: I need to rebuild my life Face: -_- Learned: People change and there's nothing you can do. The only thing you can do is hold on and try to move on and forget.                    Well I started my first day of work yesterday, I guess it wasn't that bad, it was work what more can I say. I work at a place called sharpeys, its a sub shop. I was kinda upset cause I didn't think they servered hot food, but I was wrong so the kitchen in like 1,000 degreees all the time, I thought it would be more like subway. I gotta learn how to cook cold and hot food, clean everything, work the registers and the phone and a few other various things in less than a month, atleast thats what my boss wants so he and his wife don't have to come in to work that much any more. My boss's name is john, hes an alright guy I guess. He seems like he should be on king of the hill. he's very old fashion and slow talkin... but for some reason I don't think I'll have this job long. But other than that I've been trying to find a ride to summer school for the last 2 hours cause I need to make up a lot of credits, I have 12.5 and I need 22.5 to graduate and I'm suppost to be a seniour this year, so I'm pretty behind. Well soon I'm gunna put on a mic and spit some of my shit for ya'll to hear see if ya like me at all, not that I care about you if you don't :)    Music: D12 - Loyalty (ft. obie trice) Mood: Rushed and anxious Face: 6_6                   HAPPY 4TH!!!    This weekend was insane. All I did was party the last 2 days ina row and I have more to go. I stayed the weekend over at my friend's mom's house and I drank more saturday night than I ever have any other day in my life. The entire weekend was just a big tent party, me adam and jake went to it. Friday was just like 10 people sittin round drinkin and msokin all night, but saturday was pary time. There were over 200 beers in the cooler and 250 jello shots. On saturday alone I drank a case of bud to myself and somewhere between 30-40 jello shots, i was more than wasted. There were a bunch of fireworks too, and not cheap ones the good ones. We also had m-500's (half sticks) plus there was 2 places with fireworks displays we could see form the house we were at so we watched fireworks for like an hour stright. The amount of bud we smoked this weekend was rediculas too, we really did it up and smoked about 2 oz's in less than 2 days lol. I've been giggling like schoolgirl all fucking weekend. Well right now I'm about to shower and shave which is much needed, get dressed, go pick up a case, and do the same damn thing again :) Gotta love summer ^_^    Music: Twiztid - Maniac killa Mood: PARTY ALL WEEKEND! HAPPY 4TH! Face:   Learned: I don't think I learned anything... I think I forgot a lot of what I've learned.            \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
