  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic:\n\n             These are the things I have done today which aren't work.  1) Went to Tesco's 2) Ran 6 miles or so. 3) Called my mum and dad, sister, Hav (twice). 4) Won the treble (League, FA cup and Champion's League) on Fifa Soccer on World Class setting. 5) Developed killer concept for off-the-wall post-ironic superhero comic book.   A blockage has developed between my neural doo-dahs and my wotsit cortex which prevents me physically from doing any work. It's a disease! Do you think I can get mitigating circumstances and an extension?  In a slightly scary but still very exciting development, me and Hav have decided to bring the wedding of the century (OURS, you arse) forward a year. Yes that's right, it's THIS SUMMER! Using the sort of logic only we can employ, we have decided that it's less stressful this way. There was a whole thought process behind this but it is quite retarded and schizophrenic, so let's just say that we couldn't wait any longer. We couldn't, anyway. So put your holiday plans on hold, folks. Start your diet, look out for a hat, find your dancing shoes and your best underwear, cos an invitation may just be winging it's way to you sometime soon. If we don't have a nervous breakdown before the day comes round, it'll probably be pretty good fun.  6) Wrote this blog.  Later. x.                        A decidedly Sundayish feeling to today. I hate Sundays. Not just because it’s the day before Monday, cos, let’s face it, that’s how things have been since Gregory invented the calendar and if we haven’t got used to it by now there’s a problem somewhere. It’s just that they’re so  disappointing.    In the movies Sundays (and therefore also, I guess, bank holidays) begin with your being woken up by golden sunshine pouring through the window, or by some unfeasibly beautiful women stirring at your side, or by a shaggy dog jumping on the bed. You spend Sundays playing chess in the park with old Jewish men who bring along breadcrumbs for the pigeons, or drinking coffee on terraces with people in corduroy, or Guinness in charming pubs which are showing the football, but no-one is watching it. At any given time during all of these activities you will always have slightly mussed hair and perfectly even stubble. You will wear sloppy sweat tops and holey jeans in which you will look  just fantastic.  This is what Sunday is about. It is the law.  So how come, then, on any given Sunday round my house, we lurk in our rooms doing work all morning, emerging bleary-eyed and grumpy about 2ish, do some washing up and the hoovering, eat a pizza, watch whatever dreck Channel 4 have decided this week is a cinematic classic, discuss our mild disappointment, and go to bed?   I’m starting a campaign for More Exciting Sundays. Who’s with me?  Just me then.  OK.                       Has London been recently struck by a plague of birth defects?  I ask because there seems to be a spate of folk abroad lately with one leg shorter than the other. This is the only way I can explain the strange behaviour of a whole underclass of citizens who simply cannot walk in a straight line! What the hell is wrong with these people? Is it too much to ask that they just select a point in space and aim for it? Is something awry in their inner ear which is affecting their balance? Or is it just sheer bloody-mindedness that makes them drop their shoulder like a premiership footballer, feint left, shimmy right, then BARGE RIGHT INTO ME!?! Bastards! Today while running I got knocked over FOUR times! Also a guy came up to me and asked for a pen. Why would I have a pen? I'M JOGGING! Jesus!  School today was lovely. Harvey Jarvis, that most tramp-like of art-teachers, was nice to me about my lesson despite the delightful 8GR pouring cellulose paste all over the floor. They tried my patience with their chuntering and their newspaper-flapping antics, but my Jedi skills saw me through in the end. After that my mentor Alastair signed off like a gazillion standards, even though I'm sure I haven't got evidence for any of them. You can bet I'll be finding it at the weekend, though. Finally, I discovered that next week is Exam Week and so I almost literally have NO LESSONS! This is the best news EVER! I can do my portfolio in peace and maybe even my essays as well. I am uber-chuffed. Good old Asskiss!  Last night on the radio some dude was talking about Blog Activism, this pseudo-movement whereby folk whinge about Bush, Blair, globalisation, etc. through the medium of Blogger and other similar publishing services. Fair play to these guys, but I feel mildly aggrieved at the dismissive tone they used when referring to non-political bloggers, as though they're some less meaningful form of fish in the big internet pond. I'm happy in my Blog Inactivism, thanks very much. I hate what's going on in the world right now with the heat of a nova, but this blog isn't about that. It's about some good old fashioned mithering, and me trying hard to defy my genes and be funny. And can't see anything wrong with that. So bugger off, Blog Fascists. I fart in your general direction.  Today has been a bit ranty.  Zen tomorrow, I promise.                           It's been so long since I've been here, I've almost forgotten what to do, and so much stuff has happened, I hardly know what to write.  In the past two weeks the following things have happened:  1) I got a job. 2) PGCE came to it's final, shuddering halt. 3) I had a few days off, for the first time in God Only Knows How Long. 4) I started my job. 5) My computer finally shuffled off its electronic coil, taking with it five years' worth of my work, and most of my major lines communication with the rest of the universe.   So it's a whole entire, strange new world which greets me as I roll out of my bed these days. I'm feeling very disorientated and I'd very much like to work through my issues in the public arena, where all you kids out there can point and laugh, etc. Unfortunately it doesn't look like I'm going to be able to replace the PC anytime soon, so my blogging may be pretty sporadic for the forseeable future.  Right now I'm snatching a few quiet minutes on a very shiny school Mac (I so want one of these), but I can't see it being a regular occurrence.   Never mind. You all should have better things to do.   I'll be back.  x.                        Hav came round last night and we ate lasagne and Lindt chocolate bunny and quaffed pink champagne. How incredibly decadent!   Got up this morning and winged my way down the East London line to my new school. It took about half an hour.  Half an hour!  Am going to gain just  hours  of my life back this term through not having to make ridiculous odyssey-esque voyages to work every day. This is amazing. I can play an extra hour of Gamecube every night! (I wanted to say extra planning, extra marking, extra resource-building, but who am I kidding?)  The school is called Haberdasher's Askes. That's cos it was founded by the Guild of Haberdashers way back in ner-ner-nerfty-ner, and some guy called Aske donated a wad of cash to them when he died. It's massive and split over two sites, and it has more resources than you can shake a meter ruler at. They have darkrooms, they have kiln rooms, they have screen-printy things and a minibus service. You can charge your lunch to the school on a little swipey-card, and the same card will also do your photocopying for you! Genius! And they gave me keys! I keep using exclamation marks ALL THE TIME!!! It's a whole new world, people. I just hope I can remember how to teach so they won't kick me out.   In a miraculous development, Barbara has put the Assessment essay deadline back to the 1st of June. Honestly, today couldn't really get any better!   Will probably get run over by a car on the way to the pub.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
