God is changing his life 180 degrees, like his changes at work, new house, new car, etc.  God is changing Nick inside and out, and I am so excited for him!  It's like God is raising the bar in his life, if he's ready to step up to the next phase he'll find what he's been yearning for.  Nick is really headed somewhere exciting and purposeful in life... and I don’t want to hold him back by any means, and I don’t want to compete with him as I accelerate in my own, rather I wish for those two things to compliment each other, to strive to make each other better and lift each other up.  Ah I just want to stand in faith for him and support him and be a part of his life.  If only he were willing.   I really want to ask him if he believes this is something to pursue... and if so then I want to do it right, like foundation-wise, I don’t want this to be a sporadic once-a-month or whenever we can get a chance to hook up, because we both have so much going on in our lives that there wouldn’t be enough there to like… well, ya know how especially in the beginning it needs cultivating and a little cocoon in order to develop and stuff.  It’s like the night when the phone was ringing like crazy, can’t get into the groove and reach substance because just when you get to that point the phone rings and pulls it away or distracts and the moment is gone.  Whether that’s the devil halting because he is clamoring to knock this down and prevent what we could become, or it’s God halting us and trying to deter us and steer us in the right direction.  I know that Nick would want to think long and hard on that, or rather he’d probably say he doesn’t have time to think about that right now.  But I also am aware that the answers don’t come from the mind, in fact that opens the door up to doubt and over-analysis and fears from the devil, rather get into the spirit and the Spirit will take from Jesus and reveal to him.    \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
