  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic:\n\n       (warning: may be habit forming)  Mash six medium potatoes, then set aside.  Blend together, then add to potatoes: 4 oz sour cream 3 oz cream cheese, cut up 1 T butter 1 t onion or garlic salt (more to taste) 1/4 t pepper (more to taste)  Put potato mixture in greased casserole dish - I prefer a low-sided oval Corningware dish - and top with: 1/4 - 1/2 C milk 1 T butter  Bake uncovered at 350F for 1 hour, stirring twice. Can be made in advance, then heated up - just be mindful of moisture and add more milk or sour cream as necessary. When I make them in advance, I usually halve the baking time - baking for 25-30 minutes, then covering with foil until it's time to prepare the meal - then baking another 30-45 minutes, adding milk or sour cream and topping with more butter as necessary.  I sometimes like to add 1 C cheddar cheese and more garlic - the cheese tends to burn so if you add it, you'll need to stir more often. I hate peeling vegetables - hate it hate it hate it - but it's worth the ten minutes with the peeler to have these potatoes. I know this all sounds like propaganda - but try it! You'll like it! I've been assured that they're just as good with low-fat ingredients.                 E asked for my stew recipe last night, and like many things, I don't have one.  But here's what I told her (in case some day I'm old and senile and don't remember how I do this):  My stew changes every time I make it, depending on what we have --   But here's what I did Sunday night.   Sauteed a chopped onion in some olive oil, added some sliced carrots and diced potato, let them saute for a bit.  Added a big can of stewed tomatoes (I would normally add diced tomatoes, but didn't have any) and their juice, added some veggie bouillon cubes, and some water.  A can of corn, a can of blackeyed peas.  Let that simmer for a while, added some thyme, oregano, celery seed, and a bay leaf.   Once everything is all stew-y, I added about two tablespoons of flour to thicken it.  Then I mixed up a package of pre-packaged biscuit mix (the one I used was cheddar and garlic), added a little extra cheddar, and spooned it on top of the stew.  Let those cook for a bit, and ate it.   Nothing major, nothing complicated.  If I were adding chicken or something, I'd do it right after the onions.   So there, for posterity's sake.                     I could read maps before I could read books. (37)  A map does not converse in sentences.  Its language is a half-heard murmur, fractured, fitful, nondiscursive, nonlinear.  'It is almost as if one had to read from a page where all the words had been assembled in random order: obviously there could be no fixed starting point or sequence of perception.' (37-38, qtd from Arthur H. Robinson and Barbara Bartz Petchenik in  The Nature of Maps )  A map has no vocabulary, no lexicon of precise meanings.  It communicates in lines, hues, tones, coded symbols, and empty spaces, much like music.  Nor does a map have its own voice.  It is many-tongued, a chorus reciting centuries of accumulated knowledge in echoed chants.  A map provides no answers.  It only suggests where to look:  discover this, reexamine that, put one thing in relation to another, orient yourself, begin here... Sometimes a map speaks in terms of physical geography, but just as often it muses on the jagged terrain of the heart, the distant vistas of memory, or the fantastic landscapes of dreams. (38)  A single map, observed Denis Wood in  The Power of Maps , is not a self-contained document but a compilation of what ' others have seen  or found out or discovered, others often living but more often dead, the things they learned piled up in layer on top of layer so that to study even the simplest-looking image is to peer back through ages of cultural acquisition.' (95)  In geometry,  describe  means to draw or trace the outline of something; in poetry, it means to get at the essence of something, to bring it to life in a way that's both startling and beautiful.  You've got to do both kinds of description -- and do it in a medium that's partially visual, partially mathematical, partially textual, a complicated miscellany of scale, orientation, projection, grids, signs, symbols, lines, colors, words. (97)  Mapmaking has been going on since at least the Stone Age: a picture map painted on a wall of the famous Catal Huyuk settlement in south-central Turkey dates back to about 6200 B.C., nearly three thousand years before the first system of written language appeared.  And recent studies have shown that even very young children have an uncanny ability to understand maps, fueling speculation that we are born with the skill. (142) (note: All cultures are thought to make maps.  See David Stea, James M. Blaut, and Jennifer Stephens, 'Mapping as a Cultural Universal,' in  The Construction of Cognitive Maps , ed. Juval Portugali (Boston: Kluwer, 1996), pp1-16.)         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
