I have been sooo busy with work and catching up on sleep that when I do check my email writing on my blog just takes too much time.    Life in N. Ireland is good.  I was recently accepted to a graduate programme that is a 35 week internship/placement all paid.  I just have to find a company to work for.  It starts in October and I could end up in Asia, Australia, America, Canada, or somewhere in the Middle East.  God only knows.  But I made it this far which is a feat.  I have had to do an application, assessment with group work and now have to interview with individual companies.  I also have to start my dissertation before I head back state side in September.  For all of you Americanos there in the states I am gonna be in  Seattle at the end of Sept.  I would love to meet up.  Other than that I am just working insane hours at the Strand Bar here in Derry and trying to get back in shape after my marathon...I have only been running 3 times sine it ended...YIKES!    Well that is my life sorry I haven't been updating more often.                       Living in a foreign country can force one to think an awful lot. Even when its against their will.  However, I have come to realize that it is through this thought that I have grown, matured, lived.  As I was in bed unable to sleep last night I began to think of this world we live in and all its complexities.  Here I am in the North West part of Ireland (known to many as Northern Ireland) studying Peace and Conflict, yet I have discovered the essence of what I study is right before me (not in the form of a national problem, rather one that is intrapersonal)  The peace and the conflict.  Is it possible to help others deal and solve their conflict when you aren't able to solve your own?  I'm not sure.  Can you strive for world peace when there isn't even life peace in your life?  Still unknown.  But what I do know is that I want to make a difference in lives, and recently have discovered that maybe I need to start with my own...rather than looking from the outside in.  It could be best summed up by an illustration of my Professor, Dr. Paul Arthur, you need to get off the dance floor and into the balcony.  Only then can you truly make a difference to your life and others.                         So I have been flat out lately.  I went to Dublin for a basket ball tournament...more like a drinking marathon...and we got slaughtered by Trinity, however we had fun and some how in the last 2 minutes managed to play on the court with 6 players and didn't get called.  I like basket ball a lot more here....its less serious than in the states.  Our men's team won the plate (of the losers bracket) but that is great since Magee never wins ANYTHING!!! Now I am back for 5 days and will work 3 of them, have to write a paper, train for my marathon, and get ready to leave for Belgium on Saturday at 4am.    I will be in Belgium for a week hob nobbing with the likes of EU politicians and visiting NATO, not to mention visiting a concentration camp and other historical areas.  Speaking of hob nobbing...I was able to meet the Prime Minister of Ireland (and the current EU president), Bertie Ahern and Nobel Peace Prize winner John Hume last week when Mr. Ahern came and talked to the college about Peace within the EU.  So life has been full to say the least.  Now on to my real tangent.  I went out last night (it was the international students night in the union) and then after the union closed went home and got ready for bed....now by the time I finally get into my bed its 2am and suddenly the phone rings.  Its this boy who I haven't seen or talked to in weeks...I kissed him once but that was months ago.  So I get this call from this boy and he asks what I am up to and if I want to meet up later....WHAT....I AM IN BED.....NO I DON'T WANT TO MEET UP!!!!  So I just go back to sleep after telling him I am home in my bed.  Then this morning I wake up to 3 text messages, and a missed call!  Sheesh talk about a hard core booty call....what is with this people.  Boys...don't you understand?!?!?  You can't call a girl randomly after not talking for weeks and expect that she will jump at the chance to hook up with you!  It just doesn't work that way! And if it does for some girls they should be shot....Late night random booty calls are ok....but not when they are out of the blue.  Sheesh....  Ok. Tangent over.  Discuss.                       Well I am back in Derry...whew that was a quick trip.  I flew home to Montana on Thursday and then after 30+ hours of being awake yesterday finally got back to my house here.    Montana was brilliant, I had a great time, beautiful wedding, good friends, and no sleep.  I wish I had more time there but none the less I had a good time.  I am looking forward to September when I have more time to chill and relax.  And hopefully by that time it won't be snowing.  Yes folks you heard me correctly.  It was snowing back in Montana.  Yes its May, and yes there was snow.  Oh well.  I hadn't seen snow for a while and really had miss seeing snow in the Mountains.  I guess you just have to be careful at what you wish for...it may just come true 5 months later.    Now I am in Derry and have to look for jobs in the next few days.  ICK!  I need a job that is flexable and one that pays enough for me to pay my rent each month.  :)  Well these are the ramblings of Clementine....Enjoy!                       Why are goodbyes so stinkin' hard?!?!  It's like losing a part of yourself into an abyss of nothing, uncertainty, and sadness.  Starting from scratch but not willing or wanting to fill the void of one friendship with another.  What can you do to control the sadness that occurs when you walk by that friends house?  How do you react when you go to ring them and you realize they won't answer?  Is it possible to cope when you have something funny happen to you and they aren't there to share the moment with you?  What can you do to move on when you are used to spending every waking (and some sleeping) moment with one another?  Once you find a friend that compliments you so well how do you move on?    Making and maintaining friends is a process that should be a familiar one to me. Since I have lived in 5 cities, 2 countries, and traveled most of the EU all since I was 18.  But, each time I say goodbye to these friends it seems all that much more difficult.  Yes, I can get through almost any situation, be it a travel mishap or a housemate issue, but this friendship thing is a killer.    In an ideal world I would be able to have all my friends, that I have acquired over time, live in one place where we could always see each other and utilize our friendships as need be.  There would be no more goodbyes, no more tears, and no more contemplating when and how you will see one another again.  Moving away is like dying...somehow a part of you is missing, maybe not permanently but the sense of loss is always there.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
