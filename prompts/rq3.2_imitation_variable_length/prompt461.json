(by the way, TONS OF POINTS still available - maybe i should get a job at a movie store) worth 1000 points... it's a tough one - but there's&nbsp;a hint with the character name... no cheating!!!   urlLink Gib : I flunk English, I'm outta here. I gotta get a job, and you know what that means. That's right, they start me at the drive-up window and I gradually work my way up from shakes to burgers, and then one day my lucky break comes: the french fry guy dies and they offer me the job. But the day I'm supposed to start some men come by in a black Lincoln Continental and tell me I can make a quick 300 just for driving a van back from Mexico. When I get out of jail I'm 36 years old. Living in a flop house. No job. No home. No upward mobility. Very few teeth. And then one day they find me, face down in the gutter, clutching a bottle of paint thinner and why? Because you wouldn't help me in English.                      i'm fascinated today with laughter... why do some things bring smiles to our faces, an outburst of laughter or even a snort...  there are a few people in my life right now - and 2 of them happen to be father and son - who can make me have an outburst of laughter and usually a big snort without even saying a word... they look at me, and i lose it... it's great fun, but i can't explain it at all... i can't explain why certain things make me laugh and other people don't think it's one bit funny... strange... someone called me the other night and told me a story and prefaced it by saying, 'i thought that you'd be someone who would laugh at this...'  what a great thing to hear... that made me happy... even if the story hadn't been funny, which it was, i would have laughed anyway!!!  i like that sometimes when i smile too much my face hurts... and being around some people makes my face hurt because i smile too much... and sometimes i hate that when i'm giddy for some unknown (or known) reason, my face reveals me before i have a chance to talk... anyway, i hope that today your life is filled with laughter... it is a GREAT way to burn calories... we should all do more of it!!!  happy laughing!!!  today's quote worth 500 points to the first response: 'Bert: Uncle Albert, I got a jolly joke for just such an occasion. Would you like to hear it?  Uncle Albert: I'd be so grateful.  Bert: Well it's about me granddad, see, and one night he has a nightmare. So bad, he chewed his pillow to bits. Bits. In the morning, I says, 'How you feeling, Granddad?' He says, 'Oh not bad, a little down in the mouth'.  [They laugh]  Bert: I always say there's nothing like a good joke.  Uncle Albert: And that was nothing like a good joke.
