I like Leibniz.  At least in his thoughts I find some of my own.  The educational tensions we experience may stem more from the contradiction of being human as much as contradictions in pedagogy and  urlLink curriculum . It seems reasonable that we should inquire as to what makes learning real to students.  Just as it seems reasonable that we try to make ourselves 'real' to learners rather than 'fake.' Whatever may be the criteria for 'realness,' we sense that this matter is important.    Oddly, as educators we spend an interminable amount of time questing to understand knowledge (a philosophical branch called  urlLink  epistemology  ) but mostly shy away from  urlLink  metaphysics   (the branch of philosophy that grapples with matters of reality). Yet, the matter of 'realness' versus 'fakeness' continues to sneak up on us as it has through the ages from pre-Socratic times right up until the Wachowski brothers, who captured our imagination momentarily with the first   Matrix  installment.  Philosophers, artists, and scientists have been toying with 'reality' for the better part of the 20th Century and any  uncertainty  (Heisenberg) suggested by scientists can provoke peers to cry out, 'God does not play dice' (Einstein)!  It appears that contradictions are inevitable especially whenever a practical application is attempted.  Even when we give credence to the existentialist ideal that reality is merely  point of view , arguments never cease!  In general, scientists accept truth by consensus (more so than artists and philosophers?), for as long as skepticism exists and testing persists, there will always remain 'checks and balances.'  The trouble with philosophy and art, of course, lies in the fact that 'proof' is achieved through rational thought (i.e.,  a priori ).  Not easy to argue by  logic  alone!  Why anyone chooses to investigate problems that are insoluble has always puzzled the pragmatist (sometimes referred to as the 'practical' thinker).  The pragmatist, according to William James, is likely to 'turn his back resolutely and once for all upon a lot of inveterate habits dear to professional philosophers away from abstraction and insufficiency, from verbal solutions from bad  a priori  reasons.'  Should we wonder that American ideology was founded upon Pragmatists, particularly the educational system, since capitalism necessarily requires practical means?  Ah! Ideally, life ought to afford humans time enough for both philosophical musings and practical applications (if one so desires).  It takes pragmatism to navigate daily life, to find a companion, to raise children, to labor and to survive.  On the other hand, it takes a lifetime of contemplation to fall in love, to create art, to be curious about the world and to venture into the unknown.   PS I suspect that we have all practiced the art of  being real   or  faking it , at one time or another...(Nieminen vs Lecavalier anyone?)                       I hope Dieder will forgive me for putting a link to his  urlLink  blog  without first asking permission - which is mostly his book journal - but his latest post called 'Blogs hit the Web' with a link to Time Magazine is quite - well - timely!   And Sarah has also started her own  urlLink  blog  - her latest comments are responses to posts on Spord - some of you will be interested in reading.  I was thinking that an alternate assignment for the Scrapbook could have been creating your own Blog!  Dieder was able to include images (jpegs) that are either found on the web or (if you have personal server space) your own that you've stored.  I could have shown you how to do some  urlLink  simple html tags  to create links, block quotes, or to   italicize ,  bold , and  add color   ...etc.    I suppose a blog could appeal to many individuals...but then again...for some it may just seem like the same old assignment repackaged with a high tech twist... hmmm...  My practicum student, while introducing iBooks to her grade 2 class, said, 'They just accomplished in an hour what took me two weeks to master!'  The students were doing a web quest - seeking images - downloading them to the desktop and inserting them into a word document in order to manipulate the image. When I polled these 'savvy' 7 year olds, they informed me that they had been using computers and laptops (including wireless) since as early as the age of 2!!  Apparently TV is no longer the main competitor on our toddler's playtime...   Come to think of it, my two eldest had access to computers since they were toddlers also but the internet did not become sophisticated until they were well into their teens…so…the TV and the VCR were their buddies (and, later, video games like Mario Brothers). Yup…I can readily admit (sheepishly)…as a working mom…I will be forever grateful to Mr. Rogers, Mr. Dressup, Rainbow Brite, Sesame Street and the countless Disney movies...(especially The Secret of Nimh)   I was using the Internet as early as 1992, but by 1995 the World Wide Web was pretty much up and running as it is today with dueling browsers (a.k.a Netscape and Explorer), and my son was 6 yrs old!  He started downloading his favorite on-line games and playing with his friends across town since he was nine…  Now he’s an MSN and cell phone junkie…he surfs the web regularly for funny videos/blogs…he goes to a minimum of 3 movies per week (cheap theatres near home – great dating haunts for a 15 year old!) and watches 'The Family Guy' and 'Simpsons' on DVD – he reads voraciously (currently The Iliad) – plays Lacrosse religiously – and he was just presented with an athlete of the year award at his end-of-the-year assembly at school. While retro 60's, 70's and 80's are in...I'm afraid the 21st Century is truly his stomping ground!  I wonder what undergrads will say about technology by the time he's in university...  More things that make one say...hmmm...                         The surest way to corrupt a youth is to instruct him to hold in higher esteem those who think alike than those who think differently. -Friedrich Nietzsche    I was particularly struck by a commentary made on Radio-Canada 97.7FM (CBC French Radio) this evening.  The commentator was quoting Carl Jung (I wish I know from which text) who purportedly said that the conundrum we face in education exists in large part because teachers who enter the profession – having been trained from within the same system they themselves were educated - know no better.  As Gödel might have said, “This is a strange loop of logic indeed.”  It is peculiar that some statements appear to be self-evident though we often overlook the profundity found within the words (hearkening back to the effects of the “transparency” of words – no less due to the facility with which we use them).  Can we ignore the fact that each of us has been educated in similar educative constructs? Regardless of where we were educated or under which ideology – we have faced, to varying degrees, similar academic dysfunctions, i.e., performance excellence and competition, grading, academic achievements, standardized tests and so on.  I cringe from the idea that we are trying to teach children from within the same dysfunctional system we were once taught – but it is not easy to ignore this notion once it has been “spoken.”  And, consciously or not, perhaps that is why we collectively continue to extol the value of “reflective practice.”  There seems to be few solutions to changing one’s perspective than by contemplation – other than to visit another universe (or crawl out of the cave).  McLuhan declared, “If you want to know about water, don’t ask the fish.”  Another fish reference – but in some ways it leads us to wonder how we may “examine” our existence if we do not leave “the cave” (as Plato so admonished us to do – this one for Gail, as have Simon de Beauvoir and Maxine Greene, both of whom expounded on the power of “imagination” to help us to achieve new vistas)   In other words, I think about the idea of “institutionalization.”  Whether that originates in a community, an organization, or a “nation state” – how do we venture away from the “collective unconsciousness” of which Jung spoke?  We talk about curriculum constraints, and diversity within literacies that are ignored in light of cherished “reading and writing” forms, as well as assessment and evaluation paradoxes (particularly in physical and arts education), and many more laments of education.  How do we combat that which we continue to uphold?  How do we make visible the invisible?  That is to say, render opaque what is transparent? I don’t mean to act as though I understand the aphorism, “The medium  is  the message” but in my mind if we only attempt to unravel the content (i.e., message) and ignore the context (i.e., medium or the “thing” that transmits the content), we unconsciously miss what was actually “transmitted!”   I think, in general, we focus intently on the message and neglect that the medium plays an intrinsic role in conveying that message. We have been extolled to “listen” to the meaning of the “words.”  I suspect that like Dorothy, however, until we uncover the Wizard behind the Talking Head we are bound to “cower” from the message.  We are, at that instance, unable to uncouple the meaning of the “text” from the “thing” (i.e., medium) that controls the “text.”  It is no wonder we will say with equanimity when faced with vile rumors, “You ought to consider the source!” But the moment that the wizardry is revealed perhaps is the moment we are empowered to uncouple the medium and the message – to examine what is communicated from all angles – and to be free to act upon what we  know .  Uncovering 'the truth' (i.e., reality) for Dorothy allowed her to advocate for herself and others, forcing the Wizard to confer courage, brains and heart to her friends who possessed those qualities all along, and to find a way to return home.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
