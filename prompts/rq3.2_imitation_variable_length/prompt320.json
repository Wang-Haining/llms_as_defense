About my exams, about my future, about Pete... I don't know. I love him so much, but it would seem that he only said yes when I asked him out because he'd never had anybody ask him out before. I mean, he sent me all those sweet texts, and emails, and said he loves me, but when I asked him what he loved about me, all he could reply was 'the fact I seem to love him so much.' Is that really a basis for a relationship? I don't know. I'd love to spend all my time with him, because I love him, and I can see this lasting, but if that's all he loves about me... I mean, he said he's not terribly physically attracted to me, which is kind of a downer, because I was really hoping that this relationship would be different in that respect, PLUS he's called me podgy, which was for a reason, and I did ask why I'd get the p*ss ripped out of me if I went to one of his cricket matches. I'm still with him because I want to be, but I don't know if he wants to be. I'm just confused, I mean, is he just saying he loves me or does he actually love me and want to be with me for a long time?  And then there's still the whole thing with my mum. I would love to just ignore it and get on with my life, but I can't. I miss her, and although I don't want direct contact with her in a serious 'you're back in my life you're my mum again' kind of way, I would like to know how she is. I can't forget what she did and how she treated me, but in a way I've forgiven her. I mean, I must have forgiven her if I can say I don't care about what she did anymore. I... say that, but I don't know if that's true either. It may just be the fact that I wish I had someone to call mum or dad. I spoke to Malcolm about it a while ago, and I explained to him that he and Penny have been like a mum and dad to me, but he got really *rsey almost, about how he and Penny could never replace my parents. I just want to find somewhere stable, secure. I mean, I'm secure with my grandparents, butit's not the ideal situation. I'll be honest I'm not exactly happy with the way things are. Granted, I have a lot more freedom and such, but... I appreciate everything they've done for me, and they've always been there for me, but we're not getting on brilliantly at the moment. My grandad is just plain annoying. He's constantly asking me about stuff he knows I don't care about, he's always jumping on me when I'm doing something else. I get in from school and he comes straight up and says 'How was your day? What happened? How's everything? Are yous ure you're okay?' And I know it's only because he cares, but it's annoying. When I get in from school I automatically go into 'absent-minded not-caring tired stressed b*tch' mode, and he wonders why I bite his head off. I'm just really tired of it. I just want to be alone...  In the maths exam, with the compasses I didn't need, I was sitting there after finishing, contemplating picking a hole in my arm. I realised that'd be stupid, because it'd gain unwanted attention. But I'm home alone tonight, and I've found my grandad's brand new penknife, so I might cut. Just a little bit, to ease everything up. I want to and I feel like I need to. I've managed not to so far, and I'm just hoping I can last the week without it. I won't be able to all next week because I'm on holiday, which is about the only thing I'm looking forward to. I can't look forward to the stuff I'd planned with Pete anymore because I don't know if it's going to happen because I'm full of doubt. All I know is I love him with all my heart and I want to stay with him for the forseeable future.
