A concept formed by man, pretty much as a convenient way to measure moments in an accurate way. And it can be relative. A moment here can be less or more than a moment there, depending on various factors such as relative position and speed of movement of matter. Time is not something that is tangible.  How do you actually prove that time actually exist? Do you really feel it? It it really something that moves forward? Why can't it move in reverse, if it is moving at all.  After pondering this for a while at 4 in the morning (don't ask why I was still awake), I thought of a lateral way to interpret the concept of time. Instead of viewing it as something that is separate of us, it could be said that it is something innate to all reality. Consider this for a moment. If nothing ever changes, does time exist? In my view, time only exists if things change. That probably why things freeze in movies and on television shows when they try to show that time has 'stopped'.  Therefore, time only exists when matter moves, or evolves, so to speak. We could say that we are still occupying the same space as the dinosaurs did. Take away the application of the concept of time, and it just means that matter moved around a bit which resulted in us, mankind and the world that we know of, at this moment in space. How and why or how long matter took to move around is subsequently irrelevant for all intents and purposes.  That just one of the thought that I have recently been trying to grapple with.                     Well, i was just in one of my rhetoric moods just now. I was thinking of how sad it was that good friends can grow apart as you grow up.  You gain new perspectives as you grow and those might now be the same as your friends. Like you're in different realities. Sometimes you grow apart because of differeing views and sometimes it's because of circumstances. Some of which are not under your control but most of which that are.  Things like gaining a new idealogical beliefs, new social groups or just something as simple as getting a new job. Any of which can cause you to not make contact as often as you would like. I used to believe that it was their fault for not keeping in touch. But then i realized that I was as much at fault as anyone else in my life.  People walk in and walk out of your life. You can try to keep them from walking out but ultimately, it's their choice. Guess that's why you have to choose your friends carefully. But then again, if you are too guarded in your choices, you might be artificially restricting yourself. Ah the choices we all make.  I've had many good people in my life. It's sad to reminisce on the good times past as you know the chances of regaining those timeas are slim to none. So there's no use dwelling on them. But you don't want to discount their value in helping to shape you into the person that you are today. And yet, you don't want to let them hold you back from become the person that you're going to be tomorrow. Sigh.  This doesn't happen much when you're a teenager but it starts when you reach adulthood. You wish to be as carefree as you were then. Letting your parents worry for you. Reality was just for other people. You lived in a cocoon, in your own world.  Ah the good old days.                     So another month has gone by. And of course, seeing as how my life is pretty much stagnant, nothing much happened. Well, except for the stuff I'm gonna talk about now.  I finally completed the beta version of the tradenet website. Of course, this was after much dragging of both feet (well, waddaya expect?). Kept adding and improving it. Probably gonna register a domain and get the site up and running by the middle of january 04. The delay being attributed to a lack of funds, and a means of which to transfer it to the web hosting company. My partner is gonna get his credit card in january, so that's when we're gonna set up the site.  And how could I forget the other main thing that happened. I flunked accounting. Oh my god. I flunked. I guess I could see it coming, from the moment I got out of the exam hall after the paper, I pretty much knew. I just flunked with 47 outta 100. I dunno. Is it worse flunking knowing that you are so close to passing or worse is you flunked badly? I'm guessing the former. Well, just cos it's borderline, I put in an appeal to the course coordinator. Not hoping for much but at least there is hope.  On the borght side, I did get distinctions for law and economics. I suppose that if you like a course, youre more motivated to do well in it. But then , you'd like a course if you find it easy to understand. Hmm, a catch 22 situation.  Well, Gonna get the appeal result this week. Crossing my fingers there. Other than those things of note, nothing much has happened. Guess that's it for now. Till next time.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
