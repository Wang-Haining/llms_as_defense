 this isn't my main blog anymore, though i haven't posted there either in a long time either, until just a few minutes ago that is, but there it is.but i'll post here too.  this blog will be mostly about my life as a gay guy per se, my coming out process (i'm out publicly, but i don't think word has gotten everywhere yet for instance), my search for a boyfriend, for a life partner / husband and all that great stuff!my chronic pain situation is gradually getting better, and i'm in better spirits about my situation and have more hope about my future.  congratulate me!i'm searching, friend- and boyfriend-wise, basically on http://www.gay.com in the seattle and seattle north chat rooms, where my 'nym is ihy.  you can look for me there!  i've had some interesting chats on gay.com over the years.more l8r.  cya, dear reader, dear friend.                        hey, peeps, just added a new link!  *please*, every single day click on the link to The Hunger Site.  there, completely free of charge to you, you can click on a link which gives food to the hungry!  also there are tabs at the top of that page which take you to four other charity sites where you can do the same kind of thing!  i'm making it a practice, at least once a day, to go to all those five sites (all accessible, remember, from The Hunger Site) and click on each of those five links 108 times, being one mala's worth of clicks.  i've also become a Friend of each of those five sites, for $30 each, which doubles (or in the case of The Rainforest Site *triples*) the amount of money i call down from their sponsors for each click at each of those sites!  it's a wonderful way to do charitable giving, especially seeing as it costs you nothing unless you choose to become a Friend of one or more of those five sites.  it's free!  it's good!  it only costs you a click of your mouse, a *tiny* little effort!  you can help, and help genuinely and easily!  *please*, do this, for the sake of the Living Good.  *thank* you, all of you who do this to any degree at all.  one site feeds the hungry, another gives free mammograms to underprivileged women, another takes care of children's health, another preserves our rainforests, and the fifth feeds rescued animals, all of which are worthy causes in my book.  i think their idea of arranging for calling down money from their sponsors is brilliant!  but they need your mouse click or it won't work!i luv u, my reader my friend, never forget that.  accept my gift to you of the gift of giving easily.                        hey, peeps.  i'm working on a *really* big project and my confidence is growing a lot.  it's all about making everyone truly happy, which is right along my lines.  someday in the not distant future i long to have a boyfriend to help me in my work and my play and my life in general.  i even envision myself marrying a boyfriend and sticking together for the *really* long haul.  i mean, i intend to live a long time, plus there's no such thing as death of the self anyway!  i'm very much an idealist, as you've probably gathered dear reader dear friend, and my boyfriend needs to be in harmony with my ideals and work.  you see, i'm building a group, a very special group of dedicated and sworn friends, upholding the highest ideals and helping each other in every relevant way to be truly happy and to support the true happiness of all who live.  i believe in noble, even holy, idealism.  and i believe in you, dear reader dear friend.  i don't believe in accidents or *mere* coincidences, and there's a reason for your reading my blog.  you are *meant* to.  and so i love you and welcome you and, well, l8rz...                        those financial-type visitors are still here.  i wish they'd leave soon, meaning them no offense, so i can have a good opportunity to have that special little talk with my folks.  i feel a great urgency about this coming out thing all of a sudden, thanks to my old friend turning out to be gay too giving me a sudden burst of courage.  see, i want to do this while this bout of special courage lasts.  that's part of my feeling of urgency.  i think it *will* last anyway, but just to be on the safe side...  i really need to do this for my happiness' sake.in other news, i've decided to add some more exercises to my workout routine.  currently all i'm doing is 30 minutes on a treadmill every day, which of course is important and a great thing for me to do in and of itself, but i want to add exercises to tone and shape the rest of my muscles too, for health's sake, for beauty's sake, for my potential boyfriends' sake and all that great stuff.  i'll start with some easy isometric exercises to start building my musculature more, then graduate to training with weights soon after that.  of course, i need to actually *get* the weights, but that can be done of course.  all we have at home is a pair of 2-pound hand weights, which isn't much except as a bare start.  i've found this website which has a sort of personalized trainer computer program and descriptions of a bunch of exercises.  i guess when i graduate from isometrics i might start with the few exercises there that don't require weights or machines, especially if i haven't gotten my weights yet to train with.  i'm determined to get my body into top shape, as a good thing in every way.  l8r...                        hey, peeps.  you know what, my dear reader my friend?  i love you.  that might sound corny and/or weird and/or unrealistic, but really properly analyzed it's not.  i love all living beings on general principles.  and i recommend that as a good way to be.  what does it mean that i love you, even not particularly knowing you well?  it means that i recognize you as a precious living being, deserving of happiness and its causes and deserving to overcome suffering completely.  it doesn't mean i know you personally and approve of your every characteristic.  i don't have to to love you as i do.  i wish you every happiness and no suffering at all.  a word of advice:  avoid malice like the plague.  i've decided that malice is the root cause of every suffering.  don't invest yourself in malice, even in subtle ways.  and don't fear malice.  by that i mean neither be afraid of (fear) malice nor obey (fear) malice.  and by malice i mean the wish and/or intention that someone suffer, in whatever way in whatever degree, be that yourself or someone else.  never punish yourself, cause that's a form of malice and you'll suffer for it.  and *noone* deserves to suffer.  dangerous people deserve to be quarantined so they don't harm people, but they don't deserve to be punished in the sense of being made to suffer.  imagine what the world would be like without any malice at all!  seriously, imagine it.  think about it.  invest your energy like that into making the world free from malice.  even those *thoughts* actually help, i promise!  thought power is a very real thing, and it has a greater effect upon oneself and others than most of us have been trained to imagine.  use it well.  use it joyfully to abandon malice in all of its forms.  i *promise* you you'll be making good karma that way and *will* be rewarded.  invest yourself well into the abandonment of malice and you'll be rewarded mightily.  this is no exaggeration.  the reward might take a while to reach you, but it *will* come.  this is a total promise.  we *can* eliminate malice, and we *will* eliminate malice.  this is a vow of mine as well as a promise.  so, dear reader dear friend, remember that i love you.  and write to me if you need a friend, 'cause i vow that i'll be as good a friend to you as circumstances make practical.  l8rz...      \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
