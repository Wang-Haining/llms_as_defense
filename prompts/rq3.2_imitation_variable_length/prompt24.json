Only in America - are there handicap parking places in front of a skating rink.  Only in America - do drugstores make the sick walk all the way to the back of the store to get their prescriptions while healthy people can buy cigarettes at the front.  Only in America - do people order double cheeseburgers, large fries, and a diet coke.  Only in America - do banks leave both doors open and then chain the pens to the counters.  Only in America - do we leave cars worth thousands of dollars in the driveway and put our useless junk in the garage.  Only in America - do we buy hot dogs in packages of ten and buns in packages of eight.  Only in America - do they have drive-up ATM machines with Braille lettering.  Only in America - are the least useful professions (professional athletes, movie actors & entertainers) paid so disproportionally much compared to people with normal jobs.                        SA2B's  GANG    EPISODE 2 Here, Kitty, Kitty, Kitty   One day, everyone was sitting around the room, bored. 'Where the heck could Sa2b be?' inquires Camo. 'He's been gone for quite a while,' Knumchuck points out. 'He'll be here soon, don't worry,' Foxy says, reassuringly. Suddenly, the door bursts open and in walks Sa2b. 'Hey, guys, guess what?' 'Oh, you mean guess what you were doing for THREE FREAKING HOURS?!?!?' exclaims Camo. 'Noooo, guess where we're going!' 'Where?' asks Foxy, excitedly. 'We're going to DISNEY WORLD!!' screams Sa2b. 'YAAAAAAAAYY!!' everyone yells. 'ONWARD!' Sa2b says, as they all vanish.  Reex Cave, Subterranean Disney World Sa2b, Knumchuck, Camo, and Foxy appear in a puff of smoke. 'Where are we?' Camo asks. 'Dude, didn't you read the subtitles? It said we're in Reex cave, obviously a walk-through ride at this new part of the park called 'Subterranean Disney World,'' explained Sa2b, as he broke the fourth wall. 'Well, let's find the exit,' Knumchuck suggests. While everybody walks off, Camo is busy looking at the rock formations. 'These look too real to be fake....' Suddenly, a red cat with dark red stripes wearing a black tanktop and denim shorts bumps in to Camo. 'Sorry,' she says. As she is saying that, Camo notices that she has orange hair, red eyes, and three orange circles on her forehead and temples. She then runs off. When Camo catches up to everyone, he asks, 'Hey, did any of you see that gi-' He is cut off when Sa2b grabs the top of his head and turns it in the direction they are looking. Camo suddenly sees this huge, blue, gelatinous monster with green tentacles all over its body. 'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!' they all scream. The monster turns and sees them and lets out a huge roar right in thier faces. The four try to run away, but the monster grabs them and starts squeezing. You see, if serious pressure is inflicted on Sa2b and his friends, there powers have no effect.

Anyways, even though SI is working through a story, I'm gonna type a short story about LALALAND! and stuff.    Typical Day in Lalaland.        I'm sitting at the rollarcoasters engine, trying to figure out what to do to make it even faster than it already is, when I see Alec, who runs the hotel, run very fast past me. I quirked my eyebrow, and walked in the opposite direction from which Alec was running. I see that all my fellow co-workers and friends are standing in front of a blazing inferno *KOOOOL!* Then I relized that it was a fire of fun and prettiness *which it usually is* and that it is actually the hotel. I knew know one else was there at the moment, cause it's MCAS time, dont cha know, and that people weren't burning alive. Erm. Anyways, I turned to Mandy, who runs the gift shop and asked 'What happened here?!!??!?!?' She doesn't answer me, so I turn to my friend Gage, who runs the tea shop, and see him stareing at Alec, who as just run back with a strange looking charactar by the collar. 'Fix this, Camo!' Camo, the weird guys name, (Camo: I am not weird!!! Me: Shut up *throws random object...and misses*)says with an attitude, 'And what if I don't wanna?' Alec gives him a serious look and says in a stern voice, 'Then I'll make you face Katt on DDR 1 million google times.' Camo looks horror stricken then, and fianlly gives in and says, 'Fine!' I stood back and watched Camo laugh manically as he put the flames out and Gage rolling his eyes, saying under his breath, 'Pryo/hydromaniacs...' I saw that the entire hotel was burnt to a crisp. 'Bye!' Camo shouted, just as the hotel re-appeared again *POOF!* only, this time it was green. So, at the end of the day, we all went back to our jobs, and I just tried and tried to figure out the rollarcoasters guts spilled out all over the floor. The end! PS-Camo is not the antagonist in the story. He's like both!
