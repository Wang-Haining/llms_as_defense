  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic:\n\n       well like i said you never know wats gonna happen. life is very strange and i seem to have led quite a weird one.  life dosent seem it would be hard but you have to work and do all this other stuff just to survive. life can be cruel but so can i i just seem to muddle through existance its not my fault that bad stuff seems to happen to me. life to my is like a choclate box cause you never know what your gonna get. gee that was weird...... well my mind seems to drift off latly i just cant seem to stay focused on any particular thing.  i always seem to get down easily i dont know why but i do. like today i went out and all i wanted to do was go home life is so very confusing some days all you want to do is roll over and die. life just gives you so many questions that you want answerd but youll never get the chance to answer all the questions you want answerd like why is the sky bluei know there is a scientific explain but who wants to hear crap said by people in white coats not that all scientists wear white coats but hey i'm just generalizing. i'm not trying to sound like a git but i dont really want all my q's answerd i mean if i knew everything that i wanted to know what would be worth living for if youve got no questions to think about.  to me life is an ever expanding question that just keeps getting bigger and bigger dont get me wrong some times things can get answerd but most of the time life just continues with out you and youll never have enough time to answer it all.  if i were to ramble on about all this stuff i would pobally start to get boring.its like listening to the same song over and over again at some point you will think get that shit off its driving me insane so i will stop writing about this subject who knows i might finally find what subject i find dear to my heart but i doubt it. thats what i like about my life i always find things to change.                 You would think that i have run out of things to say in a space of an hour but hey my mind is still brimming with creative jucies. i have decided not to tell my friends about my blog i think i would get sympathy from people if they knew what i was like on the inside i dont want things to change with people but i will tell you this if they do find my blog good for them but dont spread the word to heaps of people well you can if you want i'm all for it but hey just be the smae i'm not differnt now that you know more about my life stuff that i find hard to talk about and dont get offended if i say something abot you i still consider you a friend even though i dont show it much.  i dont know what made decide to lay out my thoughts in chapters i mean i'm not aiming for a book or anything to me it just felt like the most differnt thing to do mind you there are provally heps of people deciding to write like this but i dont care i'm just writing like this because i feel the most comfortable doing it this way.  its simple to see that i have a lot of things on my chest that i prob want off but i dont want to see a psyche i'm not crazy well you dont have to be to see a psyche but i think i feel the most comfortable writing my thoughts well typing my thoughts that is so lets start from some where i havent already gone.  well i'm single i have no one that i'm keen on and i dont really care if some one likes me well good for them if they do but if they dont let me know how they feel about me how can i feel anything back i mean you have to put something in to get some thing back.  i've never had a real keen interest to write but writing this blogg just seems so natural. so i think i will press on.  i have a lot of good friends but there are some people that i just cant stand for one thing or another. have you ever just got the feeling when your talking to someone then stuff that they usually do just starts to get on your nerves i have that feeling all the time latly. i just cant seem to get things off my cest maybe thats why i started this blog. for some reason i just keep switching topics thats prob just how i feel like writing/typing.  i'm really into computer games for someone that dosent know which i doubt any of you would is that i cant wait for Half-life 2 it just seems like the perfect game for me it just looks like all the stuff i wanted in a game is i there.  but enough about my nerdyness in games i just like to say is that i have contemplated death a few times. Yes i do mean dying. i mean i would neverb really do it but i get that depressed it just seems like the only option out. now that i am at this school i have a lot less of those feelings but i still get quite depressed then i just fake that i'm tired. i just cant seem to get anything straight i dont know whether it is just every thing moving too fast in my life or that i just dont really care on what happens throughout my life who knows cause i surly dont i mean i dont want to kill my self but  have contemplated on it.  but ive always wonderd what death looks like a lot of people sya hes a hooded creature clad in black with a scythe but who knows it could be this beautiful woman or this stunning dragon or it could be this hobo that lives up the road. who knows cause i surly dont but hey i'm open to sudgestions even if is to help me with my spelling.  i mean if i really were to commit suicide it would mean missing out on all the good things in life s kids my message to you is dont youll one day regret the day you did(even though youll be dead) but you just dont know whats around the corner. it might be the love of your life or it could be the best thing thats ever happend to you in your life so just old on and see what comes you just dont know what is out there.  i mean i'm not trying to be cynical or anything its just my view of my life so who knows what will happen around the corner i surly dont.  but i'm dabbeling on you just dont want to see me keep ranting on but if thats what you want i can but hey.  some people consider me to be one of the funniest people theyve met but i don't know i could be but who knows i dont rekkon i'm that funny.  i think i have found my passio in life and that is editing and i mead film editing i just love it i'm like the top in my class (Yr12 Media if you were wondering) but when i do it i just have rthat much joy for it i just find it that fun. who knows mabey one day i just might make it nto the industrey heres to hoping its the only thing you can do.  i'm not a real fan of sport but i do enjoy a good round of golf for some reason it just fells so relaxing when you just going at your own pace.  so i'll leave you with this is that if i have learned anything at all it is that life is the mst precious thing you can have and if you abuse it your a fool.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
