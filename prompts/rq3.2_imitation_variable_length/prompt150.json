I can't wait! more drama in other peoples lives... Josiah can no longer go to prom with Molly, since he is going to New York for national dace competiton, and that girl is PISSED. Naomi is naturally quite happy about this arrangement, but *shhh* i didn't tell you that. Also, since Richard isn't going to prom, his special date from New York won't be comming. Well i supose Richard won't be too mad since they will be in NY anyway. But, that means Brittany and Richards plans are ruined. Details: they hate Naomi and don't want her in Josaiah's life or something lame like that, so they set up this huge thing to get Molly to ask Josiah to prom. I dunno how the whole thing goes, but it is very interesting. I really don't know why Richard wants Josiah dating Molly, since Richard wishes Josiah was gay... maybe he is hoping Molly would be a terrible girlfreind.....  ahhh, that feels good to gossip, i wish i had something in MY life to talk about, but i don't... oh well.                      meh...   that is a 'i wish my life were more interesting 'meh'' just so you know, really nothing special happened today, im so jelous of dylan who can make even the most mundane things seem interesting.... i think i will make something up  today, when i was in math class i was talking this test, and it was really hard. well i finish the test and stuff and im all like 'WOAH I HOPE I DID GOOD' because i talk in all capital letters now. anyway, i hand in the test and i turn around to my desk, and there is a peanut on my chair. im like 'WOAH, THERE IS A PEANUT ON MY CHAIR, I WONDER WHY' and i look over and there is this squirrel sitting on Megan's head. and she just has this big smile on her face. i have no idea how a squirrel got in my math  class, but that doesn't mater cuz i just broke up with my boyfreind.  wow, maybe i should be happy with my dull life, because that story sounded totaly drama queen, especialy the end. but actually i do have a couple true stories. like the other day, my mom comes in the house and hands me some efferdent, im so confused. i don't have dentures, she just gives me this efferdent. yea, she later explained it was for my retainer, but still, i was confused for a while. also, today at rehersal, i was playing with the draw string for the curtain, it has a big metal thingy on the end, so it swings crazily and is fun to play with. anyway, im playing with it, and it swings around the curtain and i hear durran say 'OH CRAP' and i look around to see him removing it from his face with a tramatized look on his face. i scared him with it and hit him in the face, it was hilarious. also that was the only time i heard him talk off stage. he is so quiet, i think he is intimdated by us theatre kids because his grilfreind says he thinks we are weird. i wonder why he tried out for the play if he thinks we are weird. oh well, he is cute so i can fatasize about sucking face with him.  well i think i shall go eat my munchies now, as i am quite hungry.                      big update   ok, so i realise i have not updated since before i went to florida, except that one that was just for the sake of updating.  flordia was awsome, i had a total blast, i think i could have spent the whole week in just downtown disney with a crapload of money, but then i couldn't have gone to the other places. i got lots of neet things in the japan store at epcot. one night at downtown disney cathrine, ashley and i had fun using gaydar to figure out who was or who wasn't gay, we got about 53 i think, just in one night. that could be because june is pride month and the orlando gay days were fast approaching. while i was there i discovered a cool gay mag called genre. i also bought this totaly ghey shirt in the 'cirque' store. i could go on for hours and hours about florida, but that might bore you.  anyway, i got home and  my dad found my genre and threw them away, i recovered them by sneaking out of the house at 2 in the morning before garbage day. it was cool.  other than that i have been spending the last month or two working. i have a fairly nice tan i supose.  i told jocie and joah about jeff tonight (lots of 'j's lol) jocie didn't seem to take it too well (sorry hun... don't feel bad i understand) but joah was happy for me. i still need to tell kim, i don't know how that will go over.... anyway, that is about it, no really juicy details...                      horray!   first off, gym was actually fun today! we had a free day so jocie and I made up games involving the medicine ball, which had the amusing propertey of being heavy in air, but incredebly light in water, barely sinking. first we tried to play blitzball with it, but since when you threw it it would go forward about 2 feet then start its slow decent, we gave up. then we went looking for this torpedo that travels through the water very well, didn't find it, so we tried to play keep down with the tenis ball, that didn't work, so we finaly moved on to playing catch with the medicine ball. it made cool splashes. but catch is too boring for us non jocks so we started to play water calvin ball till the end of the period. it was good.  after school, i had work. Andy wasn't there. if i  haven't explained Andy yet, i will just say he is hot, and go into further detail tommorow. oh, and i was working at the pool, my summer job, not party america. anywho, we were cleaning the pool with hydrochloric acid, and i can still smell it. that stuff burns like crazy. but now the pool is clean *happiness* after work i decided to drive around the park in my scooter, and then some other guy had a scooter, not like mine, one that is shorter, and is like those lame razor ones only with a pretty nice motor, and a low seat. anyway i was driving along and he comes up behind me and asks how fast it goes. we get into a breif conversation and end up racing through the park, it was wonderful coz once we got past the cars/pedestrians i beat his ass. then i went to kims, nothing eventful there         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
