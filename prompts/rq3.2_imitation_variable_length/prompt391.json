Kristine picked me up @ 10 a.m. and we went to TVHS to turn in our UC essays to Ms. Cutler. Well, we go there and Ms.Culter replies---'You didn't double-space?' At that point, I think my face blanched. I swear (and I doubled checked) that this lil bit of info was NOT in the instructions. So Kris and I rushed to my house, where we promptly had to retype her essay and print mine out with the correct spacing. When she was done typing it was 15 minutes to 11 a.m., our deadline. As I was finishing my corrections, I told her to warm up the car. It felt like we were doing a heist. lol. I then rushed out of my house like a mad woman into her car that was ready to go and we sped off (hmmm... I wonder how fast we were driving?). Kris pulled up to the front office and I  ran  out of the car to deliver the essay on time (last I checked we still had 5 minutes at the stoplight). lol I didn't even shut the car door. What an adventure! We're always doing crazy things like that. lol.  Anywayz, afterwards we treated ourselves to some Ben and Jerry's, which is surprisingly cheaper than B&amp;R. We were in the Town Plaza, so Kristine wanted to look at the pottery store, Painted Earth. We ended up staying there for about 3 1/2 hrs painting little star shaped ceremic boxes---she had also decided to do a ceramic car for her boyfriend. It was a ton of fun and way relaxing. teehee I got to get in touch w/ my creative, artsy side!                            I'm only 16!I can't be losing my hair! That's for  really  old people! My hair stylist, Rozban, said so and tells me that it's probably due to stress. She informed me (and my mom) that stress can be caused by a wide range of troubles---academics, parents arguing, etc. Ha! I knew it! My family does give me stress. But I still want to keep my hair!! So, I'm suppose to use my mom's special shampoo b/c it's ph balanced w/ other good hair-care qualities. I always thought losing a little hair was normal (avg person loses 40 strands a day) but I guess in my case it's not a little but enough to start thinning my hair! WHY ME??!! Well, my session went nicely after that lil shocker. I had it cut to long layers so it's still mid-back. I luv that length! When I was little, I had long, straight hair but an unfortunate hair cut accident w/ my dad in the 3rd grade left me w/ hair chopped right below my ears!  Anywayz, Rozban styled my hair quite nicely afterwards (I was going to take my senior pics later). Shiny and sleek with bouncy curls at the ends. Best haircut ever! Made me forget about the whole 'hair ' thing. Besides if I use that shampoo, my hair should stop doing  that  and return to a healthy state in 3 weeks. She's also giving me a deal on this hair serum from Avaeda that keeps hair shiny and soft. It really does pay to have connections w/ a hair stylist. ^_^                            I woke up around noonish...again. I really need to sleep earlier. But anywayz, I walked downstairs into the kitchen because I was told that my friend Kristine had called. As soon as my mom saw me she asked for my help. She needed help to order her name badge and business cards for her new career as a realtor because she's absolutely clueless when it comes to the internet and anything else computer-related.  I tried  to be patience. I  honestly  did. But that's hard to do when I wake up late so I still a little achy, I haven't had anything to eat, and she keeps questioning me on wheather  I'm  doing the right thing. So I got snappy. End resullt: I'm responsible for her now snappy mood. ::sigh:: That's life.      I really  can  be patient and understanding but  not  after I wake up or if I have an empty stomach. And it's even worse if I'm related to the person I'm being crabby at because I won't feel much, if any, qualms about lashing out first before assessing the situation.       She told me that she doesn't snap at me when I ask for help. But oh is she wrong! She does it when she's very frustrated. She compare my behavior to my dad's, which I find insulting. She says that she didn't learn anything because I was too fast. Hmmm...well if she had  said  something oh I dunno...maybe I would have stopped. She also said she asked me at that moment for help because she didn't want to bother me later---when I'll probably be more content because my morning crankiness is gone?? If I had said later, she would have called me selfish and lazy, which is what she called me after this little episode anyway! Well, now she's out running errands. I've calmed down---I've had bowl of moose tracks ice cream, chocolate does do the mind good. Hopefully, she'll be calmer when she gets back. She won't drop what she said but what else can I expect? ::sigh::        \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
