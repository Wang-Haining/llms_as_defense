'Hell yes, we have color, what are you, stupid?'     Imagine videos.  Really good videos.  Really  great  videos.  No, I'm not talking about Tom Green on DVD or even porn.  I'm talking about the  Sean Show *.  Yeah, I have some great ideas cooking in my little head and they need to be filmed, but this is where I run into a problem.  I do not own a video camera, and people who do are incredible tight asses!  Yes, you guessed it, I, Sean Berwick, the one and only abuser of commas, am asking  YOU , yes  YOU  for help.  Please lend me your video camera every once in a while or...   Send any donations to the Sean Needs a Goddamn Video Camera fund! 1084 Queen Street West - Unit 32b Mississauga, Ontario, Canada L5H 4K4 (People who know me can always donate personally)   Not only will you get a sweet ass hug (or the female variant known as an ass grab), but people who donate will receive  a FREE secret prize !**  SWEET!  Oh, and I am also currently accepting souls if you have an extra you could spare.   * Show name subject to change. ** You only get a prize if A) I feel like it. B) You're liked by me (see the COPS post).                       Sean here.  If you are easily offended, don't read this...  assuming you can read...    The majority of rap artists  these days don't make their own music.  Now, lets just say, hypothetically, that the music industry was about  music , they wouldn't have jobs, n'est pas? So, really, what are these guys getting paid for?  Oh yeah, they can rhyme.  You see, back when I was in  kindergarten  I also learned how to rhyme.  Why am  I  not making millions? I must have used proper grammar or real words, or maybe it's because I did not mention my 'gat' enough. So in pseudo-conclusion, they are getting payed to flash their bling, and shake their tail feathers.  What the hell?!  Millions of people work hard, get educations, get jobs that help today's work force, and by the time they die they will not have made a third of what these  artists  are making.  Problem number 1:  Rap artists + Money = More Rap Artists  You see, a rap artist can coast his way through life.  After making billions, his brother says, 'Yo, G, can you loan me a record deal or two, bro?'  Problem number 2:  This means the more rap artists we have now, the more dumbass rap artists we will have in the future.  I call it the  Parabola of Brothas  effect.  y = x^2  .'. Sean goes on a rampage and destroys the earth. And because it's in popular culture, kids will eat out of these turds' hands.  Problem number 3:  The future, a generation of illiterate gang members.  If you're not in a gang, ask yourself this, how many people do you know who are in gangs?  Now how many of them can spell 'intelligence', 'employment', or 'literacy'?  Exactly. The only problem is, anyone who complains will get a 'cap' in their ass.   Thank god for skaters.   Don't get me wrong I'm not super pro-punk, but they are the positive to the Thug negative.  I'd like to see a huge gangs vs. skater war, no guns, unless you're a big pussy.  Jackass rap dildos.  Grr.  'Payce' [ GRR! ], Sean                     Guess whaaaaaaaaaaaat... =D  Sean Berwick, yes me, the awesomest of all that is awesome, has finally set up his home server!  Hosting hooray!  I will divide this introduction into two sections;    Basically,   This means I will host Audio, Video, Art, Text, and other stuff all one one   urlLink big huge server   known as my computer.  You can see all my stuff, and if you want, send me your stuff over MSN Messenger and I might post it! =D    But technically,   My 802.11b router had to be disconnected for the site to work.  Unfortunately, we need to have the router up so my mom can use the other computer that is networked to it, so until I find out how to negociate the site and the router to work together, there will be a problem.  If you have any information on how I could solve that, please inform me at stringtheory@gmail.com.  If you need details, it's a microsoft wireless router, 802.11b as I said before, and my server is running on Faststream NETFile 6.6.  I'm guessing the quickest solution is to use different hosting software, but this is free and yeah.  Well, I hope you guys like the changes! Keep checking for updates.  Love, Sean                      LEGAL, READ THIS:  By reading anything beyond this point you agree that you will not take any of this opinion as fact or seriously in any way, and will not use it as motivation of any kind for any action. You also agree that the person who wrote this is in no way responsible for anything you do.     If you're going to slit your wrists, how about instead of talking about it you  finish the job ? Cutting your wrists = suicide! What a novel idea! I'd go out on a limb and say the world is better off without you taking up our air, and our black paint, and our ugliness. Nevermind, keep the ugliness, just GO, or in the words of my outspoken, unnamed internet buddy, GTFO! I'll  pay  you to die. PLEASE. JUST GTFO, I DON'T WANT YOU HERE ANYMORE. LEAAAVE. Jackasses, get a friggin' I.Q.. Here's some truth to cry about; no one loves you. That's why you're a Goth in the first place right? Same with 'hardcore anarchists'. Anarchy, as far as I know, comes from the French  laissez-faire , which means 'let it be'. I'm pretty sure it was a pseudo-neutral political party. Anarchy doesn't mean rebel, it means leave shit alone! Quite the opposite if you ask me.     A new guy at school, I think his name is brain-dead moron, once said to me, 'You know, total anarchy can't exist because there will always be one organization to take down all the others.' Hey, dildo, do you know what anarchy means? No? Eat my rubber. You know the evolution of the human race is slowed every day by people like you? No? Eat my plastic. I actually think I'd prefer looking at feces over looking at an 'anarchist' because that way I don't have to brace myself for inane remarks. Everyone on earth exists because there is some agreement between the people that live on earth.  If you don't agree, then don't live. It's that simple.     In conclusion, the more you brag about being an anarchist or a Goth or a shit head, the more you deserve to be shot, and when I become president of the world, you will see just how right I am. Want to have a cause? Want to be against a cause? NO! NO NO NO! Maddox put it best in the heading 'Looking for a safe stance on abortion? Me neither', and I'd say it's safe to replace 'abortion' with anarchy, atheism (or religion in general), feminism, or any other stupid cause that these inbreds can come up with. I'm starting a cause. It's called   logicism  . Get smart or GTFO. I urge you to be  logicist , too. You know why I can force people to join my cause? Because technically the people who aren't  logicist  are stupid, and I'm right. Do you want to be stupid? Then don't join my cause. If you are smart, feel free to call yourself  logicist , and go enforce your extremely correct opinions on others, and keep working at it until one day you're almost as right as I am.  Love, Sean                      Everyone who reads this will hate it. But,  I do give Lord of the Rings credit for being the  least  bit interesting. You know whyyyyy? Because Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings are very well made movies. They're made so well that even if you hate the movie, after you see it you will enjoy it. I hate both, because;  a)  The Neverending Story  was shorter. b) Wizards, talking trees, massive computer generated wars, there is only so much I can take. c) Harry Potter, written by some homeless dyke mom who is a good writer, was created to be read to her little kids.  The books got published, and somehow it was not only little kids who read the little kids books. Now she's really rich.  If Harry Potter is your thing, then, whatever, but something's not right when you try to act uber mature and then you go put your wizard hat on to catch the first release at 1:30 AM. It's just not possible.   I would rather see someone get stabbed through their temples, or better yet,  I  would rather stab  myself  through the temples than watch someone who hasn't hit puberty go to a fictional school (HP). Also, I don't know much about Harry Potter, but they all talk like they're from the UK, and I detest the UK. It's just not possible.   The only thing I hate more than Harry Potter are the retarded parents who tried to  BAN  the book! OMG! He's casting a spell, call the pope.  The whole thing is messed up, you have university graduates reaching climax at the thought of seeing the new movie, and you have parents trying to ban a childrens book!  It's just not not not possible.  Lord of the Rings on the other hand is okay. I finally watched the first one, and it was not bad. Yes, that's right, everyone who tried to get me to see the movie but I refused, there you have it. I might actually consider it a great movie if a third of the characters weren't  the gayest things anyone could come up with, ever . Overall though, LOTR is okay, but Harry Potter...Come on...
