Bah, this is really only a test blog. I could tell you how crappy my day has been so far, but do you really wanna hear my whining on my debut blog? I should be all 'Oh wow! I have a blog! Yay for me! I am so exicted! You're all gonna love me!' Stuff that.  I've actually made this blog as in about four months I am going to Japan. Exciting, ne? I will be a kindergarden teacher for three months at this place called Chibikkoland which means little kiddy land in japanese. My boyfriend prefers to call it Chocobo Land. I think I would prefer to raise chocobos, but only if I got to do it in cosplay. But I digress... So yeah, the primary function of this blog is to share my tales of craji Japan with all my friends, so that I don't have to send out mass generic emails, and those emails I do send to ppl are more personal.  I don't know where exaclty I'm going yet, I have to wait for their call. But when I know, I'm sure everyone will hear about it!  bah, move along, nothing more to see here....          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
