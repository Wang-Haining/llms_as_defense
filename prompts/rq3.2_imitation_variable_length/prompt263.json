Well,i've been asked to share on youth sunday about God's goodness,or anotherwards how God has been good to me.i'm pretty nervous n scared i'll screw up!i've just gotten an email from benny which goes like this:  'Can I have a peek on your sharing for Youth Sunday this coming Saturday. Remember, God's goodness to you as a personal experience... maybe retell a story? Definitely not a bible study on God's goodness! ;)'  yea God has been good to me in MANY many ways,but which part of my life would be suitable? roughtly thought of some but i'm not really comfirmed yet... aiseh this benny ah,he said 'this coming saturday' which means tomorrow la!! (btw he sent this email only today-friday!) hope that my mind can work fast!!if u have any ideas or suggestions do comment! thanks!  oh yea btw tonights BK class,i shall be very nervous as we will be getting our exam's marks,pretty scared,dun think i can get teacher's aim of above 80! mebbe above 60?? ish...at least i noe hock keat will get worse than me =P hahaha...that joker ah...dunno can get 2 digits annot...  so please pray for me: 1)that i may think of something meaningful in my life to share on how God has been good to me. 2)BK RESULTS!!! AHHHHHH.....  thats all folks!              Today was indeed a sad day at Catholic High School.  Firstly,during perhimpunan it was announced that Pn Sandy was retiring.NO she's not old,in fact she's young!Heard ppl say that her husband is pretty rich and she wants to spend more time with her family..aww... some teachers cried u noe!Well,she taught me sejarah last year,her notes are very good! anywayz, everyone was applauding Pn Sandy,indeed she is a popular figure in CHS.  Secondly,sadly,today my class made Pn Choo(my accounts teacher) cry ...sigh.This happened maily because someone didnt do her HW and copied someone else's.So in her tears,Pn Choo gave her thoughts and advises.The class was silent.It's been a while since our class has been this silent..Seems as if almost every teacher hates us now.english,mandarin,maths,science,accounts..   The worst thing happened after school.Me and my friends realize that some people were crying in front of block A and there were reporters asking them some question.we didnt noe exactly what happen.then later,robyn asked ming shiu and we found out that apparently a form 1 mandarin society girl from 1B1 was killed along with her siblings.apparently the parents were not on good terms.im pretty blur besides these info.hmm,i've alwayz read these kinda news in the newspapers or something,never imagine it'll happen to someone from my school.so sad..mebbe it'll be in the newpapers some time soon.  im pretty shocked..and i dont know what to say..i'll stop blogging here..     \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
