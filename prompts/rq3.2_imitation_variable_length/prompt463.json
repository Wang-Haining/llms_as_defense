Upon arrival in the once quiet & beautiful  'Dark Side Of The Moon'   I saw in the distance, fairy lights twinkling and made my way over to the  urlLink  'Neon Travelers Caravan Site'   that different players had built together. Each section had its own  urlLink   Caravan   and picnic table & bench. We decided to join a fellow neighbour at his table  urlLink   He didn't seem to mind !  Kipper was having major  LAG  problems in Tyr and recently, it's become an issue there...It used to be almost deserted but recently since the new  There  houses have been built..Its like  urlLink   PAZ CITY    So I ran about taking in the  urlLink   Weird & Wonderful   It looked like a car boot sale on LSD with all kinds of junk, some glowing some not..can's of beer and rubbish bins...half eaten burgers left on the picnic tables...As I walked up the lane of  Virtual Trailer Trash  I saw another neon sign  urlLink   BAR    Remembering it was 4th July and that in the USA this was  independence Day  I found  urlLink   THIS    Was a proper Bar complete with bartender and a hand full of people all using voice and chatting to each other  urlLink    under the moon & stars    ... I was that caught up in my casual 'eves dropping' I forgot all about Kipper and his LAG & connection problems and when I called over to him to meet me at the bar, I saw no name tag and no Kipper..So I wandered thru the  urlLink   amusing & Damb right UGLY stuff    and sat myself down outside another caravan  urlLink  Alone    Picking thru the remains of someones cold left over pizza & listening to the distant glasses tinkling and people talking & laughing celebrating the 4th July in the bar near by.  LAG in Tyr is a MAJOR gripe at the moment..it used to be beautiful and maybe its just me but I think ( with the exception to this featured article) all the ugly neon springs and space stations, and anything that 'glows in the dark' draws the eye from the real beauty of Tyr...Which was the Moon, Stars and the huge dinosaur bones left out as permanent Hover Board ramps...It seems to be a place for players with little style, class or building skills to just drop their crap in a bid to be the 'loudest' and for that we have to be constantly driving into a lot of it or rubber banding about..I'm just  VERY  thankful we didn't buy a There House in Tyr . We nearly did but for the same reasons I'm pointing out here..As soon as we stepped outside we were struck by LAG and faced with bright green columns and crap...Its like having the Clampits move in next door!         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
