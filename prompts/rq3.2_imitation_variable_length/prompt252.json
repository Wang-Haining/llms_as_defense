Abortion ticks me off so freakin' bad! These people have no respect for life. They don't a conscience, so as long as they're making money, they don't care. Professional mutilation, that's what it is. Posted about it on Anime Angels. Haven't gotten much of a response...ah, well...here's that post...   My honest opinion of people that get abortions and then don't care, is that they deserve their own place in hell where they can hear the silent scream for eternity. I'm sorry if you don't agree.   It makes me cry almost every time I hear about abortion. THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR ABORTION! Yet, most of these abortion cases(not all, however) blantantly disregard their privilege to be a mother, and quite literally, throw that gift in the trash. It's professional mutilation of a human child.   And don't get me going on this 'fetus' crap. They say it's not a human child. Okay...the mother is human...the father is human...so therefore, from the time the first cells form in the mother, that is a human, not complete, yes, but human nonetheless.   But one thing some pro-lifers forget to realize, there is forgiveness for this hideous crime. There is forgiveness and a second chance. Please don't forget this.   As for abortion of children that are a product of rape? I wrote something on that.   Despite Beginnings   It's not your fault  That since last night  Because of a sin  You carry a life  But just because he has sinned  You have no right to kill within  She breathes and lives  A beautiful start  Within eight weeks  You'll hear her heart  No matter how shameful she did begin  You have no right to kill within  A seperate life  Depends on you  Someone will love her  Just follow through  And as unjust as it may have been  You have no right to kill within  Your indecision  Inside will grow  When you have seen  Tiny fingers and toes  Above all of the pro-choice din  You have no right to kill within  Even though her life began with sin  You have no right to kill within   Some people argue that abortion is alright if the mother will die if the baby is born and a C-section isn't possible. This may sound harsh, but I believe that as it is the mother's duty to care for that child, she should be willing to die for that child. Harsh, yes, but that's my opinion. And opinion never changed fact. What the fact is, remains to be seen.   I'm sorry if my opinion offended anyone. This matter...well...I can't use the language to describe what I truly feel about it, without losing my Christian testimony.    My opinion on abortion wll never change as long as I live. It's wrong. Plain and simple.   And as a POD song says:   Abortion is murder  There's nothing you can say or do  To justify the fact  That there's a living breathing baby inside of you  -POD, 'Abortion is Murder'   If I was drafted into the army, would I run into Canada to avoid the pain? No. Why? Because it's my duty to my country. Motherhood is a duty. But everyday, women run into the proverbial Canada by commiting abortion. They avoid their duty, because it'll be inconvienient.  You can say I'm on a soapbox, you can say I have no clue of what I speak of, all I know is Truth.            Okay...I'm confused, pissed, tired, VERY confused, grouchy, and slightly twitchy all at once.  Let's get things straight...  A: Aaron is fine being single. B: Why does Aaron like girl? C: Girl has partial boyfriend. D: Aaron's not going to intrude on other guy's territory E: Aaron's fine with that.  Now for the kicker...  F: Why does that bother Aaron so much?  It doesn't, but...it does! What the crap is up with this? I was fine just a couple days ago, but now...geez...it's driving me up a fricking wall. I didn't even like this girl up until what...Sunday? Geez, Aaron get a hold on yourself...  Then I have another girl who...well...I don't know what the crap is up with her, but apparently she likes me...AGAIN.  When do people give up? When do people leave me alone? When do people just piss off and leave their noses out of some things?  Man, the human race annoys me sometimes.  Had enough? I'm not done yet.  I've had the calling(and many confirmations) that I'm supposed to be a leader in the youth group. Up to this point, it seemed to be working out fine.   But then I started thinking...  How can I be a leader when over half the youth group(including the recent converts) are all more spiritually adept than me? They're speaking in tongues, prophecing, discerning things...I should be happy...right?  Wrong.  In fact, it's made me extremely depressed. Here I am, almost 12 years of being a Christian, and I can't even speak in tongues. It's not that I haven't sought for it, it's not that I haven't had the faith. Maybe I just haven't had the paitence. But it's very saddening to see your friends getting a blessing when you pour your heart out to God, and you get nothing but warm fuzzies. I don't want warm fuzzies. I don't want earthly pleasures. I don't want girls. I don't what earthly fame.  I want Jesus.  I've been seeking and seeking and seeking, but every time, it's only my friends getting the blessing.  Why do I have to wait? Why do I have to seek and press when they walk up and start speaking in tongues? Why do I have to sit back and cry, watching them get the good stuff, when I'm starving for Jesus? Why? Why? Why?  Why am I left behind when I'm supposed to lead them?  When they're supposed to be watching my actions?  When they're supposed to look up to me?  What good is a a leader that no one can see?             Everything I thought was real Every dream, every feeling cold All the ghosts I tried to run from All the storms rusting into me  So tell me how to feel Now that you aren't real There's nothing to reveal  I ran on glass, broke my bones so I could find you I cut myself to Be around you And when I bled, you disappeared Just like you knew I always feared I closed my eyes, and climbed on you so I could breathe I hung my noose around your tree Suffered addiction to the air around you Now my whole world exists without you  I was a son, I was an angel falling from heaven I was a slave to your oppression The prophets never spoke of reasons For me or for my bitter freedom You spit on me, filled my Dirt with seeds of black As I carved your name across my back Burned out my eyes into your sun Oh, can’t you see now what you’ve done to me?  If I close my eyes, will this all go away? If I take your pill, will it all fade away? If I wake myself, will my darkness peel? I can’t sleep away because nothing is real.  There's nothing left to feel So tell me how to feel             I feel so empty right now. So very empty. It's like there's a hole in my chest and someone dropped a wrecking ball inside. I just want to break free of something...if I only knew exactly what that something was. Is it my past? My present? Am I worried about the future? I'm angry...at myself?  Maybe it's simply the fact everyone sees me as something different than what I know myself to be.  It's hard to know who you really are. To stare yourself in the mirror and seeing what you are. It's hard to say that you're a perv. A sicko. A dink. To know this. And to have people still smile at you. That kills me. I want them to run from the monster I am. I don't want forgiveness. I don't deserve it, so why give it to me? Me. A player. A porn dabbler. A freak. A pimp. I'm sick of me. If I could just shed this skin, I might be happy.  Then again...  There's the side of me that screams for forgiveness and attention as much as the other side screams for shunning and punishment. A side that longs for love. A side that is the little boy I am. I'm screaming for me to come back. But, who would come? Would it be the side that everyone says I am, or the side I know myself to be?   I don't mean to hurt people, but my lust drives me to it. Forgive me, Jordain. You hold a large part of my heart. But something deep inside tells me that there's someone else. For you. For me. Just please...don't cry...I never meant to hurt you. But we're children. Fairy tales don't always come true.  But either way, I'm stopping my sick side here. If I have to do it with just me and God, I will, but I'm going to fight this. I'm going to be the man God wants me to be. I'm going to accept the fact I'm imperfect, unclean, and unholy, and that God wants to use me just the way I am.  Ashley, I'm sorry. Your intuition failed this time. Good try, though. But right now, I can't have any distractions, no matter how miniscule. Thanks for praying for a prick like me.  I'm breaking the habit tonight.            I'm a bit more relaxed. Two straight days of gaming will do that for ya...about 7 total hours of Dynasty Warriors 3(which is safely within my backpack for borrowing pleasures) and about 6 of Onimusha 3(which is quite the gorefest, but fun nonetheless), along with 2.5-3 hours of Half-Life: Decay, and a good hour of Red Faction multiplayer(let the debris fly!!!). Add that to 2.5 hours of swimming at Jeff's camp, and you have a well-rounded weekend. In the words of Strong Bad, 'I feel so...cleansed...'  Great. Just peachy. My mom's mad at me just because I wasn't thrilled at the idea of watching a movie with her and Dad. It pisses me off that she thinks I don't care about anything outside of a screen. Just because I spend a lot of time online and in video games doesn't mean I don't love my family. I realize that I have a life outside the virtual world, but apparently, she doesn't see that. She sees me enjoying something electronic, and it seems that she deems them as evil because I spend more than an hour a day on them. She never says a thing to Nick about his obsessive guitar playing.   Maybe I'm just pissed at the world for no apparent reason. I've rather irritable lately. Maybe I just need to go to bed early tonight...    \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
