My queries have more or less been answered:  Internet Access - Will apply for me, so should not be a problem  Accomodation - Will stay with another girl temporary, until we have found the new location to move into. Yes, single. Me, Myself and I.  Telephone - Very expensive to call back. Looks like i have to rely on internet then. Company will provide a local mobile phone. hehe. You guys in SG can still con't sms-ing or calling me on my SG mobile since i have decided to apply autoroaming. but i will have to pay the bucks.   Food - Yes yes... trying to incorporate meat into my diet now. but if there are much veggie or grass to be grazed, i might just go back to being veggie! the servings usually go by kg, and for a simple lunch will cost abt SG$7-8. Good resturants will cost abt SG$30 ($1 Reais = $0.6 SG) or more. I will try cooking. probably will lose another 10 kg from the lack of nourishing and edible food (my cooking).  Clothes - Office wear similar to SG. so it's casual + smart. and during the weekends, dress shorts and t-shirt. no fancy orchard-road fashion show here...   Climate - Brazil is in the same latitude as in Aussie. so now it's winter. it won't get lower than 15Deg in the day, and 12Deg in the night. and i am staying near the coast, so it will not be that bad.   Safety - will be travelling together with my colleagues to and fro work as we have a car sharing system. no pepper spray needed.. apparently not that bad. but will be mindful.  Well, looks like it's pretty much on my own now... Pls give me strength. HIKES!                       1 Aug 04 Sun  Went to the Hippie Market at Ipanema. So nice! bought quite a bit of things.. Many handicrafts are sold. one stall sells face masks made of leather (interesting). Art pieces are also sold. We ate African traditional food, which i didn't like. This young girl came to ask for food we didn't finish. really poor thing. Then saw golden retreivers puppies being sold. The parents are also there, i guess to show the potential buyers the good breed. As we walked along, huskies, chihuahuas, terriers, cocker spaniel are sold too. SO CUTE. urgh. altho i dun agree with selling them, but at least they are in hands of animal lovers. was thinking abt the pet breeding farms in Singapore. haiz, think the animals here have a better life.  31 Jul 04 Sat  Spend the 1st half of the afternoon at a chinese restuarant with the SG ppl. It was the looongest lunch i have ever taken. we arrived at 1pm, and the food came at 2.30pm. we left the restuarant at 3.30pm. it was so long, that big boss had to tell the owner to hurry up serve the food, cos he has to leave for the airport at 4pm!  Then Lionel, Sabah, Melissa, her son Joshua and me went to Sugarloaf. It was beautiful. There is a pub also (brazilians love to party, and will create any opportunity to do so). Then there are groups of ppl exercising. not the SG kind of old ppl doing taichi, but doing aerobics, yoga (somehow seem like Falun Gong to me) and cycling (on stationery bikes... funny huh.)  From Sugarloaf can see the Christ statue on the next cliff. we also caught the sunset. beautiful.  At nite, Lionel and I went to the nite spots in Lapan. We went to the biggest disco. We did a test to see how many guys want to pick me up. so i went walking around alone. nope. but was molested by this idiot, who used his elbow to brush me! so angry, i pushed his arm away. hope his hand rots!  Then caught a few boys starting a fight in the middle of the dance floor. the security stepped in to stop it. one of the boys was stopped by a girl, and the whole event has a 'happy ending' with the winner smooching the prize away all nite. sounds like cavemen to us. hahaha. There was a band who came to the stage to sing, with dancers in the back. of cos skimpily dressed. The girls are not that hot, but one of the male dancer was W.O.W. great toned muscular body with a killer smile. The dancing was the main attraction, and whenever the gal expose her little panties under the short skirt, wolf whistles and cat calls are heard.  A fat man approached me for a dance. yah rite, over my dead body (which will be when he tripped over me during the dance). then as we leave, another young boy wants to talk to me.  WHY I ATTRACT PERVERTS, FAT GUYS AND YOUNG BOYS!!??                        16 Jul 04 Friday  &nbsp;  Last nite we held a party for uncle larry, who is leaving for SG tonite.  &nbsp;  the place, which is a pub, is beautifully decorated with many antiques. 3 stories high and there is a live band playing local music (not samba, something milder). the things in the bar is for sale! but i guess it can get quite eery. i was frightened by this bronze statue HEAD of a man at the end of a corner.  &nbsp;  we headed to the place right after knocking off. the ppl here can just drink without eating dinner. there's finger food tho'. the beer here is quite nice, even i enjoyed it. have been forced by ppl here to take alcohol, like red wine and beer. hope my liver survives these 2 years.  &nbsp;  the music is addictive. there are dancers (or dancing students) who come here to dance to their music. the way they sway and move is so well coordinated. the old, young, sexy, pretty and ugly all got to the dance floor. there's this old couple... the woman looked so happy to be dancing! then i was (again) forced to dance. a male colleague invited me to it, and guided me along. simple lah, but also seem quite stupid '2 steps left 2 steps rite'. then there's another way to dance, which he said 'hope you dont mind but usually the ladies here dance more closely to the guy... and so i can lead you'. i said no, not knowing how close he meant. and yah, he is rite, I BLOODY HELL MIND! hahhaa. ok lah, it's just uncomfy to be so close to a guy. (and he is not good looking - this is THE point. haha)  &nbsp;  left the place abt 1030. really tired. but again i had fun. would love to go there again.  &nbsp;  this morning woke up to cook breakfast for uncle larry. hope he is not suffering from stomachache. he is so kind to deliver some letters and few boxes of chocolates for my family. i am so going to miss him. sob sob.  &nbsp;  the ppl here love to talk loudly. i am suffering from headaches for the past few days. and they slang very strongly. wah lau. the only time i have some peace is during lunch. urgh.  &nbsp;            \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
