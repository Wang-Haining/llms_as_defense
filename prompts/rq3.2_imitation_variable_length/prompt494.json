After a trip out late at night, Sarah and I were walking and talking.  And then the popo showed up.  Fuck the police (fuck. fuck. fuck...).  We got busted for violating curfew.  Soooo much fun.  My parents aren't too pissed though.  And they're not blaming her as much as I thought they would.  I found out some information that kind of hurt me.  I don't really want to go into it in public, but wow... not cool.  Not cool at all.  __________________________________________________________ (Note: If you're not interested in another 'gay entry,' stop reading now)  Mike's Confusion.  I've been thinking more and more lately about whether I like girls.  And the more I think about it, the more I think it just isn't true.  I'm still confused, I guess.  But it's getting less confusing as time goes on.  I've realized that the more time goes by, the less I'm interested in girls.  But I almost feel like sexual frustration is leaving me confused.  I really want a boy to date.  The lack of real candidates pisses me off.  I dunno, as desperate as this is I just want someone to like.  But I've got no one really.  It's just frustrating.  I can't wait until I get out of high school.  I want to meet people.  I want to have a relationship.  Maybe I should start going to CTA meetings and stuff.  Or Links things.  I wish I had been here for the pride parade and stuff.  Damn.  I wish I weren't leaving on sunday.  I really want to go to this Synergy dance thing on Saturday night.  Hmm... maybe I could.  I think I'd have to come out to my mom.  That'd be awkward.  Train making would be hard.  I'd also leave the day after.  I guess it can wait.  I think I am going to come out to my mom.  Stuff just keeps getting in the way.  Getting in trouble, my parents fighting.  Maybe I'll just do it tomorrow.  That'd be good.  I want to do it.  It'll make my life easier.  I hate being a political issue.  It's so dehumanizing to read articles about gay contituencies, and gay issues, and blah blah blah.  I don't want to be a statistic or a 'wedge social issue.'  I don't want something that directly affects my future to be decided for political gain.  I hate the GoP.  I hate the dems refusal to support me.  I hate that our country is full of christian moralists who think that I'm going to hell.  Whatever.  I'll deal. -Mike  backed my car into a cop car the other day  Well he just drove off, sometimes life's OK  I ran my mouth off a bit too much, oh what did I say?  Well you just laughed it off, it was all OK   And we'll all float on OK           \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
