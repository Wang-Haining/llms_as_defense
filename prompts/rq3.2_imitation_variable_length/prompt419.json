If only I was blessed with his musical talent. hmmmmrgg. Seven years of piano lessons didn't do much. I wonder how much los padres blew on  that  failed endeavor. Well, I haven't posted about this to protect S's privacy, but I will soon be an auntie! I am so excited. She thinks it is a girl, which is awesome because the little girl clothes are so much cuter. Just like women's clothes are more interesting, I guess. I am thrilled, even though I think my parents are turning their eyes to me and wondering where their grandchild is. I have never felt particularly maternal, so I hope they don't get their hopes up too much. I'm probably sterile from living a few hundred kilometers from Kyiv for over 3 years. I joke. Many of my Ukrainian friends have had perfectly normal kids.   So we're going to  urlLink Bavarian Grill  tomorrow night so we can have some bieren. I don't like drinking on school nights. It makes Friday seem the longest day EVER when you have a hangover. Very excited. I love Jäger Schnitzel mit Spätzle and the little breads you get, especially this roll that has rock salt on it. Then the salad is to die for. So perfectly Central European with pickled beets, beans, tomatoes. yum. I highly recommend this restaurant.  I have received a lot of birthday greetings from the inlaws, from dh, from my ex, from the president of our company, and from one of the vp's. I work for a small company and I like the president, but I pretty much despise this vp. She is at another office and I don't report to her, thank God. She went and got a bunch of pre-printed cheesey ass cards and had her name imprinted on them and then had her poor admin assist mail it out to me. And the bitch didn't even sign it. She is such a political weasel it makes me puke. She almost destroyed this company with her overblown self-importance and ego, in my opinion. We are lucky that K took over the presidency from C so that she couldn't wield her influence anymore.            Good grief, work is BUSY. The phone has been ringing off the hook, which is good. Thought we were headed for the typical summer slowdown.   We survived the weekend with the stepmonster. If you think you know an annoying, know-it-all, trashy, stinky, stepmonster, you do not know M. She is the end all be all of hideousness. She chainsmokes and her teeth are yellow, has the worst taste in fashion imaginable, actually still wears banana clips in her hideous hair, and has her husband completely hoodwinked. So sad. She is so obnoxious, there are hardly words. I just sit back and pound a few Bass Ales and then tune her out. She is the authority on EVERYTHING. Nevermind she never went to college and can't hold a job for more than 2 years before she gets canned/laid off, most likely for being so bloody annoying. She told dh that he was stubborn and that when he had long hair, he should have had bangs and some layers. He blurted out, 'And what?!?! Have a MULLET?!?!' She has also argued that the Titanic had been raised and was in the Smithsonian. What a dumbass. Well, we don't have to see them for another 4 months or so. Slava bogu.            Quite the unremarkable weekend. We went over the B and P's on Saturday and found out P is 6 months pregnant. Which we figured anyway. B told DH that they had some 'big news' to share with us. Well, big news is either you're getting married or preggers. And they got married 4 weeks ago, so...I had no clue she was 6 months along! You couldn't really tell at the wedding at all. Granted, she did have a big poofy Cinderella dress as opposed to my garden drape-style dress, which I had to wear a freakin' corset under because it showed every imperfection. One very funny thing that happened when we were getting the new house tour is P's daughter (from previous relationship) A asked her mom, 'Where are the kids?' We started laughing so hard and told her that our parents are wondering the same thing. This, of course, went over a 5 year old's head. DH got mad at me because I fell asleep at their house around midnight. I had maybe 4 beers, which is nothing for this beer-guzzling Pollack, but I think it's the new medicine I'm on. Last week I had 6 beers and fell asleep at midnight. I finally looked at the bottle yesterday and it said that DO NOT DRINK WITH THIS MEDICATION. WILL CAUSE DROWSINESS AND ENHANCE EFFECT. Damn, they sure don't lie. Well, on the upside, it'll keep me from drinking too many alcohol calories.   urlLink pretty disturbing               Well, still no call from the software co. Still in limbo. I guess I'll be the aggressive go-getter mba type that I pretend to be and give 'em a jingle manana. I thought I wrote some kick-ass thank you letters too. I'm surprised to hear I haven't made the second cut. They probably think there is no way they can pay me as much as they think I should earn since I have an MBA (a real MBA from a full-time program, from a TOP 20 in the USA PROGRAM, I might add...), but they are wrong. The current place of rabota pales in terms of salary and bennies.      But that's neither here nor there. I love that phrase. Much better than saying some dumbass analogy or even a non-analogy and then adding 'if you will' at the end and trying to sound smart. I noticed that this was quite the catch phrase for tv journalists covering Bush's Iraq War Part Deux. It drove me bonkers to hear that phrase everyday. 'It's carpet bombing, if you will.' Well, it either is or isn't. What if I WON'T? It was major pet peeve of mine. It seems to be disappearing in the vernacular lately, slava bogu (thank god, for you non ruso or uki speakers).      Went to  urlLink Kalachandji's  today for lunch with the boss immediately over me. It was pretty good, but it always kinda tastes the same. Not that I mind, but I couldn't eat that everyday. The soup was some kind of dahl and was pretty extraordinary though. This one hari krishna chick there is intriguing, not in a lesbian way or anything, please! She has been there since I started going there about 3-4 years ago. She is really thin, is white, always wears a sari, and has striking blue eyes. I heard her speaking with some guy there once in a language I knew was Slavic, but couldn't figure out what it was. I asked her and it turns out she's from Serbia. I found that so crazy. She always acts kinda stressed out and harried, so maybe this hari krishna thing isn't really the inner peace she was hoping for. But maybe she doesn't like wasting time waitressing. I'd rather be chanting. She must have come here some time ago. So once upon a time hari krishnas were dancing down the old cobblestoned and shellshocked streets of Belgrade in the early 1990s getting converts? OK, I'll dump this Orthodox/Catholic/Muslim thing, just get me the f outta Dodge, dude!         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
