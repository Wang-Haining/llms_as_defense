You guys make me laugh, keep me sane, and drive me bonky all at the same time.    Saturday I had the chance to catch up with a friend I've known since grade school.  Still the same Jen.  Not that I'm against change, but it's comforting to know that there are some things from your childhood that haven't changed too much.  Thanks for the reminder about grade 8 graduation.  Picture 4 girls dressed in frilly poof dresses standing outside 7-11 waiting for our parents to pick us up after the grad dance.  A guy gets out of his car and goes '12 or 13?'.  We yell out proudly '14!'.  He looks at us strangely and just walks into the store.  It took us a bit to realize that he was asking if it was our grade 12 or grade 13 grad.  And to think we were so offended that he thought we were only 12 or 13 yrs old.  Definitely a winning moment in the life of Cindy.  Had fun crashing a friend's friend's party again.  Although I'm a bit disappointed this time..  no twister game!  But hearing the story about my favorite electrical engineer setting his kitchen on fire and having his dorm evacuated while he was trying to cook  instant noodles  well made up for that.  Remind me that when we make dinner plans - we go out for sushi.  Today we caught the play China Doll at the Tarragon.  I was pretty amazed by how powerful the production was.  I get shivers thinking about how painful and crippling foot binding was.  It's hard to imagine that women were subjected to this in order to achieve what society considered an ideal beauty trait.  But then again, that was hundreds and hundreds of years ago, and look what people are doing today in their quest for physical beauty - plastic surgery, breast implants, liposuction.  Maybe we haven't progressed that far really.  Thanks again everyone for the great weekend.  Feels like home.               \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
