But I didn't have a lesson today so I got some practice today. I also had to teach a student's lesson today! I'm a student teacher in the making, I guess you could say. I think it was a pretty good session.  So here's my practice:  Scales  - All were very well. I think I'm trying to play them to fast though, so this week I'm going to play them slowly. Have you tried that lately? Sometimes I find it funny that it's harder to play them slower, because when you play them faster you don't really think about the notes that you play, you just go!  Cadences  - Really strong today! I'm happy with how they are coming. 1st inversion with G Major was good actually.  Hanon  - I tried putting #7 hands together. AHHH! Very Hard! This one might take me a while!  Technic  - First off I've been wondering lately, 'Why did James Bastien spell it technic when its technique?' Anyway, 'Snowmobiling' is very slow, but it's together. And yes, I practiced my inversions.  Piano  - I almost have Reveille! I just keep messing up going from the A minor to the E Major. SO CLOSE!  'Spinning Song'  - I cannot wait until I get to put hands together on this song. Sometimes the counting throws me, but I really think that I have it!  But today I really missed the Master's Class! (That's a theory class for all of you who don't know.) :) But I can wait until next week.                     Hey everyone! My name is Chad (heh, hence the name of the blog), and I'm a piano/voice student. My music teacher, Rhonda Trull, asked me to begin posting my practice online. I had already been keeping a practice journal, but since it ties in with her site,  urlLink here , she asked me to put online.  So anyway, I guess I can share a little light on who I am. I'm 15 years old and I go to Wayne County High School. To read more about that click  urlLink here . I've been taking piano lessons for 5 years in August, and I've been taking voice lessons for almost a year.  I'll be recording: my practice, problems I'm having with songs, how songs make me feel, etc. Now there is one rule for me, and i'll share it with y'all.  NO PERSONAL STUFF  in this journal. Of course if the song makes me feel someway about what's going on in my life at the moment, I might let  that  slide. I learn from the Bastien Piano books series. I'll post a list of the books I have if anyone wants them (that's only about 6 or 7!). And I should post practice everyday, except Sundays. Rarely do I practice on Sundays.  So i hope that you find my blog slightly helpful in your musical journey!  :) HAVE A GREAT DAY! AND PRACTICE!  Oh yeah and if you want to drop me a line, my e-mail is Godsdude4life@hotmail.com                     I've had a little more practice today that usual. I'm actually really proud of myself. I practiced an hour today! I know some people practice a lot more than that, but I'm really happy with an hour. I'd like to get up to about an hour and a half a day.  So anyway, here's my log:  Scales  - Sounded really nice today! I'm very pleased, though I stumbled on A Major a little just because I wanted to play A minor first I guess! :)  Cadences  - I really didn't want to play Cadences today, but I did. And you know they go by really fast once you start playing them. All were very good.  Hanon  - I HATE Hanon #7!!! It's like way hard. I mean I knew the guy was crazy, but he was just insane!!  Technic  - 'Snowmobiling' is still in progress, yet it still needs lots of work. And I'm still practicing my inversions which make it easier. But broken chord inversions are just hard!  Piano  - I'm played 'Reveille' perfectly today!! I mean I got all the turns and everything was on time! OHH! That makes me smile!   Spinning Song   - Ok I know I should have, but I did. I put my hands together. Hey don't worry it wasn't really practice, because it all fell apart. :) But I did practice it like I should. I hate practicing the left hand though, it's so redundant, and I lose my place ... and it's frustrating!  I've been thinking again. Since I am a voice student, maybe I should post that practice too. Which there's nothing really to that, but I could still do it. I'll think about it.                         Hey everyone.  It's been a while since I've posted. But to give you a quick overview of what's going on: NOTHING!  :)  I'm teaching Sunday School this coming Sunday!!! I'm so excited. But that excitedness is kind of being  weighed down, because I'm just really depressed about my school. I feel like there is no one who believes in Jesus. They just run Him down to the ground, so to speak, by the way they live.  What do I mean by that? Well lets take the biggest thing in High School for example. SEX. They have sex and then they come to school and boast about it. Like they've done something special. Basically they're justifying what they are doing. And I want to go up to them and shake them and ask them 'What's wrong with you? Don't you know that you're hurting yourself?'  And there's so much fighting going on, and it's driving me crazy! Sometimes I wish that some people could expirence hell for about 30 seconds. That may sound bad, but I know that would light their fire.    I just have this heavy burden on my soul. It's hurting too. I feel like I can't do anything to help anyone. I just need to pray about it and pray for some people.  If you're reading this will you please send me an e-mail?! Please I need to hear from somebody!  CHAD                        Life lately has been pretty awesome. God has really just been teaching me a lot, changing me, and molding me. He's been doing that to a lot of people. Worship is becoming natural to me, which is awesome.     &nbsp;   Now prayer is becoming a major focus in my life. I know prayer is a powerful thing. Hopefully I won't take that lightly. I'm trying to discipline myself in prayer. It's so hard though. I mean I can pray it's just so hard to find time. I guess when i go back to school I'll have to make time.     &nbsp;   Speaking of school, I have yet to get those two books read. I'll be reading at the last minute. I'm hoping to be done before I go to San Antonio, because I know I won't get them read out there. So I have 2 weeks.     &nbsp;   Oh yeah before I forget, the band has a new name! We're now called, Sea of Glass! How cool is that? It's based on Revelation 15. It's really cool. I, personally, like it. I think everyone in the band does too. I'm beginning to grow on them too. I mean I kind of have to since the drama team is completely falling apart. But hopefully everything will pull together. I'll be praying about it.     &nbsp;   Church was really awesome tonight. I thought it went well. I'm really expecting God to do something great. I just have a feeling that lives are gonna be changed. I'm praying that the Holy Spirit just begin to take control of the services.     &nbsp;   Bro. Ryan is getting us geared up in evangelism. I'm really gonna try to reach someone this upcoming school year. Liana is really the only person  I  know that is unsaved. I mean I know that there are plenty of other people, but she's the one I know. If I ever see Holly, I'm gonna try to get her to start going to church. It's kind of scary, but then again, it shouldn't be. The worst thing that could possibly happen is, their response be 'No'.     &nbsp;   Anyway I have to do some more blog updating in my other blogs. So yeah... :)              \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
