We where usher into this little changing room area through the backstage area, thank god so we oculd get away from the noise of TLK!!! We all sat down like we where waiting for our exams results...... must have been around a 10 minute wait or so. Jackie was shaking, her legs and jumping up and down so much, thankfully Linda gave her a few tips on calming down, which she did.  The time came and in walked Anders first.... who just waved his hand and shouted 'Hej' followed by a very cute Per! Micke who is so god damn sexy laughed with his sense of humour, the Goran and MP came on in too!  The guys signed our stuff, and I got some photos, not all that great but a good one with Micke took by Jackie. Eugene took some official fanclub photos.   Me and Jackie where having a joke with Micke. Anders laughed cause we where from England! (yes he remembered you three Fliss, Klair and Ailsa from the carpark!) He seems a little worried when I warned him would be back soon to haunt him!!! :)    MP and Goran did not really do much just signed our stuff....  I think it lasted around 15 minutes then it was time to go, I got to shake Per's hand on the way out when really I wanted to give him a big hug. I certainly said more words that I did last time.  The guys went and we had a few minutes to gather our stuff. Everyone from the fanclub M&G showed up and there was also a family there with there 2 children.   We went back out and me and Jackie headed outside to think and to STILL avoid the noise of TLK! We found a bench and Eugene came out some time later to transfer the pictures to his laptop, so we got a sneaky peek at them! :) Very good camera is that he has!!! some good photos of all the M&G winners with the band can't wait to get my hands on a copy!!!  I swaped my standing ticket with a tout for a seat as I did not fancy standing so long, Thabkfully I got a good seat, in block A again okay I also paid an extra 300 SEK but it was worth it. I took lots of photos with my own camera, so I can't wait to download them when I get home! Jackie was sat over in block O but she also had a good view and was a little higher than me, some of the photos she took are fantastic!   The concert was as good as the last one... the guys where so good on that stage, I know understand why some people go to more than 2 concerts, you get so hooked!   Met up with Jackie on the way out, and she thought what I was thinking!! should we head to Falun, it would have been so great to have caught a 3rd concert!   But alas when we got back to the hotel I went onto ticnet and there where no seats left to buy, it would have been a bit risky to have gone up there in the hope of using a tout and a major let down to have missed out if there where no tickets!  Well I have to go for now someone is waiting to use the PC here at the hotel, catch you soon!  Ally x                    WOW, I cannot belive how much I got done today! housework, the garden, the shopping... bla bla bla...  Jackie is being a soppy sod and won't write a few words for the diary, but tells me to say  'SHE DOES NOT HAVE A SUITCASE'  Jackie go charge the credit card now!!! She also  says she has ironed all the clothes but can't do anything without a suitcase!   DOH SILLY MARE    So day 9 is almost over... for now. I can say most stuff is done. Alfie is flaked out on the sofa, dreaming of rabbits I bet!  Am off to bedland myself soon.... thinking of those who are already in Halmstad now, and getting to see the prem tomorrow.. how cool they must be feeling now!   Was chatting to dear old Ted earlier on MSN, god that guy does worry over nothing...  TED I AM SURE YOU CAN TAKE YOUR CAMERA IN WITH YOU TOMORROW... DON'T WORRY!   Jeez your meeting Per, what's it matter if you get a photo or not.. store the memories on your hard drive (brain) you'll never forget 14th July 2004!     Personally I can't wait to read Thursday morning Swedish papers, for all the gossip and pictures!  Anyhow... Night xxxx                   Okay so much for not getting up early… said I was feeling a little under the weather last night I was cold…. Later on in the night I went so hot, and when I said hot I mean hot, I was walking around the garden at 12.30am with the dog to cool off! This morning I wake up with a sore throat. GREAT! Not been sick in what 12 months and now I have a sore throat, it is not so bad and I think with some over the counter stuff I can get rid of it, what you betting I have picked it up for the hospital!  Well 1 day to go, this time tomorrow I shall be preparing to head to the train station, I just pray I get paid from my employer. My first wage packet is due tomorrow, I will go mad if they balls it up! It would just be my luck!  Well I was up at just after 7am, I have pulled out the suitcase and will pack later this afternoon, got some cleaning up to do this morning and pack the rucksack, make sure I don’t forget anything!  Decided I will go visiting to see mum, a couple of hours won’t mess up my routine to much today and I want to see her before I go to Sweden.  Fingers crossed I can get rid of this blessed sore throat by tomorrow?
