I haven't really spoke much about my job have i? well it's a typical job in a busy tourist town shop. Most of the people i work with are cool, and i get on with most of them. There are a couple of things that piss me off about work:  the first is.......the un-natural way everything has to be 'just right', and by 'just right' i actually mean '100% anal'. i work on the shoe floor and the shoes have to be facing the right direction and in price order....and there are about a trillion bazillion other things that have to be done...although it's not all bad cause it keeps me busy.  the second thing.........well i've previously mentioned how nice everyone is in canada. well, it's actually in my contract that i have to great every customer that comes into the shop, bit of a pain in the ass when u have a stinkin hangover and when you greet brits...cause, sorry guys, i can happily say, brits are the most unfriendly lot of twats! ESPECIALLY SOUTHERNERS!!!! but on the whole i think being friendly suits me..which leads me on to the main point of this long winded blog....when i start talking to customers, most of them talk back...i once had a 45 minute conversation with a lovley couple who were just browsing...but i digress....the other day i was talking to this old lady who was trying some shoes on, not a supprise cause i work on the shoe floor...well after the usual 'are u from Australia?' question i get (which is occasionally replaced with 'where in new zealand are you from?') i was chatting about what she was doing in Banff...she was there with some of her pensienor walking group from somewhere in the states, anyway, not sure how we got onto it, but she started telling me that her late husband past away in 2000 of cancer, a sad story of how they loved each other dearly, and how she missed him, but then in 2002 she went to her high school 50th reunion...and she met some guy she used to go to school with...and they are now dating!!!! she says he's exactly the same as he was in school, only more cool stories about what he'd done since last time he saw her, in 1952! I just thought it was quite a sweet story and it just goes to show, you go through your life looking for the right someone, and it turns out you miss them first time round, just prey to god that there's a second time...or just don't screw up your first!
