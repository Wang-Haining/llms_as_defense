I really wanted to get to the pools and soak in some hot water before I take off....but I've got so much to do.  Everything I spend now is not specified in dollars....but rather how many nights camping I just spent.  Just yesterday Charlie and I saw a better way to pack my bike, so I ran to Riverton to pick up a different bag and have to repack everything (2 1/2 nights).  Hopefully this will help with the weight distribution so that I won't seem off balance with all my stuff.  I also bought a motorcycle cover (5 nights).  I thought it would be good to cover my bike during the day while I'm out browsing or hiking and at night if it rains.  In my experience most people don't bother bikes, but I'm from Wyoming where we don't lock our houses or cars either.  Since this is all I have and so much would be easily lifted....like my magnetic tank bag,  I might want to play it safe.  Met a husband and wife today from Arizona cruising on their Harley.  Marty is the President of the Old Bastards Motorcycle Club in Arizona.  Very nice people and they want me to give them a call when I get to Arizona and they will hook me up with a place to stay for the night and show me around.  They also gave me a great tip on an Ozark Mountain ride in October that I think I will have to try to schedule in for sure.  Funny, I'm not use to riding in October because of the cold weather.                          ever hear of the iron butt run?  it is where bikers push themselves to ride 1,000 miles in 24 hours.  well, almost made it. try 660 miles in 24 hours.  why you ask?  let's just say i was trying to build character that day.  not on purpose.  some things just happen on the road.  problem is that i don't really plan, but i have learned one thing.  don't try to go to a major tourist attraction in the middle of summer on a saturday night without reservations.  i was heading towards cape cod.  i realized before i got there when i got to plymouth massachutes that this was a really bad idea so i turned and headed into rhode island & connecticut.  problem is the whole time i was on hwy 1 which is still on the coast.  no vacancies everywhere i went & when i did find a hotel they wanted $120 and up.  sorry, just not in my budget.  so 10:30 at night i'm sitting at mcdonalds and come up with the perfect plan.  it is a beautiful night and a full moon, maybe my destiny is to take nyc in the middle of the night.                          i'm on my way to my cousins in north carolina and i know i need to make time to get there by her day off, so everyone suggests the only easy way is to ride 1-95.  so from new jersey to washington d.c. and almost to richmond virgina i ride the interstate.  when i talk to people later they say that is probably the worst road for heavy traffic in the united states.   i was on this road for about 7 hours trying to make time.  all the time 3-6 lanes of constant traffic.  once in a while the interstate would totally back up with a traffic jam and i was actually thankful because every one had to slow down and i could take a bit of a breather.    i pull over at a rest stop and literally shake.  i can feel it in my legs, arms and hands.    i'm a bundle of nerves.  i know i have to get off this road.  i had one extremely close call, but i  tell you i think the Lord cleared the one lane so i was able to scoot over before i got ran over.  i don't even want to leave the rest area i'm so unnerved.  so i get out the atlas and plan a route that looks like two lanes and go talk to the tourist info gal and she says another 15 miles and i can be out of this traffic.  before i leave the rest area i meet another biker and he is traveling on I-95 through richmond and says if i could follow him for just 1 1/2 hours more we would be out of traffic.  even though i know i won't make it to my cousins today because of my slower route i know i can't go back out there.  i told him thanks, but i would rather slit my wrists than to ride in any more of that.                          got in kind of late so didn't really talk to anybody.  just threw up the tent, headed for the bathrooms & to call the kids.  i sat by the water for a few minutes & then headed off to bed.  the next morning was buzzing with activity though.  i thought i might never get gone.  this camp ground is visited by many families every year.  parents started coming years ago, so now the kids & grandkids come as well.  got to eat breakfast with a real nice family who was really interested in my adventure & gave great advice as to where to hit on the coast.  after returning from breakfast the neighbors started talking & wanted me to stay for the day &amp; kayak with them.  man, didn't take them up on that offer, but that is definitely on my list of things to do in my life time.  also everyone wanted to make sure i had supplies.  do i need anything.  can we give you juice, candy bars....etc.  etc.  haven't had this good treatment for quite a while so it was refreshing to have people to talk to.                            i wanted to title this blog jumped - but i didn't wan't to cause a panick in any of my fellow readers.&nbsp; when charlie &amp; i first married we made a pact.&nbsp; i was not to use tools &amp; he wasn't to use the checkbook.&nbsp; well, charlie improved - he got very good at balancing the check book.....but ole' nellie here never really improved with tools.&nbsp;&nbsp; so i did a boo, boo.&nbsp; after checking my mileage for the day - i left my key turned on and ran down my battery.&nbsp; luckily i'm still at the campground and they have a handy, dandy battery charger.&nbsp; so the guy gives it to me and sends me on my way....guess he figured if i can ride that thing by myself i ought to be able to jump it too.&nbsp; i walk away like a puppy with tail between legs.....a little nervous, cause i've never had to do this myself.....always had a man around.&nbsp; least he is kind enough to remind me black on negative &amp; red on positive.&nbsp; but i'm convinced even if i have to totally unpack my bike &amp; drag out my book i can do this.&nbsp; i remember where charlie said the tool kit was and pull it out for the first time.&nbsp; take out the allen wrench to take the cover off my batter cover....hook her up.....turn her on and listened to her purrrrrrrrrrrr.&nbsp;&nbsp; hey, i did it...and everything went smooth &amp; fast.&nbsp; feeling pretty good at this new accomplishment in my life.&nbsp;        \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
