They may be terribly aligned but hell, at the age of 51, they're pretty dynamite. Yes. He does most of the crab chores at the seafood meals.&nbsp; urlLink     k that wasn't why i wrote bout my dad.the objective was to bitch bout his manners on the road.  As usual, the ride to work today was totally nerve wrecking. He was driving at a deliberate speed as the car on his left who's been wanting to keep right for the longest time. Simply refuses to let the poor dude in. Why? Personal reasons, didn't like 'the guy's face'????  His philosophy of driving as dictated below: One Do not give way to Mercedes drivers. they are snobbish and will never thank you for giving way. Two Do not give way to lorries and cabbies. cos they are reckless drivers??? and cos they've never given him way either i reckon. Three Do not give way to lady taitai drivers cos they're the worst of the lot (probably bought the license somewhere) and can't drive for nuts. Four Do not squeeze your way in front of his car without signalling. He will not hesitate to squeeze alongside with you until the sides are close enough for you to look at the driver and see his white hair (unless you're a lorry or old wreck). Five All bikers are a nuisance (cos they always appear in his blind spot when he needs to switch lanes, that i call it 'suay') Five Always prepare your cash card for ERP entries etc. He will not hesitate to BLAST the horns till the security guards are roused from sleep.  That's my dad. The rude pig male driver.            swearwords:  n . word considered obscene or blasphemous.  when angry, count four. when very angry, swear - mark twain  strange. i've never hesitated to count till four before swearing. my first swear word was fuck and i was eight then. my mom chased me round the house with a cane and i didn't utter the word until my late teens. in fact, i never knew i was a swearer until my ex art directors imitated my identifiable form of swearing: FUCK. i cursed alot when i was a suit. advertising makes you short tempered. in fact, it made you nasty.  in the creative department i say fuck. in the media corner, i say 'ta ma de'. fortunately, i had very civil workmates in the production and studio departments (fairly unusual i should say). in the accounts deparment, i DO NOT swear at all cos i'm always late in submitting claims. so, i guess i'm bilingual after all. i can curse in malay too (of which i learnt from my previous account director who swore at EVERYTHING).  it was kinda hilarious looking back cos i'm pretty sure my tow kay GM would be mortified to discover this crude side of his sweet demure suits. but that's also cos he's never been subjected to the silly whims and fancies and worse yet, stupidity of certain clients. then again, i had a cool client who cursed more than i did. he says fuck more often than not but in a sociable way.  for instance fuck, what's wrong with your media planner? this is screwed up man...(and it was true so no complaints) fuck, your boss (GM) just called me. what the fuck does he want? tell him i'm not signing the 20 insertions for TODAY. no budget. (likewise how to complain when i totally agree with the client?)  fuck is the universal word for swearing. we've even created hand gestures in case we cannot hear the swearing. eg, when u're in the car and wanna curse the moron who almost scratched the paint off your sides. what do you do? give him the middle finger. or slam your fist into your palm. or if u're still ladylike in that situation, simply use a v- shaped peace gesture but flash it with the back of your hand facing the receiver. you can use the word or gesture any where in the world and still be understood (and punched in the face). isn't it simply amazing? Its global yet local.  i used to and still wonder about the person who first coined the word fuck. how did he or she create such a significant word that could release our daily frustrations and anger? how fascinating it would be coining swearwords as a career. maybe retired or jaded copywriters should experiment with that. i think they'll have plenty of unleased potential. till then, i'm mighty happy swearing fuck.              It's&nbsp;strange how&nbsp;single people&nbsp;are generally&nbsp;less anal if they found the 'love of a good woman/ man'. i witnessed&nbsp;an old acquaintance who had been glowing from ear to ear having been recently attached. Terrance then told me his friend's 'happy quotient' went up from 4 to 8 after finding his significant other. The challenge is not about love itself&nbsp;but rather about finding a&nbsp;good or right person who would give you that thing called LOVE. It was heartening to hear&nbsp; and we were happy for him. The very same night, dora decided to find out about our own futures by bugging Jacky to read our palms.   I should&nbsp; never have relented cos what he told me was something&nbsp;which i've feared most. that i was destined to be single for the rest of my life. I know i should not believe in such airy fairy predictions on my future but to have the same prediction over the last 9 years by 4 different people is indeed freaking me out.&nbsp; And certain recent incidents had me pretty upset and angry at myself for being in&nbsp;a similar situation which i've sworn never to be in&nbsp;if i had the choice. and i&nbsp;HAD&nbsp;that choice. and i found myself crying during that night again.   kyle's parting words six years ago finally hit me. 'You're too hard on yourself and your expectations of others. learn to let yourself go and someday you'll thank yourself for that.' I never did quite understood what&nbsp;he meant&nbsp;but i think i do now. i've been pushing myself&nbsp;so very&nbsp;hard for the past 3 years and its toll&nbsp;had finally caught up. this insane need to prove myself to no one is driving me to up the wall. who am i proving and justifying myself to? me. because i cannot fail to...myself. i can now understand why Kyle left everything behind&nbsp;six years ago&nbsp;to pursue the life of a nomad. i was much younger then and could not forgive him for his seemingly selfish actions. but i do now. because it's totally fucked up&nbsp;staying here and knowing the constant would never change.&nbsp;     \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
