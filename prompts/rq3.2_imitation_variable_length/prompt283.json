I like to leave the link at the top there so everyone can use it. Aren't I kind? (Entirely rhetorical. Don't answer.)  Rob told me to blog. So I am.  Look! Blog! Isn't that great?  What's going on then? Tomorrow, I have an 'Industry Day', where I get to spend the whole day in school doing... Hell, I don't even know what it's meant to be. What a load of shit. What's that Mr. Mathieson? I just suffered the most boring week of my 6th form life and now you're telling me I have to do even more shit? Thanks a fucking lot.  What else? I'm bored. I had a bacon sandwich earlier on. I liked it.  What else? I had some skittles earlier too. They were also nice.  What else? Somebody phoned me lots of times. And my house too. If you wish, I will tell you the number and you can see if you know who it is. It is very disturbing.  What else? I have induction training at Waitrose on friday. That should be fun. Once I start, I will be on Â£3.90 an hour, thursday and friday nights. Plus, if I do overtime I get more money. PLUS, if I work on sundays I get 'time-and-a-half', meaning I get all the money I earn that day plus half again, in case you didn't know.  Anything else? No? Good. That's quite long enough. Congratulations for surviving my post. I like them long, as you can tell.                                 Well, today, I have done very little. I watched a film about some guys who were trapped in space and got rescued by Russians. I also gave not unconsiderable thought to how capitalist bastards are destroying hippies like myself. Admittedly I have only been a hippy for 3 days, and I don't smoke, or chain myself to trees, and casual sex... well, I just don't get the chance. But anyway, I was thinking about how we could make the insurance cheaper, and I have had the following idea, assisted by my wonderful mother. What we do is: Designate 2 drivers, and I would go for Vicky and Bri, since they are learning to drive even as we speak, but also because they have less insurance to pay because they are female, and also by the time of the trip they should, with care, have a few months of no claims too. Then we get my mum to by the insurance in her name, and nominate Vicky and Bri as drivers. We are not sure if this will work, but it might, and she has lots of no claims. This should lower the price considerably. Then, we divide the cost between everyone concerned, and life is good. After that, I may be able to foot the bill for most of the van, since this years EMA was mostly going to be saved up for a car, and a hippy van is far better. If anyone else, such as Penman actually manages to find a good job and wants to go parts with me, that's cool. Very few people could have thought this far ahead in the space of 2 days, so kudos to me for being obsessed  and  bored. What a long post that was. Apologies to anyone who this doesn't concern and just came here by accident, the rest of the blog is far more interesting, so read that. Cheers.                       ...find what you all desire/need, and only then can you go home and avoid looking eachother in the eye afterwards.' The group stared at eachother, all felt that they were happy so what could they possibly need? 'How about looking in the mirror from Harry Potter that showed your hearts desire?' suggested Vicky 'And where is this mirror?' inquired Rob 'We'd have to ask Dumbledore' 'But...' and so on and so forth Rob destroyed Vicky's logic till the Davemother who knew Vicky to be right, stopped Rob by giving him blue eyes, rosy cheeks and a cute little dog to complete the sissy look. Rob hid behind a tree. 'Now listen,' the davemother said, 'i will give you a clue for what Rob needs...or I shall just tell you cause he really needs MODESTY!' 'Do not, Im perfect!' Rob proclaimed The others looked at eachother and agreed first get the modesty before midnight (well you know that someone would kill Rob if he didnt have some by then) and then after to search for this mirror and seek what each desired. The fairy davemother was to come along to, to finally rid her/himself of this cross dressing curse bestowed by someone with a poor sense of humour. And off they went on their journey but had not gone far when...                           So, hello. It's me...grooowl. So a run down of todays events: 1) I woke up, ate, had a shower and headed to school for my history exam. The history exam was piss easy because it was a source paper and there wern't too many questions unlike last time >:( ! 2) I went to see Mr Mathieson (or however its spelt) to get my sixth form induction sheet. Yeh thats right! I'm going to sixth form! ^.^ Hoorah! But now I'm not sure if I want to do french or not. Maybe I'll do biology? 3) I went to Pete's house (as if you all know him...) with Brownie, Dave, Kirsten and Steve. I don't like Steve much. We then travelled to Daves house to retrieve my monkey hoody...and then to Steves to check his dog wasn't dead ;) 4) We all went into plymouth, managed to get child tickets and headed to subways (mmmmm!) we then went about the shops and I got mocked for working in freezeways :( argh! 5) We went to the guitar shop and I sat there all jealous and grumpy 'cos I can't play. I really wish I could, I must learn. But first I must find enough money to pay for my guitar...and my new phone...and my MP3 player...and my Green Day T shirt. Life is SOOO unfair! - Kevin stylee 6) Came home, and wrote on here.  Now, I know that wasn't interesting but I'm bored as fuck, so live with it!                                 Heelllloooooo!!!!
