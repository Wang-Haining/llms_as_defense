Today's post is inspired by lyrics to a Dashboard Confessional song, and also brought to you by the letters 'F' and 'T'.  (Sesame Street kicks ass!)  I am vindicated I am selfish I am wrong I am right I swear I'm right I swear I knew it all along. And I am flawed But I am cleaning up so well. I am seeing in me now the things you swore you saw yourself.  I was going through my garage and found a box of old pictures and old poems and shit I wrote when I was younger.  Walking down memory lane told me one thing...  I was fucked up when I was a teenager!  I was imagining what my life would be like if I kept going down that path I was on.  Literally, I would probably be dead.  And it would probably be over a stupid reason too...  like a girl or something.         Thank God I was blessed with the ability to look at my life, see how much it sucks, and it turn laugh at it.  Otherwise, I would probably be in a gutter somewhere eating shit.  'I eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast!'  'You eat pieces of shit for breakfast?!?'  'What are you too good for your home?!?'  (Happy Gilmore)       Overall, the weekend was a good one.  I got to hang out with China on Sunday.  I hardly ever hang out with her on the weekend anymore because of her hectic schedule.  The best part about my weekend...  I got to see a bunch of old pictures of Ang and Kathy.  I laughed so hard that my contact came out of my eye!  Lookin' good ladies!                       Hey folks!  Good to talk to you again.  I hope all you kiddies had a good 3-day weekend too!  I know I did.   Friday - My good friend Elliot is back in San Diego.  He was in Virginia for the past few years for school.  He graduated (consequently making me feel like a loser for not finishing school).  We hung out with my friends Anthony, China and Alex that night too.  T'was a good time!  Didn't get to bed until 3:30 in the AM... Saturday - Had to wake up at 4:30 = 1 hour of sleep.  Went to work from 6-10am.  Then went to Angela's mom's house to visit all the relatives from Wisconsin.  Cool people I must say!  Love the accents!  Sat around drinking beer and playing speed with Angela, Kathy and Danny.  According to Kathy, I guess I need a bib when I drink beer.  I do like to slobber!  : ) Sunday - Slept until about 3:30 in the afternoon.  Such a bum!  Then went and hung out with Angela. Monday - Went to Sea World with Angela and the kiddies.  Had a good time.  Got sunburned.  I was actually shocked that I did because I'm so freakin' dark.  Oh well...  Also got soaked on all the stupid water rides.  Who would have thought that you can get wet in a place like 'Sea World.'  Hmmph. The rest of the day today is going to be filled with work and working out at the gym.  My life is just one big party huh?                       I discovered today that my sweat glands are sooooo bass-akwards.  We are throwing a baby shower for our boss here at work and the gift we got her is a bassinet.  So because I possess a Y chromosome, I was charged with the duty of assembling the bassinet.    Mind you, assembling a bassinet is not physical work.  But for some God forsaken reason, I was sweating like a pig in a turtleneck.  You would think I was assembling this bassinet on the surface of the sun or in hell or something.  The weird thing is, whenever I work out, on hot summer days, whatever else it is, I NEVER SWEAT.  What is the deal with that?    Someone tell me that it's not just me.  Someone tell me that I don't need to go to the doctor.    By the way, for the nerds out there, I know that pigs do not sweat.  It was just an expression.  On a totally unrelated subject, let me tell you all about my weekend...  On Friday I saw Lit and Hoobastank in concert.  It was a FUCKIN' AWESOME SHOW!  I was goin' crazy that night.  By the way, I didn't sweat there either.  Even though there was like 10 people crammed into each square foot.  Saturday my friend Kathy had a party because she graduated from beautician school and it was our friend Ziggy's birthday.  So happy birthday to Zig and congrats Kathy.  Sunday was a day to be lazy.  I did go to the gym.  Here's a pop quiz to make sure you were paying attention:  Did I sweat?  Anyway, I'm done rambling.  Catch ya'll on the flipside!                       I am in quite a funk today and I can't seem to figure out why.  I just spent 10 minutes staring at my spaghetti trying to figure out what color it is...  It's not red and it's not orange.  I will call it 'Sporangetti Red.'  Maybe cause I woke up about an hour ago and went right into work...  Dunno. This funk is funking me out.  What the funk!?!  Or as my friend Angela would say, 'I am in a mood today.'  She is probably right.  I guess I can be pretty moody.  I need some sort of constant in my life I guess. Maybe this is partly because my friend is going to be gone all weekend and I don't know what I am going to do with myself.  Don't get me wrong, I have other plans this weekend too!  I am hanging out with my other best friend China on Saturday, so that will be cool.  I just don't hang out with China as much because the two of us have such opposing schedules.   Oh well!  It's not the end of the world.  I'm sure China and I will just drink all weekend until we're too drunk to stand or realize that what we're sitting on is not really a toilet, but the VIP booth of a club.  Alcohol solves all problems doesn't it?                       This past weekend was/is a complete haze.  Let me start by saying to everyone out there in the world...  If I called you at any point between 11:00pm and 3:00am on Saturday, then I apologize for anything 'inappropriate' that I may have said.  If anything, I guess I'm also sorry if I happened to wake you up.  But in my defense, WHAT WAS YOUR ASS DOING ASLEEP ON A SATURDAY NIGHT ANYWAY!?! Anyway, I'm pretty sure I had a good time on Saturday.  Me and my friend China, China, China, China, China (what do you think of that Queen Kate) went to a club.  We went ghetto style.    ghetto style:  ghetto style in this case is buying a bottle of vodka and making your own drinks before you even get to the spot.  it involves getting drunk before you even get there.  let's face it, my cheap ass is not paying $8 for a watered-down drink!  I spent all day Sunday being hungover.  I always recommend that!  (in a sarcastic tone)  We went to Sea World to check out the new water ride they got there.  So, we waited in line for about an hour before we finally get the news that the ride is 'temporarily out of service.'  FUCK THAT!  So, China, her sister Monica and I left and went to the Budweiser beer school.  We all graduated and got our Beer School Diplomas.  See Mom, I told you I would finish school!  Needless to say, I don't think drinking 6 glasses of beer superfast was the surefire cure for a hangover...  I guess I'll take off now, I feel myself rambling on...  Where the hell is that beer?                       I don't think I will be able to post this weekend, so I want to take the time to tell everyone HAPPY 4th of JULY!  I hope everyone has a good weekend.  I know I will.  I get to hang out w/ Angela and Kathy this weekend.  Speaking of the two of them, they actually inspired the rest of this post...  I realized this after my conversations with the both of them from last night and this morning.  I'm assuming everyone at one point or another has had a headache.  DUH.  Have you ever noticed that when you get a headache, something about it affects your brain.  This headache MAKES you want to tell EVERYONE that you have a headache.  Not only that, you have to use this exact phrase:  'I have SUCH a headache right now.'  No exceptions...  Also, when you do have a headache, you have to make sure that you tell the other person at least 5 times in the conversation that you do have a headache.  Here is Kathy and my conversation last night as an example:  Renan : I rode an elephant today.  Kathy : I have SUCH a headache right now.  Renan : Really?  That sucks.  Kathy : I hate my kids!  Why don't they understand that I have SUCH a headache right now.  Renan : Why the hell hasn't Angela called me yet?  It's already 9!  Kathy :  I dunno.  Does she know I have SUCH a headache right now?  Renan : Probably not.  I need to get a haircut.  Kathy : Yeah, probably a cool, MIL-tary style haircut (in a southern accent)  God, I have SUCH a headache right now.  Renan : I know, you told me.  Cool, Angela's calling me right now, I gotta go.    Kathy : Tell her to call me back and that I have SUCH a headache right now!  I hope you all see now what I'm talking about.  I will be conducting further research on this.    HAPPY BIRTHDAY AMERICA!         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
