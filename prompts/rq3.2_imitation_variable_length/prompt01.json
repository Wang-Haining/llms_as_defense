From: Nur  Sent: Thursday, July 15, 2004 10:06 AM Subject: Warm Fuzzies  interpersonaL skiLLs?? a kind act to make the other person smile…  from www.care2.com Warm Fuzzies: A Random Act of Kindness    Adapted from How to Read Signs and Omens in Everyday Life, by Saravananda Bluestone (Inner Traditions, 2002).   When the author was a camp counselor, she reports that stress levels were high and exhaustion was epidemic--until she tried this exercise with a group. She noticed an almost immediate shift away from stress and irritation toward more relaxed ways of being, not only in her group but throughout the camp.   Simple Solution:  The key : Writing anonymous, loving, sincere letters that expressed appreciation for someone else in the camp. Evidently, everyone can use a few real, genuine warm fuzzies. And the author notes that the people who enjoyed it the most were the ones who wrote the letters!   If you would like to practice more random acts of kindness, try this with your co-workers or other group (or you can go it alone). It only takes a minute and the results are well worth it. Here’s how to make the world a warmer place, one letter at a time:   Here is the formal “game” approach:  1. Play this “game” with three or more people.  2. Take a few minutes for everybody to concentrate on the others in the group. Try to pick up some characteristics about each person, the way he carries himself, the way he speaks, anything.  3. Write one paragraph to each person in the group. Without judgment, write something kind and sincere about the person that has to do with who that person is. It is not at all necessary to know the person you are writing about.  4. Put the name of the person you are writing about on the paper, but do not include your name.  5. One person collects the papers and distributes to the others the warm fuzzies that were written about them.  6. Each person reads some or all of his aloud.  7. No comments are allowed.   Here is the individual approach:  Simply write a sincere anonymous letter to someone you know, focusing on some quality of theirs that you like or admire.    SO HAVE YOU MADE A PERSON SMILE TODAY??                           'If your dream brings you joy, take it as a blessing from your Lord. Express gratitude and share it with others. However, if it incites fear, then remember it is but an assault from Satan. Seek refuge in Allah from its evil and do not mention it to anyone, for that shall annul any harm intended to you.'    - The Prophet Muhammad, as reported by Abu Sayeed al-Khodri    urlLink   ...i had a dream yesterday nite...the dream made me feeL extremeLy at ease, masha'Allah...it had something to do with someone whom i had been thinking of these past few days...someone whom i am missing at the moment but unabLe to get in touch with as we have Lost contact with each other for the past 3 years...i wished i never woke up from that dream...its Like as if that person knows that i am thinking about her/him and was trying to communicate thru my dream...  i have Learnt aLot from that person and want to say thanks for everything...that person have taught me that Losing a person physicaLLy doesnt mean you Lose that person forever...the person that you Lose stiLL Lives inside your heart...Letting go of that someone hurts but it wiLL be a decision that you wiLL never ever regret...  insha'ALLAH, i wiLL meet you again my dear fren...maybe tomorrow, maybe next year or maybe 10 years Later...
