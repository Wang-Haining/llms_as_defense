February. 2000   I smile  He told me I had a good voice, pretty eyes, but then claimed allerigies when I tried to repay with a kiss. Is it my inexperience? My naivete that keeps them away.   You make the best friend they say. And its always just me alone  at the end of the day. Mentally I went beyond the physical, emotionally I moved beyond the mental. But there's still the emptiness, there's still the physical, and so my lonliness begins to feel simply logical. In that moment I began to make my masks, hiding from myself even, anything even remotely resembling human contact.  And the cobwebs form, the dust settles, the shadows move in to claim their domain and I pretend that I like them, that I love the dark.  I pretend to enjoy only what I can see in the light.  I tend to my hidden places because even I know that to shed light on them would destroy my logical existence.  I smile when love blossoms in the world around me.  I smile and step down on another thorm from my hidden places, my savage garden.  I smile and shed another drop of blood to my pain.    I smile- and you say I'm the best friend you could ever have.      Written. 14. November. 2000   I had the oddest dream last night.  Or rather a series of dreams.  A family with a secret who was forced to destroy its home- and the one that sits more uneasily with me:  Alison who had powers, a dragon ability, fell in love with the devil.  And how he was attractive.  I think I fell in love with him, too.  After losing her head, she gave up her powers in order to live with him in Hell.  They left, and I was to await either his return, or David's.  Mother actually came, and there was a huge fight.  A school type function, and then I called Him- and he was so wonderful- so alluring and captivating.  He and Alison had broken up and I pleaded my case- he agreed.  Then the alarm woke me up.    I can never describe it well enough afterwards, can never get all the little details.  Was I dreaming about Keith and this upcoming date symbolically?  I wish I could find the meaning of it.  Was it a warning?  A test of some kind to be passed?  Gods, I wish I knew.  I nearly called in so I could go back to it.  I'm here at work, however.  And still very much affected by it.  I imagine I will be for quite awhile.         Written. 30. August. 2000   Its time for me to stop and take a breath- to look around and see what I can see.  Not that I'm going too fast, But I'm too deep, too mired down in the mundane, slowly drowning without even knowing it.  I have to take a step back and look at the whole of it- at least that which I can See.    Perhaps I'm so deeply embedded in the little things that I've really become detached from Spirit and so yearn for adventure, for change I know I don't need.  I wish I could meld the two, so I could function smoothly between, ins tead of having to flip back and forth, using energy and resources that are limited to begin with.  This is my goal, to achieve fluidity; as I grow and learn I believe it can happen.      Through it all there is this lethargy, a weariness that grows every day, an increasing desire for true silence.  I fight myself even as I am resigning myself to the care of Spirit, and it is exhausting me.    I've begun to wonder how much further I can go alone.  I wonder if I even want to.       Written. 2. January. 2000   ( This was written about a man who I gave 5 long years to.  And to whom I am still enternally bonded.  We may never speak to each other again, and ours is a long, long story, but we'll always be each others.  And no, it was never a romantic relationship. )  There's a feeling of justification as I sit here writing, a feeling that I did what needed to be done.  Ours paths are ultimately seperate, but forever intertwined; in that respect we'll always be friends.  But I need to embark on a personal journey, I need to go forward and carve my own niche, and he can't be there for that. Its the same feeling from San Antonio, and this time I HAVE to act on it- I have to heed the calling.  Its time for my spark to flare to brilliant life.        He heard his calling long ago.  And I'm sorry if these actions and decisions hurt him, but its my turn to shine.  I know how selfish that sounds, and that's not how its meant.  I want him to understand, but its not necessary for me to keep going if he doesn't.    Its almost as though I'm standing outside of myself watching the drama.  I don't need him anymore, though I'll always want him near me.  There's a transcendance here, of all the things small and material, and he knows it.  The move was a catalyst only.  I'm happy where I am.  I'm safe.  I'm excited about my future.  I'm free.  I'm challenged, and esteemed, and centered within myself.  I'm ready.  I'm not forsaking the past, nor ignoring the present.  I'm finally learning all my lessons.  I'm doing it without him.  No bad blood, no ill will.  I'm coming into my own, on my own.  I feel justified.  I feel right.  I feel whole.  I feel love.      I feel alive.   \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
