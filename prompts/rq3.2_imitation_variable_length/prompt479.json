Primarily surrounding my impending trip (the tasks for which I have to complete in the next 4 weeks are driving me steadily insane).  1. Between now and February 2005, I will probably see John for a grand total of three days. I was trying to swing a 'quick' stopover to Beijing en route to Dhaka, but the airline prices are astronomical. Admittedly, I'm not the one paying for it, but I do have a limited budget. I'd rather blow the cash on a vacation to Cambodia or something later.  2. My love of the Lord of the Rings has reached embarrassingly obsessive proportions. I own each DVD of the trilogy now, and sit for hours drooling over the extras late into the night. I'm also reading the book. I think genius of J.R.R. Tolkein is up there with some of the greatest minds of our time, surpassing even the brilliance of Pauly Shore.  3. My sister is the greatest. I've been having such a great time with her this weekend doing absolutely nothing. We went shopping (one of my least favorite activities in the world), watched some TV, and practiced the German liederhosen dance from Steven Colbert's routine on the 'Strangers with Candy' DVD. Our parents looked at us (quite rightly) like we were insane. I love having a best friend for a sister.  4. Everyone's getting married except me. This Saturday my sister went to a second of her high school friends' weddings this summer. These women have to be 21 or 22. I'm 23, so by West Michigan standards, I'm quickly approaching Old Maidom. It's all right with me, mama.  5. Recent movies: Monsieur Ibrahim, The Fog of War, The Triplets of Belleville. All excellent. On my cinema horizon: Napoleon Dynamite, Goodbye Lenin, The Lord of the Rings DVDs (again).  Well, I'm off to have dinner with the family and some of our closest friends. It's Bengali food night, so the whole house is perfumed with various fish odors. I'll be eating some 'niramish' (vegetables).  Enjoy the rest of the weekend.  Tanya                           * feel free to comment on any of my posts, whether you are a Blogger user or not. I've changed my settings to allow all of my web-using friends to drop notes on my weblog! *   Though I still walk with a noticeable limp, things south of my knee are steadily improving. It looks worse than it is, with the purply-black bruises adorning the left side of my foot, but the physical therapy sessions that I started yesterday are sure to put me on the road to recovery. Even if the sessions are a bit strange.  The pleasant, young, blonde therapist who was working on me asked me what my 'goals' of physiotherapy were. It was hard for me not to answer that question with the obvious 'um...my goal is to not feel like crap', but I bit the bullet and replied with some cheesy, plastic response ('I want to learn how to improve my health overall and avoid future injury). After some strange tests and a somewhat uncomfortable 'massage' of my plump ankle, she hooked me up--quite literally--to a machine that sent electrical shocks to my leg. It was a 1960's looking computer thing, rolled in on a cart, complete with the sticky pad and wires, hooked onto four carefully chosen spots on my foot and leg. I found myself feeling slightly panicked, as if my foot were about to undergo a lie detector test (had my foot been dishonest?). I imagined the machine asking my foot questions like 'so Tanya wasn't actually  carrying  anything when she tripped over the curb?' or 'has she sprained you before?' perhaps 'have you been forced involuntarily into stilettos in the past month?' My foot would have to shamefully answer 'yes' to all accounts. I think my feet STILL hurt from those notorious $70.00 strappies I wore to Meg's wedding.  Anyway, other than the podiatry lie-detector device, the rest of the appointment was fine. She gave me some exercises to do, including tracing the alphabet with my foot thrice a day. Hey, it's harder than it sounds. I keep forgetting 'W.' I sure hope everyone else dumps the 'W' on November 2nd...  Well, tomorrow is the one-week anniversary of 'the fall.' I hope it'll get better soon so it can stop dominating all of my blog posts. For now, I just bask in the glow of the sympathetic looks and the I'll-get-that-for-yous. The Chairman/CEO/owner of our company (for whom I work) was so concerned that he left me a little note by my computer before he left for vacation. 'Sorry to hear about your ankle! Here's to a speedy recovery!' He asks about it every time he calls into the office. It's very sweet.  Here's to a speedy recovery indeed.                        Sadly, I learned late last night that my paternal grandmother had passed away in India. She was 87 years old.  &nbsp;  All of we grandchildren call her 'Ogo,' a pet name that our Dadu (grandfather) gave her. A 'domestic engineer' all her life, Ogo bore and raised five children and stood proudly by my grandfather's side as he traveled the world lecturing and researching at universities world-wide, from Stanford to the University of Ghana in West Africa. She was a strong woman who ran an efficient household, even until the last years of her life.&nbsp;Our family legend even involves&nbsp;Ogo's&nbsp;run-in with a cobra that had somehow gotten inside our house in Calcutta. That cobra is now sitting on a window sill&nbsp;coiled in a glass jar, preserved in a chemical cocktail that my&nbsp;Dadu &nbsp;dreamed up. I've seen it, and photographed it.  &nbsp;  Ogo was strong, but gentle. She sacrificed, yet she had conviction. She was kind to everyone she met, and she seemed to love people of all cultures. Many a 'bideshi' (foreigner) has been a guest in her home. When she reached her later years, Ogo began to develop a pigment disorder, and large portions of her body lost their color and became white. It gave her a somewhat 'spotted' appearance,&nbsp;which I always found benign and endearing. Now that I think about it, I've never known a non-spotted Ogo...I guess it would seem strange to me to have a uni-color grandmother!  &nbsp;  I was fortunate enough to have seen my grandmother last year. I visited Calcutta several times between January and April of 2003. I was next door in Dhaka, Bangladesh doing an internship and crashed at Ogo's flat.&nbsp; I would tell her of my Bangladesh adventures, recount stories, sing songs, and do impersonations. She said I was 'exactly like her Bobby' (my Dad).&nbsp;Below is a picture with Ogo, my two paternal&nbsp;aunts (her daughters), and myself. We were sitting in Ogo's bedroom in Calcutta. I feel&nbsp;incredibly&nbsp;blessed to have had the fortune to be there. Before last year, I hadn't visited my family in India for TEN years...  &nbsp;  Both now passed on, My Ogo and Dadu leave behind a strong legacy--a legacy of selflessness, charity, and love. I hope that we as the new generation can carry on their legacy in our relationships with each other, in our professions, and in our lives.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;                           I've just returned from Washington D.C. after an invigorating week at the Fulbright Orientation for scholars traveling to North Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. It was truly awesome, and now I'm even more pumped for my trip to Bangladesh. I'll try not to yap about it too much, but a few thoughts on the program:  1. My 'cohort' is truly fantastico (if I do say so myself--wink wink). Among the group there were Rhodes scholars, Harvard grads, activists, world-travelers, and generally bright people. The best part was that every single person in that room had serious leadership qualities. It wasn't a roomful of nerdy geniuses who were work-horses but socially inept. Everyone there was the kind of person that would come up to you, introduce themselves, shake your hand, and ask about you, and maybe even crack a few jokes in Arabic. I felt honored to be among them (though I'm still convinced that I may have been selected due to some administrative error during the application process or something).  2. The orientation really stressed cultural exchange and mutual understanding more than the research. One program officer said that it wasn't as important to 'have perfect data' as it was to interact with people, volunteer, and generally be a personal diplomat. They explicitly told us that we were not to be mouthpieces for the U.S. government or its foreign policy (praise Allah), but rather human bridges between people here and people abroad. The most important part of our Fulbright experience, we were told, was when we returned home to educate Americans about other countries and cultures...especially crucial for the region of the world we're all going to. In the past, war has been the only way most Americans learn their world geography.  3. I met the two other students traveling to Bangladesh. Katie, who comes from a small town in Wisconsin and is married to a Bangladeshi man, is really cool. I got a chance to meet her Mom (hilarious) and sister as well. She has a really unique perspective on Bangladeshi culture through the eyes of an American Bangladeshi 'bo'(wife). She also has some mad Bengali language skills. Keisuke, a Cornell grad from L.A., is a true-go getter, but he knows how to have a good time. It was totally his idea to take a picture with the three of us in front of the NPR building in Washington, spelling out the letters N-P-R with our arms. I have a feeling we're going to have a lot of fun traveling the world all together.  4. I got to spend some time with friends from the past as well. I met up with Austin and Jillian two nights in a row, and as a surprise bonus, got to meet up with Freddy Blavin as well. It was a treat. Fredo, as usual, tried to bite my 'sausage fingers,' as I simulated dunking him into a large tub of BBQ sauce (I always joked that he resembled a chicken McNugget in high school).   Saturday night I got to hang out with Beth and her buddies from High School. They are so funny that my sides hurt today from laughing all night. They remind me of Christie, Peggy, Meghan and myself (tear). I love having friend clicks, I ain't gonna lie.  That's enough for now. Don't worry...plenty of gushing about my fellow Fulbrighters to come. Tah-tah.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
