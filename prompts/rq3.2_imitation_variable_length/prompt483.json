It all started...*doodle oodle loo doodle oodle loo*  Rachael and I arrived at Olander at 8:30 on Saturday morning. We met the rest of the team, and set up our sleeping bags and stuff. Then all of the teams gathered around to sing the national anthem before the opening lap. During the song, i saw Jake. JAKE!!!! I love Jake, he's so hott. He's only an eighth grader, but he looks MUCH older. So while we were singing, he shouts 'USA' really loud and totally embarrases me. But I don't mind. The relay starts and we do our laps and what-not.  Chelsea and I take a little break to watch the band preform, while other people do their laps, and the lead singer, Brandon, doesnt know the words to the songs he's singing, but hes very attractive, so it doesnt really matter. We tye-dye our T-shirts and then we go back to the tent.  Around five, Chris, Lauren and Jessica just HAVE to leave. So once they left, we did a couple more laps, and some other stuff happened...LIKE ALEX and SARA. Sara who i strongly dislike, and Alex who is cute, smart, and funny are practically oogling in my face. this upsets me.  Later around seven, chels and i hit the kareoke place. where chelsea falls madly in love with Ben. For this, i cannot blame her. Ben is ridiculously good-looking. We stay forever to watch him sing, and he does, and the people love him. Ashley, who was sitting in front of us, asked him how old he was, he's in eighth grade too. What is with this younger boy thing???  We walk back to the tent and who stops me? JAKE of course, along with his little buddy asking me for my wrist band. I GLADLY give it to him. and he walks away.  Any way Ashley Chels and I harrass some little kids, and they cancel the relay at 11:30, and i go home. thats about it.  WAHOO!  Around five, Chris, Lauren, and Jessica just HAVE to leave.                  i must be one of the biggest losers of all time. i have went into a slightly red-headed infatuation with E.N. i was at his web-site and reading all about his hunky goodness and then i stopped and was like what the hell am i doing here? he doesn't even know who i am.  what am i supposed to do? there are only a select few days of school left. he MUST find out who i am but at the same time, no, he cannot, because if he did, he'd think i was a total freak. now, i've heard some talk about him 'he smokes, he has a fondness for alcoholic bevs, he likes to do drugs, hes a man whore' and ive also heard that hes actually not that attractive up close. (this i have reason to doubt) anyway, i am just very confused and i shouldnt be because its not even a big deal. BECAUSE HE DOESNT KNOW WHO I AM i apparently need to get out of this dillusional state of mind where i think that life is a musical and that one day he'll come up to me in the hallway start singing 'your song' by elton john and spin me around while im wearing a gorgeous red satin dress.  its simply not happening because i am a loser and he is not. sigh. any advice?                 Ok so today Megan Lauren and I went to Bob and Evan's...formally known as Bob Evans. And there was this crazy man in an electric wheel chair and he ran into Lauren and then he ran into the booth next to us and then ran into Lauren again, and i was trying soooo hard not to laugh, and so was Megan so she shoveld a bunch of salad into her mouth to keep from laughing then she dropped some onto her shirt, so i started laughing hysterically because i really needed to laugh at the man in the wheelchair. we laughed for like ten minutes at the man in the wheelchair. and lauren didnt even notice! Does this make me a horrible person??  Anyway so also we found a horoscope guide for next year and i am supposed to be a love match with a taurus! January horoscope 'its a new year, and with the new moon in your sign on the 10th (my birthday!!), you will have an exciting secret crush. a good friend fills you in on need to know info, and you use it to impress him. your world is in order finally' Ok it also says that Jan 10 is my lucky day.   if you know what i mean...                 Saturday: After i got back from the mall I had to go to a BBQ. After the BBQ, I was off to Megan's to spend the night. We had a good time. Jessica picked us up and took us to MeyjerS and we painted THE ROCK. I wrote 'I heart E.N.' and Megan wrote the same for R.K. Then we were going to do some damage to a certain somebody's house, but some people decided to run back to the car, so we couldn't do it. (did that make sense?) Anyway. Megan and I might have gotten a tad...er...'happy' from the spray paint. She was making really scary piano faces, and i thought it was so funny, i practically peed my pants. But it wasnt actually that funny. heh.  Sunday: I TALKED TO E.N. and he said 'You know Maxwell's coffee shop? I might end up there tomorrow...you should come' OH MY GOD. I almost had a hernia. So then i took my dad past the rock and somebody duct-taped my heart. i was crushed. Megan also spray-painted over hers cuz she was embarassed. SIGH. anyway, i'm going out with Jackie and Delia might come too. We are going to go see yet another movie. Like i don't spend enought money as it is. Chelsea made me kind of mad because she didnt take the tape off of the heart. (sorry i just felt i needed to say that). Ok well i guess thats all.                 So at school friday they had this thing called 'fun day'. which is a lie, because it was actually only like, 'fun hour and a half'. They had battle of the bands, and they all sucked arse until Poon Tang came on and they were awesome. my buddy EN is in that band. it was hott. anyway so then i went home on the cheese with Rachael and we got pizza and later Delia and Divya and Lauren and Jack came over and we went to see Troy. TROY IS THE LAMEST MOVIE. It was like three hours of Brad Pitt beathing the crap out of people in leather skirt like things. Personally, i don't find brad pitt very attractive, but, whatever. it still sucked. so delia and i had to keep from dying of bordem by throwing reeses peices at people below us. *Sigh*. anyway then we went back to Rach's house and had a good 'ol time.  Micki picked my up at 11 from Rach's then when i got home Lauren F. called and wanted to go to the mall with me and stu. so i had about twenty minutes to get ready. so i speed showered and then we were outie. i bought some cute stuff, i've been home for a half hour and in about another half hour i have to go to a BBQ. There is simply not enough time in a day. let me tell you!                 So we arrived at the beauty Bar around the crack of dawn (or 10:45) and surprised Delia and got our manicures and pedicures. We also visited this store that had lipgloss that burned like fire...it was pretty cool. Then we got a limousine, except it was more like a  jankousine  and the driver happened to be a  wo-man-whoa  (Wo-man-whoa: A distinct gender that resembles a woman's body with a man head while showing both masculine and feminin tendencies)...so that was pretty scary. The ride was fun, then we ate at Zina's or something, some Italian restuarant where i had some brocollini. (Yes, brocollini). We then showed off the jankimo to some friends and went home and ate cake. It was glorious. (Except when Rachael smacked some cake in my face...that was TRES TRES upseting, and i could have&nbsp;killed her...but then her mother would have worried. By the way... RACHAELS A FOOL !!)&nbsp;Oh yes, how could i forget...TINY BABY! We set him ablaze a number of times and eventually melted him back in time. That's right, he is no longer Tiny Baby...he is now Tiny Fetus.&nbsp; I had fun.  'TINY BABY'S ON FIRE!!!'    &nbsp;  and today i almost killed people on airport highway...im never driving again.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  ever.           \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
