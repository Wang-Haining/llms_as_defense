  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic:\n\n       Yesterday I lost my mind.     I woke up with a text from her saying that my texts were so sweet. I shrug it off.   An hour later I text her saying we should just be friends. I was okay. I knew in my heart we needed the time off, trusted that she loved me and certain that I love her. Hopeful that in a few days, weeks, months, we'll be okay and back in each other's arms.   I text her saying she's still my bestfriend.   So I ask her if she wants to be study buddies with me. She texts back that she made plans that afternoon already. I&nbsp;went   ballistic  .   I have never felt this jealous before. Never. (And to think my ex would make me jealous and cheat on me on purpose.) I felt like I was going crazy, like the whole world was going to swallow me up. I'm so scared I texted everyone to help me get through the day.   B, the infamous ex, and some friends helped me get through the day somehow. Somehow.   I text B:   'I'm jealous. Have you ever felt that? The kind where you think you're getting a heart attack. Where you feel your whole heart stops, you can't breathe and your head spins. That's how I feel.'   Or something to that effect.   Anyway, to keep the story short, I have gone mad.    I still am.    Here I am sending her crazy SMS messages when I know that I should just leave her alone. That maybe we are better off apart. That we are NEVER going to work out.   Love has never been this complicated for me.   I have grown into a selfish, jealous person, bitter and unhappy.  Yes Lia, I know I did this all myself.      But all I asked of you was to love me, be with me and help me become a better person. To be honest with me and to fix whatever needed to be fixed. All those other things you accused me of, that I only grew to love you, that I only settled with you, that I only tried to change when things got really bad, I accept it even if it's not true.   Maybe if you had only believed me then maybe you wouldn't be this dissatisfied.   We have succumbed to our insecurities. And we have given up on what we thought was love.    B texted me this:    'Have you tried talking to lia about it? Here's the thing: Lia and You are blessed tobe together. Not all people have what both of you have and we envy you (yes, we d freakin closet romantics). I don't claim to be an expert on this but here's what I know: it's good that both of u trust each other. Hold on to that. That'll hold your relationship together, with friendship and love of course.'       Yes Lia, not many people have what we have. I know you don't see this now but I know we had it the moment we kissed. Heck, even the moment our eyes locked at the chapel. I knew in my heart that you are The One.   I prayed for you months before God sent you to me. I asked Him to send me The One through a meeting in the chapel. I have had that chapel as my secret refuge and I knew that the chances of my meeting The One there was unlikely.   But I did meet you there. At the last pew, you sat beside me. When I had specifically said to meet OUTSIDE the chapel.   Outside the chapel I saw you. A few feet away I saw you, with your spikey hair and tan, leaning against the wall. Then you looked up, our eyes locked and I felt a tug in my heart.   It scared me, to be honest. I wasn't expecting anything like that so early in my life. I had just turned 18 and gotten out of a 3-year 11 month relationship. I wanted to have fun, to date around and take things easy.   I couldn't look you in the eye after that. But you had me then.   I surprised myself by taking a walk under the sun with you, something I never would've done before. So many things happened after, coincidences, signs, whatever.   Then I said 'I love you.' I'm sure you wouldn't remember when and how it happened, but for me, the feeling and the memory burned itself into my mind and my soul. It's still so vivid it feels like yesterday. May 14, 1998, around 4 am, my whole life changed.   I've never been the same after that day, Lia.        I'm sorry I screwed us up.               I've been having a really sucky day.  And I thought I had it all worked out until tonight.&nbsp; I was gonna be fine, I thought.&nbsp; What was another breakup with her anyway?  Then you send me a YM.&nbsp; You asked me what would be a good first year annive gift.&nbsp; Now, of all days you ask me that.  So I answer you best as I can that now is not a good time.&nbsp; That you give her whatever she's been wanting. [I thought, I wouldn't be much help anyway,&nbsp;I don't know her that well.]&nbsp;  Then you call me a bitch.  All day I felt like hanging myself from the ceiling and I had to use every single energy I had to stay afloat.  You, of all people, who knew how it felt to be in my place.  I am genuinely happy for you.&nbsp;No one else can be happier for you than me.&nbsp; You have no right to be this cruel to me just because you found someone to love you and adore you.  I would never drag you into my hangups.&nbsp; I never even told you what was happening to me even though I thought you would be able to knock sense into me.&nbsp; But I guess I'm wrong.&nbsp; You don't deal well with other people's hangups anyway.  And yes, I know I brought all these upon myself.&nbsp; I'm not blaming you or anyone.  I never bad-mouthed that ex of yours who broke your heart.&nbsp; I prayed to God to give you strength when you would text me how miserable you were, 'cause God knows I don't have any to give you.&nbsp; I was going thru deep shit with you.  Just because you're happy and I'm not doesn't mean I bitched on you.&nbsp; You're the last person I want to be a bitch to.   If you only knew.   I'm glad you showed me your true colors.&nbsp; I just didn't think other people's impression of you would be affirmed to me this way.             today no tears were shed.   i'm still at work, trying to figure out what else needs to be done. all work is done, just waiting for boss to get better and make decisions for layouts, etc.   had a fun day at work, actually. not that much to do so i was able to concentrate on my layout work and breathe in between pages. heck, even got to check downelink and blog. :)   i'm still thinking whether i should go to that exclusive this friday or not though...   maybe not.   i think that i should take my  'going straight'  campaign more seriously.   backtrack...   ---  spoke to my friend niquee who's getting married this october. asked her if she was happy with her life. she said, 'it's okay. lesser evil.' for some reason, i knew exactly what she meant. hers was not a fairy tale sort like our other friend mita's. [mita doesn't work, stays at home, pregnant and savoring 7 months of newly-wedded bliss with her husband who showers her with presents, shopping and all that  adoring  attention.]   but i know niquee's as happy as she can get -- for now. and she isn't complaining.   she's thankful she has her   mucho guapito   son Liam (my  inaanak ). she says she doesn't ask for much; just a simple pat on the back from her husband-to-be, a smack and a little holding hands. she doesn't ask for flowers or a date or even heart-stopping, sizzling sex. but she's happy and glad she has Liam and her guy.   that's when it occurred to me that maybe, just maybe, i was hoping for too much with Lia. that i was probably meant to go straight, that what i had with her was just my little chance at happiness and bliss. that i was meant to end up with kids, a husband i don't feel passionately crazy about and a cute little house somewhere.     *my heart just skipped a beat. wonder what that meant?*     Che was probably right. Maybe Lia and I weren't meant to be with each other after all.   ---   spoke to Becky and Therese yesterday. They both agreed that relationships are not easy. that maybe she just needs space.   even my tita said that we will get back together  pa .   i don't know. i'm tired. this time all i have is love and i know for sure it isn't enough. never enough. not with lia.     napapagod din ang puso.     ---   so i'm  'going straight.'    and while i am looking forward to seeing   someone   soon, i know it won't be anything much.    i never did register well with guys.             Yesterday felt like we were a couple again -- at least for some moments.  I love spending time with her; it's never a dull, boring moment with her. Traffic is somewhat my bestfriend when I'm with her. But then again, when difficult subjects arise, it's a different story.  Anyway...  I had a really weird dream this morning.  I was supposed to still have my braces on but then it  was kinda loose so when I tugged on it, some of the brackets came off.  Here's the weird part... When I tugged on it, some of my teeth came off while some brackets tore off a part of some teeth.  Parang I had a chip on my tooth. I was so disturbed by it that I couldn't open my mouth daw and when I did, it was only to stare at my teeth.  I told my dad about this and he said that my dream might have bad messages with it (that someone I know will die). Of course I push the thoughts aside -- it's too early to be morbid.  I guess it was only because we went to a wake last night. Or maybe I'm thinking of the wrong interpretation. Whatever.  ---  Is she or isn't she?  Still in love with B, that is.  Or B still in love with G. Whatever.    It was kinda awkward to see her in a setting different from the usual meetings.  In a social setting, seeing her caused my stomach to do flip-flops and for me to start getting weird paranoid thoughts. (Is G still in love with her?  Is B still not over my G? Are they wishing they were together? What do their friends think? What is G thinking while B is telling a story?  What is G thinking while B retells her story about missing a turn and her studying etc etc? Does G wish I was more like B? Is it really over between them?)  It's so complicated, our situation.  I had her first but she left me for her. She went  back to me after a year and a few months. Then she left me again for her. Then they broke up and she went back to me. Then we broke up and they got together again.  It didn't work out between them now she's with me again.  I have her but she's not happy.  How can I not live with so much baggage when the situation is like this?  She doesn't really understand where I'm coming from, I think.  And I am trying to understand where she's coming from. But for the life of me, we're not seeing eye to eye.  Oh well. At least we're having some fun.  Forget that the kind of fun we're having is oh-so-wholesome. Fun is fun.  ---  But then again, what do I say or think when she asks me what do I do if we never get intimate again?    \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
