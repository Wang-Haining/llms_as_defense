This being my first Frontier experience, I was looking forward to seeing how it compares to  urlLink Southwest  (no contest) and also thrilled to have an affordable non-stop option to Denver.  First off, Frontier has seat assignments (big win).  Second, they allow you to pay $5 and watch any of 24 channels of live TV (including Food Network) via  urlLink DirectTV .  And they serve  urlLink decent   urlLink beer .  I'm not impressed with the  urlLink animals on the planes , but I found out that one of their major ad campaigns centers around the animals talking to each other while sitting at the gate.  Still don't think much of it (in fact probably less) - Southwest's cleverly decorated regional planes win out, hands down.  As does their magazine.  In fact, I quickly flipped through Frontier's rag and wrote it off (read: no crossword).  And when I read in the  urlLink Sunday paper  that it was a new product of their ad agency and was 'worth' $8 a month as a high-end coffee table magazine, I was more than a little skeptical.  So, fly Frontier if you can.  Row 9 is exit row, for those who want some leg room.  And have a Foster's or a Newcastle and pay the $5 for TV, even if only to ensure that the person next to you won't speak to you during the flight.                           Spent the weekend at the  urlLink golf course  with Peach, at what will always be the Sara Lee LPGA tournament, no matter where it is or who sponsors it.  Kind of like how  urlLink Tom Selleck  will always be Magnum PI, even though the show is long over (as is his moustache)...  Started Sunday out with Mimosas and the paper at Peach's, then on to the golf course, where we had a very strategic day.  It's funny how just when we NEEDED a cart to take us to the other side of the course (or to the beer tent) one would appear.  We also got to practice our stealth maneuvers...  Peach to avoid her barfly, and I managed to not be sighted by my father.  It's funny how that childhood game of 'if I don't look at you, you can't see me' seems to work.  :)  I ran into some of my old friends from the Sara Lee, and I think I agreed to be a captain at next year's tournament.  We were lucky enough to spend the afternoon in the Trophy Suite, with a bird's eye view of the 18th green and an unlimited supply of refreshments.  All in all, a good time for everyone.  ...until we got to E and Peach was so happy to see The Vest back from his vacation that she kissed him and threw the poor boy into shock, causing him to break a glass and slice off his hand (well, a portion of).  We never saw the actual wound - and he turned down our offer to take him to the ER, but I hope he's stitched up and heavily medicated and recovering...    But I think I need to keep an eye on Peach at the wine tasting tonight.  I'd hate to send another man in for medical care...  ;)  Update: It wasn't his entire hand, just the top of his finger.  12 stitches and possible plastic surgery.  At least it's his middle finger and he's having a lot of fun waving it around...                           'This posting is a community experiment started by  urlLink Minding the Planet  to see how a meme represented by a blog posting spreads across blogspace, physical space and time. It will help to show how ideas travel across blogs in space and time and how blogs are connected. It may also help to show which blogs are most influential in the propagation of memes. The original posting for this experiment is located at: Minding the Planet; results and commentary will appear there in the future.  Please join the test by adding your blog (see instructions, below) and inviting your friends to participate — the more the better. The data from this test will be public and open; others may use it to visualize and study the connectedness of blogspace and the propagation of memes across blogs.  The GUID for this experiment is: as098398298250swg9e98929872525389t9987898tq98wteqtgaq6-2010920352598gawst (this GUID enables anyone to easily search Google for all results of this experiment). The new GUID is as098398298250swg9e.  Anyone is free to analyze the data of this experiment. Please publicize your analysis of the data, and/or any comments by adding comments onto the original post at Minding the Planet; Note: it would be interesting to see a geographic map or a temporal animation, as well as a social network map of the propagation of this meme.

This of course will make it impossible to use it in a Google search to retrieve all relevant postings spreading this meme. I wonder why the original author didn't think of a short ID to prevent this. In any case, a search query such as 'The dataset generated by this experiment could help us' will work as well.                            I've been feeling more than a little overwhelmed lately and find I am having difficulty 'catching up' and haven't felt rested since I don't know when.  And I started thinking about what I've been through lately - since July:  Had surgery and was off work 12 days (should have been more)   Introduced my mother and Joe's mom (one of my first post-op outings)   My parents divorced, my father moved out, their house went on the market (and a contract is pending)   Spent 3 days in Denver   Spent 4 days in Las Vegas   My 'better half' at work moved on to greener pastures   Good thing there's not much going on now - all I have to do is throw this couple's shower for my bro and his fiancée this weekend, go to San Francisco for a conference Sunday through Thursday, head to Chicago Friday, Cubs game Saturday, home Sunday and back to work.  Seriously, after THAT, I hope things calm down. Other than my mother buying and moving into a new house and my brother's wedding (along with all of the out of town guests and family attending the first family function post-divorce...), what  else  could happen in September?  Don't answer that.
