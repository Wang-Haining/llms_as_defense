'self, i hope this isn't a virus' because nikolle had a virus on her computer and it is f*cked!  first i called the telephone company that does our internet and i got this foreign guy who told me that there was a network outage...  liar!  i didn't do anything else because we went out to watch mean girls and go shopping.  when we returned at like 11 at night i tried calling microsoft and was on hold for like 45 min.  i hung up.  then sunday i called back and got through after 15 min.  and i must thank that man who helped me fix my computer even though it took me HOURS...  blah i don't understand how i got the virus and i just know i won't be opening up any more forwards from anyone EVER...                                    everybody in the club gettin' tipsy...    tipsy, yes...  in the club?  no.  just at home...  but it's only 553 in the afternoon!  why am i even blogging?  i'm tipsy!  i was mad really.  mad mad mad!!!  my sister and i have been trying to plan our vacation with our family and now they say my hubby cannot go on vacation.  :(  i know i should not act mad towards my husband because it's not his fault but i'm mad so i'm not talking to him.  just drinking my moscato wine...  see, i was trying to prepare myself for this napa valley wine tasting trip!  will my dad want to drive up the whole 6 hours from edwards to napa?  we'll see.  i have not told him yet.  553 and tipsy...  what a lush.  not really but maybe i'm starting to take after my friend pam.  she drinks wine all the time...  lunch, afternoon, evening.  whenever really.  see i don't have a job, unless you count substituting but i don't care for it that much...  is it fair that i'm 23 and get to stay home while most people my age bust their asses at jobs they may not even like?  i asked myself that once but then i said 'self, who cares!  you can stay home...  and so you will!'  blah blah blah your lips are moving but all i hear is blah blah blah...                                 i haven't blogged in over a week.  i would say i was on vacation but (and i think i may have said this before) since i don't really have a steady job, everyday seems like a vacation.  my parents arrived on the 12th of may for the USC graduation on the 14th.  it was the most boringest (i am aware that is not a word but i like to make up my own from time to time) graduation i had ever been to.  for such an expensive university it was really kind of tacky.  first of all there was two ceremonies the second being the college you are majoring in.  my sister majored in psychology and is part of the college with anthropology (i think) and sociology (and a few others)...  but psychology got called up last and all the other people graduating whose names had already been called just got their diplomas and walked to meet their families and friends!  i would say 90% of the people did not return to their chairs and they didn't have one of those things where everyone stands and moves their tassel to the other side...  the psychology majors really got the crappy end of the stick being called last because the names could barely be heard...  blah, anyways after the graduation and some milling around campus we headed off to goldilocks for vinegar chicharones(sp?)...  dinner was at max's of manila and i didn't see what all the hype was about their chicken.  it wasn't even that good to me.  i probably won't return there, plus i think they favor people who speak the native filipino tongue...  :/  saturday was universal studios with everyone...  all 12 of us, only 2 kids.  they enjoyed it more than disneyland.  but no one wanted to listen to me about how boring that tram ride was...  all 45 minutes of it...  karen, my sister, made a new friend whose name is captain america.  monday, me, my sister, mom and dad, and cousin ellen were off to napa valley.  it took about 6 hours to get there because we stopped to eat sandwiches for lunch off of interstate 5 near where those stinky cows are.  we checked into travis air force base lodging and got to stay in a 2 bedroom (with living room and kitchen) for $32 a night!  score!  monday was all day at napa and i've found a new appreciation for wine.  i think we visited 6 wineries.  i enjoyed the neimbaum-coppola one (thanks ziggy for the suggestion) and also thoroughly enjoyed their wines...  i didn't purchase any because the guy said it was cheaper at like albertsons and even costco.  it's the coppola diamond series...  artesa's wine didn't really appeal to me but they had stunning views.  my cousin said it looked just like when she visited italy!  lunch was at v. sattui where they have tons of meat and cheeses and fruits and wines and you can get food and wine and picnic on the grounds.    tuesday was all day in san francisco.  saw the golden gate bridge, rode a real cable car.  i think there were two highlights...  no, wait, three...  first was when we saw this homeless man.  he had put himself into a trashcan and made a sign that said 'white trash'...  funny stuff but i still didn't give him any money.  the second was the sundaes we ate at ghirdelli(sp?).  then the third was when our cousin (the adventrous traveler that she is) convinced us to take the city bus to have dinner in little italy...  never would i have taken the bus anywhere!  i loathe public transportation!  the cool thing was eating in a real italian restaurant not that fake wannabe stuff like olive garden (i still like that place.  in fact we ate there a few days after this) or the spagetti factory...    anyway it's now sunday and we've returned from dropping off my mom and dad and cousin at the airport.  how lonley and quiet my house is!  i miss my family already.  i know i've blogged a lot so...  till next time.                                 hot hot hot!  the thermometer when i got into the car said it was 108!  but then when i was driving home from the BX it dropped to 103...  it is too hot to even go outside.  i swear, i wouldn't leave the house unless i had to but i had to pick up a graduation card for the party we're going to tonight.    yesterday i had an appointment for a checkup.  the doctor said i was okay and said we were lucky because they've had fatalities with slower speeds than 40 mph...  i still can't believe that happened to us.  that was the worst thing that ever happened to me!  every night i ask myself if i thanked god for allowing me to live another day...  i never did have a nice thing to say about ford but hey their motto is built tough and now i have to believe it.  might even consider letting the hubby get a mustang somewhere down the road...  blah blah blah said he's always wanted one, it's been his dream.    anyways i should be getting ready for graduation at 430 then the party at 730...  i can't figure out what to wear so i can cover up most of my scars and bruises and crap...  adios!
