I spent most of it in my hometown, Austin, seeing everyone I have ever known in my life who still lives in Tejas. (All my exes live in Texas. Okay, not really but most of them.) Since I started writing a book on dating several weeks ago, the past is right here in my face, complete with screwed up relationships, lessons learned and not learned, and past loves galore. I am far from a dramatic chick, but have been juggling my rage and melancholy with laughter and a sense of contentment.  Prior to yesterday I was planning to move to San Francisco in September indefinitely. After being in Austin for the fourth time since I moved last July, I realized that I want to live there too. So I hatched a plan to live here in the Bay area in the summer and there in TX in the winter. Whenever that is financially feasible, which should be 2005 or 06. Exciting? Yes. Further, I have been wanting to go to India for years and the time has come. In September when my lease ends, I will become a nomad for a few months. I will be flitting around California, Utah and Texas. I plan on touring India for 4-6 weeks in October/November, coming home to Austin in November/December and moving back to SF in December/January.   Sometimes it seems so futile to make a plan such as this. Life never goes as planned. But it's a blueprint. I'm a yogi. I'm flexible.                     It's really a miracle that I ever post to this blog. Information overload really gets me when I'm online. Especially lately. I'm checking eighteen email accounts, updating websites, randomly Googling, socially networking (orkut, friendster, mixermixer, can't you all just join into one?), IM-ing with friends and occasional strangers requesting naked yoga lessons, reading the news, and on and on. I think, 'Ooh, I want to blog.' But then I get distracted by flashing lights and the sound of new mail.   At long last, here I am. Today, and of late, I am keenly aware of the need to balance work and play. Focus and relaxation. Mind spinning and mind stilling. I spend hours on end going, going, going, and if I don't meditate a while, or go for a walk or whatever, I begin to grow tired, or stressed, or caught up in the details of Tuesday, May 25, 2004, 12:34 pm. Then I look outside and see the dogs basking in the sun and remember to breathe, close up the laptop and give it a rest.  I volunteer taught yoga and meditation at Sunnyvale Middle School yesterday. Some kids were attentive, others rude or bored. After school, they erupted into yells, formed into circles of cliques and digital rings. I wonder: why do twelve year olds have cell phones? Are we breeding a new wave of stress monkeys? Mommas, don't let your babies grow up to be materialistic.                     A week ago, my grandpa went to his final PCS (permanent change of station), as he called it. He died of complications related to cancer and Parkinson's disease. It has been a whirlwind week of driving, flying, hugging, emotions, visitations, ceremonies, crying, laughing. He had been sick for quite a while and on a gradual decline for a few years. He spent the last few months at a nursing home. I saw him in January and feel very blessed to have had the chance to say goodbye then. In fact, I wanted that to be my last goodbye but I was somewhat peer-pressured into viewing the body at the funeral home. I realize that this can help the healing process for some, but I have had a lifelong fear of the dead, death, and dying and absolutely did not want to see a lifeless Grampa lying in a casket. But I came around and I guess it wasn't so bad.   There was a lengthy Catholic mass/funeral at which I spoke. I did the whole gratitude thing. (If you're Catholic, you know what I'm talking about -- 'blah blah blah... Lord, let us pray.') I felt my voice was shaking but no one else could tell. Must have been my inner fear of being struck down in the house of God for consciously opting out of Catholicism.   He was a Colonel in the Air Force and therefore had a 21-gun salute and fancy flag-folding ceremony which was pretty neat. My Uncle gave a heartfelt, funny and moving eulogy. At least a hundred people came. Brothers, cousins, nieces, old friends and war buddies.   Maybe it's all the meditation and spiritual stuff I do, but I definitely feel that I am getting over my fears of death. In this case, it is almost a relief to know that he's no longer suffering from an ailing body. After all, we are just energy (souls, if you will) encased in these bodies. Once the bodies are finished with their earthly pursuits, our energy travels to another realm. (Heaven, maybe, I hope?)                      In cruising around the Internet lately, I am reminded over and over of the vast array of information available to each of us at the click of a button. Just about anything you can dream you can find online. Tarot readings, khaki pants, diamond earrings, self-help books, better technology, more targeted marketing strategies, and yoga mats galore. It's overwhelming!  In my journeys across every yoga website ever, I encountered many great ideas, wonderful designs and helpful articles. Not the least of which was entitled  urlLink What if I have a crush on a yoga teacher?  Being a yoga teacher by trade, this topic is especially relevant. I made the 'naive choice' of becoming involved with a yoga student during my first year of teaching. I can't call it a mistake, because it was a fine relationship from which I learned more about myself. Further, to this day I maintain a solid friendship with this guy, let's call him Tim.   I would urge other yoga teachers and women of similar professions (i.e. massage therapists, acupuncturists, and so on) to STEER CLEAR of dating students or clients at all costs. Or if you do choose to date one, make a swift end to the professional relationship by referring them to another teacher or healer. I found that with Tim, once he was no longer a student, I felt a lot less immoral about our relationship.   On a related note, Tim and I still talk weekly. He lives in Austin and is dating someone new. When I first found out, back in September I was none too happy. I realized that this was irrational, of course. I live in California, he lives in Texas and is planning to move to Europe. I should be happy that he's found someone new. He told me it wasn't serious anyway. Well, yesterday he was inexplicably compelled to tell me that he is feeling more strongly about this girl. I thought I was over it, but I immediately became quieter and couldn't really think of a smooth way to change the subject. I couldn't even mask my disappointment. And then I began to deny it, especially when he called me on it. Worse yet, I felt lame or inadequate or at the very least petty for having these jealous feelings many months after we broke up, during which time I moved halfway across the country and was living the dream! The truth is, I am happy for him and I wish him the best and care about our friendship, blah, blah, blah. I guess I am still wishing there was some way we could get together again, even though there is about a 0.05% chance of that happening. Why? Most likely because I haven't found anyone else to bump him out of position. So far in California, I have had some laughably baaaad dates. Some good ones too, but fewer and further between. Do I need a boyfriend to be happy? OF course not. Instead, I'm going to try and take this opportunity to cultivate happiness for Tim and his new girlfriend and consequently continue cultivating happiness in my own life.                       confessions of a nervous hippie   In perusing the bookstore shelves lately, I've noticed a sudden spike in the new titles containing the phrase, 'Confessions of...' (a dangerous mind, a teenage drama queen, an ugly stepsister, a grieving Christian, to name the most popular).   Why the sudden need for penance? Or the forewarning: you are about to read a confession? But really, every piece of writing can be viewed as the author's 'confession,' whether she is revealing a deep, dark secret or simply telling it like it is.  I confess! I miss Austin in the spring. At the same time, I love California and it's beautiful and warm and there are nice beaches and mountains and forests. But Austin has SXSW, Eeyore's birthday party and Bob Marley fest, three events quite distinctive to the city, which I have attended for years and will no longer. SXSW is going on next week, I think. For you laymen, it's South by Southwest, a massive convening of musicians, filmmakers and interactive/high tech people upon the city to eat, drink, and rock. (See also www.sxsw.com.) On the downside, it's crowded, expensive and a bitch to park.   Eeyore's, of quite a different vibe, is a one-day tribute to Winnie the Pooh's fictitious donkey friend in Pease Park, complete with drum circles, live music, vegetarian snacks (and greasy meat too), vendors, and every hippie within a 50-mile radius of Austin. If you don't smoke pot, beware where you breathe. And, within a week of Eeyore's is Bob Marley Fest, which is clearly a reggae music festival. It's held at Auditorium Shores, a big grassy field right next to Town Lake, with a killer view of the Austin skyline.   I'm sure there are a plethora of equally great spring and summer festivals here in the Bay Area. Now to find them!                       Zen and the Art of Substitute Teaching    Did I mention that I'm a sub? Yes, since January. No, I'm not planning to get my teaching credential. I'm just a yoga teacher trying to make ends meet.   God bless these K-12 teachers. Especially the middle school variety. Those kids are nothing but obnoxious. Were we this annoying at that age?  Today is my first day administering a test as a sub. I'm in an 8th grade social studies class in Mountain View. And it's still the same old tricks. Sitting in unassigned seats. Whispering during the test.  Miss, I don't have a pencil.  But I can't complain. I'm getting paid to sit here and supervise some relatively obedient middle schoolers, blog, and otherwise fool around online.   There is definitely a zen aspect to subbing, and it certainly helps to practice deep breathing and mindful meditation on some days whilst teaching, or attempting to teach, or attempting to maintain sanity in the face of thirty unhappy freshmen. I think it's because you really have no choice but to be present. Each day is distinctive, always a new classroom, lesson, teacher's pet and class clown. If you're like me and tend to run later than earlier, it sometimes means waking up to an automated call from the sub finder at 5:30 am, going back to sleep until 7:20 and either hitting traffic or getting lost on my way to east San Jose, thereby ending up at school just as the first bell rings.   If there's a lesson plan, I'm golden. Of course, it's nice when there's a video to be watched. Although it can become a bit grating to hear the same Spanish telenovela every period for SIX periods straight. Elementary school kids are cuter, obviously, and easier to scare, but you actually have to read to them and teach them stuff. High school kids are usually independent and pretty intelligent, but a lot of the guys are super immature still. Like paper airplane immature. I try to steer clear of middle schools, perhaps just because my very first day on the job was horrific, and it was in an 8th grade science class. I sent 3 kids to the office, had to come home and immediately sleep I was so exhausted.  And now to my other blog. I'm starting one that's devoted to articles and information about...guess what...
