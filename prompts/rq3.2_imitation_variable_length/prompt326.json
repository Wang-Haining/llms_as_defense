Ok yesterday miree and i decided we wanted to have some aloutte cheese so we went to kroger! as we were walking into kroger my mom calls miree's cell phone and told her she just dropped of some aloutte and crackers at the pool! but we still wanted to get some from kroger. so we assume that it would be over with the cream cheese and grated cheese. so after we&nbsp;stoped by the free samples of cookies and got some crackers we went to the place where we thought there was cheese. well as we stand there looking at the&nbsp;cheese for&nbsp; about 5 minutes we decided it just wasnt there. so as miree is raising her hand looking around like an idiot i look for someone who works at krogers.&nbsp;I see this man stocking theshelves&nbsp;and we go over&nbsp;there.&nbsp; and miree asks where the alloutte is, the man first stands there like he is thinking then he asks if we looked in the cheese&nbsp;deli miree and i looked at each&nbsp;other&nbsp;because we didnt know&nbsp;there was a cheese deli. as we follow the guy around to the other side of the store&nbsp;we stop at like an oval stand thing that held a bunch of different cheese spreads and we just look at the one side for a while then we walk around and find our alloutte!!!! we were so excited!&nbsp;i guess you might of had to be there to understand our excitment!&nbsp;                         i'm scared! i love the untit so much i would do almost anything for it! hey i put up with a year of hell for it because Chris wouldnt let me quit, and now people use that against me. but i'm mostly scared for kayla. I dont want what happened to megan beasly to happen to her. she is my best friend and i could not stand by and let people hold meetings about her i would have to say something. I think one of the problems is that chris, col, and kayla all have the same personalities are too similiar. they all know what they want and will do anything to get it, and you cant change any one of their minds for anything! but dont get me wrong i love them all, but if you put them all in a room they would kill each other!!! I just think that kayla works hard and she might not be the easyist person to work with but neither is chris or col. Chris if you read this you know how rotc is, you hear things i just dont want people to think that kayla did something wrong by not going to SLS. Her little sister was being born for christs sake. and i heard her tell MSgt and col that she didnt want to go because sarah was being born then.  so i dont think they or anybody else should be mad at her for not going. so if later in the year something comes up with her i think that so far she has done an outstanding job and should not have to deal with little meeting that people have to talk about her i think it is wrong and i stand by every choice she has made, it may not have been the best sometimes, but this is JROTC we are here where we can afford to make mistakes, and we learn from them, so i hope that people will realize that we all make mistakes.           \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
