  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic:\n\n           8:00 a.m. Wake up. Wonder where you are.   8:01 a.m. Realize you are lying on 100 percent cotton sheets of at least a 300 count, so don't panic; you're not slumming.   8:02 a.m. Realize you are actually in your own bed for a change. Wake stranger next to you and tell them you are late for work so won't be able to cook breakfast for them. Mutter 'sorry' as you help him look for his far-flung underwear. You find out that you tore his boxers while ripping them off him last night, so you 'loan' him a pair of boxer-briefs, but not the new ones because you never intend to see him again.   8:05 a.m. Tell the stranger, whose name eludes you, 'It was fun. I'll give you a call,' as you usher him out the door, avoiding his egregious morning-breath.   8:06 a.m. Crumple and dispose of the piece of paper with his telephone number on it when you get to the kitchen.   8:07 a.m. Make a high protein breakfast while watching the Today show. Wonder if the stories you've heard about Matt Lauer are true. Decide they must be.   8:30 a.m. Italian or domestic? Decide to go with three-button Italian and the only shirt that is clean.   8:45 a.m. Climb into red Miata and try not to look too much like Barbie driving one of her accessories as you pull out of your underground parking. Revos or Armanis? Go with Revos.   9:35 a.m. Stroll into office.   9:36 a.m. Close door to office and call best friend and laugh about the guy who spent the night at your condo. Point out something annoying about best friend's boyfriend but quickly add 'It doesn't matter what everyone else thinks, just as long as you love him.'   10:15 a.m. Leave office, telling your secretary you are 'meeting with a client.' Pretend not to notice her insubordinate roll of her eyes (or the cloying 'poem' she has tacked to her cubicle wall).   10:30 a.m. Hair appointment for lowlights and cut. Purchase of Aveda anti-humectant pomade.   11:30 a.m. Run into personal trainer at gym. Pester him about getting you Human Growth Hormone. Spend 30 minutes talking to friends on your cell phone while using Hammer Strength machines, preparing a mental-matrix of which circuit parties everyone is going to and which are now passe.   12:00pm Tan. Schedule back-waxing in time for Saturday party where you know you will end up shirtless.   12:30 p.m. Pay trainer for anabolic steroids and schedule a workout. Shower, taking ten minutes to knot your tie while you check-out your best friend's boyfriend undress with the calculation of someone used to wearing a t-back and having dollars stuffed in their crotch.   1:00 p.m. Meet someone for whom you only know his waist, chest and penis size from AOL M4M chat for lunch at a hot, new restaurant. Because the maître d' recognizes you from a gay bar, you are whisked past the Christian heterosexual couples who have been waiting patiently for a table since 12:30.   2:30 p.m. 'Dessert at your place.' Find out, once again, people lie on AOL.   3:33 p.m. Assume complete control of the U.S., state, and local governments (in addition to other nations' governments); destroy all healthy Christian marriages; recruit all children grades Kindergarten through 12 into your amoral, filthy lifestyle; secure complete control of the media, starting with sitcoms; molest innocent children; give AIDS to as many people as you can; host a pornographic 'art' exhibit at your local art museum; and turn people away from Jesus, causing them to burn forever in Hell.   4:10 p.m. Time permitting, bring about the general decline of Western Civilization and look like you are having way too much fun doing it.   4:30 p.m. Take a disco-nap to prevent facial wrinkles from the stress of world conquest and being so terribly witty.   6:00 p.m. Open a fabulous new bottle of Malbec.   6:47 P.M. Bake Ketamine for weekend. Test recipe.   7:00 P.M. Go to Abercrombie & Fitch.   7:40 P.M. Stop looking at the photographic displays at Abercrombie & Fitch and actually begin shopping.   8:30 p.m. Light dinner with catty homosexual friends at a restaurant you will be 'over' by the time it gets its first review in the local paper.   10:30 p.m. Cocktails at a debauched gay bar, trying to avoid alcoholic queens who can't navigate a crowd with a lit cigarette in one hand and a Stoli in a cheap plastic cup in the other. Make audible remark about how 'trashy' people who still think smoking is acceptable are.   12:00 a.m. 'Nightcap at your place.' Find out that people lie in bars, too.

Bush as Holy Supreme Planetary Overlord                     i'm all for a multi-party system.  i don't think it's fair that only democrats and republicans have a say.  still, i hate nader for a variety of reasons.  anyway, i was looking up some other presidential candidates and i found the libertarian platform.  it's great to want the 'war on drugs' to end because it's racist and ineffective.  it's great to remind voters that the administration lied to us about the war.  it's wonderful to be pro-choice and to want to increase funding for veterans' benefits.  however, you completely lose all credibility when you list  urlLink reasons republicans should vote libertarian .  3rd parties love to talk about the two major parties going negative and how there need to be positive options.  apparently, that line of thinking doesn't apply to themselves.  the worst part is that a lot of these third party candidates are so full of themselves.  they think that they're the savior for all of the problems in this country.  it's bullshit.  instead of wrapping themselves in the flag, like republicans, they wrap themselves in a cloak of hypocrisy and self-righteousness.  no one is looking out for the weak among us because everyone is looking out for themselves.  at least some people are upfront about it.                     don't i have a job or something?  damn.  i think that ending it is a gigantic mistake.  distance amplifies everything.  i was in this mindset yesterday where i didn't want to believe anything that made him less than the biggest asshole who ever lived.  a restless night of sleep and words from up above made me reconsider.  the whole situation is complicated, and i need to just be quiet and listen to what i feel inside.  anytime i think about forgiveness, the picture flashes in my mind.  ok, who am i kidding?  i see that picture in my head all the time.  it makes me ill.  how would he have felt if it was me?  i don't want to see him in pain or even know that he  is  in pain.  i'm used to being in pain, and i can handle it.  i just don't want to see anyone else like that.  he wants a break.  i am not going to beg.  i am not pathetic.  i am, however, a complete wreck.  _______________________________________________________________________  'The weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong.'  -- Mahatma Gandhi  'You are never so strong as when you forgive.'  -- Kimberly Converse  'A woman who can't forgive should never have more than a nodding acquaintance with a man.' -- Ed Howe          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
