Well, it is. My word of the moment is: Motherfucker.  The word of the moment used in a sentance:  (as a noun) 'Put your hands up Motherfuckers!' (heard at 1tym concert) (as a verb) 'Don't try to motherfuck around with me!' (I used this today! *giggle*) (as an adjective) 'Man, don't be such a motherfucking idoit and just jump!' (Used this on too *more giggles*) Yes, children, run around and use it often, like me, and get in trouble, like me, when you use motherfucker in a sentance. It's ok, ya stupid mothafucka. So I'm actually listening to 1tym's 'Ready or Not' in English, and you thought I had a dirty mouth. Oh, and I just heard my word of the day!     'Do you wanna ride?

Jinusean, Perry)  Yeah, I like that song. And Without You, that ones good too, but I always cry when I hear it. Plus in the MV, Danny looks really hot. I'm actually trying to find a pic of him right now, BUT NO ONE HAS ONE, well, atleast no one on the soompi forums. Nevermind, found 'em.   So...I don't have a lot to say.... so I'll just let you read something....   She hated planes. Everyone knew that. But here she was, sitting next to the window, watching the clouds roll over the shaky wings of the plane. Her fear increased with every heartbeat as the wings shook in the wind that showed no mercy as the plane groaned around her. Doubt rose like the bile in her throat until it hit her heart where it stayed. ‘I shouldn’t be doing this. I shouldn’t be doing this. I really shouldn’t be doing this.’ The young girl thought as she twisted a paper napkin in her lap, her hands shaking. Her legs shook also, and suddenly her whole body had stood up to its own accord and was on its way down the small aisle of the plane to the tiny bathroom at the far end. She caught herself as she slid open the vacant bathroom, blinking for a few seconds before she remembered what she was doing as she looked around the small aircraft, wondering if anyone one had noticed that she spaced out, thinking that her brain certainty didn’t tell her body to take her to the bathroom. That’s when her nausea hit her, and she was suddenly very thankful she had spaced out. When she emptied the contents of her stomach, which wasn’t very much, she heard the stewardess knock on the door. “Miss? Miss? Are yoo alrigh’?” She could hear the woman’s accent through the door as she held her head above the toilet seat. “Uh, Yes, um, I'm alright. Just a little motion sickness.” She called out, tears running down her nose, dripping into the water.   And thats it. Hoped you liked it.  urlLink email  me if you did, b/c I waaannnnaaa know. Oh, heres a  urlLink pic  of 1tym, taken off a fan's planet site. And I was going to post one of DongBangShinKi, but can't b/c Blogger doesn't let me (don't ask me why, I just know I can't understand that stupid Hello program and don't really feel like simging up for more crap.)  But anyways, they're hot.  Specialy Jae Joong. And Choi Kang. And Micky. And Uno. And then theres Xiah, who kinda looks like a jerk to me, but a sexy one. I was really hoping that those links would work b/c I haven't a clue when it comes to html and whats that other one? I know it starts with a B or something, but this isn't even html I'm dealing with, right? Soooooooooooooooo I can't!!!!!!!!!!!!  But I'm actually really stupid about somethings on the computer but really smart about other things. And I don't feel like nameing those things so :P. Wellllll....I'm gonna go get some din-din, motherfucker (noun).  Peace out. OH!!!! B4 I go, IIII-FFFFF you know me,(as in real life *cough*joe*cough*) tell me, cuz I know that you know, so, I just want you to know that I know you know. Got It Motherfucker?
