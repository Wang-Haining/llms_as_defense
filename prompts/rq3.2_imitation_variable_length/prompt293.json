It started the night before, Shawn & I went to our friends house-Mike &amp; Jess-and drank wine/beer, talked, played with puppy's and met their nephew who is 1 month younger than Nick. Speaking of Nick, he was awesome! One of the puppy's played tug-of-war with Nick's wrist rattle! Shawn and Mike drove an old truck thru 10 acres of a sort of muddy race course! The look on Shawn's face as he raced around was priceless. We all had a blast. After that, we stopped by Mount Royal Plaza and got snacks, put Nick to bed, watched a movie while eating sugar filled sticks, wax bottle candy, oreo's, and pizza rolls!!! So long diet! Nick didn't cut me any slack during the middle of the night when he was very very fussy! The morning of my b-day, Shawn & I went to brunch at Belisio's. G'ma Lu babysat Nick and was naughty!-She gave Nick a ride on her new 4-wheeler &amp; let Boyaka like Nick's face and toes. I don't trust Boyaka at all! He is still fairly young and big. Very big! Back to Belisio's....We sat outside and there was Italian music playing, the sun was shining, there was a light breeze. The food was amazing! Tusican Belgian Waffles with blueberry's! And I had a drink...or two!...of something called a Bellini. It's champagne mixed with peach puree. Perfect day. After that we went to a chocolate factory and got 3 chunks of different types of fudge. And then home. And then back to pick up Nick. And then G'pa Daryls. And then home. And then my G&G brought my present over....background...My cousin and I would buy a snapple or two or three every day last year during school mostly for what is called, Snapple facts on the cap. Yes, we are dorks! Anyway, last weekend while at Toys-r-Us, I saw a Snapple facts game!!!! My G&amp;G Koski got me that game! Last night, Shawn and I played the game for forever! It's a lot of fun...I never knew 'astronauts become taller in space.' Now, I am back to the same old, same old. I wish the weather would cool off a bit. I am ready for fall. Only 5 more weeks left of Shawn internship! I can't wait!!! Did I ever mention, I have the best husband ever!!!                     My boy is a scucher! He can scuch his way around while doing tummy*time. He still dosen't like tummy*time, but it is helping him and he is doing much better compared to 1 month ago. We've had a busy week. Today it's raining and the candles are lit and the house has cooled off and Nick is napping! When he wakes up, we have more errands to run. Nick has done a good job sleeping the last 2 or 3 nights. He has been going to sleep at 8:30-9:00 and up at 2:30 and again around 5:30 or 6:30. After that feeding, he goes back to sleep  again  until 7:30-8:00. Last night I could not sleep, so I just watched Nick sleep. He&nbsp;is so precious! I think he is the most beautiful baby in the whole wide world!!! I love his chubby, chubby hands! Nick  loves  to stand! His face lights up and he gets this huge grin that takes up almost his entire face!~his eyes crinkle, too! I love days like today. The only thing missing to make this day perfect is Shawn. But...he'll be home in 8.5 hours!                    I just finished a book called, Sarah. It is about Sarah & Abraham.   IT WAS SO GOOD ! I am almost shaking! I love when a book can transport you to another time...to become so involved with the book and characters that their emotions become tangible. Ahhhhhh! Good Book. Today was beautiful! I set up Nick's swing outside our back door and actually got to lay out for almost an hour! Nick slept basically slept through the night!~He got up around 1 but the pacifier worked its magic and put him to sleep until 5. Then we both slept until 9!!! Lucky us. We went on a long walk today, too. He also had tummy time and only fussed for 5-10 minutes before falling asleep on his  left  side which is great. Nick turns his head to the right when he sleeps and just in general all the time...so his head is now flat...YES FLAT on the right side. All the time I can get him to be on his left side will even it all out and make his skull more round. This happens all the time to babies and it will go back to normal...I hope ;) In August, Shawn & I are going to Valleyfair for his work picnic! I am so excited. I  love  rides!!! The faster the better.  Nick and I miss Shawn a lot. He both got used to having him home. I found out yesterday (& it's been on the news too) that Shawn will be going to Iraq from May 1st until Aug 30th next year. After that, he'll be home for good!!! No more leaving!!! Thank God!!! At least next summer, I will be busy with Skills  all  summer long! But, Shawn will miss my graduation. =(           \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
