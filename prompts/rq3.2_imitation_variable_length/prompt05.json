I finally have found some time to play for the first time in 2 months. Normally taking 2 months off from golf would be bad for your golf game. But surprisingly I played very good. Golf is a game that never ceases to amaze me. If you’ve never played it before you should try taking it up sometime. It’s a game that you can play even as you get old, and you don’ t have to be good at it to have fun. But don’t expect me to play with you if you haven’t played before. I don’t have much patience with beginners.  When I got home from the golf course I turned on the TV while I cooked dinner. I normally don’t watch TV but I made an exception since I was trying to rest from playing golf. The TV show “ urlLink Everybody Loves Raymond ” was on. I’ve heard good things about it so I watched it. And it just happened to be an episode where the wife wanted Raymond to take her golfing so they can do more together. And that brings us to our topic of discussion.  I will never get married to someone that plays golf. The golf course is to be my place to go, not my wife’s. The golf course is where I will be going to get away from my wife. A place to be on my own away from her. You need times apart. Just like in relationships now, you can’t spend all your time with the same person. You’ll go crazy if you do. And it will in the long run end with a bad relationship. But like in the TV show, you’ll see that when husbands and wives get too annoyed with each other on the golf course. Golf is already a stressful enough sport. When you add the stress of a women to it then it becomes too much. It can only do harm to your relationship. Of course this is coming from me who plans on having a separate house for my wife. But that’s another story for another day.                    urlLink    Grandpa Jones&nbsp; urlLink     The other day, I had a some one say to me, 'you're a cool guy.'&nbsp; I thought about it and realized that in actually, I'm not that cool of a guy.&nbsp; I mean, 'you're a cool guy' is a great compliment, but perhaps my standards of cool are set fairly high.&nbsp; I mean it takes a special person to merit such an adjective as cool.&nbsp; I don't know about you but I don't like to just throw titles like that around loosely.&nbsp; The reason for this is simple, those who I look to for coolness, hold that title to very high standards.&nbsp; Probably the coolest cat of all is the famous Grandpa Jones.&nbsp; I mean it's hard to find anyone that's cooler than Grandpa Jones.&nbsp; He was the unnamed member of the Rat Pack, the original choice for James Bond before Connery, and had more dates than Hugh Hefner.&nbsp; Grandpa Jones is my hero.&nbsp; Of course, I am nothing like Grandpa Jones.&nbsp; I don't have his good looks, charisma or even self esteem.&nbsp; But I can dream can't I?&nbsp; So I even though I enjoy being called 'cool'. I know it takes more than just&nbsp;a title to help me reach that level of sophistication.          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
