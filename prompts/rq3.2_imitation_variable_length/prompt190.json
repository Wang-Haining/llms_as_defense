Today we have 15 days to go.  It is 15 days too many, though.  We live in a nice apartment, don't get me wrong.  But, it is not exactly in the nicest area, it is 20 minutes away from everything we do and all our friends.  This new apartment is bigger (though, still only a one bedroom), nicer, in a nicer area, has a full washer/dryer, a big bathtub!, and the list goes on.  There are so many positives to this new place, that the positives of the one we live in now are almost non-existant.    The only problem is, by moving, our rent will go up almost $200.  But, since we both have full-time jobs, that doesn't phase us anymore.  The difference between rentals in Illinois and California initially shocked me, but they don't anymore.  I most of the time forget that, in Lincoln, we paid less than half of what we're paying now for an apartment twice the size of this one.  I think I tried to forget that one so that it didn't bum me out anymore.  I have finally come to the realization that Justin and I are going to make it as adults.  We are responsible for each other, and our parents have no more obligations to be our sources of being.    Growing up is a wonderful, but hard thing to do.                 Yesterday, May 24, was my 1st wedding anniversary.  It was a very cool day, but it's sparked some interesting thoughts for me.  Q#1) Am I really old enough to be married?  A#1) Yes, I guess.  Q#2) Am I really mature enough to be married?  A#2) It depends on who you talk to.  Q#3) Do I know how to be a Godly wife?  A#3) I can only hope and pray.  And the list goes on.  Justin has assured me that most of these things are very true, and that I need not worry.  But I know I will still doubt myself from time to time.  The attribute that I want to strive the hardest for is being a Godly wife.  It means more to me than I ever thought it would, because Justin deserves the best.  He deserves to have a wife who seeks God's will, and will constantly strive to/be do anything he needs.  I want to be his confidant, I want to be his helper, I want to be his sounding board for sermons and lessons, I want to be his friend, I want to be the bride that Christ compares His church to.  Man, I definitely have a lot to live up to.    When I got home from work, Justin took me to my new favorite Japanese restaurant, Benihana.  I already had a love for Japanese food (cooked, not that raw crap), but this place just makes the food even better.  We had fun watching the chef chop things up, bang on the grill, do a little show to impress us.  I've always thought it was funny how the Japanese restaurants rely on their chefs to entertain the customers.  Anyways...it was great food, great service, and it was my anniversary!   Then he took me down to Santa Monica to walk down the Third Street Promenade, which is this really cool outdoor mall.  This place is cool, because you get to see no-name people (who are just praying that some big recording company executive will walk by and hear their self-written ballads) about every 50 feet singing and putting on their own little mini-concert to the passers-by.  You also can do any kind of shopping you want, because there are clothing stores, restaurants, an Apple store(which we unfortunately had to stop in), shoe stores, basically a mall.  Then we were going to go down to the beach, but the walkway was forever away and it was already 9:45 (we still had 30 minutes to drive home), and anyone who knows me well, knows that I'm not truly coherent past the time of 10:00pm.  So we just stood and watched the ocean from up on the pedestrian's sidewalk for a little while.  It was very romantic.    So, after this first year with my husband, I can truly say, that this has been the greatest year of my life.  I have grown, and I have been stretched beyond what I thought was possible, but it has been great!  Living with alone with a guy is hard work, especially for someone as detail-oriented, neat-freakish, and picky as I am.  I know that I shouldn't try to 'train' Justin to be the person I want, but I do hope he'll learn to pick up some of my more anal habits, so that I don't have to work as hard at home anymore.    There is one thing I know for sure...I love Justin with all my heart.  You forever have my heart, Buddy!                 I have come to the conclusion that War absolutely sucks!  I remember when we went to war originally back in March of 2003.  My friend Tim Stewart was ready to go the instant there was even a hint of war.  I wonder why that was.  Now he's been there for 3 months, and he says he is having a good time.  How can you have a good time amongst death and destruction.  It was pretty cool when he told me that he is getting to see a lot of places that are mentioned in the Bible.  If that is what he's referring to when he says he's having a good time, than I understand.  I want Tim to come home, but that won't happen for 9 more months.    Since we've been in California, Justin and I have become very close to another military man.  His story is different than Tim's, in the fact that he absolutely hates being in the military.  He doesn't hate the military, persay, but he sees it as a job and nothing else.  He got shoved into the war when he had barely turned 18.  He joined the Marine Corps at the age of 17, because his parents wanted him to clean up his act, and then he got sent to Iraq and was a part of the original destruction of that country.  We don't ask him about it, because it tears him up, but we know he had to kill lots of people.  Now that he's been home for a while, he is going to be sent back.  I don't want him to go.  He has become a good friend to Justin and I, and it just reminds me that war tears friends/families apart.    I don't really know where I'm going with this post, but I think I just wanted to get it across to everyone that I hate war!  I am not against President Bush, but I do hate the fact that we had to go to war.           \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
