Not those you see on TV and the movies, but the stars in her life, her friends. Naks! It was really nice to 'reunite' with people I hardly see and talk to. We couldn't get enough of pictures, talking, and drinking! It was definitely FUN hanging out with them and catching up on what is happening in their lives. :) Ciara was very busy entertaining guests. Compared to her party last year, she had more guests this year. There were also so much press people taking videos of all the actors that were there and interviewing people for, i guess, their wishes for Cia. All, in all, I enjoyed myself. Was just SUPER tired from work...Hay! Can't wait to see myself on TV and in the newspapers soon! Bwahahahaha!!!(NOTE: I hope Mich send the pics soon so I could post them here)    My Cuzin's Bamboo.   Mayen was there with me. Her crush, Bamboo, was suppose to perform in the party but unfortunately, he was sick. He was there for a while but sadly, Mayen was too late to see him... Sayang! If I had only known earlier he was gonna drop by, I would've told Mayen to come with me. I promised her I would ask a pic for her... i'll really try and look for one to hang in her room! Hehe!  That's it for now!!!                       After weeks of trying to do with what I had... I finally got fed up with my phone! It suddenly just turns off, rings out of the blue with no one calling (kathy witnessed this and she said my phone is possessed!), signal is low, etc etc! I then decided to just get another unit.   Sony Ericsson Z600   I had friends who have this phone (the Vargas') and when  urlLink Kat  showed me its features, I was interested in buying one. When my current phone started to make  loko , I decided to get one for myself. So yesterday, after days of convincing myself I needed a new phone, I bought one. The price was reasonable (it was sorta within my budget) and for the features, I have yet to discover. All in all, I think the phone is great. Handy and cute!    urlLink    Sony Ericsson Z600&nbsp; urlLink     Here are the features:  A long list of features are hidden behind the deceptively simple-looking Z600, including standard GSM 900/1800/1900 MHz WAN connectivity coupled with HSCSD and GPRS for data transfers. What's more, there's built-in modem functionality, an infrared port and Bluetooth, while serial and USB connections are also supported albeit there's no cable included. PIM applications such as a calendar, note book and phone book with room for approximately 500 contacts are all easily reached from the menu, which is an exact copy of that found in the much-lauded Sony Ericsson T610.   Furthermore, the Z600 offers support for concatenated SMS messages, MMS, e-mail (POP3, IMAP), WAP 2.0 and polyphonic ringtones, while other entertainment features include the Mophun gaming engine, J2ME support and an integrated digital camera with CIF (288 x 352 pixels) resolution. Although the current selection of games aren't much to write home about, the digital camera offers up quite a bit of fun despite its relatively poor resolution. To gain full advantage of the excellent main display, however, pictures taken at higher resolution than the built-in camera can offer should be retrieved.   Z600 SPECIFICATIONS   Your Z600.

We had 2 visitors from NY this week, Peter Marney and Mary Burke. While they were here, they also gave out the awards for the 2nd quarter. Luckily, I was awarded Best Performance and Attendance for the quarter! Yipee!!! Aside from the GC's I got (shopping spree at SM, hehe!) I joined the other winners at Starbuck's for a treat from Peter and Mary. :)   urlLink    Outstanding Performance Award&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Loans/PF/Munis Manila Team with Mary Burke (extreme right)&nbsp; urlLink     That's it! More pics (hopefully!) of this weekend... =)                          I've always wanted to go to a comedy-music bar. Last Wednesday was the PERFECT time to visit one...  My mom and her friends (aka my new barkada, according to Bern and  urlLink Sabs ) planned on going to Klownz, Araneta a few weeks back. I was so curious to go to one so when my mom found out, she asked me and Nic to go with her. It was the bar's 1st year anniversary and Ai Ai delas Alas (aka the Comedy Concert Queen) was gonna have a concert that night. I'm so fond of Pinoy humor and jokes, which made me MORE excited. PLUS, she had a very special guest on her concert... PIOLO!!! ;)  That night, I was with my mom and 11 of her friends!  Nagulat ako!  They were all so funny coz they actually went there to watch Piolo! Funny talaga! They looked like 'fans'!!!   During the pre-show, the hosts were calling up on stage people to sing. Ofcourse, when they asked Nicole to sing, with no hesitation, she went up on stage! Her voice was terrible but her confidence was admirable! I couldn't believe she can sing in front of a crowd (the place was packed!) knowing her voice isn't even close to being OK. Despite of her 'reciting a poem' way of singing, the hosts asked her to sing 2 songs, 'Cry' and 'Have a Little Faith in Me', both by Mandy Moore. I actually told her to quit it after her first song... but she didn't listen to me.  After all the audience singing, it was time for the main show. Ai Ai was hilarious!!! I laughed at ALL her jokes, costumes, and spiels. She really deserves to be called the Comedy Concert Queen. After a few guests, Piolo came out and EVERYONE (no exagg!) was screaming! Nakakabingi! It was funny to see all the adults with me (except my mom and Tita Claudette)  kilig  as they saw him.  To sum everything up, it was a FUN night. Although I spent the whole night with adults, seeing the 'kid' in them was funny! I hope that in the future, I can go with my friends and have as much (or even more) fun as I did that night ;)  *Pics to follow... too tamad to download and fix them*                  I spent the whole morning and the afternoon at Valle 1 at my tita and grandparents' place. First, we went to buy some fabric for our dresses for a party. I chose pink, as in the bright one, coz my tita said that it will fit my skin color (since i'm really white!). Then, we went back to my tita's house and ordered in some chinese food... yummy! Afterwhich, we headed to my grandparents' place. My lola will be back on Sunday from a vacation in the States so while she was gone, my tita decided to surprise her with a renovation of her place. I'm sure she will love it! The place looks brighter and more 'homey'. My tita's talent in home decorating is really terrific! I can't wait to see the smile on my Mama Nena's face when she enters her condo! :)  After an ocular inspection on the renovation, we stayed in my lola's room to watch some old videos. We watched some of the videos of my grandfather's birthday parties... his 75th and 80th birthday party and my grandparents' golden anniversary. I was having mixed emotions while watching the videos. I miss Papa Ciling, aka POPS.   Pops passed away last February and things have never been the same without his presence. The warmth that he exudes and the laughter that he brings is greatly missed by the whole family. It was very nice to be reminded of these while watching the videos. *sniff* It was also funny to see myself, barely a teenager, dancing and singing in the parties. Obviously, I had no qualms in performing in front of a crowd! How funny!!! :)                 Here are some of the highlights, so far, of this year...    Father's Day .   It was good timing that my brother, Drei, was here to spend it with my dad. For lunch, we were with the Penson's (my mom's side) and for dinner, it was me, drei, nic, mom, and dad in Good Earth. Good food, great company!   Hong Kong .  FUN! FUN! FUN! esp since it was just us kids. :) It was nice to be with my cousins and my sister. We all got along especially when it came to shopping! I just love bargaining (the Ilocana in me) and cheap stuff... good thing Ate Dinggay (who lives there with hubby Bryan and kids, Rafael and Miguel) was there to show us around. Expert shopper, I may add!    Solo .  Grrr!  I've been trying so hard but I still can't seem to add my picture in the profile.  I need help!!! Sabs? I know you're an expert na!    urlLink    Hong Kong Trip with my fave cousins Jill, Mayen, and Marga.
