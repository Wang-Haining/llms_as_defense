There's a movie which I don't think starred the child co-star to that 80's TV show which had Alan Thicke, Kirk Cameron, brother of Candice Cameron who was on Full House with Dave Coulier who supposedly had a song written about him by Alanis Morisette. So yeah, in this movie with the character maybe played by Kirk, he's a hockey coach of a junior hockey team and the child star wants to play even though he's hurt and the coach won't let him play if he can't hold a stick at the middle and turn his wrist all the way in each direction.  The only reason I want to know is because right now my right wrist is sore from the softball on the weekend that I can't do that. Every time I stretch Mr. pinky across to the enter key on my keyboard I die a little more.  The 'rents and fam are coming to see the house tomorrow night and have a BBQ. I guess that means I should clean 'n stuff tonight eh? Doh!   Of the Moments...

Mood:  Monday Blah's  Food:  Hungry for spaghetti                 I'm driving down Dalhousie on my way to the bonfire party when I see a 30 - 45 year old woman standing on the street corner. She's wearing a pair of jeans riding semi-low and what I thought initially to be a purple tight top. No, it's a swimsuit, and I can see the cutlines in before her hips before the V descends into the denim. And I think to myself, 'Oh damn, why would somebody want to wear...' the thought trails off as a car with a man and a woman turns in front of me past the woman.  There is another woman in the passenger seat blissfully unaware of swimsuit woman. The man, driving, practically has his tongue hanging out as he makes the turn. He (quite talented I must give him credit) manages to keep his head cranked back looking at swimsuit woman while he completes his turn, doesn't catch the eye of his passenger (presumably wife or GF) and proceeds down the opposite direction of Dalhousie from me.  'Oh. That's why. Because all men have two heads :/' Some like them young & nubile, others like old & raunchy. I prefer cute, intelligent and with a little wild side - (preferably saved for the bedroom :)                 You hear major league basketball, baseball et al players talk about  'being in the zone ' and ' finding the groove ' and such where you just feel so comfortable with what you're doing that you have no fear that what you are doing is going to go through the bucket, hit the homerun, score the touchdown, etc. In a bit of an epiphony yesterday I realized how true it is. Some of my Ultimate teammates were talking about their inability to dive for a disc, or feeling pressured to throw the disc before they need to / have a good target or don't feel like they are doing much when they defend a player.  The mentality I get on the field is that if I can touch it, I'm going to catch it. I may not knock down the disc from the thrower every time, but I'm going to do it a lot and if I can't manage that I am going to make them change the throw they want to do. Some would call if cockyness, I'd say confidence. Confidence that I know I play the game well enough that I will make things happen.  A lot of my teammates have asked how I catch so many discs and why I dive so much? One question answers the other...I can get to more discs to catch because I dive for them, without thought on the matter I get my hands / upper body in a position to catch the disc more often than another person might. When a disc is thrown ahead of me (within reason) I don't stop running or slow down, I know the disc will slow and hover and give me an opportunity to catch it.  As an offensive player you never take your eyes off the disc. As a defender, you should never take your eyes off of me ;)                  'Do you know Joe from Canada?'  'Oh sure I do, of course, he just had another baby...' Ummm NO! It doesn't quite work that way folks. So when Andrew asked me if I knew Emily who aparently talks to him about the some of the same haunches that I frequent I goffed at him.  But then I started digging around  urlLink his blog  a little and found a link to  urlLink her blog . Saw a picture, poked around a bit but still no recognition. Check the comments and I see one from a girl named Jen. Big deal right?  WRONG!   That particular Jen happens to be a new, decently good friend of mine with  urlLink her own blog . So while I may not know Emily, I have two different two-degree separational opportunities to know her. Sing with me now children:  It's a small world after all! It's a small world after all! It's a small, small world!    Of the Moments...
