One of my online hobbies (for both personal and professional use) is checking/editing/translating using online dictionaries and translation tools.  My favorite translation site is  urlLink Babel Fish . You can translate from several languages into several other languages. I tried this one with Korean first. I typed in simple phrases and the translations were almost always nearly perfect... even deleting subject pronouns as Korean speakers would... Complicated sentences are another story, however.   Now I use it for other languages, too... languages new to me like Spanish. Unfortunately, not all languages are represented. If you want to translate Serbian, you are out of luck! However, there are always ways around this. Just email me with your Serbian language needs and I will send them to Slovenian friend and translator extraordinaire (I hear she also does Croatian, Italian, German... ) or sign up for  urlLink  on-line Serbian lessons ! This one is fun as you can drag your cursor over the word and hear the meaning... or click the speech bubble to hear the phrase spoken...

Although I sometimes find it quite amusing to read editorials and news in the  urlLink China Post  or the  urlLink Taipei Times , I feel sometimes that we in Taiwan might be slightly underpriviledged in the limited quantity and quality of news we receive that is NOT related to Taiwan.  I rather miss witty editorials and news magazine articles (who can afford to buy news magazines regularly in Asia at US$10 a pop?)complete with forecasts for the future and maybe even some posed solutions.  Looking for such kind of information, I came across the  urlLink World Press Review Directory of Think-Tanks and NGOs . It has a number of sites with interesting articles on current international topics of interest. You can read about the same issues on different country's think tanks' pages and see the problem from a variety of different viewpoints.  Feeling somewhat removed from Canada these days, I will likely start with the commentary section of the  urlLink Canadian Institute of Strategic Studies .                                     What is the language of love? Some say love needs  no language... or that between two people who are meant to be together, no  language beyond the language of love is needed.&nbsp;Are we to understand  that&nbsp;this language is made up up entirely&nbsp;of glances, gestures, and  other non-verbal kinds of communication?&nbsp;It    all seems very romantic, but I wonder...       &nbsp;    Recently I attended a birthday party for a  Spanish-speaking&nbsp;student celebrating with 50 of his closest friends and his  Japanese girlfriend. She sat leaning against him for most of the early part of  the evening. She spent most on the evening just sitting, only occasionally  punctuating her silence to chat with her girlfriends in Japanese, or to look at  bf with big doe eyes and exchange a few kisses. I asked her if she was studying  Spanish or English... but she said she wasn't - only Chinese... well, this is  Taiwan after all... but neither is he studying Japanese (and she admits she  can't understand his Chinese). Seeing as there really is no common spoken  language they can share, that chemistry must be pretty strong and the language  of love speaking volumes...&nbsp; Certain he said volumes after a bottle of  champagne when he stood up and declared his love for her to the whole room.  Hmmm....      &nbsp;    How important it is to share a language with your  partner? Who should learn whose language... or should the couple both learn the  other's language... or a third/neutral language? Or&nbsp;is it different for  everyone? Are there people who really can communicate without language?        &nbsp;    I remember my first year in Korea. I guess most  people who have lived in a foreign country have had the experience of going on a  few dates with someone who doesn't share&nbsp;their language. I remember the  pleasure and pride of stringing together a sentence and having it be understood  by the other party... drawing pictures, charts and diagrams to make  communication... How flattering it feels when someone has made the effort to  learn a few words/phrases in your language.       &nbsp;    I also remember how frustrating it was not to be  able&nbsp;to&nbsp;learn fast enough... repeatedly try to explain something and  the frustrations mounting to a point where&nbsp;one just has to giggle and give  up... And the profound disappointment on having&nbsp;the achievement  of&nbsp;having sucessfully reached a certain proficiency in the target language  marred by the realization that&nbsp;not only do you have absolutely nothing in  common with your sweetheart... he stands for everything you are against! Hmmm...  ok, maybe it is not always so extreme, but for me... communication is extremely  important.&nbsp;       &nbsp;    I have more to say about this, but I will hold off  until I can update you on the saga of the above birthday boy... Perhaps I will  be able to report that she has learned fluent Spanish from  his&nbsp;friends,&nbsp;that his Japanese is coming right along, and they have  already&nbsp;started&nbsp;teaching their unborn baby Chinese, Japanese, Spanish  AND English.       &nbsp;    Well, this is too long so I will stop here, but  perhaps one day we can also share ideas on  love and language  exchanges .       &nbsp;    &nbsp;            \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
