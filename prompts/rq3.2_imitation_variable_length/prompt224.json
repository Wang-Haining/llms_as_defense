I spent most of Wednesday decoding and trying to understand what goes where. I did have a break in the afternoon to make a blueberry cheesecake (including the crust). It turned out pretty well. A little too soft, but it tastes like the real thing.  I had a college professor tell me once he knows girls from my high school are good at two things: making blueberry cheesecake and being excellent politicians' wives. So I got one down.  Anyway, I went to Greenbelt yesterday thinking it was the day of my lunch date with my college friends(it's actually today). So after cursing my ability to read properly I had an enjoyable lunch with Nina and took in a French movie as well. Might as well make the most of being in Makati. I hardly ever go there because I it makes me sad that I can't afford anything. Also, I never fail to get lost in Glorietta.   To be honest, I like hanging out in Cubao. I found 'The Portable Beat Reader' there in Booksale for only Php110. It was a good day.                      I came across this site called  urlLink Paradise Engineering  while trying to find the lyrics for 'Common People'. It's a site that promotes future paradise, hedonism, and drug use (because as we all know it's impossible to be truly happy without some chemical assistance). All that and it hosts mp3s to some songs by REM (It's the End of the World as We Know It and Nightswimming), The Monkees (The Last Train to Clarksville), and They Might Be Giants (Birdhouse in Your Soul), to name a few.   Here's a little quote from their intro page:  The Hedonistic Imperative predicts we are poised to explore a spectrum of outrageously beautiful states of consciousness. Potentially, states of consciousness far more sublime than today's fleeting 'peak experiences' can become part of the texture of everyday life. The advent of utopian biotechnology permits our genetically enriched descendants to be animated by gradients of immense well-being - in contrast to our animalistic mix of pleasure and pain. In the new reproductive era of 'designer babies', gradients of innate bliss can form the bedrock of invincible mental health.  Okay...  I've been reading some Isaac Asimov lately and this is the kind of thing he writes about in his novels about the future. He doesn't mention any 'spectrum of outrageously beautiful states of consciousness' but apparently there's some kinky robot sex in our future.   If you don't want to search through pages and pages of new age quotes and pretty pictures of beach scenes and horses in the mist,  urlLink here's  the page of the mp3s.          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
