Not that exciting, but at least it's not about anisia (for those of you out there who are tired of me talking about my feelings for her) [ugh] Well Church was fun tonight. We went to the bowling alley and bowled. It was kool. The first game we played I didn't get one single strike or spare until the 10th frame when I got three strikes in a row and it was then that my nickname became Vin Deisil because on the score board it had a triple x. 'XXX' nice. Oh but before all that (like before church) Anisia called and that was a pleasant surprise. So we talked for a while and I got to hear what Maggie's voice sounds like and I have to say...from her voice she sounds like she's hott. lol. Any way then I went bak to taking my nap and then got online for a while and talked to who else but Anisia and Maggie. I told anisia a little bit more about how I feel but I always feel like if i told her how I truely feel it would make things akward between us and that she wouldn't understand. Idk, but we're going to talk about things when she gets back, hopefully not immediately though cause I think we should see how things are working out as friends still.  Love you all Bye      I had a really big post that I was typing up last night, but it got erased. Stupid computer. Oh well it wasn't really important and only about two people (maybe just eva) read this thing anyway.  I think I should discuss the title of my blog.  'Who do you think I am................ 'cause I'm not'  What this means is that a lot of people think they know me, but in all reality... Nobody has hung out with me or talked to me enough to know the real me. I don't even express my true self on this thing. So for all of you out there who think you have me all figured out you're wrong and I'm almost certain of this. I know of only two people who know the real me or at least understand the real me.  Bottom Line= I'm not as sweet and inocent of a guy as you all may think. Sure I'm a romantic, but there is an evil side to me too and lately I feel like it's trying to come out. I hate when people swear and I just hate the thought of swearing, but this is a special occasion.

James Bond was the first real 'pimp'. I mean he could have any girl he wanted and as many as he wanted. Personally not my idol, I believe there should only be one other at a time, not multiple partners at once. Maybe for some that's acceptable. Okay enough of me trying to understand up to date things like pimps. So, How is everyone doing out there? Good? Good, that's good to hear. Today I doubled up on my runs, and at conditioning it was Bo, Alex, Skuyler and I. We dropped skuyler after 6 minutes and then with like 1/2-3/4 of a mile left I started pulling away from Bo and Alex. It was kool, but then I decided I should slow down cause it was supposed to be an easy run. Well enough of that boring run stuff, now onto... actually onto nothing cause I have to go do my dishes. Talk to you all soon (i hope)  Love you all  bye  'Just thinking of you makes my life even better,  and just knowing you care makes me feel whole.  You'll always be my friend and forever the one  I love.' urlLink    \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
