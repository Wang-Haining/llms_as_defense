Not the bullpen, which had an off night and tried to give the game away, but the boys came back in true Yankee style. Never give up. Never quit.  Sheffield is the MVP of the league. Who can dispute that? Sure is good to see A-Rod back, too. This team is so exciting. You never know what will happen. You can't stop watching before the last out. Give them one more out and you could pay for it. Matsui is still coming through in the clutch. I love it best when they beat someones closer. Very satisfying!  I think the only worrisome area is that the bullpen looks a little tired at this point. The dog days of August are here and fatigue sets in. But come September and October, they will be pumped. Hopefully the rest will come for them in late September.  I love this quote:'I just [stunk] today,' Quantrill said. 'I didn't get my job done, and that's the only reason the game was in jeopardy.' (See the  urlLink Yankee  website) You just have to appreciate that kind of honest assessment.   For the dog days, I've broken out The Secret Weapon. My lucky Yankee shirt that I used to wear every Friday, without fail, during the 1998 & 1999 seasons. It's not quite dark blue anymore. It keeps needing repair around the NY emblem and shoulder emblem, but it never fails the Yanks, so I'll nurse it through the remainder of the season. I know for sure that stuff like my lucky shirt will help the team (don't we all know lucky charms work?), so I'll be pitching in a little extra from now on.                        Does anyone actually like the way the modern media operates? For instance, here in Baltimore there is one of the greatest swimmers ever, quite possibly the best ever named Michael Phelps. I hope he wins all 8 gold medals at the Olympics and sets a few new records to boot. (Breaking his own records in the process.) But all the hype is driving me nuts! Constantly in the news, every medium, are stories about his past, present &amp; hopeful future. His endorsement deals, his coaches, his routines, his training schedule and methods, interviews with kids at swim meets, his underwear size and brand. (Just kidding. That may come soon, though.) Now his family is in the spotlight. Actually, this is one of the better stories inside the whole hype thing, but it's just too much! Give the guy a break! He's training for the Olympics. How can he be focused on winning if there is some goober in his face asking stupid things like, 'What about Ian Thorpe?' What's he supposed to say? 'Gee, I hope he doesn't beat me?'  This is just one example. I think our media types go way too far invading people's personal space. I think the American Hype Machine puts too much pressure on individuals and sometimes helps them fail. I hope Michael is immune to the added pressure. At this rate, by the time he gets to Athens, he will be expected to win every race or some will consider it all a failure. No one can win 10 medals in 8 races, but after all the hullaballooo, isn't that what we all expect?                      So Jeff Brantley keeps saying during his Yankee telecasts that he doesn't believe in curses, but he believes in the Yankee ghosts at the stadium. His stories of being on the field in the late innings and knowing that the game was won only to have the Yankees pull out another victory are always entertaining. Last night he got to experience it again while in the booth. Sheffield saves our butts in the 9th and ARod seals it up in the 11th. The whole game was well played. One of those that you just can't walk away from. Almost felt like October. Maybe it was a preview?  And what is up with the A's and their pitching development? Where do they keep finding their prospects? If Harden is their 4th starter and he's a rookie, look out. Soon they may be the team to watch out for. (For second best, of course.)  One more thing, Olerud is very welcome in New York. I've always been a fan of his and I'm glad he's not an enemy anymore. His debut was typical John Olerud, great defense and hitting. Good to have you aboard, John.                      Well, the Yanks pitching wasn't quite up to it last night, eh? At least Jorge and Shef are continuing their great play. Kudos to Mulder, though. He's no fluke. When the boys get a lead on a pitcher like Mulder, you would hope they could pull it out. Oh well, there's always tonight...  And what's up with this John Kerry guy? I loosely follow politics around election time, just to make a somewhat educated decision when voting. But this year it's been quite interesting. Kerry says (on record) that he has a secret plan for Iraq, but he has to be elected before he can let anybody know what it is. I guess this is a good reason to vote for him? You know, the old 'I just gotta see what his secret plan is so I'll vote for him' deal.  Kerry also said (on record) that he will personally visit ALL the Muslim states and will convince them that we are the good guys, not the enemy. This is a miracle that no one in history has been able to accomplish yet. More power to him if he can. Question, why does he have to be President to pull that one off? Can't elected officials travel over there on State business, especially if they know how to save the world? I'm starting to wonder just what planet Kerry is from. I've heard of election year promises that may or may not be fulfillable, but geez! Will anyone with a brain actually buy into this one?                        Well, yesterday wasn't the day. The Yankees didn't get the sweep we were hoping for, thanks in part to 2 errors. (Note: Lofton in right field?) Loaiza still isn't solid. Looks like the bullpen/long relief is in his future? Could be if Lieber continues his streak. No complaints, though. If we continue to win 3 out of 4, this will be a pretty good year. Look out tonight. Kevin Brown is pitching in Texas. Should be a good one.   How about Texas. The Orioles whipped them pretty bad. Their weakness (pitching) sure has been showing up lately. Not to mention the change in the Orioles since Ray Miller was brought back. If the O's keep rolling like this, hello wildcard. I hope so. I'd love to have the Yankees play them in the postseason. I'm no O's fan, to be sure. But there are some guys on their team I like. (Roberts, Lopez, Palmeiro, Surhoff.) Besides, I work within sight of Camden Yards. The Yankees knocking Baltimore out of postseason would give me serious bragging rights. That would be fun.    One more thought. For the future, watch for Tampa Bay. They are young and good and will only get better. Lou will make sure of that.                      OK, so I call my dealership where I bought my Olds to find out if my heater/air conditioner fan is covered by my so called 'bumper to bumper warranty'. When I bought this car, the special deal was that a 5 year/60,000 mile warranty came with it. It was some promotional thing Oldsmobile was doing for one month back in 2001. Sounded good to me at the time. But of course, the fan isn't covered. In actuality, almost nothing is covered. I've had the car in several times for service and nothing has ever been covered. (And this car has needed some service, believe me!) The only thing this warranty has ever been good for is a $4.00 flasher for the turn signals that went bad. I guess I was suckered by the sales pitch. I should have known that any car made in the US won't have great backing. They are just too expensive to produce. (Unions are the big cause, but that's a rant for another day.)  My second car is an import. German. The warrenty   is   'bumper to bumper'. I've had 2 and both have been so well serviced, it almost doesn't seem real. The first one had a volume button on the steering wheel that became slightly discolored, so they replaced it. Once, the brake light on the dash came on and when the service guys checked it out, they said the brakes were below their standards, so they replaced them. Brake pads, rotors and sensors. No charge. The car had 42,000 miles on it and they replaced all that, no charge.  We, the USA, are supposedly the producer of some of the finest goods in the world. If that is so, why can't our manufacturers first - build reliable products and second - back them up with decent service? It kinda sucks to think that I probably won't be buying any more new American built cars again. I've been a GM driver for a long time. But what's the point of putting my faith in something that even the builder doesn't have enough faith in to want to back it up? No thanks.                        I bet this has happened to everyone. You're cruising along in the morning, half asleep, doing your customary cruising speed when you run into a large grouping of vehicles going slower than you want to. Thoughts come rushing through your mind like, What the..?.., Get out of my way! Finally you're able see around the vehicles ahead. A police officer is cruising along at the posted speed. Your frustration boils over! How dare he get in your way! How dare he drive the speed limit and back up traffic like this! Geez, I might be late!    This is the way this morning started for me. As I had the extra time, I began to think about how the 'good' start to the day is heavily predicated on being able to break the law and get away with it consistently. For most of us, our timed schedule in the morning relies on getting away with speeding. We don't alter our schedule to allow for driving the posted speed. That would mean getting up earlier, being more motivated earlier, being concerned about the cost of a speeding ticket.  I guess this extra time to think and ponder possible consequences could make us better citizens? Maybe I should be grateful to the police?
