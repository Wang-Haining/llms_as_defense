Kumar and I went to a couple of place on Monday to scout for possible locations for the tuition centre.   We first went to siglap centre. The place had a good location but the sizes of the units there were not optimal. Besides, the units were mostly taken.   Then we went to roxy square 2. The place was nice but there were no apparent vacant units that was well suited for our purposes, in terms of size.  Finally, we went to katong mall. The place was the best. There were numerous vacant units that were suited for our purposes. So, it is most certain that the tuition centre will be located in that shopping mall. The rent there was also reasonable.  The only problem is that the mall is not very near to a bus stop. It is quite a distance to walk to the nearest bus stop.  We also decided to commence operation in the last quarter of the year as the student take up rate would be most optimal during the holidays and early part of the following year.                     Well kings has gone and gotten himself a girlfriend. Well smack me silly and turn me inside out. Wouldn't have thought that would happen anytime soon. Goes to show how life can sometimes blindside you when you least expect it.  So there it is. My kemosabe in bachelorhood arms has deserted me. Can't say I blame him though. Except the reason for him to get together with this girl are rather suspect. I'll never be sure whether he got together with her just to prove to himself that he could get a girlfriend or that he is really sincerely into this girl. Only way to find out is to just ask him directly but that would just make our friendship take a weird turn. Oh well.   Don't know how long he'll be with her. Seems to me that this girl is the controlling type. Scolded him for playing pool with me the other weekend. Maybe it's because they're in the 'honeymoon' period of their relationship and she doesn't foeel secure enough with him to let him out of her sight (claws).   Or maybe I'm just over analysing things. Nah.   Bleah.                     So another month has gone by. And of course, seeing as how my life is pretty much stagnant, nothing much happened. Well, except for the stuff I'm gonna talk about now.  I finally completed the beta version of the tradenet website. Of course, this was after much dragging of both feet (well, waddaya expect?). Kept adding and improving it. Probably gonna register a domain and get the site up and running by the middle of january 04. The delay being attributed to a lack of funds, and a means of which to transfer it to the web hosting company. My partner is gonna get his credit card in january, so that's when we're gonna set up the site.  And how could I forget the other main thing that happened. I flunked accounting. Oh my god. I flunked. I guess I could see it coming, from the moment I got out of the exam hall after the paper, I pretty much knew. I just flunked with 47 outta 100. I dunno. Is it worse flunking knowing that you are so close to passing or worse is you flunked badly? I'm guessing the former. Well, just cos it's borderline, I put in an appeal to the course coordinator. Not hoping for much but at least there is hope.  On the borght side, I did get distinctions for law and economics. I suppose that if you like a course, youre more motivated to do well in it. But then , you'd like a course if you find it easy to understand. Hmm, a catch 22 situation.  Well, Gonna get the appeal result this week. Crossing my fingers there. Other than those things of note, nothing much has happened. Guess that's it for now. Till next time.                     Damn. Time sure flies. Checked my schedule and had the biggest shock. I have an accouting test next tuesday! I guess it kinda crept up on me. Augh! Guess it's time to have a crack at the books. Only consolation's that it's an MCQ test and not a written one.  Darn it. I promised myself at the beginning of the semester that I would get my act together. Well, it's not too late. Only a third of the semester has passed so I'm not too far behind in my reading and stuff. So what now? I'll write up that study schedule I guess. Yeah just as soon as I fininsh that movie... Bad haz Bad, Bad haz.  That richard dude is sure long winded. Once you get him going he keeps on going (like that energizer buny eh). Guess that's what ocs does to you. But then again, not all the ppl who went to ocs are that long winded. I  guess it's just him then. Thank god that's about his only, how shall I put it....glitch? Yeah That's sound about right. So I guess he's ok in my books.  Oh and that accounting lecturer should get a personality. I mean she must rank as one of the not so captivating teachers I;ve had in a long time. And that's putting it kindly.  The marketing project's getting along better now. We're actually getting the research materials. Though I'm finding it a bit tough to find 3G subscription info from european telcos. Richard had it ez with only japan's telcos to do reseach on, which is practically only NTT DoCoMo.  Ok, Enuff ranting for one nite.                     Well, i was just in one of my rhetoric moods just now. I was thinking of how sad it was that good friends can grow apart as you grow up.  You gain new perspectives as you grow and those might now be the same as your friends. Like you're in different realities. Sometimes you grow apart because of differeing views and sometimes it's because of circumstances. Some of which are not under your control but most of which that are.  Things like gaining a new idealogical beliefs, new social groups or just something as simple as getting a new job. Any of which can cause you to not make contact as often as you would like. I used to believe that it was their fault for not keeping in touch. But then i realized that I was as much at fault as anyone else in my life.  People walk in and walk out of your life. You can try to keep them from walking out but ultimately, it's their choice. Guess that's why you have to choose your friends carefully. But then again, if you are too guarded in your choices, you might be artificially restricting yourself. Ah the choices we all make.  I've had many good people in my life. It's sad to reminisce on the good times past as you know the chances of regaining those timeas are slim to none. So there's no use dwelling on them. But you don't want to discount their value in helping to shape you into the person that you are today. And yet, you don't want to let them hold you back from become the person that you're going to be tomorrow. Sigh.  This doesn't happen much when you're a teenager but it starts when you reach adulthood. You wish to be as carefree as you were then. Letting your parents worry for you. Reality was just for other people. You lived in a cocoon, in your own world.  Ah the good old days.                     Well, in the last seventy two hours, I've had 14 hours of sleep. Had 4 last night and 2 the night before. Why, might you ask have I had so little sleep? I've been tossing and turning in bed trying to get to sleep till the wee hours of the morn. Just can't seem to get to sleep. Lots of thoughts were coming into and out of my mind.  The economics lecturer was pretty fast yesterday (no suprise there). For a few minutes there, I sat in the lecture theatre feeling as if someone had put a pillow over my head, trying to stifle me, but only in the intellectual sense. But thankfully I snapped out of it early enough to grasp the bulk that the lecturer was teaching.  Note: Never have only two hours of sleep before another econs lecture again. In fact, it's best to go over the lecture notes beforehand, preferably twice. It'll make everything go smoother during the lecture.  Oh and I think I got the real iq, which is 128. Nothing spectacular but at least it's in the 97th percentile. Pretty darned decent. In the gifted but not quite genius range. But lest I pat myself on the back, I should stop to remember that even the most intelligent person in the world would be useless to himself and the world if he procrastinates too god damned much.  Well, in hindsight, I would have prefered to have not learnt about iq tests. Personnally, I think they're much more trouble than they're worth. That's the last I'll write on  that  particular subject.  Well, what else have happened the past few day? Spent the better part of the day at school doing the marketing project (situational analysis & SWOT). Gonna go to school tomorrow to type it all out with the rest as we only wrote out a rough copy of it today.  Well, that's about it. *YAWN*. I guess it's about time to catch some quality shut eye time.                      Kumar has invited me to join his new venture, a tuition centre for primary school kids. I agreed. I find new ventures exciting. At this point in my life (at the beginning), I find that service based ventures pose very little risks.  And in addition, K seems to have a good working knowledge of the industry, as a result of his numerous years as a tuition teacher himself. This would definitely be an advantage as I have virtually no first hand knowledge of it personally.  Setting up a tuition centre would only need a minimal startup cost of about 4-8k. Therefore, the risk exposure, in financial terms, is minimal. I have only a few assets (hey, I'm a poor student), so there is little that I will loose if the venture is not successful.  Add to that, the team K has put in place for this venture, I feel confident that this venture will, at the very least, break even.  The situation we find ourselves in is that we need to find a location that is large enough and is within our targeted rental range. Once we do that, we would then be able to address other issues like furnishings, licenses and renovation items.  Wish us luck.  P.S. I will also be starting a blog on my journey into the exciting yet somewhat intimidating world of business. Look out for the announcement soon. Now, less talk and more action!!                     I just read this  urlLink article , specifically the section referring to the remarks made by  urlLink Bill Cosby . In it he talks about the culture of victimism in America.  This got me to think about the culture of victimism in the civilised world as we know it today. I get tired when I hear people blaming everything but themselves for their less than desired life situations. Or saying that it's meant to be.  In my humble opinion, unless you are mentally incapacitated, you and only yourself, are responsible for the life that you lead. There is no two ways about it.  What is the point of blaming everything for your troubles? Why not get off your @ss and do something about it? I'd like to think that I am doing so through actively taking actions that has a specific life goal in mind.   You can't go anywhere if you don't have anywhere that you want to go to. So I suppose the keys is that you should decide upon a goal that you want to strive towards. But it's not just goal setting that's important. It must be with a sense of discipline that you work to wards your goal with.  Though that by no means guarantees success, success cannot be achieved otherwise.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
