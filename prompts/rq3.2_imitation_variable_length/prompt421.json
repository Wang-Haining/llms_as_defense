  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic:\n\n       Everyone has a vision of what his life should be. It never works out. What you got to do is focus on one thing and make that one thing your life. Make no excuses. Rip yourself apart every single fucking day trying to get it right. Do that and at least you'll be able to look at yourself in the mirror as a man. Maybe I won't win any contests, but I know there's honor in the struggle. When it comes to the struggle, you can't take any prisoners. You got to fight harder than that guy on the other side of the line. You got to train like you got a gun to your head.  Nothing in life worth having comes easy. When the bombs fly and the roof falls down around you, all you can do is hope that your foundation is strong enough to withstand the pressure. All you can pray for is that all your hard work will pay off. That you weren't lazy and didn't overlook something that might have helped you prepare for the battle. All things in life have a purpose and a reason for happening. User every second, every fiber in your body, every last breath to make things happen. Everyone fears death. But I say this: Live proud and fight as hard as you can. If you do, you'll live beyond your time on this earth.             woke up way too early today... feeling the burning sensation allover my body.. musting be the stacking of TRIBEX &amp; NITRIX at work again...   was too busy, too tired to blog the past week, everyday at work sucks, project after project i finished, project after project come again.. blew my top twice in office this week, they took me for granted, thinking i'm a too nice guy and they could bully me? BIG MISTAKE!
