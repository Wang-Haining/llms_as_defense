He had an interesting description of his view of atheisim, in that he didn't beleve in a heaven or a hell.  He thought more so that they were metaphor for how one lived thier life.  He said that in his case he didn't feel the need the fear of hell to compel him to live a good life.  Interesting...  I would say that I identify with this point of view more than any form of religious doctrine/dogma, and the inevitable zealotry that arises from it.  The realization of being completly responsible for your life, actions and consequences, without the ability to pawn off the responsibility and consequences or mistakes or decisions on some divine law or interpertation of it,  is core to Mr. Regans point of view.  But, it still leaves one open to the incorporation of a spiritual element of guidance or companionship in what ever from it may take.  I often times see religous instutions by direct intent or accidental consequence, empowering individuals to give up the joy, and responsibility, of total control over their life, decisions, circumstances, and consequences.  In essence, exchanging ones earthly freedoms for eternal salvation.   Aww... look at me trying to be all philosophical  :-)                     It's a wierd point of view for me to try to wrap my head around, that people out there don't believe in a 'Universal Truth' if you will.  I've spent a huge amount of in the past couple of years, reading and comparing notes, and accounts of the role of spirituality in the lives of 'The Greats', the people who were considered by history to be enlightened in some area.  As I move through this process, and analyze it from a myriad of different viewpoints, and sources, I begin to see patterns, and fundamental beliefs that begin to emerge.  These things emerge regardless of religious doctrine/dogma, social orientation, sexual orientation, and even period culture.  They just seem to be the things that are 'true' regardless.    I have gradually seen my attention shift from discovery, to implementation over the past few months.  How does this all apply to me, now, in my culture, in my social setting, etc.  How do the actions that I take in response to what I believe to be true look?  I don't know, but that's where I'm at right now, is trying to make sense of that.    I refuse to believe that who I am and what I believe in is dictated by the culture around me, and the circumstances I find myself in, and it seems odd to me that anyone would feel comfortable giving up power of their life to something as fickle as the group of people, and the society they find themselves a part of.  To recognize that society is constantly trying to influence you one way or another, and by default is not a revealer or spreader of truth, and in the same breath profess that society, culture, and circumstances are the things that make you who you are.  That just seems  crazy to me.    This all might not make much sense out of context but it stems from conversations i've had over the past several months about whether or not there is a common spiritual link in humanity, a core universal truth or belief structure that trancends time, and culture, and influences humanity.  Or is what I think and believe just a product of the times I live in, end of story.    Yeah, Yeah, I know, it's all really abstract, and sort of wishy washy.  Maybe It'll get boiled down to something concrete one day.  Maybe not.   Later,  Mule                      Man... I can't even begin to say how great i have it.  The older i get and the more I get to talk with the folks about what they did and how the did it raising me.... I'm truly Blessed.  I know that probably lot's of people feel this way but i've got the best parents there is to offer!  I have no idea where i'd be with out em.   I just got done with an evening at Bacchaus with Tim, Jim and friends, and what an evening.  It doesn't get much better than that!  Anyway.  I'm heading to the beach this weekend for a little bit of rest and focus.  I'm looking forward to the escape!   I won't be posting 4 a bit but i'm coming straight back from the trip and heading straight to the racetrack, to help alan with his pit duties.  I haven't seen that HO for like 4 months, so it will be good to catch up with him and the rest of the crew.  I remember the first trip i ever took to Sears Point with him.   Man what a time.  There are few people you meet in life that you are just friends with and will always be friends with.  Ploon, Geo, The Rear Admiral, Matty Z and the whole crew....I can't wait to see those ho's on sunday.  So until then  Sleep well to all!!          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
