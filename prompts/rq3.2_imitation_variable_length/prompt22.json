We have them on Saturdays for the most part. I love to run, but meets are just terrible sometimes. too many hills, and then there are people that are like 'Push it!!' and obviously you can't push it more becasue you are about to die and your legs feel like jello. Sometimes I feel like asking these people if they'd feel running this course. Mostly my sister who says that running 3.1 miles as fast as you can on a hilling and evil course is no excuse to be grouchy to her. It was like 50 degrees, and there were huge and evil hills. I would like to see her run that the whole time and PR (By the way, PR is Personal Record). She could, but it was so cold in Athens today...I didn't even want to run. So, the whole thing went more or less like this. A freezing warm-up, and a freezing run. It was terrible. And it was RAINING! Ick, it was gross. I PRed though. Which was a happy day. Everyone did awesome, and i was very happy with our JV team. Because....we got 3rd overall!! Out of 20 teams, which is like, moundo happiness.   YAY!! I'm meeting Tyler on Monday. Yay for me!   Oh, who's Tyler?   Tyler is my 17-year-old date to homecoming. He goes to Grayson. Which is pimpin' because, that means he doesn't go to Shiloh. So, McGeehin is picking me and him up, and....we're going to do something...ah well. That's the end of this blog. I'm so sleepy...time to sleep.  -Steph         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
