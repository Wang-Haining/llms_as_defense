On Sunday June 18, the U.K.'s Catholic Herald reported that the Holy See is about to 'relax the rules' on the Tridentine Mass because bishops have not been 'generous' in allowing its use.  According to the report by Freddy Gray, 'Cardinal Castrillon Hoyos. prefect of the Congregation for Clergy, told The Latin Mass, America's leading traditionalist magazine, that the Vatican was preparing to issue a 'juridical guarantee' in favor of the Tridentine rite, which was the Church's official rite from the 16th century until 1962.

'Rome is signaling that it is prepared to use the transcendent nature of the traditional Mass as a standard to rein in the abuse in the new rite,' he said.
