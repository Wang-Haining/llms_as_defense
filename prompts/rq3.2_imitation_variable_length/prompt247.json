Having met Howard Devoto in 1977 as he was departing the Buzzcocks, McGeoch became a founding member of Magazine and many memorable riffs are featured on their first three albums Real Life, Secondhand Daylight and The Correct Use of Soap. By 1980 he was moonlighting with Visage and Siouxsie and the Banshees and went on to largely affect three of the latter's most lauded albums, Kaleidoscope, Juju and Kiss In The Dream House. In late 1982 McGeoch suffered a breakdown and was subsequently hospitalized and replaced in the Banshees by The Cure's Robert Smith. In the mid-80s he formed The Armoury Show with ex-members of The Skids, appeared on two solo debuts (Peter Murphy's Should The World Fail To Fall Apart and Matthew Sweet's Inside) and, finally, joined Public Image Limited. He became their longest serving member barring John Lydon and helped to re-invent Pil into a 'rock' band with Happy?, 9 and That What Is Not. By 1993 Pil dissipated and McGeoch returned to England from Los Angeles where he continued making music in various low key or unfinished projects. In 1995 he became a qualified nurse but chose not to follow the profession and lately had been writing music for television. John McGeoch is survived by partner Sophie and daughter Emily.'                  urlLink Censor Scooby Doo?    'The Bush administration has decided that people with bad hearing have bad judgment, too, and need special guidance from the federal government. So the U.S. Department of Education is declaring about 200 television programs inappropriate for closed-captioning and denying federal grant requests to make them accessible to the hearing-impaired.  'The department made its decisions based on the recommendations of a five-member panel. Who the five members are, only the government seems to know, and it isn't saying. But the shows they censored suggest a perspective that is Talibanesque.  'The government is refusing to caption Bewitched and I Dream of Jeannie, apparently fearing that the deaf would fall prey to witchcraft if they viewed the classic sitcoms.  'Your government also believes that Law & Order is too intense for the hard-of-hearing. So is Power Rangers. You can rest easy knowing that your federal tax dollars aren't being spent to promote Sanford and Son, Judge Wapner's Animal Court and The Loretta Young Show within the deaf community. Kids with hearing problems can forget about watching Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, classic cartoons or Nickelodeon features. Even Roy Rogers and Robin Hood are out.  'Sports programming took a heavy hit, too. The government has decided that people with hearing problems don't need to watch NASCAR, Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association, the National Football League or Professional Golf Association tournaments.'                 Spam in the place where you live...now face west.   urlLink Pair Nailed In AOL Spam Scheme   'An AOL software engineer was arrested today for stealing the company's entire subscriber list--totaling 92 million screen names--and selling it to a 21-year-old Las Vegas spammer. According to the below federal criminal complaint, Jason Smathers, 24, last year illegally accessed the highly confidential AOL list by using another employee's identification codes. Smathers, who worked in AOL's Dulles, Virginia office, then allegedly sold the list to Sean Dunaway, who used the AOL database to promote his own online gambling business and who also sold the list for $52,000 to fellow spammers, one of whom used the names 'for purposes of marketing herbal penile enlargement pills,' according to the complaint. AOL's subscriber base is about 30 million individual customers, who account for 92 million different screen names. Prosecutors also contend that Smathers subsequently sold Hathaway an updated AOL customer list--this one with approximately 18 million names--for $100,000. Both men have been charged with conspiracy, which carries a maximum prison sentence of five years. The Secret Service probe was aided by a spammer who purchased the two lists from Dunaway and is now seeking 'leniency concerning his/her participation' in the AOL conspiracy, notes the complaint.'                  urlLink The Smoking Gun   'FEBRUARY 2--A California judge today unsealed documents related to the search last year of Michael Jackson's Neverland ranch, providing the first glimpse--though heavily edited--of what investigators carted away from the singer's estate. The documents include redacted inventories of items seized from Jackson's home and two other properties raided November 18. According to the below Neverland inventory, Santa Barbara Sheriff's deputies removed computers, legal documents, magazines, and a Canon digital camera found in Jackson's master bathroom. The court records, released by Superior Court Judge Rodney Melville, show that the material was taken from the 'main house' on the sprawling Los Olivos estate. Agents searched Jackson's master bedroom, where they took a 'note' found in a nightstand, and had to have a locksmith open the locked master bath (keys to the bathroom were apparently found later in a safe). The search warrant documents also include lists of items seized from the Beverly Hills office of Bradley Miller, a private investigator working for Jackson, and the L.A. home of Hamid Moslehi, a videographer who has worked for the so-called King of Pop. Melville, however, has refused to release the affidavit filed in support of the searches, a document that would provide a details of the prosecution's case against Jackson as well as the account provided to investigators by the teenage boy who has accused Jackson of molestation.

That's because the Tiffany Network actually opted for a prominent photo of Tonight Show host Jay Leno--instead of Dave--in its online promotion of Sunday night's People's Choice Awards. It wasn't until Letterman himself started ragging on CBS during the taping of last night's program that the image of his NBC rival was hastily deleted and replaced by a shot of the Late Show boss. Network brass apparently were so embarrassed by the gaffe that CBS president Leslie Moonves called Letterman during the Monday taping to apologize and say, apparently facetiously, that the employee responsible for posting Leno's photo on cbs.com had been fired. Below you'll find the before and after images from the network's web site, captured by TSG before the Leno art was deleted. While both Letterman and Leno were nominated in the favorite talk show host category, the People's Choice nod went to Oprah Winfrey.

However, I do have to admit that I am glad that I don't have cable....because I know that I'm dumb enough to fall for a show like this. Hell, I can't stop watching 'The Apprentice.'

'Did you know that there are practicing vampires in the United States? Or that the Wiccan religion is sometimes called 'witchcraft'? And why, exactly, do nudists like being naked?  'SCI FI invites you to experience life around the edges, in the colliding worlds of its newest alternative-reality series, Mad Mad House.  'Five practitioners of 'alternative lifestyles' — a Wiccan, a Naturist, a Modern Primitive, a Voodoo Priestess and a real-life Vampire (known collectively as the Alts) — rule the roost. Meanwhile, 10 ordinary folks move into the House as the Alts' Guests — and compete against one another for the $100,000 jackpot.  'Our Guests will live out a Survivor meets The Real World meets The Osbournes lifestyle — and try to get along living under one roof together. The eclectic and unpredictable Alts will challenge them, judge them and eliminate them one by one — ultimately deciding which Guest is most fit for life in the Mad Mad House.'                  urlLink Bad Checks Spell Trouble For Forger   'AUGUST 5--Meet Fitzhugh Fenderson, an alleged felon in dire need of a spell checker. The 33-year-old Long Island man is facing grand larceny and forgery charges for a scheme to swindle car dealerships out of pricey SUVs. According to cops, Fenderson last month passed bogus certified checks at two Cadillac dealerships, walking away with a pair of $65,000 Escalades. When the checks bounced, the dealers ran to Nassau County cops, who yesterday nabbed Fenderson, who was at the wheel of one of the Cadillacs when placed in cuffs. However, had the car salesmen looked more closely at Fenderson's checks they would have realized there was a problem with the paper. Along with misspelling 'Roosevelt,' his own hometown, Fenderson had trouble correctly rendering 'Chase Manhattan Bank.' Below you'll find one of those bogus 65k checks, passed at a Freeport dealership last month. Perhaps the next time Fenderson goes auto shopping he'll leave the checks at home and pay with cash.'             \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
