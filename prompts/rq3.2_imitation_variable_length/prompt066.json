I am supposed to have 24. I am thinking of un-casting-off and knitting a few more rows, maybe even another repeat of the pattern.  While I am stewing over this decision...  I have been looking into 'A Step Above' (ASA) entrelac socks from Knitter's 75.  So.  In a fit of 'must have them', I bought yarn for these socks on Sunday.  But the yarn I bought is not showing the pattern well.  I am knittng a test triangle and it's just not looking good.  I think the best yarn for these socks would have color run lengths of about 6 inches at a time.  I have a bunch of yarns at 20-30-50 inch run lengths and this new cotton yarn which alternates 6' of purple with 1' of red.  The color is also muddied by the use of a white thread to make this a tweed yarn.  So I'm thinking about a quick run to the yarn shop... though of course Charlotte & the unfinished bedjacket, baby sweater and other baby sweater are calling.  And so we come to discipline.  I will knit with what I have tonight.  Tomorrow maybe I'll go to the yarn shop.  Today my friend Frank sent me a copy of the 'Person Paper on Purity in Language' by William Satire - a satirical essay written by Douglas Hofstadter and first published in 1983.
