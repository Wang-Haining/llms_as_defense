And everytime I try to fly I fall without my wings I feel so small I guess I need you baby And everytime I see you in my dreams I see your face, it's haunting me I guess I need you baby  I make believe That you are here It's the only way I see clear What have I done You seem to move on easy  And everytime I try to fly I fall without my wings I feel so small I guess I need you baby And everytime I see you in my dreams I see your face, it's haunting me I guess I need you baby  I may have made it rain Please forgive me My weakness caused you pain And this song is my sorry  Ohhhh  At night I pray That soon your face Will fade away  And everytime I try to fly I fall without my wings I feel so small I guess I need you baby And everytime I see you in my dreams I see your face, it's haunting me I guess I need you baby  After all... After all...                              so today was normal til 5th period. i have a band s.h. during 5th and so i went to the band room by myself b/c sarah had to take a math test so i was sitting there then i 'snuck' out to go to my locker and get my phone to call my mom to see if my private teacher had left her and e-mail and so i was talking and talking and mr. blair the chorus teacher came wondering back in the room where i was and was like everyone's spose to go out the football field and baseball diamonds immediately and so i was like mom i g2g go and i thought he was going to yell at me for talking on my phone but no so we was all out there and stuff and it was great then word got around that i was a BOMB THREAT! so then they moved us all over to our saviors Lutheran church and that was great too then we were told that if we had our keys on us that we could go back over and get our cars and leave or if our parents were coming to pick us up. so i called my mom b/c i didnt have my keys b/c my purse and stuff was in my locker and we arent allowed back into the school so yeah my car is sitting in my parking lot til who knows when i guess. so my day was very eventful.                       so last nite i decided to spend that nite at my grandparents house...yes i still do, i enjoy spending time w/ them and being on a farm outside getting,   'Gasp!' dirty!  . anywho so today i woke at 10 and then watched a movie,  Seabiscuit . I like that movie i've seen it several time and its just neat...then i took a shower. Before i went outside i ate some lunch then went out to mow the pasture. my goal this summer is to mow the whole thingy by  myself  but everytime i attempt it either grandpa comes out and helps or my dad. today i told grandpa i wanted to do it myself so then dad came out w/ his other lawnmower which is the new one and its awesome! it has power steering...anywho m.b. mowed w/ me. while i was mowing today i decided to work on my tan so i put on my swimming suit and mowed. im a little pinkish which is good. so now im home and i just downloaded two songs:  Gigalo  - nick cannon and r. kelly and  tear it up  - yung won, DMX, David Banner, and Lil Flip. i still like my rock music and pop music but now im into the r&b and rap thing.                        so last nite was SOUNDSATIONS it was grand! uhm, i didnt really care much for that Jazz Band...but they were good. I learned that some people who i thought couldnt sing could actually really sing. The pie was good i guess  uhm, this weekend well actually tomorrow is the FIRST real race at KNOXVILLE! i just hope it doesnt get rained out or anything. Skip's Car Is looking GOOD! ok well ima gonna add a link to my 'raceblog' and maybe to hannah's since i was checking out chads and he posted that she had one so i went and read a few entires pretty interesting and uhm yeah but right now  i need to go and clean out the litter box....aww i dont want to.....its really icky when tiger decides she wants to use it as im cleaning it out and so i have to switch and do the other one. yes we have 2 litter boxes....and 2 kittens actually they're not all that small anymore...ok i know that was just way to much info but if you know me when i talk its hard for me to stop so ok i really need to stop typing and go. if i remember which i doubt b/c im so forgetful i'll post or well add to this later but all that i'll remember is to add links and stuff.  ok im leaving NOW!         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
