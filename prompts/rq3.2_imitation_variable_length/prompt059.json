It was awesome!  The place was packed.  As reported earlier, this was my tenth time seeing them and they were in top form.  There were a gazillion people there and we were in the upper bowl, but we could see everything because we were directly next to the stage.  P-Nut is my favorite member of the band - I just really love his style of playing but mainly for the way he interacts with the crowd at the shows, and his stance on issues like war and politics.  It's nice to look up to someone who stands for something.  Especially in the music industry today, that doesn't happen often.  After the show we found the buses and waited.  There were a ton of 18 and 19 year old blond girls there who presumably just wanted to meet Nick (the commonly known 'hottie' of the band, and also the lead singer).  I've met Nick before, and yes, he's hot, but I was hoping to see someone else, too :).  After about 30 minutes of freezing, Nick did come out.  He was bombarded by the hooch patrol, and I didn't even get a chance to talk to him.  So, I sat there and sulked for a while like the big baby that I am.  Chad said, 'Come on, let's go' but at that point I'd waited and froze so long I really didn't want to go away empty handed.    Next thing you know, P-Nut is walking over.  I zipped over to the barricade and was so excited to see him.  I didn't think he was coming out since I'd heard he was out before the show to meet people, too.  Everyone was asking P-Nut questions, like How's the wife, etc.  I asked him if there were any little P-Nuts in their future.  He smiled and said, 'Someday' and gave a little laugh.  It was really funny.  I was wearing my brick red Evolver shirt which he signed and I plan to wear that to the 311 Day show in March.  I also asked for a hug, and he gave me a big one.  I told him how much I appreciated the band and that they are awesome.  I swear, I turn into such a drooling fanboy around them.   Chad was watching from the sidelines and saw me get a hug from P-nut, and was smiling when I made my way back out.  We then decided to get something signed for my sister Karen, who is also a huge fan but couldn't be at the show.  Chad went up to P-Nut and shook his hand, and P-Nut signed a ticket for Karen (it was for her birthday on  the 26th).  Chad also thanked him for reading 'our emails'.. P-Nut kind of did a double take and said, 'Keep 'em coming!'  A couple days later, he did respond to our message which was also very neat.  It's so awesome to see a band that takes time out for the fans, even when it's freezing outside and they have a busy week coming up.  Thanks P-Nut and 311!                       I really wanted to come up with two more bad songs to finalize my  urlLink list  of 'songs that make you want to stick your head in an oven' so without further ado here is number 2:    urlLink Don't Want to Miss a Thing   by   urlLink Aerosmith  .  This song is the main hit from one of the worst movies of all time,  urlLink Armageddon .  So, when you hear this song you get to remember that horrible atrocity of a film, as well as some really terrible lyrics:  I could stay awake just to hear you breathing Watch you smile while you are sleeping While you're far away dreaming  Oh, so this is apparently  Every Breath You Take , part 2?  But not nearly as cool.   Lying close to you feeling your heart beating And I'm wondering what you're dreaming Wondering if it's me you're seeing  Yes, because I can only dream of you?  If I'm in a cold sweat, maybe that's the case, since this makes me think you're a creep.  Next:  Then I kiss your eyes And thank God we're together I just want to stay with you in this moment forever Forever and ever  WTF?  Kiss my eyes while I'm sleeping?  Wouldn't that wake me up?  Unless I wasn't really sleeping and you murdered me - in which case perhaps this moment could really last 'forever.'                        I'm up in Michigan visiting family and today my sister Karen and I went to see  urlLink 311 .  For those of you keeping track, this was my 11th time seeing them live (would have been 12 except we had to leave one concert in 2000 before they even came on stage.. long story).  Karen and I are pretty short and often have a hard time seeing the band up close because 311 shows are typically general admission.  This time at Pine Knob (whoops, I mean DTE Energy Music Theater), there were seats.  We decided to take a deal we found on  urlLink Stubhub  and upgrade our tickets, getting fifth row center for not much more than we had already paid.  Karen's boyfriend Mike and his friend bought the other tickets from us.  311 is always a fun concert and tonight was no exception.  The opener we saw were The Roots and they were really good.  Of course when the show started the fans that were a little bit back from the front section tried to come up.  There was some room where we were, so fine, whatever.  This one guy though got on the seat where a girl was standing and was kind of grinding against her.  She wasn't liking that too much and asked him to move.  He was clearly not someone who had a seat in our section (otherwise he would have probably been sitting there) and he was also under the influence of something, either beer or otherwise.  He came over behind Karen and I and stood on our chairs.  He started grinding around.  We asked him to move (because we didn't have any room and he wasn't helping) and he said something like, 'That girl over there (points at the girl next to Karen that just told him to move).. she's a total b----.  She's not cool.  I won't be in your way, I'll just stand back here.'  (Grind, grind)  There was a couple in front of us that we met during the break between bands and they were super cool.  The gentleman was muscular and built like you wouldn't want to mess with him.  He was watching this dork out of the corner of his eye...  Karen and I asked him to move again and he was not listening to us.  The person in front of us (I wish I knew his name) said, 'Can you just go somewhere else and leave the girls alone?'  Captain Jackass launched into his rant about how that other girl was a (well you know) and after a minute of back and forth, he pushed the nice guy in front of us.  Nice guy pushed back, and being much stronger than the punk kid, pushed him so hard that the punk fell backwards and on his back on the ground in the row behind us.    The punk gets up again and starts pushing on Mr. Nice Guy (remember, Karen and I are in between them now).  Mr. Nice Guy knocks him over again.  He gets up (now people in the crowd are starting to watch) and this time, grazes Karen and I with blows on his way to try to hit the guy in front of us.  I got hit pretty good in the right eye and my contact was on the verge of popping out.  No one messes with me and my sister, and especially when our favorite band is on stage.  I turned around and hit him.  I punched him like 3 times, then I pushed him (although he didn't fall like when the nice, strong guy pushed him).  Other people around us started restraining the jackass.  He manages to swing again and hit Karen in the face (not super hard, but hard enough to give her a fat lip).  Now I was really mad but I just let the guys handle it and pulled Karen aside.  Nick Hexum, the lead singer of 311, stopped what they were doing (they had just finished a song) and goes, 'Dude, that's not cool' to the jackass kid.  Security came sweeping in and took him away.  I don't know how much of the fight was on the overhead screens at The Knob but I know some of it was.. I wonder how many people saw me hit this guy.  I haven't been in a fight since I was 12, and I hate violence, but man, don't beat up on people at the concert because you're mad that you don't have better seats.  Especially two girls.  Dummy.  Props to 311 for drawing attention to him (otherwise I don't know if security would have seen it), and all the guys around us for helping out a couple girls that ended up in the middle of a fight.  311 is the best band in the world and the fans are super too.  I feel bad for Mr. Nice Guy's lady friend who lost a watch somehow in the scuffle.  If I have a black eye in the morning I'll be sure to post some pics.  I find it strange that the fighting started during '1, 2, 3' which is one of the chillest, most mellow 311 songs there is.  Sample lyrics:  ...run up the hill do as you do I'm going to chill you know you really ought to do the same...   Other than the fight the concert was incredible.  I saw about 4 people go running across the stage only to be tackled by more security.  The crowd was so loud.  The setlist was great.. and they even played Omaha Stylee for one of the encore songs which is unheard of.  (After they took a poll and let the crowd pick one of two songs.)                       ... a week makes.  Last Saturday the  urlLink Metroplex  saw its biggest snowstorm in about 25 years (4 inches at the airport).  This Saturday it's as sunny as can be and pushing 70 degrees.  I love it!  Things have been insane around here.  Chad and I are both working a ton - he's at work now.  All the car sales people work on Saturday.  Makes sense since that's the biggest sales day.  He's been fighting off a cold thing - must be the crappy weather all week (60s or higher since Wednesday) ;).  He's sold a couple cars already and building some momentum :).  I'm working 10 hour or so days as well as we prepare for a major release around the first of March.  I absolutely love it though.  The cat has adjusted just fine - she's liking all the sun and the birds in our apartment complex.  I think she misses us being gone all day since we used to all be home all the time, but she's a cat, so she might just be looking for more food when she howls when we walk in the door.    We are unpacked and finally the money spending has died down :).  Now all we need to do is sell that  urlLink house  in Kalkaska. ;)           \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
