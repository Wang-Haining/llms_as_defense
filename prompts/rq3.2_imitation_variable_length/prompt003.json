Yeah, I am pathetic, I talk to my mom secertary more then I talk to my mom. What do you expect, my mom is alway busy and whenever I got on the phone with her, she is too busy to talk and usually hang up in just minutes. I am getting sick of that... but oh well, I guess that's life. On the other hand, I just weight myself tonight and I lost another 2 lbs. So I am very happy about that and I am almost at the weight that I wanted. This morning, I finally paid for my plane ticket to Norfolk, VA. Going to get that on the 8th around 2:30pm and leaving on the 12th... yeah, I know everyone is leaving on the 11th but if I have to leave on the 11th, I will have to leave at 6:30am which mean I will probably have to leave the hotel at like 3:30am in the morning which I am not prepare to do. So I am going to stay for an extra night so that I can leave around 3:00pm on the 12th... Anyway, I hope that it will be good fun at VA beach.. anyway... I am getting tire now... I will try to write more tomorrow... oh, also I really want the new Red Hot Chili Peppers CD... I want it!!!                               Alright... me and my bro were friends again... isn't that fast... sometimes, I guess I am the big brother, I just have to be cool... and everything will work out in life.... as for other stuff goes, I was trying to fix my step mom friends Mei Ling computer... I really don't understand how she use her computer... and it turn out I have to completely erase everything and reformat hard drive and then reinstall windows... and I have to reinstall all the programs for her and stuff so it turn out to be a day job. There is conflict in her hardware and I have never seen so many blue screen of death for my life. For all the computer that I have fix and reinstall wondows and everything, this is the nastiest one. And it lead me to tell myself that I am never going to fix another computer for those computer incompetent people. Other then that my weekend was as usual, very boring, nothing much exciting is happening in my life. I think I need to join some clubs or something. But I am only going to be here for a few more days. So what should I do? Oh well, I guess I will figure that out tomorrow. Also, I think I am losing my touch on all these board games, I lost my monopoly game last night and I bankrupty and own my step bro 325 dollar monopoly money. I can't believe it... I think I am better in the game risk. :O) Anyhow, coolio... sweet sweet...                               I donno... I felt like such a dork for these past couple of days... I am having a crush on this Brian guy that I met recently... he is cute, sexy and smart.... and I have never fell so weak before... my body were numb because I can't stop thinking about him... but at the same time, I don't want him to think that I am a freak because I do believe that any relationship is a two way things... it can never be forced in one direction. If he shares the same feelings as I do then something could develop... if he doesn't then we will just be friends and nothing will happen. This whole things just bothers me because I haven't dated another guy before. I had one night stand before and what not, but I have never dated another guy. It just makes me really nervous and I did many stupid things that makes me look like a dork. I even called Brian up without knowing what do say... I just totally freeze... I am such a dork... because of this, Brian knows that I am in love with him but I donno does he interest in me or not? I am sick and tired for my horrible love life when everyone that I show remote interests would just wants to be friends. To me, I know that I am a very nice guy, I want my friends to be happy and I want everyone that I know to be happy. But sometimes I do think it is unfair that everyone just wants to be friends. It sucks and it happens so often that I lost confident in myself. I know I am confident in business, I am confident in technical knowledge but I am not in love and relationship.  So this whole thing is really bothering me and I just hopes that I know how Brian feels about me. It doesn't matter if he likes me or not, I just want to know so that I don't have to spend so much time thinking about it and worrying about it. I know I like him and I know that I can love him if he give me a chance but it will never work out if he doesn't share the same feelings as I do. I guess we will just have to wait and see how it goes. Luckily Brian is out of town for a week, so I have some time to calm down. Hopefully, I can be less nervous when I get to hang out with him next time. We will see how it goes. I am crossing my fingers and hoping for the best on this one. Love you guys. Take care. Ciao. Peter                               CBC was great... they got a wonderful program tonight on fifth estate... they are talking about the stuff behind the war on Iraq... pretty interesting prospective... I have definitly learned something from it...  SARS... this got blown way out of proportion by the media... this is my prospective anyway... i was in Hong Kong just 2 weeks ago and it is not even close to be as bad as it was being said by the media... it is bad, but not as bad and dangerous... and don't worry, I don't have SARS... I left Hong Kong last Tuesday, so today was the 10th day that I was back in Canada... so if I have SARS, I should have it by now! hahaha...  As for interesting stuff... here is an interesting site that I have visit...  urlLink click here  some pretty interesting perspective on stuff... also click on Gulf War 2 on the right... it is a pretty funny animation that the author had put together...  Finally... I wrote an letter to the Queen's Journal Editor just before I leave for Hong Kong... I was so angry by my fellow Sci'03 (no names included here) when I wrote it, it was not even funny... and I still believe the person involve should be de-bossed... it drive me nuts that Queen's is such a non-queer friendly place... it is so so so bad... I even send a complain to Principle Leggett, he haven't reply yet... it had been 2 weeks, so I am disappointed in him also... overall I am just disappointed... anyway, if you want to read the journal letter, here is the link...  urlLink click here     Anyway, I got to study hard for my exams for the next few weeks... wish me luck... cooli...  Peter                               Reading week was great... relaxing... sort of... hahaha... at least there's no classes so that's not that bad... my brother send me this link today (http://anonx.web1000.com/)... and I think it is way funny... so I am going to post it here... I am sure most of you have heard of this before... but now there's is the graphics to go with it... so it is so so so cool... by the way, click on the play button as soon as the bottom of your browser said play... or else you will have to wait until eternity before the loading sign disappear... hahaha... Anyway...  I feel good right now for some reason... even though I should starts studying for my APSC 132 Quiz... but somehow I am not worry as usual... I really don;t understand how can I pass all of my courses without really doing any hardcore studying... hahaha... I donno... right now, I am just going to study really slowly... go out to dinner... and then go watch a movie or something :)  It should be fun fun fun... anyway other then that... nothing much is cool lately... the weather is nice though... it is warm, but I guess warm during winter is not really that good... all the snow melts = slushy snow on the ground... haha... Anyway... I really donno what am I going to say... I guess I can tell you the Mini-Baja is coming a long slowly... hahaha... Anyway... talk to you all later... cooli  Peter                                WHY DOESN'T PEOPLE THINK?   Why doesn't people think before they do something? Sometimes it drives me nuts! For example: tonight I discover that my housemate took my laundry out of the dryer and then put it on the floor and mixed it with my other housemate dirty cloths. WHY WHY WHY? Can't people simply think about the fact that clean cloths wasn't suppose to mix with dirty cloths??? Now I have to put up a sign just so that this won't happens again! Sometimes I wonder why doesn't people spend two seconds of their time to just think about what they are doing before they actually do it!!!   Sometimes, thinking a little might actually be good for you... working your brains out a little will improve your situation awareness and your responds time to common problems. I sometimes really wonder, how do we actually think? Afterall, we were just a bunch of H2O and Carbon and some other atom mixed together... so really how do all of these atoms have the ability to think? This is just too weird... If you ever figure it out how do we think then let me know :)  Peter             \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
