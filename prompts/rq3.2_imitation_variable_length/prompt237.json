My parents got all pissed at me today because I forgot how to do the homework that was assigned to me on Thursday.  Really mad, I ended it pissing off my mom and she just told me to take a bath and go to sleep.  She said it was the computer's fault, that I'm obssessed by it.  That's not true, what else is there to do in my house?  NOTHING!  Damn, when I'm at my cousin's I have no urge to use the computer like I do here, because there are actually things to do there.  It's fucking crazy, and I hate it when she calls people online that I know, imaginary.  They aren't imaginary, they are as fucking real as you and me.  What would you rather do, watch TV, or talk to people online, learn about things, play games that interact with you, I mean fuck, it's the obvious answer.  But she doesn't see that, oh well.  It rained a lot today, and then after there was a cool breeze, that was awesome.  I love it when it's dark and rain outside, one of the best times of the year, besides when it's cold.  I got a little Yahoo pictures account setup, so I don't have to keep sending people my pictures with my slow ass connection.  Oh you want to see it?  Here you go.  http://photos.yahoo.com/bc/osiris6411/lst?&.dir=/Boredom&.src=ph&.begin=9999&.view=t&.order=&.done=http%3a//photos.yahoo.com/bc/osiris6411/lst%3f%26.dir=/Boredom%26.src=ph%26.view=t   Quite long URL, I know.  I'll post the pictures I took with my 'nice' camera later.  Damn, my shoulders are soo sore from all the working out I've been doing, it kinda sucks, but I'll live, and lift weights tommorow as planned.  I just need to start a schedule for running.  Hmm...July 28, BAM, I'm going to be built as hell.....heh:)  I got a new door...WOO.  LoL.  Awesome boots I'm going to buy http://www.coveshoe.com/mt_hh_10tanker.html  Until next time,        adieu mon ami :)            What to say?  I have nothing to say.  But I shall grace you all with my 'Rules of Life.'  Enjoy:  12 Rules for living life  1. Never accept the rules and regulation society has placed on you. Explore. 2. Never believe the mass media. 3. Never assume you know what's actually going on. 4. Shoot for total quality. Don't shave standards. 5. Break things. Welcome destruction. It's the first step in the creative process. 6. Take risks. Don't play it safe. 7. Realize that right and wrong doesn't exist; it's only defined by society. 8. Question the nature of your consciousness. Look around and define the properties that make reality real. 9. Live your life as if there is no afterlife. 10. Do everything you've always wanted to do. Take enough precautions to never get caught when doing anything illegal and then do it with confidence as though you couldnâ€™t get caught. 11. Realize that your culture is not 'right' culture. A culture that hates your nationality is neither wrong nor right. You hating that culture back is neither wrong nor right. 12. Stay alive.   So what do you think?  Do you agree?  I sure do, it's how I live most of my life.  And so far it's worked.              Yes, it's 5:10 AM here, and as usual I'm sitting here bored talking to my good friend GeneralSpecific on IRC and convinving some newbie that I'm an FBI agent after he admitted to making counterfeit bills on Photoshop and using them.  Nothing much at all happened today, even less than yesterday, heh.  I talked to Crystal from 9 to 11, and that's about it.  She's suuuper cute, heh.  It's crazy.  You crazy cat!  Yup, I got online, talked to Anahi, she's doing better, so that's good.  Pr0to and Ironz are getting kicked out of their houses:(  We'll see what happens, I hope they're ok.  I'm more worried about Ironz, he has nowhere to stay and he doesn't know what to do.  Pr0to has a job, someone to stay with and a car soon, so he's doing well.  Oh well, I'll see what Ironz's situation was tommorow on Spurious, he was too tired to explain.  Besides all that, all I did was OWN in Soldier of Fortune again:)  As usual.  And here I am typing away, but I shall go now, nothing much left to say,  Bye now.    \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
