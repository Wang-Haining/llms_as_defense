Sorry, Chang, for the pitiful job at paraphrase.    Well, I wonder, too.  And I'm sure others are curious, so I'm giving the matter its own post with its own comments and saying, 'Thanks, Chang, for the great idea.'  I'm still in IC with Kristin Hall-soon-to-be-Gilchrist-if-I-play-my-cards-right.  We decided to stay at least another six months but probably a year in order to be married without the stress of new jobs in a new town and etc.  No date yet for the wedding as we must wait for a pastoral change at St. Patrick's.  We're both working for local test scoring syndicates.  I'm blogging, cooking, gardening, reading, and even writing a little.  For the 4th, I'm attending my cousin's wedding in Cedar Rapids.  We had a bachelor party for him on Saturday from which I fully recovered this morning (Tuesday).  Kristin is running in the Alliant Energy 8K Very Early Morning Race before the wedding.  Anyone interested in running or spectating should drop me a line.  There.  My update complete, may we hear from the rest of yous?                  More items: 1.  I am noticing that Derrcules has bumped Hurricane Earle from the top of the pile.  I am not amused.  But in other news, Derrcules--where have you been all my life?  Can you make my computer go faster? 2.  Since last we spoke I saw Jim Jarmusch's Coffee and Cigarettes, which I very much enjoyed.  At first I thought the premise was cheesy and overly-mannered, but by about a third of the way through I was thoroughly won over.  Jarmusch has a wonderful sense of humor, I think.  The scene with Bill Murray was off the hook!  I also watched Down By Law, which I liked, although I do get tired of Roberto Benigni pretty quickly.  Possibly an explanation for my resistance to C & C? 3.  Of course I also saw The Chronicles of Riddick.  Don't ask. 4.  Is the numbered posting getting old?  I think I'll stop with it after this post. The little Offutt who dances on my shoulder is telling me it's just an excuse not to write the transitions. 5.  My herbs are going strong.  The basil is a big bully.  Will have to be isolated.  I planted tomatoes and peppers, too, but the sociopathic squirrel in my backyard (it's the one who fell out of the tree, I am certain) uprooted and ate all four of them.  Seriously, I caught him in the act--I walked out to my kitchen in the morning just in time to see him leap from my rail with leaves and stems and a dirty ganglion of roots all spilling from his little mouth.  The little guy looked too ridiculous to make me angry.  (OK, I got a little angry.) 6.  Michelle, Middlemarch is tremendous.  I have had my socks knocked off on every page.  She's continually expanding on our understanding of her characters without ever seeming inconsistent or reticent--they're all just interesting and complex enough to warrant the attention.  I've seen her even give five pages of exposition on a character she'd thoroughly introduced two hundred pages earlier.  Awesome!  She also makes these hilarious and compassionate authorial asides.  Anyways, I like it.  Here's a section I've been saving for blog (from Chapter 41, p. 340 in my edition):      'Who shall tell me what may be the effect of writing?  If it happens to have been cut in stone, though it lie face downmost for ages on a forsaken beach, or 'rest quietly under the drums and tramplings of many conquests', it may end by letting us into the secret of usurpations and other scandals gossiped about long empires ago:--this world being apparently a huge whispering-gallery.  As the stone which has been kicked by generations of clowns may come by curious little links of effect under the eyes of a scholar, through whose labors it may at last fix the date of invasions and unlock religions, so a bit of ink and paper which has long been an innocent wrapping or stop-gap may at last be laid open under the one pair of eyes which have knowledge enough to turn it into the opening of a catastrophe.  To Uriel watching the progress of planetary history from the Sun, the one result would be just as much a coincidence as the other.'  Anyways, I'll give the final word when I've finished it.  Extra credit to anyone who can 1. identify whom she is quoting in line 3; and 2. tell me who this Uriel is.  (You see, I even think in numeric sequences.)                     Hey guys  I'm concerned, as I hope you all are, with staying in touch after graduation.  This got me thinking that we could start a blog intended mostly for each other.  The reasons to do this are many:  1)  posting on a blog is only slightly more complicated than writing an email, and only so when you want to include a picture or link.  Either way, it only took me about ten minutes to figure it all out.    2)  We can stay in touch together, as a group.  Think of it as a virtual Mill.  I think there's less pressure but more incentive to stay in touch this way.  If there are enough of us, pressure is considerably diluted; no one has to post with any particular frequency.  3)  I will do all the administrative work.  All you have to do is post.   5)  Invite anyone else who you'd think should be involved (and please explain that I didn't email them at first not because I meant to, but because these were the addresses in my contact folder).  6)  If you're unsure, just sign on.  You're not really committing to anything except for future options.    I think this will be great, but only if you guys think it will be great.  Let me know.  I'll get started on it right away, this email will be the first post.                   Our garden is thriving on the south side of town in a park I doubt you knew existed.  You are all invited to peruse the lushness and admire it in comparison to neighboring plots.  The park is called Wetherby and is found at the end of Taylor (just East of Broadway) off of Highway 6.  Our plot is number 6.  When you visit, pull a weed or two from the tomato patch if you find any, would you please?   The veggies growing inside our rabbit fencing have made their homes in little rows and on mounds and in patches.  After some time in the sun, bending close to carrot shoots and reaching beneath nervous-system-like broccoli, I have wished that these little living things actually possessed the voices my imagination attributes to them.  I find it somewhat unbelievable that beautiful food can be so simple.  The work we did and nurture we provided was minimal considering the results.    What’s new in the garden?  The tomatoes are staked, morning glories are planted along the back fence, corn is sprouting, one pepper plant has produced a single pepper, we’ve harvested a few onions and sautéed them for wonderful pasta sauces using the greens of the leaves as well as the onions themselves.  Old news: the rabbit fence continues to protect the lettuces (whose imaginary plant voices resemble your corpulent eldest auntie), fried green tomatoes are anticipated in our kitchen by the end of June, and a neighboring gardener offered praise on the pleasing appearance of our plot.    In other news: I’ve been putting many of your leftovers and left-behinds to rather tasty use.  Upon their moves Tom and Leigh gave me a crock-pot, Grant and Kate a food processor and spices, and someone left in my freezer a package of turkey bratwurst.  In the crock I simmered the turkey brats for hours in two cans of beer with whole cloves of garlic and sprinklings of several other spices.  The tender and flavorful result will never be exactly duplicated, as I don’t record my recipes.    Enough for now?  Probably.  Sorry for my laxity in posting.  I make no promises to be a better blogger, though you may all be assured that I wish I were.                  I was doing some research for my novel, searching the web for a little history of the term 'WASP' and when it was first used. One of the links that came up on Google led me to a White Nationalist web site called  urlLink Stormfront.org . I poked around it a little bit, and now I feel somewhat sick.   It's easy to forget how many hateful assholes are out there. But what's really surprising to me is the fact that they're actually literate. I mean, the spelling and grammar in their bulletin board posts (with subject lines like 'Cultural Differences, or are Blacks Just Plain Stupid?') is actually not bad. Which suggests that these people read books. And if they read books, how can they be so goddamned ignorant? I suppose if the only books you read are along the lines of  Mein Kampf , you can write a decent sentence and still have Neanderthal views of race and humanity. Still, it amazes me that people who think like that aren't living in caves and eating their own excrement. As they ought to be.                      The  urlLink big city folks  make IC seem a lot more interesting than it really is.  (Rock on with the mention of the Lincoln, though).   Now that we've (sort of) moved on: do you guys really like this place?  The workshop experience and the people aside,  I kinda fucking hate it.  The problem is not the midwest-- I lived in Madison for four years and loved it-- it isn't even  urlLink Herky , though I wouldn't really mind if that mangy vulture were  urlLink murdered in a ritual fashion .    The real problem is  urlLink Coralville .  The problem is TWO enormous but horrible china buffets across the street from one another, the mini-mall of America, the fact that a town was basically invented to house fast food restaurants, shitty hotels for visiting college athletes, landlord offices and strip clubs that are difficult to locate.  (Not to mention the most evil dog-trainer I have ever met.)  Sometimes I wonder if Coralville was modelled after a level of Purgatory, the particular place you go for driving like a jerk, or for masturbating too much.     Maybe I'm overreacting, but when I think about Coralville too much, I get depressed.  And this isn't a leftist, elitist, whateverist rant.  it just depresses me.  Everything that is wrong with Coralville is everything that is wrong with this country, this world, and me.  If I ever write a manifesto, Coralville will be of central and metaphorical significance.                       Last night, Alastair and I watched 'Grease,' which is on TV basically every day on one channel or another, on the Women's Entertainment Network, AKA 'We.' The little animation that came up before and after commercial breaks referred to the showing of the film as 'Cinematherapy.'  This set me off on a little rant about how insipid and unfeminist and annoying the current women's self-help / psychobabble / Oprahfied /Bridget Jones pop culture is, and how infantilizing I find it to constantly be told to 'go girl!' and 'get self-actualized' (what does that  mean ?) and eat ice cream and burn scented candles when I'm feeling victimized by men/work/my weight/etc. (As for personality quizzes, don't even get me started...)  So then there was a commercial for a show called 'Bridezillas' which seems to be about bitchy real-life brides who throw tantrums when the cocktail napkins for their reception are the wrong shade of Ecru, thus ruining the wedding they've dreamed of all their lives. (Jane rants some more, while patient, long-suffering Alastair goes and gets another beer.)  But this was the best part: the voice over said, 'That's tomorrow night, on WE.'  On We.  On We.  On We.  Say it three times fast....YES. Exactly. Coincidence? I think not.  I rest my case.             \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
