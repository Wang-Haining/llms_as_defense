Well I think that's not at all true.  For example, just last month I ate a ton of Twizzlers - I can't get enough of them! and I put on 3 pounds.  Just like that!  Can you fucking believe it?  I am purging this week so don't worry about it, but it was totally scary.  As for being rich, I don't think it's fair that people are jealous of me because I never have to work a day in my life.  Which by the way is also non-true.  I am a professional personality and it takes a lot of work to do that.  I am actually a pretty shy person and it's not easy being 'on' all the time for the cameras and whatnot.  So that also proves my point.  Anyway, don't think the grass is always greener on the other side of the street.  When people say that I just think: 'walk a mile in my shoes please!'  Between the TV show and parties my life can get really hectic.  So just please stop judging me.  I am who I am and being rich and thin isn't always the key to happiness.  Of course I wouldn't want to be poor and fat but then who would?  I guess the lesson is that poor fat people are sometimes unhappy, just like really thin, really rich people.                          San Francisco, CA -  An Al Qaeda plot to drive a van into downtown San Francisco and detonate heavy explosives was foiled on Friday by Shawna Jones, the morning dispatcher for U-Haul in the Potrero Hill neighborhood.  According to Jones, Reza Al Hagwani had reserved a U-Haul van for pick-up early Friday morning.  When Al Hagwani arrived at 9am Friday, however, Jones informed him that there was no U-Haul van available.  'I told the man that we had no vans for him but that we might have one down in San Jose,' said Jones.  'I can't help it if we don't get the vans exactly on the day people needs it.'  An incensed Al Hagwani stated that he intended to 'write a scathing letter to the management of U-Haul' protesting his treatment.  'I cannot believe that even with all the computers at the disposal of these workers, they are unable to deliver me with the van I ordered more than two weeks ago,' said Al Hagwani.  'There are many choices to me of rental truck companies, and the next time I will not be calling U-Haul, that is for certain.'  Al Hagwani did make the one-hour trip to San Jose to inquire about renting a van from that location, but it is not yet known whether a van was available.                        VATICAN CITY  and  GREEN BAY, WI , May 18th  - After 2004 years of praying to our Lord Jesus Christ, humanity had reason to believe that, well, Jesus was a figment of someone's imagination.   No longer.   In a celebrity sponsorship scheme for the ages, the Vatican has announced a partnership program with Klondike Ice Cream Company. After securing exclusive rights to the real-life Jesus for 2005, the Vatican will work closely with both Heaven and Klondike to improve the image of the Church as well as the Ice Cream company's bottom line.   The sponsorship, still in its development phase, looks to incorporate Jesus into a variety of advertisements from TV commercials to print and banner ads. With a rigorous press junket planned shortly after Easter 2005, Jesus is expected to be on Earth for two months before prior obligations require His return to Heaven.    urlLink      Jesus, Our Lord and Savior,  Contemplating a Velvety- Smooth Klondike Bar    'We're tremendously excited to welcome Jesus to the Klondike Team,' Marvin Watson, VP of Marketing, said in a recent press conference. 'With the recent spate of Jesus-positive media, we felt that He was a perfect complement to our brand. We're excited to see, for the first time, not only what Jesus actually looks like, but what He looks like earning Klondike Bars: you know, doing the chicken dance, rapping in Polish, or my personal favorite, telling off-color jokes.'   When asked for comment, Cardinal Abruzzi, Vatican spokesman, stated that 'We felt that Catholicism had taken a real hit in the last year with the various scandals. As an institution, the Church was rating only slighter higher than Janet Jackson's new  Damila Jo  album. Frankly, we'd never really lived down the whole 'sun revolving around the earth' issue from a few centuries ago. What better way to score some points by bringing back the Son of God? And what could be better than to combine His Holiness with a milk chocolate shell and creamy vanilla ice cream Klondike Bar? I can't reveal too much, but what I can tell you is that you better be prepared for the hilarity that is Jesus doing jumping jacks and screaming at the top of His lungs.'    urlLink      If all goes according to plan,  Jesus will be enjoying  one of these shortly    Initial word has Jesus attending the premiere of 'Klondike: The Very Last Temptation of Christ' next May at Mann's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood as the kick-off to the marketing campaign. There, it is expected that Jesus Himself will make a short 'comeback' speech, sit and watch the movie, and then do jumping jacks and scream at the top of His lungs in order to earn His first Klondike Bar in two millenia. He is then expected to make His way over to the premiere party.   As of press time, Jesus was unavailable for comment.    The New Marketing Campaign from Klondike    urlLink                            Bloomington, IN -  Mass pandemonium was unleashed last Tuesday when an area toddler grabbed for and dropped a can of whoopass at the Kroger Supermarket on 10th Street.  Bystanders report that the can emitted a loud hissing sound before exploding into a black cloud of bitterness and rage on Aisle 3.   urlLink     Cans of whoopass. 'Justin's always grabbing stuff off the shelves and throwing them into the cart when I'm not looking,' said Marnie Wolff, the toddler's mother.  'You can bet I gave him a big smack this time.'  Assistant Manager Joe Shifflett remembers rushing to the scene and attempting to contain the spill, but says, 'I just kind of blacked out after that.'  According to witnesses, Shifflett ripped his shirt off and began hurling cans of tomatoes at shoppers trapped in Aisle 3.  75-year-old Judith Martin, who was caught in the middle of the aisle, dropped to her knees and was heard chanting in a foreign language.  Bystander Matthew Pinole said, 'It sounded like Latin maybe.  Remember that kid in The Exorcist?  It sounded like that.'                        New York, NY  -  In a long-anticipated study commissioned by New York City's Center for Homeless Research, the findings have been announced:  New York City's homeless are lazier than they have ever been.  'I remember when the homeless of New York had, I don't know, a certain je ne sais quoi' said Jennifer Skately, 24, of Washington Heights.  'They'd at least crack wise, do a little dance, or just take pride in earning the 21 cents you'd half-heartedly fish out of your pocket.  Now it seems like they expect you to give 'em a buck for nothing else than being homeless.'   urlLink      Sittin' around, doin' nothin' - as usual    Quantitatively, it does appear that Ms. Skately's anecdote can be supported.  In a broad range of categories, it appears that the homeless are trying less hard than ever.  All-time low marks were earned in entertainment, creativity, and good humor.  Marks for aggravation, conniving, and public urination have bottomed out as well.  The only statistic in which they receive a better mark is 'sitting around and doing absolutely fuck-all.'     urlLink      Get up and get a job? Not this guy!     Henry LaFontaine, spokesman for the Center, chimes in:  'It seems that after 9/11, the average vagrant's desire to improve his or her lot in life just vanished.  Some may chalk it up to a crushing loss of hope, attributable to prolonged homelessness.  On the other hand, maybe since garbage pickup has been reduced to twice a week they're all better-fed these days?  I really couldn't tell you.  Nonetheless, I am afraid that the homeless, more than ever, just seem shiftless, bored, and unbelievably lazy.'  I spoke with 'Joe' (not his real name) to find out his side of the story.  'Man, you go on the Subway and they look at you like you done [had intercourse with] their kids.  It's tough to find a [friendly] face.  And now, with the new mayor not making us go to a shelter at night, it just seems like the other bums got all lazy and [what have you].'  Joe then leaned back against the wall and got comfortable.    Joe, comfortable    urlLink                                By Molly Wentworth  The other day I was at Lot 21 doing a quick key hit in the bathroom stall when I heard my old roommate Joyce talking to another girl about me.  She said 'I just saw a friend from college at the bar - I hope she didn't see me.  Major addict.  I've heard she's turned into a total coke whore.'  Joyce, first of all, that was so unfair.  I totally buy my own drugs.  That's an incredibly important distinction.  Second of all, I also don't think it's fair when you say I'm an 'addict.'  The difference is that an addict  needs  drugs, while I simply  like  drugs.  This is why I prefer the term 'aficionado' to 'addict.'  I don't even have an addictive personality.  Do you remember our junior year in college when I quit smoking for 2 months?  That wasn't even hard for me.  I've also just switched from vodka to red wine.  Wine is full of antioxidants and hardly even gives me a buzz right away.  Just because someone likes to do something doesn't make them an addict.  I recall you getting up every morning to go running.  How would you like it if I called you an 'exercise whore?'  I think that would hurt your feelings.  Anyway, I hope you're happy.  I am totally losing sleep over what you said.  I had to take two Ambien last night just to get 4 solid hours, which might not seem like a big deal to you, but now I'm almost out and the Web site where I get them just got shut down.
