I'm taking 18 hours, which I have done before, but not for a while.  It helps that 6 of those 18 are Criminal Justice workshops.  I've never taken any of them before, but I've heard it's a quick and dirty way to get extra hours in.  And they are supposed to be easy.  My Schedule is as follows...  Genetics - MWF at 8am and lab on Tues morning - 4 cred hours Chem 151 - MWF at 10am, recitation at 12 on Mon, and lab at 5:30pm Mon - 5 credit hours!!! Comparative Seminar - MW 1:30-2:45 - 3 cred hours Oranized Crime - Weekend workshop (2 weekends in a row) - 3 cred hours Crime Scene Analysis - 'nother Weekend workshop - 3 cred hours  Im excited for all of them except the chemistry.  At least people I know will be in all of the classes.  That's what I get for being an undergrad for so long.  Last night after dinner, we went for more Ice cream on Mass Street.  This guy ran by us as we were standing outside, and my comment was 'I want that.'  I think it was my entire family's plan to make me feel badly for not liking bar scenes, but what can I say?  It sort of turned into 'you have no social life' attack on me.  Im focused, I can't help it.  I don't think I will meet anyone I will like in a bar, because that's not exactly the best place to meet people, in my view.  Even my dad was making fun of me for not having a date for quite a while.  I could have a date, if I wanted one, that's just not something Im thinking about right now.  I don't really have much time to spend on a boy anyway, so he would probably feel neglected. Anyway, my fam can be pretty catty.  I think it's hard for people to understand that I like school so much.  And they don't understand that Im a little afraid to get into anything serious right now.  Don't really enjoy getting my heart stomped on, so Im trying to do it less and less.  And plus, with the possibility of moving in a year, what's the point any way?                        Regardless of what you may think, my title is my scream of joy.&nbsp; I just logged into my school account to try and do another email, because it's been about a week.&nbsp;&nbsp;(and at the urging of my reader, that's singular&nbsp;since I think there's only one of you out there...) &nbsp;Lo and behold...to my surprise, there was an email awaiting me, from the prof.&nbsp; My prof.&nbsp; That's possessive, huh?&nbsp; I am excited.&nbsp; Very Very Very  EXCITED .&nbsp; This means a road trip for me next weekend, and a break from Kansas.&nbsp; Yippee!&nbsp; I am planning an afternoon meeting with him, and then I think im going to stay overnight in Omaha.&nbsp; See the town a little.&nbsp; I must admit that I'm not very adventerous when Im on my own in new places, but at least I've been there once before.&nbsp; I may just be my big geeky self and spend all day Friday at the Omaha Zoo.&nbsp; Last time I was there we rushed through it.&nbsp; Way too fast.&nbsp; Oh yeah!&nbsp; Now I just need to reread all of the articles so that I have something to talk about with him and so that he doesn't think im not qualified to work with him. My Bio advisor said he (the professor I want to&nbsp;work with)&nbsp;has a big ego.&nbsp; I think he was just trying to freak me out, but he said he was an alpha male type.&nbsp; I can deal with non-human alpha males.&nbsp; He also said that 'You don't have to like the professors you work with in graduate school.'&nbsp; I was thinking, come on Dr. M.&nbsp; Find some more good stuff to scare me with. Anyhow, YAY!                         I have that song in my head. But I really do need some help in order to stop posting. It's addictive. Or something along that line. Since my earlier post I have done the following:  a. showered b. drove to school (stopped on the way for ice cream... I love summer... when it's not 100 degrees out) c. sat and started replying to emails and what not in the lab. And read Meghan's blog... It's really my only way of keeping up with her d. procrastinated to keep myself from actually doing work. Which I love to do. What is wrong with me? I am a work-a-holic I swear. Lately I can't seem to stay on track though. I get pulled off my thought process too easily.  I looked through a lot of my possible future home's stuff, and I think I have decided I would really like it. Probably a lot. Hormone research isn't too far away from things like pheromones and stuff. Which really interests me lately. I can see myself being cooped up for long hours on end in the building I visited, and loving it. And I do like the marmosets allready. I fall in love with animals quickly. So now... I'm only praying I get in. I think I will. I hope I will. With my research background it shouldn't be too hard. Hopefully. It's awful to be nervous about something I will be doing a year from now. If everything goes according to plan.          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
