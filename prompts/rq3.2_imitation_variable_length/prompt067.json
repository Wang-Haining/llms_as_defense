But I guess now is a better time than any. Yesterday was the end of the semester, and I wasn't happy with my grades.  This semester was different because I really worked my ass off to do the best I could. I stopped copying massive amounts of homework assignments. I did my work, or at least as much as I could in the time that I had. I learned this semester, that I couldn't make the cut. And I won't survive much longer.  The way Oxford works is whack, and it took me years to figure out exactly how things are. In 7th grade, you start out with what are suppose to be 200 of the smartest people in the district. As every year, every semester, goes by, people get kicked out of the school. These are the people who are 'not as smart,' and couldn't meet the 3.0 requirement. By junior year, you end up with only the people who in jr high had straight a's and awesome grades. Everyone else, by now, is long gone. You're left with a group that is supposedly the best of the best because the worst of the best were forced to leave, and while I used to be near the top of the bell curve, I'm now left near the bottom.  Sure I could graduate at Oxford, but with what? The pride of knowing that I survived six years of hardships? With a mediocre GPA which will get me into a college that I don't want to be at--A college where my SAT score is 300 points higher than the school's average. But I'm there because I couldn't get a GPA to match it.  Oxford has a problem that as soon as students fall into hard time, the school turns their backs on them. Instead of truly helping them to catch up, the school recommends that you go to another school. The school recommends that you lessen your workload and take some 'regular' classes at another school. The school which is suppose to prepare you for college forces you to go some else and it closes a door behind you after you leave.  I don't know how much more of this I would be able to take. Every semester, I have to constantly worry about if I'll be at the school in a couple months. I have to worry about keeping my grades up.  I'm sick of it.  I'm sick of being a guinea pig so that the school can find out how to create the 'perfect' school.  Face it, Oxford looks good on paper, but how well does the school actually work?  Sure we have high test scores: we kick out anyone that can't keep up.  It used to be a matter of finishing what I started.  I'd gone this far, why give up now?  But have I really succeeded if I finish with a GPA that I'm not proud of?  How much is Oxford really a college prep school if its seniors can't get into the colleges they want to?  Thank you to everyone else who is leaving this semester or is planning to leave at the end of the year.  And there are tons of you.  Someone else called it The Great Walkout.  Thank you for making me realize that I can leave, and I don't have to put up with this.  Oxford is not the best; we're a poor excuse for a high school, and we don't have to have our college admissions, our careers fucked because our high school's system doesn't work.  I'm done.  I've realized that I can do better, I can go elsewhere.  I don't have to put up with the stuff that Oxford students always complain about.  I don't have to struggle through everything I do because Oxford is still trying to figure out how it wants to run its school.  I don't have to put up with the empty promises of a gym and new classrooms.  Good bye Oxford.  Cuz dude, I'm a Centurion now.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
