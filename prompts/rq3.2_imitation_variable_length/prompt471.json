  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic:\n\n           has been some time since i posted on the blog. just was very busy with my work and didn't find much time to write anything. spiderman-2 is the next big thing coming up. reviews have been fabulous. and how did i forget the fourth of july weekend!! have got quite some plans lined up, lets see how each of them materializes. talking of spiderman, i have to mention about the ride at Universal Studio, Orlando. It's a 3D-simulation ride. So you and a few more people sit in a van and wear suspicious looking dark colored shades. The story is like you are the journalists travelling in a van covering the activities of spiderman. The van is moving on tracks and spiderman and all other charachters are created by laser, just that they are 3 D!! So unfortunately you get caught in the fight, and the evil souls(all 3D laser created charachters) try to douse you with water (and you actually are sprayed with water) and burn you with fire (u feel the heat), though not specifically in that order :-). and finally your van falls from the top of a building. simulation-zero gravity effect. absolutely awesome. and spiderman catches you in his web. So everything except you and the van are laser created. Was undoubtedly the best ride that i have ever been to. If this sounds like fun, then there are a handful other rides like this. Was a good theme park to visit. And if that was not enough, there always is a NBA restaurant and a hard rock cafe inside!!                        Yesterday, I realized blogging is not for me. I have seen people blog for a couple of years now and frankly i don't know how. I will tell you what my problem is. I don't like to talk about my daily schedule, nor my work or thoughts. I think all these things will bore the reader.I have seen that my blogs are increasingly about music and sports. Ah well... is there anything as a blogger's block? I think what's undecided in my mind is 'How personal do I want this thing to be?'I don't know. I don't think I have been able to find a right balance.  But at the same time, whatever short span I have been blogging, this thing has become a little part of my life. Its just a nice space on the web where I can write something  and people who know about it can read. Its too tough to let go of it.  Anyways- whats hot:Lance, for Tour de France and his role in 'Dodgeball'!! (And you thought          Texas only produced Cowboys and dumb presidents) whats not:having to work on beautiful sunny days.                        I am really pissed at SBC right now. They said my phone conn will be installed on Wednesday, and that didn't happen, so I called them and asked whats up. They said that it shud be up and working now. Now there is some problem with the main telephone console for which their guys will have to visit and fix, till tomm evening. And at the end of every conversation that stupid woman asks if I am satisfied with the service, i mean, is it supposed to be a joke, of course i don't give a fuck about the company, just get my goddamn line connected.  Neways, I plan to get a cell, though am not sure if I will use it or not. But thought WTF, its been two yrs since I am in US, might as well get connected with some old buds.   Lost in the intramural volleyball finals today for second consecutive year. Maybe we should borrow the 'chokers' tag from ganguly and co.  Sometimes I feel what am I doing here? When I should really be with people I love. Is it worth it all? I don't know, hopefully one day I will have an answer .  They are playing the song 'Turn me On' by Kevin Lyttle right now on TV. Babi, I miss you so much when I hear this song. I always think of our night in the Hawaiian Shack ;-)Had so much fun that night!!                              1) Real Madrid signing of Michael Owen. Dude, they have a 'Michigan 1902-point a minute' offense, maybe even better. And thank god for Carlos Queiroz's ass being hauled out of Santiago Bernabeu. Pathetic man lived up to his expectations and thanks for giving us such a disappointing season. And while I am at it, can the price of their jerseys go a bit down. 80 euros is way too much.  2) Cramps galore at frisbee yesterday. Was about 14 c yesterday evening. So much so for the 2 months of summer. People played without drinking water and fell down with cramps. Luckily for me I sweated and that is a good indication that I need to drink water. But its awesome, you just never get tired till you stop.  3) For people cooking okra off frozen packs and pissed with the sticky vegetable due to the wet okra after thawing, here is a tip. Put potato in, that absorbs all the stickiness and tastes great and the okra stays nice and crisp. Plus the quantity increases!! Everyone knows how deceitful okra is. 500gms is sufficent for exactly 2 people!!  4)Normal is boring- So do something different today. Like take a diff route back home. If it doesn't work well, you can always blame it on Friday the 13.            \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
