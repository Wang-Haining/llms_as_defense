There is one who does know the road ahead, who knows the smooth downhill runs, the tight corners, the holes in the road, the slicks, the breakdowns, the beautiful vistas, the roads of rain and storm.  God.  He knows it cos he planned it.  So where is this particular part of my journey planning to be heading - along the road through the bible - each night I read the bible - I started 10th Jan 2004 and resolved to read every night and is so doing 365 days later end up having read the whole bible. Not cover to cover - I am not that sort of a traveller - no, I get bored of the one place easily and so I flit from place to place, person to person, book to book - I am following a reading plan outlined in the book - live like a jesus freak - when I read it I realised that I wanted to live a life more full on for God - and I knew that if I want to be on that journey then I needed to be close to God and to be close to God I need to be reading.  Up until now I have not missed a single night. Which surprises me - but when I started this journey I knew it would be a one day at a time journey and I asked God to help me - to help me to take the next step in the journey even when I didn't want to, even when I just took the step for the sake of taking the step - even when I didn't want to listen to God, let along speak with him.  And God has honoured my resolve by granting me YES to all those things - and so often I have found that when I do have a day when I set out on the next part of the journey reluctantly, hesitantly, like a dog sitting down and being dragged along - they have been the most special journey's of all.  So let's now set out together - I have been traveling dark paths in my journey of late - but I have decided to keep a travelogue, a diary of my journey through the bible and how it impacts on the bigger journey of my life.                      You brood of vipers!   Last Sunday Andrew Palmer referred to this passage and made the call that John The Baptist was a nutter - well, as a Baptist, he is in very good company - but yeah, I can see Andrew's point - the man looked like a nutter and said nutty things - and yet - that was only the appearance cos in this nutter God was doing a very very special thing - he was getting everything ready for His son to get about doing the Job He came to earth to do.  I love the detail that Luke goes into in his book - his detail to help pin point the time when the events occurred - and with just four little word ' so it was thought,' he begins to chart the male side of Jesus' family all the way back to God - along the way showing the great heritage of Jesus - well, so it was thought anyway - cos of course he wasn't the son of Joseph at all. He was, like Adam, the Son of God - but a different, better Son, a life giving Son, a freedom granting Son. A Son of God who - well - he WAS GOD!!! What an outrageous thought, God becoming a man.  Actually it's not outrageous it's very very cool :D  He knows what it is like to be human - he knows the feeling of betrayal and abandonment - and He knows for real what it means to be forsaken by God. And he knows what happens when we die - and He is Alive today :D And He loves each one of us dearly enough to die for us.  Things like that - they are the things I wished filled my heart, filled my head - filled me so full that they just burst out, exploded into the world around me - I read this the other night - Philippians 4:4,5 from The Message [love the passion in that translation]  Celebrate God all day, every day. I mean,   revel    in him! Make it as clear as you canto all you meet that you're on their side, working with them and not against them. Help them to see that the Master is about to arrive. He could show up any minute!  - I got a LONG way to go, a long way. But with Jesus on my side - He can do it, even when I can't.          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
