I listen to it when I am alone in my car, I secretly watch CMT late at night with the volume down, and I fantasize about cowboys. I grew up listening to country music because both my parents listened to it. I could sing every word to Tim McGraw's 'Don't Take the Girl' and absolutely loved anything by Garth Brooks or John Michael Montgomery. My first concert was Joe Duffy at Cheyenne Frontier Days, my second, third, and fourth were John Michael Montgomery, Jo Dee Messina and George Strait. It's probably my Wyoming upraising but whenever I feel depressed I switch to a country music station...since no one reads this, I guess my secret is safe.  I think that I am the type of person who will end up cheating on their spouse, boyfriend, whatever. I read  urlLink this  blog quite often and am completely enthralled and captivated by the lifestyle.  I think it would be thrilling and exciting having two lovers who have no idea about eachother. I don't see anything wrong with it. I suppose that could be a problem in the future.                           urlLink    Just downloaded that Hello photo hosting program so this picture is really just a test to see if it works, will probably be deleted tomorrow. Thought I would show all my adoring fans my killer tan line in the first photo. It's hot. Guess that's what I get for opting out of the nude beach though. And, if you're wondering, its all natural baby. No tanning salons for me. I promise. My family seriously spends just about every weekend at the lake. Nothing but natural-melanoma-causing UV rays for this gal. Mmm hmm.  Damn straight.   Anyway, watched John Kerry's nomination acceptance speech tonight. Suffice it to say that I was thoroughly impressed and captivated. He hit a home-run, as one of the news commentators aptly put it.  He'll make a great president, god willing he gets elected.  I won't be old enough to vote, so my fingers are crossed.   Have acquired strange obsession with making hemp bracelets and necklaces, bordering on compulsive behavior. Made probably 15-20 today.  I am wearing 8 as I type this.  Is that neurotic?   I wanted to say a quick hello to my newest online acquaintance, Sarah Beara, who may be the sole reader of this blog.  This may sound pitiful, but you made my day by posting a comment.  So, thanks in that regard.                       I finally organized all my CDs tonight...or excuse me, I guess it would be this morning.&nbsp; It took me about an hour and a half to do it.&nbsp; Granted I was sitting on the couch in front of the TV watching VH1 while doing it so that probably was a little distracting.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am really embarassed about some of the CDs I own and hope they never ever see the light of day again.&nbsp; Why did I ever waste my money on that crap?&nbsp; I mean, LFO, come on was that worth 15 bucks?&nbsp; Destiny's Child?&nbsp; In retrospect, I don't think so.&nbsp;  I was hoping to have the house all to myself this weekend due to my step-brother's soccer tournament in Steamboat.&nbsp; But, I guess it was decided that nobody else is going with&nbsp;my step-mom&nbsp;and Cam.&nbsp; I could have used a little alone time.&nbsp; Just me and the dogs.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; I really like my alone time.&nbsp; And I never get any of it other than when I am driving in my car to wherever.&nbsp; Sometimes I would much rather spend time with myself than with other people.&nbsp; Does that make me anti-social?&nbsp; I don't think so because I really do like talking with my friends it's just I am not the type of person who absolutely has to have their friends around at all times.&nbsp; Does that make me a loner?&nbsp; Maybe, but thats ok.&nbsp; I have the best friend anyone could ever ask for and some other pretty good friends too.&nbsp; That's all I need.&nbsp;                         I love Journey.&nbsp; They were a great band.&nbsp; So I sat here for 8 minutes trying to think of something to write.&nbsp; It's not that I don't have things to write about it is just that there is so much that I want to get out it feels overwhelming.&nbsp; I mean, where do I start...the death of my mom, my non-relationship with my step-mom, Sarah, depression, wanting to just leave, college, my feelings, politics, unemployment, love, lack of love, goals, hopes, dreams, feeling unfulfilled and unappreciated.&nbsp; Which of those holds precedence over another.&nbsp; Where do I start? Do I really want to express myself on all of those subjects? Or will that just end up being too hard and ultimately causing more pain than it was worth? Is it better to keep things inside like I have been doing for the past 17 years, or do I start wearing them on my sleeve?&nbsp; I feel like I am walking on a bridge of glass...at any moment everything is going&nbsp;shatter beneath my feet&nbsp;and I will just fall.&nbsp; I think I am only trying to protect myself when I don't express myself.&nbsp; I don't want to get hurt and telling the truth about how I feel could do that.&nbsp; I don't want to write anymore, maybe later.                            I have this  huge  craving for Chinese food right now. If it weren't 2:16 in the AM I would go satisfy my craving, but I can't and I'm pissed because I want me some egg rolls and Kung Pao Beef NOW! Hell.  I had the most exciting day, oh wait I must be confusing my life with someone else's again. Sorry about that. Actually, the day wasn't too bad. Went to the lake, rode some jet skis, sat in a chair on the beach, forgot the sunscreen, have weird sunburn on back of hand. Might take picture of it and post it tomorrow.  I love my dogs more than I love most people. I think it is so cool that Caly's only job in the entire world is to hang out with my other dog, Zeus. Zeus and Caly are what psychologists mean when they talk about unconditional love. I mean, I will go outside for literally less than a minute yet when I walk back in the house they are ecstatic to see me, like it has been a lifetime since I left them. They're always at my foot or hand, waiting to be petted and stroked, played with and talked to. Zeus' huge blocky head and his overgrown puppy body. Caly's paw scratching at you and her ears perked up to hang on your every word. Even though I am sure they don't, it seems like the understand me in ways no human ever could. They keep me company when I'm watching TV, they protect me from the UPS man, they scare away the airplanes by howling at them, and they are forever my afternoon nap buddies. I can honestly say that I wish I was more like my dogs, providing unbridled love and unconditional friendship to whoever gives them a good belly scratch.                        I have come to the realization that I was born into a family that has a difficult time saying 'I Love You,' and consequently I can't help but feeling unloved or unwanted at times. Who would think that three of the shortest and most simple words in the english language are some of the hardest to say. I know that my parents love me, or I know my dad does, but it's hard to feel loved when they never say it. The last time I heard it was when I was in a car accident about a month and a half ago. So, does it take something like that to happen for them to come out and say it? It hurts. Because, their shortcoming has become my shortcoming and I hate it. I wish I could say it, but I don't know how or when. I am always afraid it will come out wrong or sound stupid. I can't wait to have kids so I can smother them with the very thing I want most right now. I am going to be the parent mine never were to me. I am going to make them the center of my universe. My kids will be the one thing I will not screw up...I am making that promise to myself and them right now.           \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
