  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic:\n\n       because i have musical practice every day and i don't see some of my best friends too much during the summer, i thought i'd give a little shout out to five of my favorite girls.  ashley: ah! have we seriously only seen eachother just a few times this summer! that sucks so much. but we'll be together at teen power camp that that'll be fun. it'll be like the youth summit all over again, lol! i can't wait! well, i hope everything's going well with your new boy! keep me posted!  adryan: i'm glad we got to get together to go see the notebook...(even though you didn't cry because you have NO SOUL! haha) anyway-i'm glad you, leslie, and taylor had a good time in indy but i'm still really pissed that i couldn't go! but yeah, we've gotta hang out more this summer and we've also gotta keep burnin cd's for eachother!  jessie: omg i hate that i don't see you every day like i did last summer. i am SO glad that you introduced me to ashley and kim because they're awesome and the four of us get along really well. (prolly because we're all like the exact same person, lol). it sucks that i didn't get to go to holiday world with you guys, but we've all gotta hang out again soon!  courtney: it is so awesome that we have taken the time to go see some really awesome movies together this summer. 'if you can dodge traffic, you can dodge a dodgeball!' lol. we also got to meet some really cool people too, lmao. well, i can't wait til you're parents go out of town...PARTAY!!  nicole: where the hell are you?! i miss you SO much! we had a blast going on a mad hunt for sweatpants and watching that documentary together, haha! i really hope that you come see the show, and tell greggy i said hey!!                   yes that's right. exactly one week until i turn 17...yay! that really means nothing considering i already get into R rated movies, but hey, its one year closer to being 18, so yeah.   SO, since i have such awesome friends who i know are going to get me wonderful presents, i thought i'd share with you my birthday wishlist.  -Dirty Dancing 2: Havana Nights on DVD -Cinderella Story soundtrack -Beauty and the Beast Broadway soundtrack -a new cell phone (don't worry. mommy and daddy will take care of that!) -Thoroughly Modern Millie Song book -the new Dashboard Confessional CD -Maroon 5 live DVD -Maroon 5 poster -Orlando Bloom poster -A Britney Spears T-Shirt -Britney Spears live DVD -a new non digital camera (that's all mom and dad, too)  i'm sure there are more things, but i can't really think of them right now. i'm also really excited about back to school shopping for both clothes and shoes and also fun things for school, like stuff for my locker (haha yeah, i'm still stuck in middle school) and my super packs of sharpies that my sister's gonna get me.   my mom is in this online book/dvd club and she got 5 new dvds for free today. we got I Am Sam, The Wizard of Oz, The Color Purple, The Pianst, and Love Actually. i am very excited to watch all of them.  well, i decided to stay home tonight since i'm still feeling pretty yucky and i'm extremely tired. i'm gonna go and watch some of our new movies and i also rented Ned Kelly, with my boy Orlando Bloom in it and also Heath Ledger. later ya'll!                 well, today/tonight was fun. i woke up at about 10 and went out to ashley's and i helped her take her 4H projects out to the fair. that was an experience, lol. she had a cake and a pie in my backseat, and me, being the idiot that i am, throw my purse into the backseat, and where does it land? right on top of her pie. yeah, she was freaking out and so was i, but the pie was fine and she got 2 first places so there ya go!  so after a fun day of 4H, we went out to lunch and to target with dee and chris neidhammer and that was fun. we saw jon hight in north park and yelled at him, and chris hit his mom in the head with the back door of their SUV, which was hillarious.   then we went to our own houses for awhile, took showers and headed out to the east side. our first stop was to best buy to visit ray, then we headed to kevin's house to pick him up for the st. ben's summer social. we hung out there and talked to him for awhile, then went and picked up logan, the crazy cross-dresser from teenpower camp. we went to the social for awhile, and didn't really do much but people watch and get stared at. so after a great time there, we left and went to mc donald's. then, one of the guys' friends ben showed up and we went crusin around in his mom's mini-van, which was awesome. we drove by showplace and saw our good buddy, ben from camp. we stopped at a really bad party, then went back to kevin's for awhile, then headed home. what a night!  i have already seen 'the notebook.' but since ray is so awesome, we are going to see it again tomorrow and i am SO excited!                 atleast once every winter i get deathly sick. well, this winter i was lucky, and while everyone else was hacking and sneezing and blowing their noses non stop, i was perfectly healthy. well, i'm not so lucky now. i wouldn't say that i'm deathly sick, but i am sick. watery eyes, running nose, disgusting cough, man-ish voice. i've got it all. and the day before the john mayer/maroon 5 concert! damn. oh well. i know that seeing all my favorite boys will make me feel much better.   my mom went into her office today to get some stuff done before the school year starts, and she got my schedule for me. i've got communications/broadcasting, sociology/psychology, AP english, concert choir, etymology, 1 semester of algebra 1 (ha!), algebra 2, and psychics. AND my homeroom number is different, so i'm thinking that i don't have good ole' mrs. blemker anymore. that would truely be a shame.   well, i have a very busy evening of laying around and watching movies ahead of me, so i'm outta here.                 i thought tonight's practice wouldn't be that bad because we just did musical numbers in the second act, but it was pretty rough. although the dance to 'brotherhood of man' is SO fun and joe and i have a fabulous time shakin our tailfeathers, the song itself pretty much makes me wanna cry. we don't ever sing the right words, and never get the prases right and it takes like 20 minutes just to get through it. YUCK!...plus there is that other thing about it that makes me wanna throw something, but i'll just stop talking about it now.  tomorrow's the big sleep over, lol. woo! not too excited about waking up the next morning to be at the centre at 7am though. BUT i'm a drop girl w/ leann (my twin, lol) for the third year in a row so that makes me VERY happy. (ps-the drop girls are totally leann's favorite!)  courtney and i are going to see the notebook on friday!...yay!  when my pass came in you dropped the ball it didn't change the way i feel and i was wishing i'd break down your wall the kiss will know if lips stay still there is a line i crossed and when you missed i lost i'm not a loser don't you know that i'll be back again my dear, i went for the steal maybe it was rushed oh, my crush, i've got a crush i suppose that i could hold it in but you excite my every cell sources say that senses are your friends my senses say that i should tell you that i'm not ashamed you might just feel the same but i have to try it if you're ever really gonna know my dear, i went for the steal maybe it was rushed oh, my crush, i've gotta crush i want to i need to i have to have you you're so much to touch you're too much and i can't control it-you've got me all over the road my dear, i went for the steal  maybe it was rushed oh, my crush damaging my soul you blew me off, but i don't mind i just get better with time and so do you so do you my crush -gavin degraw 'crush'         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
