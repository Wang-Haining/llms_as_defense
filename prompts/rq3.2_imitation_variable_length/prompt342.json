Exercise wise, i am mainly going to use the gym downstairs i've been using it off and on and there is a pool as well but i'm not really comfortable swimming just yet and there is the small problem that i need new swimmers so maybe once thats resolved i'll start swimming as well. I've also started a food plan, and might start an exercise plan as well, as maybe i will stick to it more if i set it out and i think as long as i exercise more and eat less i should be doing ok.  Seems i don't really want to list my weight for the whole world to see just at the moment :) i'll just say my goal weight for the moment is 70 kilos (165.5 pounds) and i'll reasess from there, but i remember i was that when i was in Israel and i was pretty happy with how i looked so...Good Luck to me and Leslie and Aleta and anyone else that joins!                        Since Leslie threatened in her last post to come over us if we don't post, I think I'd better get in gear! ;)  Maybe you read my post about this topic at the jix message board. About one month ago I got serious back problems. It hurt so bad that I had to see an orthopaedist. Thankfully, it's not what I was afraid of (arthrosis), only cramped muscles and a lack of muscles in my back and tummy. The doctor said I had to build up more muscles, so I finally gave in and signed up with a fitness center, though I hate to go to the Mucki-Bude (muscle-hut), as we call it here. Ever since then I've been a very diligent girl. I do my workout three times a week (otherwise my back will drive me crazy).   About two month ago I made the solution to improve my health and change my lifestyle. Of course it had a lot to do with the fact that I needed to lose about 23 kg ... So far, I lost about 4 kg, +/- 500g, it changes from day to day. There has been no significant weight loss since I joined the fitness center, but I seemed to have turned fat into muscles. When I started, I had 42 % fat on my bones, now it's only 39,5%.   This week, I'm doing really poor with my new eating habits. I am supposed to have a week of vacation, but in fact I'm back to the office at least once a day for 2-5 hours (long story!). I'm so frustrated about that that I eat whatever I can lay my hands on. I hope I'll be back on schedule when I start working again next week. Unfortunately, all my good solutions are gone as soon as I am under pressure. Does anyone know what to do about pressure-eating-attacks?                        Well i had a great week food wise, i'm really enjoying the food plan setup where i can just follow it, and for the first time in my life i'm really following it measuring everything etc but i didn't do any exercise at all this week, have had bad cramping and felt horrible so decided to just eat right this week and get into the exercise next week but i still had a pretty good week and i'm happy with myself.  Highs:  Highs for the week for me are that i lost 2.5kilos (5.50pounds) :) Yay!!!  Lows:  No exercise and Andrew came home with a chocolate for me (so sweet and obviously i couldn't hurt his feelings by not eating it *G*)  Aims:  Mum is coming down for a week on Thursday so my aim is to stick to the food plan while she is here and not eat out to much and also to still exercise.  Thats about it for me, have to decide what to do for Easter cos i want my eggs :) which is ok but when we drive home (8 hour drive) we always have junkfood to eat, and because i'm so bored i constantly eat in the car...have to find something a little more healthy but still yumm!  Hope everyone elses weeks have been good, i like the comment option now to Leslie by the way and hope your back is feeling better Aleta, more so for your trip :)                        I have company for the next week.  My thin, curvy sister and her lanky fiance are staying with my thin, muscular husband and myself.  *sigh*  I'm determined to still get into the gym a few times, but it's going to be sketchy while they're here.  The past two days, my eating habits have gone to hell.     Exercise:   Spent three hours in the gym last Wednesday.  Spent Thursday being very, very sore.  Friday did the 'Flight of the BumbleBee' cleaning exercise, which includes me running up and down my stairs cursing violently at how messy Ralph and I are.  It WAS aerobic, though.  Saturday was spent wandering around Sea World for 7 hours.  I'm hoping I managed to get enough exercise that I at least made up for not going to the gym yesterday or today.     Eating:   Very, very badly.  I'm consuming a lot of junk that's just not good for me because the kids have brought it into our home and I am weak.  :(  This week will be better.  I hope.  Still ignoring the numbers and trying to keep an eye on how my clothes are fitting and how I'm feeling.                          Well I haven't really done all that well this week....though I have been taking vitamins and I have drank more water than I usually do (but not the 20 oz that I was hoping for). I haven't excercised at all this week, but I have a *very* good excuse. Last Saturday I woke up with what I thought was allergies (allergy season is well upon us). Well I got worse as the day went on, and I finally thought...'hmm' So I took my tempature....yep, I was running a fever. Continued to run one on Sunday as well. And of course once I have a head cold it travels into my lungs.... When that happens, I don't dare try to exercise because I start coughing like crazy, and start feeling really sick. At least this time, it doesn't seem to have hit my lungs too hard....I still remember one time when I got really sick, was out of work for a week, and then tried to excersice about 3 weeks later and still got sick again! ACK! I think that time it took 2 months before I could truly excerise again....I think tomorrow morning I am going to try to do some stretching type excercises, so that I am doing something, but that its not too much for my body.                         First the bad news - we had pizza at work tonight because all the schools had graduation and everybody was working, and I had four slices. (Two Hawaiian, two Philly cheesesteak)  But this morning, I got up at 7:30 and went running in the park. With my 200/30 run/walk ratio, I made it 2.5 MILES! Even better, I covered more ground in the first few sets than I had in the same number of counts yesterday AND my legs feel great. :) So for the rest of the month, I plan to work my way up to four miles (three loops) at the 200/30 ratio. Then I can spend July increasing the run/walk ratio until I'm running the whole thing by the end of July. :D (That would be about 20 miles a week.) My long-range running goal is a marathon in a nearby city held in mid-April. I figure I need to be running about 35 miles a week for about a month by the end of the year so I have the base to start training for the marathon in January. That would be three days running either three or four miles, two days running eight miles and one running 10 miles.  *pause to work out schedule* Actually, barring injury, I should be able to have two months of training at that level (November and December) before I need to start building up for the marathon. So that's my next big goal. And if I eat reasonably well, which I'll need to do to have the fuel to handle the running, I figure my weight will take care of itself. (The less you weigh, the faster you run. The faster you run, the more calories you burn both while running and at rest. It's all good. *G*)         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
