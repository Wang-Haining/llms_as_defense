These includes some of my film reference books -- some of which are better than others.  But one of them came back to Baltimore with me --  urlLink The Great Movie Stars: The International Years  by David Shipman.  It's another great biographical dictionary of movie stars.  Sadly, it does not include lists of films (as The MGM Stock Company did), but it covers a wide variety of actors and actresses from the late '40s through 1972.  And it includes a lot of international stars (hence the name!), many of whom I have never heard of.    It's got lots of pictures, and best of all, entries on people like  urlLink Tab Hunter ,  urlLink Terry-Thomas , and  urlLink Laurence Harvey .  Quality!  I remember when I bought -- it was in Lansing, MI at a bookstore during the mid-1990s.  I didn't have enough money to buy both volumes, so I decided to get the second one.  I don't know what led me to buy it -- but I'm glad I did.  I've read lots of books on golden age Hollywood stars, but not so many on the stars of the later years.  And I will eventually track down a copy of  urlLink The Great Movie Stars: The Golden Years !              I just finished reading a biography about Judy Garland, aptly titled  urlLink Get Happy: The Life of Judy Garland .  Now, I knew that Garland had a fairly messed up life.  Anyone who has five husbands has got to be troubled (just look at Zsa Zsa Gabor, Elizabeth Taylor, and the current star heading that way, J-Lo), but I didn't realize the depth of her problems.  The book is a quick read -- despite its 500+ pages, I managed to read it in an evening.  It just reveals so much about Garland, but doesn't seem to verify any of the details.  The author has extensive footnoting, an enormous bibliography (including several books I've read!), and a large list of people that he has interviewed in order to write the book, but it didn't seem to ring very true with me as I was reading it.  I believe the general outlines of his work -- Garland was so troubled, and her childhood problems with her closeted gay father and her demanding mother must have created some of the issues she had with sex.    I read a  urlLink biography  of Garland years ago -- back when I became an old movie fan -- and I remember feeling sorry for Garland.  Her life story made me cry.  But now, over ten years later, I don't have as much sympathy for her.  Her life was awful, yes.  She was controlled with pills given to her by her boss L.B. Mayer and her mother.  But it seems as though she never really took responsibility for very long.  She reinvented herself, became Judy Garland III and conquered the stage -- but it never lasted long enough.  She seems to fit the stereotype of the old Romantic poets -- they had to die young, or else they would become irrelevant.  Garland had to have drama in her life or else it wasn't worth living.            I recently read a really interesting book all about the studio system.   urlLink The Genius of the System: Hollywood Filmmaking in the Studio Era  by Thomas Schatz was fascinating.  I was familiar with the studio era -- the so-called “Golden Era” of filmmaking from the 20s through the late 40s and early 50s – but I really only knew one studio, MGM.  And of course, my favorite studio executive,  urlLink Irving Thalberg , who was really cute.  But this book opened my eyes to more than just MGM -- there was Warner Brothers, RKO, David O. Selznick, etc.  It seems like Irving was probably the most skilled at working the studio system in order to get quality product out of it, but he was not the only person capable of running the studio.    The book covers the filmmaking process in parts, but definitely looks at it from more of a business perspective.  I had never really thought of filmmaking as a business before.  Obviously, there is the obsession with box-office grosses now, but first and foremost, I think of filmmaking as a kind of art.  But apparently that is more of a modern idea -- I believe it came from the idea of the director as auteur and sole creator of a film.  After reading this book, I realized that there is definitely a lot of input and restrictions and advice by others than appears on the surface.  I don’t know that this book would be a good read if you weren’t interested in the business aspect of filmmaking, or wanted a more in-depth look at the mechanics behind the stars, but I found it very interesting.  It seems rare to have a look at the moguls who financed and made the mechanics of filmmaking work.  But if you agree that Irving Thalberg is cute, I would suggest reading this.  It shows that he was both a cute creative guy with a shrewd sense of business.            Summer is the best time to watch old movies.  There isn’t really anything on TV, except reruns.  Since I saw the shows I like the first time, I really only watch reruns of crime shows like Law and Order or Without a Trace.  But honestly, I don’t need an excuse to watch old movies.  It’s just a good reasoning -- especially since I don’t have cable.  And tonight I got to watch another Van Johnson movie.  Yes, my curiosity in this popular 1940s/1950s movie star has spread, and I’ve got a couple people supplying me with his movies.   urlLink Two Girls and a Sailor  was actually Johnson’s first top billing movie -- as well as Gloria DeHaven and June Allyson’s first big parts.  It’s a pretty fluffy story about two female musicians.  The Deyo Sisters – Patsy (Allyson) and Jean (DeHaven) – have an act at a club in what I am going to assume is California during WWII.  So the rather thin plot is stretched out by a lot of performances by other musicians and singers, including Lena Horne, Jimmy Durante (who is surprisingly funny!), Gracie Allen, and several orchestras.    The story – albeit thin – is pretty good, but standard.  Jean and Patsy have their nightclub act, but after hours, they run a canteen for servicemen in their home.  How they manage to afford to supply all the sailors and soldiers with sandwiches and pop is never quite clear, but taking into consideration the size of their apartment, they must be making pretty good money at the club.  Jean is the cuter sister and has an admirer who keeps sending her orchids.  One night they are inviting young men to their canteen and Jean gets to invite a sailor (Johnson) to the canteen.  He isn’t known by his name -- he's mostly just “Hey Sailor.”  The girls sing and get to know the sailor and another soldier, Frank (Tom Drake).  These are the two rivals for Jean’s affections, but Patsy seems to like the sailor too.  What will happen?  The girls mention that they wished they had the warehouse across the street from their apartment, and the next day someone shows up at their door with the keys and the deed.  'Someone' has decided that the Deyo Sisters deserve to get what they wish for -- but who is this 'someone?'  The sisters explore the warehouse, which turns out not to be haunted by ghosts, but rather by Billy Kidd (Durante) who they used to tour with as children.  And this isn’t an ordinary warehouse -- it's a theatrical warehouse which makes it so much easier to clean up and transform into a spectacular nightclub/canteen.  (It’s an MGM musical, so I didn’t expect any realism.)  Jean continues to get on well with the sailor, much to the dismay of Patsy.  She even ends up having a dream about it.  It’s a pretty standard dream sequence, although the sailor shows up in an admiral’s uniform, complete with enormous epaulets.  The most memorable part of the dream is the catfight between sisters over the sailor.  Seriously girls, is he really worth fighting over?  The next morning Billy manages to overhear one of the assistants with the club’s overhauling mention that 'someone' can afford to pay extra -- it's J. Dykeman Brown who is paying for this!  He tells Patsy, who manages to track down J. Dykeman Brown, who is old enough to be Jean’s grandfather!  It turns out that he’s J. Dukeman Brown, and there’s a J. Dykeman Brown II, and finally, J. Dykeman Brown the Third -- the sailor!  Johnny has been hiding a secret -- he's worth sixty million dollars!  Patsy, of course, is heartbroken, so the oldest J. Dykeman Brown comforts her by saying 'At your age I wouldn’t have fallen in love with your sister.'  The nightclub opens again, complete with a plethora of musical numbers.  Patsy reveals to Jean 'someone’s' real identity, and she is more happy with his cash than with him.  Jean decides to leave to do a single act in Buffalo, but before leaving, the Deyo Sisters need to do one last act together.  Jean realizes that she really doesn’t love Johnny -- she's in love with the Texan soldier Frank who calls her ma’am.  (It really is adorable.)  She’s going to move to Texas and raise onions with him.  Yay.  So Johnny is left for Jean to have -- and he’s realized that he’s in love with her, not Jean.  All the couples are complete, so all that’s left is for the final big number.  Two Girls and a Sailor is pretty chintzy and predictable, but I enjoyed it.  They don’t make movies like this anymore -- musicals like this have gone out of vogue, and nightclubs like the one portrayed in the movie don’t seem to exist any more.  It’s a nice look at an era gone by.    \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
