  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic:\n\n                 I wanna fall in love, real love, with someone who wants to fall in love with me. I wanna wake up in the morning thinking about someone and go to bed knowing there thinking of me. I wanna laugh, and cry with someone all in the same day. I wanna know that this person is here for me, and wants to see and be with me. I wanna spend my time with him playing, talking, sleeping, anything as long as i was with him and it was right. I wanna walk with him, and have him hold my hand, and be happy. I wanna be happy. I wanna light up when i see his name on the caller id just to sit and talk to him for hours about nothing. I wanna be able to have some where to go, and always have somthing to do. I wanna fight with him just to make up seconds later. I wanna be able to make him a promise and no i wont break it. I wanna have nothing, but feel like i have everything. I wanna get a phone call from him just becasue he wanted to tell me he was thikning about me and that he loved me. I wanna dream about him and wake up and have him tell me he drempt about me. I wanna no he fells the same way. I dont wanna care what everyone else thinks. I dont wanna have to question what i feel for him. I dont wanna cry my self to sleep. I dont wanna hurt him. I dont wanna be hurt. I dont wanna be afraid of what tomorrows ganna bring. I dont wanna look at someone else and second guess what i have. Mick Jagger said it best, 'You cant always get watcha want, but if you try sometimes, you just might find, you get watcha need...' and everyone needs to be loved like that. Some people may not show it but we all want it, we all need it. Its what makes the world go round. But i guess, the only thing i can do is wait, just sit and wait. Wait for ones to come and go, wait for the day, that i realize, that ive found that person, and that im in love. I can count the minuts, i can count the hours, i can count the days, i can count the years, but it wont make it come any faster. So like i said, i guess ill just wait....      \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
