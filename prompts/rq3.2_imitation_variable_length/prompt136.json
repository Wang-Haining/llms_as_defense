I think about Dustin Hoffman in the Graduate driving over that bridge (going the wrong way if&nbsp; you watch closely).&nbsp; It's like the top of the empire state building to me, or alcatraz, or just one of those places that makes you feel like you're somewhere special. Driving back late last night the fog was so thick I couldn't see the lights above me&nbsp;on the bridge. It was weird, the bridge that went to nowhere, me just suspended in the cloud on a floating highway. I had to turn on my windshields because the fog was actually tangible.&nbsp; When I finally did reach the city, I got to drive through the city almost uninterested, and I had that weird famous feeling like I own this place.&nbsp;   My feeling going the other way on the bay bridge is totally different. Traffic was at a standstill yesterday, and it took an hour and a half from my house to Emeryville. It took almost 30 minutes to get from Battery and California to the bridge.&nbsp;Once I do get&nbsp;to the bridge&nbsp;my disaster thoughts kick in, I suppose because I'm&nbsp;on the lower level, and I think about the guy who died a few months ago when a section of the bay bridge collapsed on his car, or about earthquakes and the bridge after the top portion collapsed in '89. I try to drive fast on the lower level. Just get me safely to land with no hovering highway above me. But on the way back, I drive slow.                    Hey Bloggers. I made a song for Kelly yesterday:  Blog blog blog, blog blog baran. Went to a dance lookin for a man saw blog baran and I knew I had a chance. Blog blog baran. Blog Ba-raaan! Please take my ha-aaand. That is for you Kelly. I know it's not as awesome as you singing I Touch Myself to all of Jens coworkers, but I think it is pretty good.   My new song for myself is 'ebay is addictive/ the best part is/ when the money flows in/ the worst part is/ packaging and sending and all the details / but i think / it is educating  me/ about having a business / with only $8 overhead for the envelopes I bought/ and it makes me think of things/ like how to ship blazers or cheesy craft kits / lalalalala'  I consider this my experience to help me thrive in my HBS class. I will be able to raise my hand during a case review and say 'well on ebay i learned that shipping and handling are a pain in the butt and you need to charge more for that because I forgot to add the price of packaging.' Life is one big classroom isnt it.  I tried Pho last night. Viet remember how it took me a couple sushi tries to really embrace it? I liked what I tasted so far and I know Pho will continue to grow on me. I like beef, I like soup, I like noodles, and I like you, so I know Pho will soon be on my list of things I am craving.    Tomorrow is Friday and Jeans day! Viet and I might try to get a seat at Slanted Door. Or at least sit at the bar and have some cocktails.   Tonight I'm just gonna take pictures of things to post for those suckas on ebay.                      I'm venturing into the eBay world, but I'm not sure it is for me. I'm very enticed by the cash, even though nothing I'm posting should sell for more than a few dollars, but I kinda like all the things I have. I have books I've never read and will never read, but I like to have them there, maybe one day some one will want to borrow one or something. But then I think cash cash. It could add up...I'm still not sure though if I signed up for paypal right and if the money will ever get to me. I figured I'd jump right in, soon enough I will figure that out (6 days 2 hours 33 minutes actually). Yep, I'm pretty attached to all my dumb things. We'll see how I feel after my first big sell though (the only To the Lighthouse Audio book CD on ebay!).    So it totally sucks I am the chirpy smily receptionist today. Man never again.  Reception blows! I'm entertaining myself with the ebay world (thanks to brookeandevan), email, IM, little bit of news, and uh, thats it. I've been out of college for three years, haven't I passed the threshold of having to do reception crapola?? Just a moment. Just a moment. Hold please. Just a moment. I'm sorry he's not available, would you like his voicemail? Just a __ ___ moment!!                 So my revelations for this friday. I'll pipe down on the ebay after this, but let me just say, i suck at it. I charged people like $2 for shipping, then they buy something for like $3, but when I go to the post office it costs $5 to ship, not to mention the price of the envelope. So officially I have made $7 on everything I have sold so far. Oh wait, I just spent $11 at the post office, so I am down 4 bucks! After this intro period I'm sure things will pick up. I already went in and jacked up all the s & h costs.   My other revelation is something I've known for a long time, I will go nowhere in this job except maybe down. I mean now I am sorting through old files and listening to these long dumb messages to wait for the person who called number, but then I miss it the first couple times so I listen over and over to messages about tycos earnings and stuff like that. The reason is to call the person back and say please dont call us anymore. Today its feeling like both business ventures are asi asi to mal but at least I'm in the black, right.  Well maybe not in ebay.   But there is lots of good stuff in the world of Celeste. It's gonna be a fun SF weekend even though I don't know what I'm gonna do, hopefully I'll squeeze some movies in though, like Farenheit 911 and Notebook. Maybe they will offset each other as far as cheesieness goes. I think Viet and I are gonna give Slanted Door a shot tonight. I hope to see lots of gay men and women this weekend as well. Kelly just sent me some fish/ man porn, thanks Kell!                  I wish I wrote this essay on summers in Houston, but Susan Choi did.  I will blog further on summers though.      Why had it never occurred to me that summer was for the outdoors, for nature, until I was more than 20 years old? Maybe because it wasn't — not in Houston, where I grew up.  Houston is fantastically unnatural, and its summer is the season for embracing all that is contrived, ameliorative and just plain fake about Houstonian life.  Every domicile is its own organism, smoothly sealed, afloat in a hostile miasma. In Houston, we air-condition all 12 months of the year, but it's in summer that our air-conditioning achieves the stature of art, that it can feel like a gleaming Brancusi or a well-mixed martini. It seems incongruous, but Houston does actually have vast public parks full of plush grass and trees. Why?, I wondered when young. What did one do in such places? Sitting outdoors on a blanket, or risking heatstroke by trying to jog, struck me as a sign of insecurity, the same strivings that led Houstonians to tell visitors how 'culturally vibrant' and 'global' the city was. These were people who didn't want to admit that Houston is an unreasonable city, a 'port' city without a harbor, a 'space' city 900 miles from Cape Canaveral's launching pad. These were people who didn't relish the fact that Houston doesn't make sense.   And so what did we do in the summer, when Houston's senselessness reached its apex? True citizens of our city, my friends and I were drawn to its artificial — by which I mean its most genuine — places. We loved the park at the base of the Transco Tower, with its manmade ponds garishly lighted from within. All of us fell in love, or consummated love, or ended love there, in that fairyland of concrete and electricity that, I realize now, was a rapturously useless elaboration of our city's two most fundamental constituents. We loved the art cinema which after the last show became our own private clubhouse, a dusky balconied cube of cold air. We loved the 24-hour Kroger grocery store and the 24-hour House of Pies. We loved controlled atmospheres of all kinds, because these were the essence of home.  In 1984, the Talking Heads concert film 'Stop Making Sense' came to spend the summer at our art cinema and we loved it, too, and made it our Dionysian summer ritual. 'Stop making sense:' yes, exactly, we thought — we, the children of a city begotten by unscrupulous real-estate speculators on an infernal swamp, the children of a city in which the buildings downtown are connected by air-conditioned tunnels so that no one need venture outdoors. We attended every midnight screening of the movie and then, since we knew him, made the projectionist show it again after the public had left so we could dance ourselves into exhaustion in the carpeted aisles. But I remember one night becoming almost febrile with excitement, and suddenly needing to be alone. I was heading away to college that fall, and I was already overwhelmed by the bewildered homesickness I would suffer my first year away, along with its more brutal flip side: stark disillusionment about the place I'd come from. Perhaps I already sensed that I would never live in my hometown again, or at least, would never want to. In another city, I might have coped with this crisis by going outdoors and gazing at the stars, but in Houston, that wasn't an option. What outdoors? What stars? Our sky was always a strange shade of salmon, light pollution bouncing off air pollution. Instead I crept through an employees-only door that led to the cavern behind the huge screen, and I lay on the dusty floor watching the movie from behind, letting the beams of light that made up David Byrne and his oversized suit stab and shift and pass over me. I remember that moment as one of awful, paradoxically self-annihilating self-consciousness. I also remember it as the end of my summers at home, although there would be more of them; but they would be visits from another world — one where lying outdoors and gazing at stars wouldn't seem like a joke.   For me coming into adulthood was a process of realizing that there is a unviverse that the world of my childhood in Houston had erased. You could call it the stars beyond the smog, or, less romantically, the heat beyond the air-conditioner.  I moved to New York after I finished college, and my first home in the city was a closetless 8-by-10 foot room that got so hot I could have baked bread. And yet one day, sweating it out in that room, I looked out the eighth-story south-facing window and saw an egret gliding east with slow wingbeats along 110th Street, as if there was a subway at that height just for birds. Was I fooling myself to think that New York, as exuberantly artificial as it is in its own way, somehow feels more real than Houston?   The other evening, more than nine years after that first New York moment, I sat in a splendid 19th-century church in Brooklyn and listened to David Byrne singing. There he was, the looming idol of my adolescence, a human-size man in blue jeans with a brush of gray hair, peering at his set list through wire-rimmed glasses, and performing without electric guitars. My life had more than doubled in length since that last Houston summer, when the future seemed to yawn like an empty abyss, while at the same time the present was closing its doors. And yet here I was in an ornate old church that was not air-conditioned, and the night was uncomfortably hot, and I was nine months pregnant — and in tears, I was so wildly happy. Not because life was finally 'real' where before it had been 'fake.' I was in tears because a cherished long-ago summer had unexpectedly meshed with this summer, and produced something new: a broader sense of beauty, perhaps, or perhaps just a span of years brought into focus, in a way that provoked no regret.            \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
