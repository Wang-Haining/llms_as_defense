To see their daughter get a university degree cus his official duties as a dad, with regards to major financial aid anyway, are over. To commemorate this joyous occasion he wanted to take studio shots with me in my graduation garb.  &nbsp;  Included in the package&nbsp;were a series of shots of me alone, me standing against the backdrop of a bookshelf filled with encyclopedias. Yup, just&nbsp;as i suspected they were empty boxes with some fancy schmancy name like&nbsp;  urlLink Britannica  &nbsp;me leaning&nbsp;on a pile of books (i think they were some marketing management and financial accounting titles) and me against a tacky backdrop&nbsp;that appears in everyone's typicall  urlLink studios pictures .  &nbsp;  While&nbsp;the photographer prepared the lighting and film, i&nbsp;had time to notice all the example shots hanging on the walls.&nbsp;How could&nbsp;all these people&nbsp;smile so naturally, or look like they were having the best time of their lives?&nbsp;  &nbsp;  There i was, wearing the hot, oversized grad gown, trying not to move my head too much cus the motar board&nbsp;was too big, perching picariously against a pile of books, trying to feel like i was on top of the world.  &nbsp;   ok, &nbsp;turn your body abit more to the left, lower&nbsp;your shoulders on the right, lift&nbsp;your chin higher, yes yes, now smile, SMILE!!!     &nbsp;   No&nbsp;no, show more teeth,&nbsp;more teeeeeeeeth!!     &nbsp;  I really tried, honest. I kept telling myself that im doing this for my parents, i kept trying to think about a funny story that my friend told me recently that had to do with taking a dump on a traffic island in Singapore...when this last method didnt work i knew i was a goner. I&nbsp;suddenly felt like&nbsp;crossing my eyes and sticking out my tongue when he snapped. But that would just be a waste of my dad's time as he has to go back to decide which shots he wanted to frame and i think he wouldn't wanna show guests&nbsp;that his daughter&nbsp;studied so hard she went berzerk after graduation.  &nbsp;  And when the final product is hung on the wall at home, i'll be glad im not around to see that sheepish, constipated&nbsp;grin i have pasted on my face, but i will be happy that my parents will look at it and smile.                   Ok so i'm about to burst already. Before i really do it physically i felt i had to try to organize things in text so maybe i can put things in better perspective.   1) For the past 2 days, i have received anonymous silent calls to my hk number. the first two at 4.26 and 4.29 am respectively and then this morning, i got one at 9.00.03am. The accuracy at which my mysterious stalker is doing this is uncanny. It's like the person has a whole schedule printed out and would set alarms to carry out action. I half expected to hear heavy breathing each time i pick up but just background noise, like traffic noise. I have only been stalked once and that was someone i knew ( thats another story when im not so pissed) so this time i had to really think about whether i had made any enemies in hk. Then it hit me, it must be associated with someone's ex gf and&nbsp;God knows other gfs for all i know. My well being and safety is more important than fighting someone elses childish battle. If i find out that it i am right, i'm heading straight for the exit.   2) Mr Ego has this bleady way of trying to unload nostalgia on me whenever he's feeling vulnerable or has lost his direction. For a long time, he always claimed that i inspired him and i was his saviour blah blah blah... it's only cus&nbsp;i criticized him the most when everyone just let him live in his deluded world. Even after the relationship ended proper, he would at the most random of times, sms me some new insight he has gotten about us and how he needs me blah blah blah...yeah, at 1.29am i was dozing off into dreamland when the sms came: I  miss you. i'm on absinth.  I'm not&nbsp;familiar with&nbsp;drugs and toxic chemicals that do not have 'vodka', 'scotch' or 'whiskey' on it so for a second i got worried. I nearly got up to check out this thing online and would have called him if my smarter sense told me to f*&^ it cus he has done this to me too many times. Always feeding on my nice attitude towards him.   3) Then today, Mr&nbsp;No Licence&nbsp;suggested we go jetskiing. I was in no mood but i decided to humour him anyway. And i ended up having to drive on a stretch of road that had alot of potential road blocks. Forget getting to the destination&nbsp;in one piece, this ride consisted of no peace given to the poor driver who had to endure snide remarks about her driving...   'When did you get your licence? What?! when u were 18? so you've been driving for 6 years, then by right you should not be making such silly mistakes. If you've been driving a auto car all your life i guess i could forgive you but&nbsp;you drive a manual car. You drive an EG should by right be someone who likes to drive so how come drive like that?'   Miss Boiling Inside:    I drive just fine. I just don't like the pressure you are giving me. It's like going for driving lessons again. If i wanted to learn driving again i will sign up for lessons myself. This is your car so it's extremely difficult for me to be comfortable while driving, somemore you keep throwing criticisms at me of course i can't drive properly. I need to drive and listen to you and try to do every instruction you are sending out. And i don't have this problem in my own car. I drive my EG just fine.    MR No licence:   I'm not criticizing you, it's advice that i think you should follow. Don't you want to improve you're driving? You're just too proud. You can't seem to take advice in the right manner can you?   4) I've become my own worse nightmare. I read his smses while he was parking the car (which of course i refuse to drive by the end of the trip) and found some smses not coming from the ex. They weren't mushy or anything. Just the kind you know that are the  'getting to know you so im being sweet but controlled'  kinda smses. Normally im very controlled and believe in respecting one's privacy but i've done it. No turning back now.   See how i need to burst?      \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
