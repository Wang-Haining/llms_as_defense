The flies have stopped, your Hutsulka solved that mystery. The floors and walls are a tad sticky from all the Helene Curtis spritz hairspray all over, but the bugs are no more. Last night I settled in to watch a movie on cable I had always wanted to see, mainly because when it came out, my mom forbade me to see it: Mommie Dearest. So I'm getting into it, loving the over the top acting and bad wigs, and the doorbell rings at 9:30pm. DH was already doing his Homer Simpson look by that time (in his bvd's and t-shirt), and I was reluctant to answer, but we have a lot of elderly people in our neighbourhood, so I thought maybe something was wrong and someone fell down or something. So all three of us (including Haley, the crazy lab mix) go to the door, DH asks who it is, and it's the grandson of one of our elderly neighbours. DH had loaned him the phone a month or so ago, I wasn't home at that time. DH says hold on, let me get dressed, and I open the door with Haley right next to me. But it's hard for a lab to look intimidating, especially this wimpy dog. I wanted her to growl, like she does with some strangers, but she just stood there with a dopey dog smile on and wagging her tail. So this guy is late 30s, early 40s, and starts rambling on about how his grandmother isn't home and is in Southlake and he got hit by a woman who had no insurance and his electrical system is all blinking and he drove around the corner and his headlight fell out and his wife is in the car, and well, Larry at PepBoys says he can fix it up for $9. I told him that we had no cash, sorry. But then DH goes and gets $9 out his wallet! This is the oldest freakin' story in the book! He said the 'accident' was at Preston and LBJ. Well, what the hell is he doing all the way down in our neighborhood? And PepBoys closes at 9. I was pretty pissed at the DH. I don't want this crackhead coming back asking for more, or breaking into our house for that matter. It was hard for me to go to sleep last night. Then about an hour ago, the DH calls me and tells me he's taking the day off and going to get a shotgun, shells, and rock salt, a la Kill Bill vol. 2. I have never been a big fan of guns, but I am not opposed to this. I am so creeped out now. I am going to go talk to his grandmother and see what the deal is. See what her reaction is when I tell her was around asking for money.             Quite the unremarkable weekend. We went over the B and P's on Saturday and found out P is 6 months pregnant. Which we figured anyway. B told DH that they had some 'big news' to share with us. Well, big news is either you're getting married or preggers. And they got married 4 weeks ago, so...I had no clue she was 6 months along! You couldn't really tell at the wedding at all. Granted, she did have a big poofy Cinderella dress as opposed to my garden drape-style dress, which I had to wear a freakin' corset under because it showed every imperfection. One very funny thing that happened when we were getting the new house tour is P's daughter (from previous relationship) A asked her mom, 'Where are the kids?' We started laughing so hard and told her that our parents are wondering the same thing. This, of course, went over a 5 year old's head. DH got mad at me because I fell asleep at their house around midnight. I had maybe 4 beers, which is nothing for this beer-guzzling Pollack, but I think it's the new medicine I'm on. Last week I had 6 beers and fell asleep at midnight. I finally looked at the bottle yesterday and it said that DO NOT DRINK WITH THIS MEDICATION. WILL CAUSE DROWSINESS AND ENHANCE EFFECT. Damn, they sure don't lie. Well, on the upside, it'll keep me from drinking too many alcohol calories.   urlLink pretty disturbing              ok, i give up. you beat me. i will never learn coding. give me gui any day. this is what happens to you when you choose photography class over tandy 180s or whatever we had in the 7th grade in 1982. i was a major technophobe for a long time. now, i played my fair share of atari games and whatnot, but i never really was interested in trying to make the computer do things. i had a typewriter in college. i only knew two people who had macs. until now. i supposed i could try to learn, and i have figured out the super basics of html, but i will never be able to get this skin to look like how i really want unless i pay someone. i looked through tons of skins on other sites, but nothing really fit. or they didn't have all the features i wanted, or some didn't work and i had no idea how to fix them. so, we shall go with the blogger minima black for now, sans pics because i can't even get stupid hello to work.   it's around lunch time. i should go get something. i will probably treat myself to the delicioso chicken fajita salad at taco cabana. but i won't eat the shell. and i'll take off most of the sour cream. but i will definitely eat all the guac. and put extra pico and cilantro on it. yes, your slightly pudgy pollock is doing the low carb thing again. the way it's become overhyped in the media and our consumer culture in general is truly annoying. this plan  does  work, but you must totally change your eating habits for the  REST OF YOUR LIFE . You cannot go back to eating that whole loaf of rosemary bread at Macaroni Grill. it doesn't work that way, sadly. it creeps back. and you really need to work out at least 4 times a week. i'm writing this more for my own sake, i guess. the ukrainian women told me 10 years ago that pasta and bread will make you fat and i laughed at them. well, look at us now!     \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
