I hated being a child when my mom would complain about not having enough things of luxury like a bigger house, nice new cars, clothing that is ridiculously expensive, and a bunch of oversized flatscreen TV's. I don't understand the human tendencies to spend money on things they don't need and really cant afford and just dig a big hole for themselves in the long run. I know this from experience after watching my parents complain about money troubles all the times yet they were still making impulse buys even tho they were thousands of dollars in debt and had some serious problems which needed to be dealt with first.     When my family was considered middle class or rich we kept on running up bills for things we could not afford, I was really not a very happy child because we were constantly moving into 'nicer houses' which made it hard for me to make friends and my parents were always working to make more and more money which made for a very unhappy child since I was always neglected and a loner (thank god for my computer) and unhappy parents since their lives revolved around work and the only happiness they found was through alcohol (at least for my father).     I just think that too many people try too hard to be someone that their not and really try their best to impress others while never taking the time to make sure they are feeling good about themselves.      One thing that I learn time and time again in my life is everything has got to be balanced or your going to tip over. People need to learn how to balance relationships, finances, fitness, nutrition, work, education, fun, and all those other things that are essential to a persons life.  Anyways I got some things to do (play starcraft and review for finals) so I'm going to get to it. LAAAATE!                      Lately the weeks seem like days, they have just been flying by and I feel like I haven't done anything exciting in a long time. I recently got some new channels that my parents ordered on the TV (Movie Central) and I never used to watch much TV but now I find myself in front of it for hours on end losing track of time slowly becoming a couch potato because these new channels have all the newest movies on and there is always something good to watch. I really got to break this TV watching cycle because I already don't get out enough because of my computer, school, work, and fitness and it makes time fly by so fast that I don't even realize what time it is and I finally get to my homework by 10 PM then I'm to tired and ill put it off to the next day and will give it to my teacher of late marks. Well, I have decided I'm going to try to break the cycle and add this to my list of monthly goals and resist the temptation of sitting on the couch after getting back from school.     I have recently started putting out my resume to get a head start on the whole summer employment thing and am really hoping that I get a job at this grocery store in my community(Especially since ill get a discount on FOOD!!). The reason I need a job is because with my habits of buying expensive protein powders, gym fees, saving so I can finally leave home and gain independence, entertainment(amusement park, movies, ect..), clothes, upgraded/new computer equipment and not getting much money from web design I really need a part time job that pays hourly wages like most people receive.  Well its 6 PM so I'm off to the gym and I promise, no matter what, I wont watch a minute of that dreaded brain melting TV and actually catch up on my homework especially since all my classes are academic this semester.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
