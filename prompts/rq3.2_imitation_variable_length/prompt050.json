I would have enjoyed it had I the chance to sit outside in it but instead I had to work AND THEN sit in the gymnasium of Athena Elementary for Jennifer's band concert.  It was hotter then hell in there!  Her band was surprisingly good; she plays in the concert band and the jazz band.  I have a feeling that since I'm living with my sister and her family that many of my blog posts will at some point sing the praises of my very talented nieces!!!  I was in bed last night by ten and slept in until eight.  I'm fully rested and in a kick ass mood today.  My workday is sort of short today.  I'm here until after lunch; then I go to Montague for the afternoon/early evening.  Since I'm the Provincial Coordinator for the Young Millionaires Program, today I'm going to sit in on the workshops being conducted on the eastern end of the Island.  What is the Young Millionaires Program you might ask? It's basically my main duty of the summer.  I'm the Provincial Coordinator as well as the western queens/eastern prince facilitator.  It's a program designed to assist youth between the ages of 8 to 16 years old discover more about business by teaching them basic business skills and by helping them start their own business for the months of July and August.  The participants attend a series of workshops that cover basic business skills like marketing and record keeping.  When they finish the workshops they submit a business plan for the opportunity to receive up to $100 (non-repayable grant) to start their business.  I think the program is going to make for a real fun summer for me.  Once the workshops are complete, I spend the rest of the summer visiting all the different businesses and setting up opportunities for them to sell their product or market their service.  For instance, we'll set up at the Lobster Carnival Sidewalk Sale and things like that.  I'm thinking of actually making a Young Millionaires blog as another method of communication with the participants.  That way I can also post pictures that I take during the summer, etc.  Anywho, I best get to work!!!    Take care            \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
