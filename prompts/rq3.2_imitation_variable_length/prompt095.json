I mostly bummed around, reading a new book (Reading Lolita in Tehran by Azar Nafisi... I highly recommend it). I also got a chance to see my friend Joey Neugart and his girlfriend Lucy. This weekend has been GREAT so far. On Friday, Somrat, myself, Joey, Lucy, and a bunch of Somrat's Salesforce friends went to see Jamie Cullum perform. He is a young British jazz/pop musician and was an unbelievable performer. You can check out his website at www.jamiecullum.com and see him on David Letterman on June 10. If you get a chance to see this guy in concert you are really in for a treat because he is hilariously funny, has a lot of energy, and plays some great music.  Yesterday we went out to Napa and went to a few wineries. It wasn't even that crowded which was surprising for a Saturday afternoon. Then we came back and visited Somrat's friend Rishik in Berkeley. We went up to the top of the Berkeley hills and took in the great views of the entire Bay Area. I wished I had brought my camera. But, so far I keep forgetting to bring it with me! So now I have at least 2 San Francisco lessons for my trip: wear sunscreen and take my camera!                     It was another fun weekend in San Francisco. On Saturday, Somrat and I went apartment hunting with our friend Gautam, a fellow plan 2 graduate who is moving out here, and then we went to the beach at outer sunset. It was freezing and we dipped our toes in the water for about 2 seconds before running back to Gautam's car. Yesterday we walked all day long. We went out to Golden Gate park for a few hours. Then we walked to the marina for lunch and over to the wharf. On our way back home, we stopped in at the cable car museum which was really fascinating. It is actually the power station for all three cable car lines and it had a bunch of old cable cars and information about how it all works. Evidently in 1947 the city almost put the cable cars out of commission with the advent of city buses. But, the city rallied around the cable cars and they decided to keep them. I am now well-versed in cable car trivia. Did you know the cables have to be replaced once every 70-200 days? Now you do.          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
