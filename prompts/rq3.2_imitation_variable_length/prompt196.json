At any rate,  urlLink this article  pretty much gets at a lot of the problems:  'Fire Hayden Christensen, whose single emotive capacity is sullen petulance, and whose attempts to put on the magisterial rage that must become Darth Vader’s hallmark instead sound like a tenth-grader whose dad won’t let him borrow the car. This is essentially the story of a guy who becomes Space Hitler, which is already hard enough to get people to take seriously without casting a scowly teen.  While you’re at it get rid of Natalie Portman, who as Queen Amidala has all the regal presence of a mallrat shopping at her local Fashion Bug. Keep Samuel Jackson, Frank Oz, Anthony Daniels, and Ian McDiarmid, and thank your lucky stars that you’ve got Christopher Lee, who’s been showcasing his considerable talent in Z-grade horror flicks for decades and knows better than perhaps any living actor how to pull a terrific performance out of truly awful material. Tell Ewan Macgregor, who’s proven elsewhere he’s a fine actor, that it’s safe to come out and emote now. Fire everyone else.'  'Space Hitler' is a gloriously inappropriate comparison, but Bahn has a point.  Darth Vader's one bad man; Hayden Christensen is not.                                   I have a pet peeve about athletes writing columns for news sources.  From Cris Carter, Jack McDowell, and Steve Kerr over at Yahoo! Sports to Frank Robinson and John Kruk at ESPN.com, I'm fairly annoyed by the whole bunch of them.  I suppose I'm off the mark in wanting better, more interesting articles, instead of platitude and cliché-ridden fluff pieces.  Most of the time, I can ignore them and go about my daily life.  Occasionally, something strikes me as ridiculously funny.  John Kruk's new article, which you can find  urlLink here , talks about the slowest runners in the majors right now.  Of course, over 10 years in the pros, Kruk stole 58 bases and was caught 31 times (career stats  urlLink here ).  This gives him almost identical career stats to that other famous base-stealer,  urlLink James Edward Rice .  The difference being that Baseball-Reference.com compares Rice favorably to such Hall of Famers as Duke Snider, Orlando Cepeda, Willie Mays (this one surprised me, but I guess from a power standpoint it's not that far off), Billie Williams, and Willie Stargell.  Kruk, on the other hand, compares favorably with Rusty Greer, Mike Easler, Troy O'Leary, Darrin Erstad, and Hal McRae.  I guess you write what you know.   Update : To be fair, Kruk's dead on about Malone laying out Darrick Martin.  Just as Dr. Z was right about Sapp's hit on Clifton a couple years ago.  Not quite the same thing, but I'm still pretty annoyed about that last one, okay?                                 These are the types of people we have running our country.  Do you think we should tell them that international law very much applies to the president and his war here?  I mean, isn't that what  international  law is for?  (Original article  urlLink here .)    'President Bush (news - web sites), as commander-in-chief, is not restricted by U.S. and international laws barring torture, Bush administration lawyers stated in a March 2003 memorandum.      'The 56-page memo to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld cited the president's 'complete authority over the conduct of war,' overriding international treaties such as a global treaty banning torture, the Geneva Conventions and a U.S. federal law against torture.   ''In order to respect the president's inherent constitutional authority to manage a military campaign ... (the prohibition against torture) must be construed as inapplicable to interrogations undertaken pursuant to his commander-in-chief authority,'' stated the memo, obtained by Reuters on Tuesday.'                                 This is the centennial of Bloomsday.  Which means that the following post, originally submitted to  urlLink Nabokv-L , a mailing list about Vladimir Nabokov (see original message  urlLink here ), is somewhat on-topic today:  'I'm sorry to bring too much of Joyce to this list, but this is so good I simply can't help it. Dale Peck talking about Nabokov's later works or about Ulysses (by the way, next Wednesday is the centenary of the Bloomsday) is pretty boringly courteous if compared with this kind of criticism on Amazon.com:   'Joyce is blind in one eye because he read Ulysses and then the eye hung itself,' writes Ben Kharakh. 'I'm contemplating traveling back in time and murdering James Joyce, in the face...For Ulysses to be any worse of a book, it would have to break into your house and defecate on your bed.''  Happy Bloomsday!   Update : I have been contacted by the author of the amazon.com review and asked to correct my attribution of the review.  Done!                                 I've been damn near silent lately.  It's mostly because I'm wrapping up my time in Chapel Hill and preparing to move back to the northeast, but it's also because I've been wicked busy.    I saw  Fahrenheit 9/11 .  I really liked it, but a few things about it made me uncomfortable.  The first thing was the audience.  It really gets my hackles up when people applaud during the movie, unless it's some sort of screening or premiere where people involved with the film were actually there.  Otherwise, who're you clapping for?  The projectionist?  Some people couldn't restrain themselves, clapping during the movie.  To me, it's as rude as talking or answering your cell phone at a film.  That's me.  The other problem I had was the manipulativeness of the film and its tendency to push things a little bit too far.  Ty Burr of the Boston Globe  urlLink explains this  better than I can:  'With the death of Lipscomb's son in Iraq, Moore himself turns exploiter. Her grief, of course, is genuine. So is our response to it. But when Moore prompts her to read her son's final letter out loud, and she cries helplessly as she does so, it becomes clear that the filmmaker's intrusiveness knows no bounds, and that he would sacrifice the dignity of even his beloved Flintians for political theater.'  Too true.  All in all, I highly recommend it.  On the Michael Moore tip, I've bought (for $8 at  urlLink The Bookshop  in Chapel Hill, one of my favorite stores in the area)  Stupid White Men .  So far, no good (as a friend once noted of a book by Terry Eagleton, 'No stars.  Pure Toilet.').  I don't appreciate being yelled at, and I certainly don't appreciate being yelled at by a book I want to agree with.  Michael Moore, at least as a writer, doesn't seem to respect his audience enough to show them where he gets his information and to lay off the rhetoric.  It's insulting.  Maybe it will get better.  I hope it does.  But so far, it's far less appealing and interesting to me than either of Molly Ivins's books,  Shrub  and  Bushwhacked , or Al Franken's  Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them , both of which are funny, sharp, and, to me, convincing, without being excessively polemical.  Moore could learn a lot from either of them (particularly Ivins in the latter book where she proposes solutions to problems -- something I liked very much).  In other news, a Florida teacher has been  urlLink arrested for having sex with a fourteen-year-old student  three times -- once in her classroom, once at her home, once in the back seat of her SUV while his fifteen-year-old cousin drove.  She's a fairly screwed up young woman, that much is clear, and this is sure to damage the kid she slept with.  I want to know what the hell was going on in his cousin's mind when he agreed to play chauffeur.  How do ask someone that, and why would they agree?  I'm not even going to comment about the outfit she's wearing in the AP photo.    According to a  urlLink new study , approximately ten percent of students are subjected to some form of sexual misconduct between kindergarten and grade 12.  Makes you wonder how many people are doing this and not getting caught.  I found two other articles at CNN.com about improper student-teacher relationships/interactions in the last week ( urlLink VA Teacher & Child Porn ,  urlLink Softball Coach & Player ).  That's all pretty damn screwed up.  In better, happier news, I've picked up the Beastie's new album,  To the 5 Boroughs .  It's slick and listenable.  Somewhat reminiscent of U2's  All That You Can't Leave Behind  in it's quality of production and, unfortunately, in its conservativeness.  It's a very well done and very safe album, particularly when you compare it to  Hello Nasty , which has a different sort of energy to it while still being a great album.  So, in the end, I guess you could say it's good, but it's not even close to being a  Paul's Botique , even though it's something of a return to that album's sound (especially in its use of samples).                                 So I go to the local  urlLink B-Dubs  to get some food and watch the Dodgers play the Sox.  Petey's pitching, so I'm pretty stoked.  I order my meal, get a beer, sit down and watch.  I'm a little late, and the Dodgers have already scored a run, but only one, so it's okay.  Unfortunately, I can't listen to the play-by-play, because the WWE's  urlLink Bad Blood  pay-per-view is on almost every single TV with the volume jacked up, including the TV immediately to the right of the baseball game.  This is okay.  I can handle this.  I can block out the WWE and watch the ballgame.  I manage to ignore the  urlLink four-way bout for the women's world championship , despite the locals hooting and hollering around me (for some reason, I'm vaguely reminded of Braves OF Andruw Jones's  urlLink testimony  during the Gold Club trial and his reference to the strippers 'doing lesbian action').  No worries.  I'm okay.  This is what I have to deal with to watch the ballgame.  Fine.  We'll just tune that out and pay attention to the ballgame.    By this point, I have an internal monologue doing play-by-play for the ballgame, trying to keep myself focused, but it's getting interrupted by the yahoo in front of me howling with laughter during the match between  urlLink Eugene and Jonathan Coachman .  By now, my monologue's sounding like this: 'Okay, here's the one-one BODY SLAM!!!! that's a strike on the outside YAAAAAHAHAHAHAHA and a routine grounder to THE PEOPLE'S ELBOW!!!!...'  Also, by now, the NBA finals are getting going, and I've got to contend with Tom Tolbert's mug on the TV to the left of the ballgame.  I ended up right before the bottom of the fourth, which most of the people in B-Dubs would have considered to be right before  urlLink Kane and Chris Benoit  squared off.  I half expected someone to turn and ask me where I was going, as I was going to miss 'the best part.'  Anyhow, there's no punchline to this.  Just had to share my pain.               \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
