I'm pretty adamant on this topic).  We wimped out on the whole  urlLink Jesus  thing, though.  Sigh .  I almost pushed their 8-year old kid off the boat, though, when he started correcting my definitions. Frankie wanted to know what a  urlLink wake  was, and I said it was the splashy stuff behind the boat, so as to keep it simple. Of course, the little annoyance had to say, 'That's not what it is, Trillian, it's...(and here I stopped listening to him because his defination wasn't that of a wake).   I wanted to say:  'See! Right there. That's why no one likes you!'  but I sensed that this might upset his parents (In retrospect, I guess I should have, given my last post on this topic). Frankie Mouse doesn't like him either, he calls him a 'know it all'. My husband calls him an 'ass' which I think is more to the point. Not really his fault though, I think it's a lack of good parenting. Nonetheless, we were fairly leisurely in commanding Frankie Mouse to stop pushing him off the dock.  (Oh, stop gasping - he was fine! And really, any true boy would have pushed Frankie back).   Before we left for the  (ahem)  cottage, I demanded that Arthur stop at his office and pick up hisnotebook computer so that I could do some writing on the way up (it's a four hour drive). Good thing, too. I wrote for at least 10 minutes before I put the laptop away and didn't touch it again until I unpacked it from the car when we got home last night.  Sigh .  Anyhoo - I promise to write more this week. And I envision it being very entertaining (well, at least for me)...                     Another great weekend. My house is clean, I exercised, I shopped, and I ate (a lot). We had a great Father's Day - Benjy and Frankie mice made nice gifts for Arthur and we also bought him a new golf bag and some sandals (to replace his 8 year-old Nike's (phew!).  And, dum dum da dum...I wrote a couple of pages this weekend! Excellent. My biggest problem is that I'm really motivated to start new chapters, and get about 3 pages into them, before I lose interest. Then, I wait a few days and start another chapter. I lack even one finished chapter. It's a disgrace, but I'm willing to bet that I'm not the only one who writes like that. The good news is that I have the entire plot in my head (it might be better on paper, I know), so I can jump around from chapter to chapter, but wouldn't it be nice if I  finished  one? Who knows? Do you know?  Alas, I'm in an excellent mood. I fear that such a great mood will lead to a lack of productivity in the novel arena - as most of my inspiration for it comes from a sense of panic, stress, and doom. (Not that my current job inspires those feelings (at least most of the time), but it's easier for me to recall Project Management events when I'm in a state of learned helplessness, which I'm currently not). Perhaps I'll have to invent some stress.... healthy!                      First of all, 10 points to whoever can place the origin of this post title.  Second, something strange is going on at the  big city  library today. I went there to get  urlLink  The Salmon of Doubt   - the last book by  urlLink Douglas Adams . The library apparently had two copies. Imagine my surprise when I found that not only were those books not there, but there were  no   urlLink DNA  books on the shelves at all! Not in hard cover, not in large print, not in paperback, and not in the books on tape section.  Clearly, I thought, something is amiss. I asked the librarians, helpful souls that they are, and they gave me that patronizing, motherly look that says 'You poor troglodyte, let me enlighten you.' Until they got to the shelves and realized that I. Was. Right.  Since the almighty system showed that the books were in, I can only assume that some selfish patron was collapsing under the weight of carrying all those  urlLink Douglas Adams  books in their arms somewhere within the confines of the library. I considered hunting them down, but then realized I didn't have enough time, as I had to get back to the office. People need me here.  Yeah.      I settled for an early novel by  urlLink John Irving  - a good writer, albeit, but obviously a bit more weighty in his topics of choice than good old DNA.  This is certainly a mystery for the ages. OK, not the ages, but certainly for the week. I think I'll pop in tomorrow and see if they've found out where the stuff went. My daughter thinks that when you put books in the return chute, they go to another world. Maybe she's right.                       Whilst playing darts in our garage, Ford asked us 'Who's your top 5?' (that's top 5 stars you're allowed to sleep with (with your spouse's permission) if you should ever come upon them (no pun intended).  I chose, in VERY specific order:    urlLink Matthew McConaughy    urlLink Owen Wilson    urlLink Colin Firth    urlLink Hugh Grant    urlLink Jude Law    Arthur went 'all time' which means that I don't have to worry about half of them, as they're very much deceased:    urlLink Marlene Dietrich  (DEAD)   urlLink Rita Hayworth  (ALSO DEAD)   urlLink Angelina Jolie  (Smugly Alive)    urlLink Sophie Morrow  (Arthur is too good looking for a French chick to be attracted to him)   urlLink Carrie Ann Moss  (Yeah, well, she's pretty hot)   If I was going 'all time', I would have included  urlLink Cary Grant , but I wanted to keep my options a little more open. Not sure what I'd say if I met one of my '5' walking down the street, though.   'Hi, you don't know me, but you're on my 'List' and my husband says it's ok if I sleep with you. Why are you backing away? Where are you going? Hey! Wait!'                       I don't mean to judge, (ya, right! This statement is only ever made by those who  do  wish to judge but don't want others to judge them) but (see!) I had a little lunch with a marginally annoying friend who was so absolutely rude during the lunch that it took all of my strength not to smack her and send her to her room.  It's not that she had 2 beers during a lunch that was less than one hour when she has to drive back to the office. That's a whole different rant that's far more serious and important than my actual rant, which is trivial and more in line with my overall nature.  She took not one, but  5  phonecalls during our 45 minute lunch!!!!! I abhore mobile phones in general (it's an aversion stemming from my previous life as a PM when I had one surgically attached to my hip by my company), and believe that in particular they have no place in:  restaurants golf courses movie theaters cars anywhere where they might annoy me I don't like hearing a mobile go off in any of these places, let alone be  with  the person who's rude enough to be the cause of the interruption! Holy shmoly!  Arthur, as you may or may not know is a Financial Planner. When he goes golfing with his colleagues (which is often, don't kid yourself), if anyone takes or makes a call on the course, the other members of the party take the phone and throw it in the water hazard. I should have dunked the mobile in her soy latte, but I don't think it would have had the same impact.  Whew. That's better.
