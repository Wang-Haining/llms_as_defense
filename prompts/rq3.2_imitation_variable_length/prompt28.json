His words have buoyed me up during a twenty-year exploration of “media” (whether human, analog, or digital).  Though I have bobbled up and down with his words (finding meaning and losing it), I am still peeling back new layers of nuanced ideas.  What intrigues me today is the McLuhan revival especially in  urlLink  business and management  .  In my search to understand the phenomenon of “creativity” (a word that even as late as 1969 was not included in the OED) McLuhan’s words have galvanized my thinking.  In particular, I am more fully aware of the “figure” and “ground” aspect of any medium.  Throughout my research, I was drawn again and again to the features McLuhan expressed regarding all media (conceptual or concrete) and this alliance led to my early-formed conclusions regarding “creativity.” I say early because while I defended my thesis, I am still on the journey of discovery that includes the continued exploration of forty leading experts from around the world, and the perusal of the more than 7,000 books, 40,000 academic articles, and 5,430,000 google hits found on the Web! Yes – it’s definitely one of the more challenging fields of investigation!  When I was first introduced to McLuhan in the late 70’s, while studying communications, I was very much aware that his thinking had been drawn from a famous communications theorist,  urlLink  Harold Innis .  I had heard his famous and oft repeated aphorism for  urlLink  medium and message   and we had become more and more familiar with the idea of a “global village” (long before globalization became a reality).    I hope that our final class will bring a not too cursory closure to our term (although I suspect that the mental dialogue will continue long after) as we will journey into  urlLink  McLuhan's Tetrads  (four questions posed to analyze media) as a tool to explore the medium of language, literacy, technology, and other “media” that have been discussed throughout our class and on this blog.   Thank you for all of your terrific thoughts expressed in this blog!  It has been thoughtful, compelling, humorous and inviting.  Great work!                         First day of class!  What an extraordinary group of individuals!  Each person, expressing so many interesting viewpoints from diverse contexts, contributed to a look at the fascinating paradoxes in education.  Can we connect some of the themes?  Go to the  urlLink  on-line textbook   to view the first link called “Context.”  You can surf the four topics,   gender, age, multicultural, language,   to uncover what language theorists are saying about literacy.     Here is what I wonder.  If spoken word is such a vital part of our linguistic heritage and given that we are such social beings (Vygotsky), why does our teaching in the 21st Century continue to be so didactic – so 19th Century?   According to statistics, the ratio between teacher and pupil talk shows that teachers are relentless in doing most of the talking!  That does not sound very sociable (would we expect a party host to do   all   the talking?) neither does it seem opportune since communication appears to be unidirectional! How droll is that?     A few of the following themes that arose from our introductions may lead us to unraveling the paradoxes:  (1) cultural attitudes and values (including parental, teen, administrative, teacher, government), (2) the teacher identity and sense of belonging crisis that ensues from questions like, “Why am I not taken seriously or valued?” – “What am I/they doing here?” – “What am I doing this for?” – “Do I make any difference?” – “Why is the system so slow to change?” – 'What is the meaning of life?'     Okay…so that last question is a bit too unwieldy. Still it holds a peculiar significance in the world of literacy insofar as what we value and the language we use are inexorably linked.  You most likely empathized, as I did, with a number of concerns that were voiced – and found some to be even more personally relevant than others.  Yet, despite the numerous subject areas, patterns were evident.  And there was an interesting undercurrent – a “ground” as it were – that may recede from our immediate view but that somehow connects all of these issues (i.e., “figures”). What are your thoughts?                          So far, as you’ve probably noticed, I’ve done the typical bloggity-blog thing that comes from public forums.  You know – raise questions, throw in a quote here and there – the usual academic fare.  And you have commented quite interestingly. But!  I just had one of those “Oh no” moments the second I opened my email.  I had shared with other instructors that I had started a BLOG with our class as a forum for discussion (different from but similar to personal journals, free writes, or classroom dialogue). Not because I think it’s the newest trend but because I wanted another means to “hear” your thoughts – other than, yet again, more reflections. When one of the instructors sent us the link to  urlLink  Blogging Across the Curriculum,   I was taken completely by surprise that there is now a body of research in education on BLOGS!  I don’t know why I was surprised, come to think of it.  Afterall, underground phenomena always become part of collective consciousness in today’s cyber fast age – think of techno music and raves.  Sometime in the middle of my teaching career, I remember the cynicism I had felt toward journaling and portfolios being made into requisite activities and shaping the content of educational conferences!  Conferences held on the value of journaling and portfolios in education?  Two forms of expression rooted in the world of scientists and artists alike   for very, very good reason   – only to suddenly make its way into academic study and into the “curriculum” – or worse (shudder) IRP’s (Integrated Resource Packages).  Even the title “Blogging across the Curriculum” makes the hairs on my arm stand up.  It’s NOT a pedagogical method, a theory, nor an approach! It’s just another medium.  If it works, it not only has transformed traditional ways of expressing ideas through digital means, but it will morph into an entirely different knowledge source.  If it doesn’t work, it has probably been theorized to the point that no one wants any part of it anymore.  That is precisely what turned Einstein off of mathematics for years!       'It is nothing short of a miracle that the modern methods of instruction have not yet entirely strangled the holy curiosity of inquiry; for this delicate little plant, aside from stimulations, stands mainly in need of freedom; without this it goes to wreck and ruin without fail.  It is a very grave mistake to think that the enjoyment of seeing and searching can be promoted by means of coercion and a sense of duty'(Einstein).   Okay enough ranting!  So what do you think of the relationship between technology and creativity?  What of Garageband and iMovie?  What about Peter’s question of whether today’s music production is “composition” or “arrangement?”  What about the assertion that   language   itself is a  technology ?   Félix Nadar said that he became a photographer because he was a lousy painter…   'Photography is a wonderful discovery, a science which occupies the most intelligent, an art which sharpens the minds of the shrewdest, and which can be practiced by the most stupid…  The theory of photography can be learned in one hour; the first notions of its practice in one day…  But I will tell you what cannot be learned: it is a feeling for light, an artistic appreciation of the effects produced by different and composite days, it is the application of one or the other of such effects according to the nature of the physiognomies which you, as an artist, have to reproduce.  What can be learned even less is the moral intelligence of your subject, that rapid tact which puts you in communication with your model, which helps you judge him and guide you through his habits and ideas, depending on his character.  This is what enables you to produce, not the banal, haphazard and indifferent plastic reproduction that is within the reach of even a laboratory technician, but a more familiar and flattering resemblance, an intimate portrait.  This is the psychological aspect of photography, and in my opinion this term is not over ambitious' (Félix Nadar).             \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
