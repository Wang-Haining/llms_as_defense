I spend it on stupid things. And stuff thats fun for a while but then I wonder why I bought it. And its just because I have money. Sigh.  Although all the things that happen at work are pretty funny though.. plus Byron bought us a freaking icecream cake today [again] and I got some this time. Plus some candy. And cookie. Did I mention that I feel like throwing up?  On the bright side it is pretty good to have money and spend it on absolutely nothing. Or say, The Darkness CD or Laurens birthday present.  I cant wait for Hootie and APRIL WINE. I got a free ticket from working down there with Celebrate Canada, and its awesome. Apparently matt's working with us this year too. I wonder how thatll work out. I wonder if Ill get frustrated with him and freak out. After putting up with his crap for such a long time, I now have a very short fuse. But whatever, maybe it will be ok. And the concerts will be amazing.  OK So the dreads still arent in but MONDAY! Or Tuesday. I  will  have them in before next weekend.   Plus : I might be getting my nose pierced. Why? Because Ive wanted to for years and I have the money. And Im old enough now to go by myself. Screw my parents. They need to lighten up anyway. So thats a maybe.      ..so it looks like I was right when I said that this summer would be the best one yet. It has been so far at least.    Listening To:  Breaking The Girl- RHCP                       Well Im back from the cottage as of Friday and is anyone else noticing that time is going by crazy fast? I mean there was celebrate canada and the festival and concerts, and then all of a sudden Im at the cottage, having a blast doing absolutely nothing. Now Im here, after working 2 shifts at GCB again. And family reunion. Wait, what?  Its all giving me a headache.  Anyway, from what I can rememer, the cottage was awesome. Monday we had crap weather so me and Jess and Mom went to Dunes [crazy artistic gift shop type thing.] We spent 3 hours in there and I think it was the highlight of my week. Besides the cottage itself I mean.. it was better than my house.  But going back to Dunes.. amazing. It was amazing. Mom even bought us dessert, which was orgasmic. I got this chocolate mousse with raspberry sauce cake thing [drool] and raspberry tea.   So good. [drool again]. Anyway back to reality, Jess got a wooden mask thing for her room and we all got free rings, made of seashell. Pretty damn cool.  It makes me think about what I want to do when I grow up. No office job for me, thanks. I think Id kill myself if I ever had a cubicle. I wonder if I could open up a shop like that? It would be very very cool. And fun. Oh, the possibilites..  But knowing me I would go backrupt in weeks.   Rejection.   Lauren I miss you so much. And Kyle. And Lydia! And Bryce and everyone that I havent seen so far this summer. What am I doing?  I need some Tylonel.                       Ugh. [sound of disgust]. Why is it that even though I hate this stupid piece of crap that I still stay on for hours?.. Just finished reading a book called Feed. The ending was really sad, and because I get way into books, I cried. This book made so much fucking sense I cant even begin to describe it. Its all about how much America consumes and how its going to affect people in the future. Everything in this book is fake. Their school is called SchoolTM and is run by major corporations and tells them how to control the world by knowing what theyre consuming, etc. They have fake clouds and they tore down all the trees to make air factories. In everyone's brain, they put micro chip type things that are like the internet, but inside your brain. Its called a feed and its like a constant pop up ad. It sounds annoying as hell. And everyone's skin is falling off because of the lack of real air and stuff. Yes, I am a bookworm, Yes, I am a dork. And yes, yes, I am a hippie. But please don't hold it against me.  Tired as hell but I refuse to do my homework and go to bed because Im stupid. Early band tomarrow, I may die.  On the bright side, Behn came home :):):) million smiles, and I got presents :) and me and tyler may be making a acoustic band type thing, which is cool.   Listening To:  silence. Its never quiet at my house. Those of you that have been here know.  .. its a nice change.                       There's so many songs about saying goodbye, leaving, missing you.. its pathetic really. Honestly, these people should just move on with their lives. But who am I to talk, its a week, a funking week..168 hours :| feeling very much like a dork.  And Im contemplating whether or not I should go to Jillians party.. but its 9:00[ish] already and Id have to walk both ways. So Im thinking no... but Im sure theyre all having lots of fun without me. I kinda feel like being alone anyway.  And I miss Lydia. I think Im going to kidnap her and take her hostage for a while so that she cant leave, because I honestly havent done anything outside of school with her for too long. wayy too long. And since Operation HPB is well under way, I think Ill make a new one.. Operation Steal-Lydia-so-she-cant-leave-anymore. Anyone want in?   Listening To: Battle of Who Could Care Less- Ben Folds  [ahh Lauren I just did it again!!!]   Do you not hear me anymore I know it's cool to be so bored I know it's not your thing to care But it sucks me in when you're aloof It sucks me in, it sucks it works I guess it's cool to be alone Will you never rest Fighting the battle of who  Could care less Everyday you wake up late Sometimes I wish I was that way   My guitar is calling, as is my front porch. I think that chocolate upstairs is too.
