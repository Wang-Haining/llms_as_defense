  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic:\n\n       A man who loves social life and curious about every new progress, new development to make sure he is in the era and always have all up date information. He likes to know what the latest trend of fashion is and make sure he is not out of style. You can easily spot him at the grand opening of new pub, new restaurant for he loves to participate in social activity.   There is a few Sagittarius who is a private person as well, but you could see that he will be ahead of his friends. He will know what is the best seller book, what are the top 10 hot hit of the week. The hottest movies showing now, he must have already seen it.  He hates routine, it makes him bored. He likes to get to his goals and succeeding in doing so is his true reward. Money making is O.K. but it is not his true joy, for he can easily spend them in a short while. They say if you want the truth, go and ask Sagittarius. They are right, you can ask him and he will tell you all the truth and very straight forward. Even he may speak bluntly, his friends loves him. If you have problems, all your friends may feel sorry for you, but Sagittarius will be the one who will give you a helping hand first and even expect no return favor. That's why he is a real charmer even sometimes big mouth.  When he is mad, he can be quite fierce but quickly dissolve and easily forgotten. He is not a person who will take revenge, so if he say he going to burn down your house, you can relax. He likes compliments and sweet words, so you can manipulate him easily. If he knows you are not sincere, you will totally become meaningless to him.  Some Sagittarius are gifted musician, or singer. He is a happy soul, has a good humor and has lots of jokes. He loves freedom, lively and very energetic. If he is working, he will take his job seriously. He likes to travel, likes to see new exciting places. Going out or traveling make him happy.  Sagittarius man is like a free bird. He lives as if everyday is Sunday. He will hardly be in a bad mood, but if he is in a bad mood, you will better leave his sight. If you want to talk to him in such mood, try to avoid issue of commenting his life. He flirts like other man, but he has a built in brake, so he will come back to you by himself. If he disappear for a few days, not to worry for he is only recharging his battery to be that same lively person again, them he will be back.  He has allergies to Pretty woman, so in love with many women for him would be normal. Setting dating schedule is his games and it's fun for him, and this will keep him from being bored. He hates obligations, so the word 'marriage' would suffocate him. If you allow him to have freedom, he will not go anywhere.  He falls in love as easy as he catches cold, especially if she is cute, funny and she has a strong personality. No one can tell how long he will be in love each time. If you want to really hold Sagittarius man, act like you are in an adventure movie. At all time, you should make yourself lively, tells him some jokes, always be cute so that it will ease up his allergy to other pretty women a bit.             A tall slim and graceful woman who walks proudly like she is walking in a beauty pageant competition. If she slips or nearly falls, she will nicely covered it up and continue with her graceful and impressive walking step. She knows how to use make up to enhance her beauty. She looks at the world positively, so her face always seems so happy. She will not get up set easily.  Self confident woman who believes in her own style. She will not follow fashion, but standing in between simplicity and too modern. She is a very open person, sometimes can be too blunt. She is an honest person and never try to cause troubles for any one. She likes to say something that you do not want to hear and yet she can say something so pleasing at the same time. Example she may say 'I wish you could make more money, so you could afford better cloth, but anyway it is better this way. If you make more money you could be thinking of money too much and become greedy'. She can say such thing and make you wonder if you should get up set or love her more.  She is also a free spirit and does not like to stay home. She likes to be protected, but not to give her orders. She has no respect to a weak man. If she try to over powered you, then you have to calm her down and try to control her to be in a limit by doing the same thing too. She will listen if she respects you. She likes to be herself and like her guy to be himself.   She is a no nonsense woman, so you will not hear she says 'Guess what I will do next', or 'Guess what I am thinking' because she always say what she is thinking out loud like a guy. If you do not understand her in this matter, you could easily break up with her. She sees problems in her love life as another funny story.  She is clumsy and it is in her nature. You may think it is cute, but for some neat guys this could be so unbearable. She is very friendly, so she can easily turn her enemy to be her friends. She has good taste in fine cloths, good food, first class and first services. Even a poor woman in this Zodiac will struggle to afford such good taste. She could spend lots of money as if she can not understand how difficult it is to make money. If you think of let her borrow money, think again.  She is a paranoid. If she thinks you like her, she may already think about getting married and lost her freedom and so on and on. A jolly woman who loves sports. She is an ordinary woman who could dress like a tomboy. She has more guy friends and sometimes could act like one of a guy. She does not care about rumors, so she can get home very late and couldn't careless what her neighbor will gossip about her. She thinks either good or bad, you will know it yourself, so you should not bother what people think.   Her wit and innocent look are her charms. She is often hurts from love, but never afraid to look for a new one as if she is singing 'Do that to me one more time'. She likes going straight and being straight forward. She will not go around to get what she wants, or beat around the bush just to say something. If you meet her and tell her straight what you think, she will admire you.              I have known her longer than my girlfriend. She is one of the few girls inspired my dream chaser project, a girl who have guild me thru in my decision ending up in Australia. Curtin is only of my top choices, when they offered me a double degree, Bachelor in Bussiness Administration and Computer Science. Yes, I do have the idea of going to school with Hazlina Hanaffi, way before last year.   One of the reason, why I am not heading for Perth, even not for Murdoch, due to the recognisation. Wollongong is still one of the top for the IT industry. That why I am heading for Wollongong. And Wollongong is really a distant from Perth, even also from Sdyney.   80km down south, sitting below than 15 degree, sometimes reaching about 0 degree. It does really can make me feel homesick. Hafizah Hashim, Juliana Jamal, Nurliza Kamarudin and Nuradlin Ayob all are back in Singapore. Even, Rahizan Zainuldin also have headed back home.   I am only left with this Firdaus Zakaria. He is a good man. But, sometime I am do really feel down, to some issues maybe, I am too sensitive. Which I gues I am, currently now. I need friends, friends who I can trusts, jokes, and going to place where we can enjoy ourselves... Just like my brother, Abdul Razak A. Rahman. I guessed, Razak still the best, no one to replace his accompanionship.  My girlfriend? She is great, I am thankfull to God, till today, I am still with her. But just lastly , I am really quite ignore by her characters. Just that she is not used to be the collage gal, I love so much. True, she is trying to change herself so much. I can see her losing her weight and her hair is dye, brown...   I told her I prefered gals with highlight hair, not brown. But .. it alright, I am not fussy about that. Cos, shw look much interesting now with bown hair. There is she online now. Just give her a minute , she will click and try to cath with me. For now, it is alright for me.   But during exam, she kepe talking wired stuffs to me . That really making me pissed off. Anyway, i am already happy with my girlfriend. But, if she want to be anger with me asking me what is wickedweasel gal? I dunn really care.  I am really feel to the maximum of boreness in my life. Hoping on the July 1st, I would clear all my exam and pass with credits. Insya-Allah.  Yupz, sometimes, in the middle of the nite, my tears do flow out. I never cry in my sleep, thinking about my dad, when i am in the army. I guess Australia, this phase of life is much tougher than army ....  All I wise was November 27 to come soon...    \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
