I took a pain killer, but it offered just temporary relief. But this morning I was game anyway for my day at Central Park. I didn't expect much out of it, hey a Park is a park right?  no way is Central Park just a Park. I walked and I walked till my legs felt like they were going to drop off but I just wanted to go on anyway.
