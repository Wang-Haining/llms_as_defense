I know I did.   Friday - My good friend Elliot is back in San Diego.  He was in Virginia for the past few years for school.  He graduated (consequently making me feel like a loser for not finishing school).  We hung out with my friends Anthony, China and Alex that night too.  T'was a good time!  Didn't get to bed until 3:30 in the AM... Saturday - Had to wake up at 4:30 = 1 hour of sleep.  Went to work from 6-10am.  Then went to Angela's mom's house to visit all the relatives from Wisconsin.  Cool people I must say!  Love the accents!  Sat around drinking beer and playing speed with Angela, Kathy and Danny.  According to Kathy, I guess I need a bib when I drink beer.  I do like to slobber!  : ) Sunday - Slept until about 3:30 in the afternoon.  Such a bum!  Then went and hung out with Angela. Monday - Went to Sea World with Angela and the kiddies.  Had a good time.  Got sunburned.  I was actually shocked that I did because I'm so freakin' dark.  Oh well...  Also got soaked on all the stupid water rides.  Who would have thought that you can get wet in a place like 'Sea World.'  Hmmph. The rest of the day today is going to be filled with work and working out at the gym.  My life is just one big party huh?                        Dear Angela, China & Queen Kate,     &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How are you all doing today?&nbsp; I am writing all three of you this letter to make sure that one thing is clear...&nbsp;  I would rather spend the rest of my life old and alone before I would trade our friendships over a girl .&nbsp; I know at one point or another, you all have questioned&nbsp;what I would do if a girl asked me to pick her over our friendship.&nbsp; I have never met 3 cooler females than the 3 of you.&nbsp; And I am so glad that I can call you my best friends.&nbsp; You are all so funny and constantly make me laugh (duh, what else would a funny person do?)&nbsp; Believe me when I say that I would never, ever, ever do that.&nbsp; Unless of course it was Kate Beckinsale who asked me to do so.&nbsp; Because  I know  that one day she will leave her husband for me.&nbsp; Then it would only be fair that I choose her over our friendships...&nbsp; :)&nbsp; Besides, would I really be the one to win if the choice was between myself and Justin Timberlake, David Beckham, or Douglas Robb?&nbsp; I didn't think so! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love you all, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Renan                                I discovered today that my sweat glands are sooooo bass-akwards.  We are throwing a baby shower for our boss here at work and the gift we got her is a bassinet.  So because I possess a Y chromosome, I was charged with the duty of assembling the bassinet.    Mind you, assembling a bassinet is not physical work.  But for some God forsaken reason, I was sweating like a pig in a turtleneck.  You would think I was assembling this bassinet on the surface of the sun or in hell or something.  The weird thing is, whenever I work out, on hot summer days, whatever else it is, I NEVER SWEAT.  What is the deal with that?    Someone tell me that it's not just me.  Someone tell me that I don't need to go to the doctor.    By the way, for the nerds out there, I know that pigs do not sweat.  It was just an expression.  On a totally unrelated subject, let me tell you all about my weekend...  On Friday I saw Lit and Hoobastank in concert.  It was a FUCKIN' AWESOME SHOW!  I was goin' crazy that night.  By the way, I didn't sweat there either.  Even though there was like 10 people crammed into each square foot.  Saturday my friend Kathy had a party because she graduated from beautician school and it was our friend Ziggy's birthday.  So happy birthday to Zig and congrats Kathy.  Sunday was a day to be lazy.  I did go to the gym.  Here's a pop quiz to make sure you were paying attention:  Did I sweat?  Anyway, I'm done rambling.  Catch ya'll on the flipside!                       I hate the fact that my over-achieving friends make me feel like such a loser.  I have come to discover tonite that A BUNCH of my other friends also have their own blogs.  And you know what?  They're blogs are like 1,000 times better than mine.  They got pictures and different colors and SHIT!  It makes me feel like less of a man...  Well not really.  But it makes me wanna kick some ass! I'm going to figure out how to make my blog the shiz-nit!  I too will have pictures, and fuckin' bouncing monkeys, breakdancin' gorillas and NAKED, NAKED chicks just scattered all over the place.  It will be so ridiculously over the top.  SERIOUSLY!  (I only said that because Ang thinks I say 'seriously' too much)  SERIOUSLY!  SERIOUSLY! SERIOUSLY! Alright, I gotta go.  I'm going to the gym and work out.  It case you wanna know, I like to work out in T-I-G-H-T spandex.  :)  Just kidding. I will see everyone later.  And to all my friends, this is Blog War.  I will take out my Blog Bazookas and Blog missiles and Blog Machine Guns and blast some holes in your mutha fuckin' asses!                        I'm sure you all have been asking yourselves that question, and I'm sure that you have tossed and turned at night not knowing what my whereabouts were. Well, for the past week I have been in Pennsylvania. Scranton, Pennsylvania to be exact. I had to travel to Scranton on 'business.' I say 'business' because how much work did I really do? Unless of course you classify 'business' as drinking heavily in dive bars, then I have told you nothing but the truth.      There are couple things that I learned from this whole experience... First of all, I am a city boy. Not only that, I am a California boy too. It's just so amazing the differences between Scranton and San Diego. Granted, San Diego isn't exactly what you may call a 'big city' if you compare it to New York or Los Angeles. But hell, it sure is compared to Scranton. I have never seen so much green in one place my whole fuckin' life! They say that Scranton is so backwards compared to San Diego.      This leads me to my number 2 discovery... I am not white! Don't think that I'm stupid. This was a fact that I was always aware of my whole life. But being in Scranton sure did beat that point into the ground. Good God did I stick out like a sore thumb. I felt like a movie star with so many people staring at me. So I did what any normal person would do... I told everyone that I was that Asian dude in American Pie. MILF! MILF! MILF!      I am pretty tired right now from the time difference and now I am about to go to the airport to fly back home. So I will talk to everyone later. Like I said, you all can breathe easy now... Ren has returned!                           Day #2 - I hope my posts aren't too boring for y'all.  Anyway, nothing special has happened since yesterday and today.  Just the monotonous existence that is my life.  I talked to my friend Steph last nite.  She made an interesting comment to me...   I guess she is having a birthday party at her house and she made reference to a place where the people can do the 'boom boom.'  A 'boom boom room' if you will.  Rrrriggght...  I can't remember the last time I heard someone call it the 'boom boom.'  Except for the time I was in a Vietnamese village in east Saigon during the war.  'Me so horny!  Me love you long time!'  Damn Vietnamese prostitute!  That will be the third and final time that I get herpes!  Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me!  : ) Also, just wanted to say thanks to Queen Kate for giving me a link on her blog site.  Until I figure out how to put a special place on my site, you're just going to have to go to the following site:  www.katespurpose.blogspot.com  I highly recommend checking it out.  She is quite a cool lady with a much cooler blog site than me.
