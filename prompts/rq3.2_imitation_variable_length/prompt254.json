Yes, I  have  only had four or five rehearsals.  Yes, it  was  for 200 nine- and ten-year-olds.  But it was a blast. I was terrified, believe me. I still don't know the forms very well, nor do I know the way CCL likes to introduce them. But I had to figure it out right quick, and it was fun. My fellow players were  urlLink Kimmy Gatewood ,  urlLink Morgan Phillips  and  urlLink Brian Finkelstein . They were very accomodating, considering that they've all done a million gigs at CCL, and this was my first one.  We opened with a  Campfire Song , which we decided to do because the group was from a camp. We then did  urlLink Ding  (aka New Choice),  Pillars  (aka Hesitation),  Audience Sound Effects , a  Conducted Story  and a  Musical . It was fun to get to play like the old days... it felt a lot like The SlushPuppies did. Very playful, very creative, anything goes.   I'm certainly not saying that this type of performance is easier than, say, long-form improv. Or any less or more fun. It's just very different, and I didn't realize how much I had missed it. Now, I'm just looking forward to doing it with a little more confidence and a slightly more interested crowd.                     I have an audition this Saturday for a group called  urlLink Chicago City Limits . My friend Eugene is a member of the group, and recommended me for the invite-only audition. I'm excited. I'm trying out for their touring company, which would mean I would get to leave the city once in a while and get paid for it. I'll let you know how it goes down. Fingers crossed, expectations low.  I started my class at  urlLink The P.I.T.  on Sunday. It's a class on writing a one-person show, and I'm scared. I've never written anything in my life (save some edits on The SlushPuppies final show in 2000), so this is a big hairy deal. I have a 5-8 minute solo performance as my final project in about nine weeks, so I'll let you know about that as the time comes.  I've decided to re-take the last class I took at UCB because it's been a year since I took it, and I don't want to advance until I'm ready. The good news: there are two scheduled class performances, and one of them happens to be on the Saturday preceding my agent showcase here in NYC. So, MFA friends, if you're in town the day before our big rehearsal, you are invited to join me at UCB for what is sure to be a fearful ride. Plus, it's being taught by my poker pal  urlLink Kevin Mullaney , and I hear he's fantastic. Should be fun.  One last tidbit of weird info: Through a connection with  urlLink Rich Melheim  in Stillwater, I got hooked up with  urlLink Thomas Ian Nicholas  (from the  urlLink American Pie  movies) to help with promoting a movie he and his brother made called  urlLink L.A. D.J. . Long story short, after some emails and a couple phone calls, I got him slated to do the monologues at  urlLink ASSSSCAT  this Sunday. Virginia and I will meet him at the theater and introduce him around. Should be pretty fun!                     1. For fun, I took some pictures of my work area and stiched them together. Did you need to see this? No, but I thought it would be fun to try stitching five pictures together:  urlLink     2. Virginia and I witnessed something horrible tonight. As we were walking home from dropping off our laundry at the local laundry joint (because we Manhattanites pay to have our laundry done for us), we heard squealing tires behind us. We wheeled around just in time to see a young woman get hit by a taxi. Luckily, it wasn't a full-blown frontal hit... it was more like when Matt Peterson and I hit a deer with his car on the way home from Metigoshe. She rolled along the side of the car and smacked her head on the windshield. I ran over and was the first person on the scene (lucky her). She was almost immediately in shock/knocked out, and blood started dripping from her mouth. I yelled for Virginia to call 911, which she did. I got down on the ground and tried talking to her. The cab driver got out and tried to roll her onto her back. I stopped him and told him not to move her. I had two shirts on, so I took the top one off and put it under her head. As I did so, a guy in shorts came up and identified himself as an emergency room doctor. Thank goodness. He took over and started talking to her. He had just asked me to check her pulse, when a woman stepped up and said she was a nurse. She took over on the pulse thing. Thank goodness again. Anyway, long story short, there were three ambulances there withing ten or fifteen minutes. The doctor told me to stay as a witness, but I didn't have much to offer since all I saw was the impact itself.   I felt bad for the cabbie. I don't think it was entirely his fault. The roads were wet and, as far as I could tell, the chick walked right in front of him.    Any way, it sucked. Glad I was there and was able to help in the little ways I could... although I'll miss my free Cleveland Indians shirt from MBNA. Oh, well.  Scary stuff.                 I've now heard from Mary Gen, Emily and a little more from Matty J.  Mary Gen has just opened 'Playboy of The Western World' at  urlLink Black Hills Playhouse  after only eight days of rehearsal. Crazy. She's working overtime to make up for the guilt she feels about getting her first full paycheck just for acting. She's crazy.  Emily is in Sacramento and is working part-time with her realtor. She said to give her a few years, and she'll be like  urlLink Annette Bening  in American Beauty. I believe it.  And this just in from Matt Joslyn: 'Here in Sandusky, I am now the pinch hitting director for Ohio's oldest Community Theatre's production of Annie. 56 kids. Oh yes. 56. The original director decided to leave without telling anyone after 3 weeks of rehearsal and having only staged the first scene. None of the kids knew the music. At all. And they don't want me to cut anything. And his prop list was 6 pages long... like he was doing a movie. And we open 2 weeks from today. $0 and stage parents.    Priceless.   Seriously though... I love it.'                     Although I had originally planned to do a monthly newsletter for The Rich Sommer Fan Club, I've changed my mind and decided to begin this web journal. I will be able to update it whenever anything of note occurs, so you can safely assume that nothing much will have changed since whatever the last posted entry says.   I leave for New York in about 14 hours or so. Virginia (my girlfriend, for those of you who don't know) and I just ate at  urlLink Nighttown , one of our favorite restaurants in Cleveland. I'm just about to do my final pass through the apartment to get any trash or dust or candy wrappers thrown away. I'm excited and sad to be leaving, but I know it's going to be a blast in NYC. I can't wait to get there/out of here.  I have three appointments this Thursday and Friday with temp agencies. I've got to begin making money ASAP.   The goodbyes here in Cleveland have been sad, weird and drawn out. We began our farewells about two weeks ago, and they just keep coming. There's been at least one per day for about a week now, and it's emotionally draining. Tonight I say goodbye to Jeff Marsey, a lovely gentleman whom I befriended when he was an undergrad during my first year here. It'll definitely be one of the harder goodbyes.  So, here it goes! I'll keep you posted on how things are going. Feel free to live vicariously through me. Although you might be bored doing so, because I spend most of my time playing around on my computer.                     So, in the ever-continuing search for my motivation, I decided to research Boot Camp workouts. These are workouts designed to simulate military-style physical training for one hour a day. Fun, right? Yeah. Fun.  The one place I could find in NYC that does Boot Camps is a company called  urlLink Platoon Fitness . They give you three free workouts, so Virginia and I decided that we would give one a whirl this morning. The catch: They meet at 5:30. In the morning. Since the meetings are in  urlLink Central Park , Virginia and I had to get up at 4:30 so we could catch a subway, transfer at Times Square, and make it there on time.    The good news : Central Park is awesome. It's one of my favorite places in New York, and it's even better when there's no one there and it's brisk outside. We got a big ol' dose of 'brisk/no one around' while we were there this morning.   The bad news : Apparently, and no one informed me of this, military physical training is challenging. Not much resting. Not much walking. Lots of running up lots of stairs. Your reward for running and climbing? Push-ups! And sit-ups! And various other ways of having pain-inducing fun!   Yes, it was fun. Yes, Virginia and I had a helluva workout. No, I won't be going back, and not necessarily because I didn't like it. I just can't swing the whole 4:30 reveille thing, especially when I'm doing stuff most nights for my improv internships. But  you  should go! Have fun! Let me know how you like it! My guarantee: if they begin offering afternoon/evening classes, I will give it another try. Until then, don't call me until after 8:00am, at the earliest.                     So, I got into Chicago City Limits! I got a call from Paul Zuckerman, the artistic director. He said that they had enjoyed my audition and would like to work with me. Then he asked that I come in for a meeting with him to discuss the commitment the group is going to take.   That part makes me nervous.  It shouldn't be a big deal. I'm fairly aware of what the group requires time-wise. It's my understanding that they rehearse Wednesday nights and travel 1-2 weekends per month, sometimes taking longer trips of up to 10 days. I'm guessing they're just going to suggest that I keep on temping so I'm available for gigs. Something like that.  But I still get nervous when someone wants to discuss the 'commitment' something requires.    The good news:  I got into something I auditioned for. That's a nice thing.  urlLink Plus, they travel all over the country.  My hope is that the group will, at some point, give me the chance to see some of my friends and family... That'd be a nice perk.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
