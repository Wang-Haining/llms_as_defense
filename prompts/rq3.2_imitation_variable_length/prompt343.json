  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic:\n\n                 so today i learned some hard stuff.  a) my anxiety is merely confused and repressed anger b) my husband is a petulant child who will never grow up so long as i keep treating him as such. c) my goal right now needs to be finishing school, no matter what the cost d) if i keep going the way i am i'll never go anywhere  i think the bit about my husband gets the award for 'thing that i'm most aware of but least willing to deal with'   i saw my counsellor today and she really put the screws to this whole notion i have of taking care of him as though he is a child. she explained to me that from my perception (what i had told her) my husband was a child, taking a free ride, not worrying about the consequences and not respecting me or taking me serriously. of course i've known that for quite some time, but still... it's easier to think that there's something i can fix in him.   but that's not how it's gonna be. no, she told me that if i continue to try and fix him i'll just ignore my own needs and neither of us will ever get out of the vicious circle. aside from which, i'm this simmering, seething ball of resentment and letting him treat me the way he does only adds fuel to my fire.  which ties in nicely with the anxiousness, actually. since the more i burn, the less i can actually release. lacking an appropriate anger outlet, i convert anger into anxiety/panic/stress, call it what you will, it's all produced right here, in my brain.  which raises some more interesting questions concerning what else might be going on or not in my life. the eating thing? yeah that has absolutely got to stop. i can hardly stand the sight of myself anymore, even though i have no idea what i look like. wonder if that's normal. i see a picture of myself and i feel like a stranger, grotesque, phony, unstopable.  so i got the atkins books, two of em, should be enough to get me started. at least then i won't have food as a crutch to lean on when i don't feel like coping in any sort of healthy manner. too, i think it will help me to feel in control of myself and that, i'm sure, will go a long way towards making me feel more... alive.  next up... REALITY: is it really real?                          geeze louise i feel so bad!   my partner and his cauc bitch (there's a story there) gave me a lift home tonight which was cool cause a) i'm lazy and b) they're just really great to hang with but shortly after they dropped me off they just about t-boned some dude up at the end of my street so naturally my knickers are in a twist the second he called me to let me know. i feel like somehow i'm responsible for that dillhole that turned in front of them (yes, against the light)   feh, i serriously need to unclench! they're both totally fine, just a little shaken  in other news - had a big pow-wow with the elders at work today. worlds of fun, oi. to be fair it could have been alot more painful but really all this meeting accomplished was to cement my confidance in my decision to 'pursue other opportunities'. the role of corporate shill has never sat particularily well with me and so it is that it's become harder and harder for me to work with a straight face. i can't be bothered to give a damn about a single, solitary thing in the place and truely, as a purported leader, that's a problem. oh hell, i know that's not true - i still care about people and things that happen at work and i wouldn't  really  want to wreck everything before i leave... that's the real problem for me: having to reconcile my burning desire to be fully completely apathetic towards everyone and everything with my inherent mother-hennery.  one with some sort of mental health backgroud would likely ask me if it would be easier if i just didn't give a shit - hell yeah it would! and that's why i  try  but still the little angel on the other shoulder says...  honesty - that's where it's at folks but how do we get there? i know i have trouble telling myself the truth with alarming frequency. but really, lying, denying, defying... doesn't get you any further, doesn't make you feel any better in the long run so what's the attraction?  to heavy for me tonight but something i'll likely think about for some time comming.                             well well well...  so paul's first day at his new job didn't go quite as well as planned.  he slept all day sunday then was up all night monday, despite my repeated nagging.  he got to work on time but apparently it al went downhill from there.  he found the work hard on him physically and no doubt he was pretty exhausted as well and he ended up shooting himself though the finger with a nail gun. following this he puked several times and blacked out.  he was home shortly after 1:00.  so now we're both unemployed and up the creek as it were.    of course there was discussion about it tonight and of course when he came home i cried.  i patched him up as best i could but all i could think was 'this is your fault' which isn't verra helpfull.    i'm trying pretty hard not to accuse him and not to flip out all together and just let go of my tenuous grip but it ain't easy.  i like to believe that one day things will be better, maybe even good but that day is not today.  oh yes, and my colon apparently hates me again.  i just don't know what i'm going to do .                         so today i'm thinking about all the people who have fallen out of my life in the past however long.&nbsp; so many people that i've dismissed but maybe that wasn't it. maybe they've passed me by.&nbsp; not all of them i suppose.&nbsp; and maybe the more telling thing is the people who have stayed arround.&nbsp; it can't be v. easy putting up with me when i get in high dudgeon, which isn't rare. either way, i've decided to compose a list. heeeeeeeeeeeeerreee we go, no. 10     &nbsp;   the posse: matt, darnell, vaness, mena    remaining: mena     &nbsp;   tim's days:&nbsp; jodi, cathleener    remaining: none     &nbsp;   school days:&nbsp; mena,&nbsp; jessie,&nbsp; shanda, susan, natalie, katherine    remaining: mena     &nbsp;   ipsos people:&nbsp; angela and&nbsp;sandy, daniel, tabitha, mo, christine, ronnie... too many to count    remaining: well rachelle got custody of sandy and angela and the rest, idk     &nbsp;   others: old boyfriends, old work friends, old school friends, just fell out of touch     &nbsp;   well this has been a pretty good exercise in self-depressive introspection.&nbsp; i think i'll stop now     &nbsp;   buh-bye     &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;                           today we saw Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.  Lovely film but quite a bit different than what I had remembered from the book.  V.interesting to see the developping personalities of our young heroes though, to me it's played out much more vividly on film.  Which is not to say that it is in any way lacking in the books, it's just a lot more subtle.    and on the crap side of the coin, my husband, who quit his job yesterday to take a new job in construction, just found out that the new job in construction isn't the sure bet it initially appeared to be.  not only has the guy hedged on giving him an accurate wage (he told me 10-12 but he wrote down 8-12) but now he's telling paul that he may have overhired and what with the rains and all... well fuck.  where would that leave us?!?!? i know i'm still not working yet.  i was really hoping to hear back from the hospital today but i guess not so tomorrow it's no more bullshit.  no more waiting arround for mannah from heaven. it's time to go full bore on the resumee warpath.  submit submit submit to every place who'll take one.  as many as i can online then bat clean up by doing cold calls in the am and seeing what I can't see from there.    the sad reality of our situation is we have exhausted not only our reserves but those of our familes as well.  our government is no help whatsoever.  apparently since i just went to school they're not worried and despite the fact that paul is only bringing in somewhere in the 950$/mo range (well below the poverty line) we're apparently too rich for social assistance.  i can't collect EI because i haven't made 700 hours since my last claim and paul may or may not be able to but even if he can that's only 55% of the 950 he was making before and will not take effect for two weeks or possibly even three.  what a fuckaroo...                         Visualization  it's a very important part of things, isn't it? (write that down, timmy.)  I can visualize myself as a non-smoker, I can visualize myself at a healthy weight, I can visualize myself happy and fulfilled.  All of those things help me make it through the day but none of which, all by its onesie, has the power to change anything. Id est, thinking healthy isn't enough; concrete physical changes need to occur.  But i think the more a person's thoughts return to a specified ideal, the more likely it is that they will muster up the juice to take the requisite steps.  Which means that probably all my little daydreams about how I think things should be will help me to eventually achieve those things.  The temptation is entirely too strong to just let it slide and figure that it will come out in the wash.  You know what keeds? It WON'T come out in the wash, not without some elbow grease anyway.  And although I am babbling and making verra little sense, even unto myself, I can 't  help but feel this is progress.  Big interview comming up on Friday.  Hope my mind/body cooperate.  I don't think I should have too many issues but you never can tell right? Okay, that's bullshit.  In my heart of hearts I truely believe that I will sail through all the little tests they've got with flying colours and get a 30, 000$/yr job and be well liked and respected by all for my professionalism and sparkling wit.  This, of course, is not bloody likely but my inside voices don't much care for the petty details.  Paul had his testing and interview today.  He seems cautiously optimistic.  Tough to tell though; we aren't the most frank of couples, though work is continually in progress.  Funny thing about that... I keep wanting him to 'open up', 'share his feelings'.  Him, not so much.  He doesn't like to talk about stuff like this so he either clams up all together or gets insanely defensive.  I gotta say it really makes me mental when he flips over my questions, sentiments or  *gasp!* criticism back on to me.  In the history of recorded time has there ever been a man who died from giving a straight answer?!?!?!  From what I can tell there must have been a great many and they must have suffered unspeakably horrible deaths to have scared the rest of the lot away from it.  love, peace and chicken grease         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
