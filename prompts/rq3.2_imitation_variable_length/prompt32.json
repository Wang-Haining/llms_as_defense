It was the final blow to end all blows which made the sunset on happiness. I find myself more alone than I may have exaggerated in my prior writings to add emphasis. This feeling makes me feel like I cannot breathe, but I have to sigh. It makes me unable to swallow for fear of nausea. It is this dull pain through my chest and stomach, but recurrences play like an old movie which I know all the lines to in my mind. Each like the dagger being twisted deeper and deeper. Feeling paralyzed and helpless gave way to hopelessness upon reflection. How could something one thought to be so beautiful and pure turn so ugly and gray? I must go on and search for the radiance I used to possess and searched for. If nothing else this has been a lesson well learned, though these lessons are better not taught. All one needs at this point is tranquility to remove the sorrow. My mind has a hard time settling and now it cannot move on.      Perhaps its the achy body from improper sleep talking, but I started thinking about the artists. Those back in the age of the Renaissance, particualrly. Those men and imexpressable talent and their works have withstood the test of time. Shakespeare, Milton, Homer, Lord Byron, Emily Dickenson, etc. So it begs the question to be asked. Undoubtedly, there are some people who's talent is no great that it is a tower and an immeasurable ruler to compare others by. But is there an artistic part in everyone? Somepeople (me for sure)would kill to be able to paint or draw. We love the work so much that to be able to contribute to society in that way would fill us with the most happiness... But alas, I can draw only cartoons, and I doubt the Louve will ever want a characature of my 10th grade Chemistry professor on its walls, next to greats. So I an a faithful patron at museums and try to live vicariously throuhg the works of those who suffered and gave their lives for their art. So that it wasn't in vain!  I was having a pretty yucky day a few days/weeks ago and I saw Rob, and he got me some Godiva chocolates... but of course it was 94 degrees so it melted... but the gesture was sweeter than the candy. We have been having some tough times... fighting a lot.. but we have been working through it and I think things will be ok. I know my moods can be a little annoying at times, but I think the way I make people feel when I am in a better mood more than makes up for it.. I hate to toot my own horn but BEEP BEEP! Thnaks hunny! I miss you... though I don't say it often enough for ya!     After all the guy hating thing, I found a fella who is a nice guy!!!!! Ok, he is the nicest guy! We hung out in LA and it was the best-est time. See, fun enough to use made up words for.. At any rate, I don't even know how to describe him because he is so special. He is totally selfless and caring, but not in a sissy wierdo kind of way. We aren't completely opposites, but we aren't the same, but I don't know. The only thing that is great is the usual stuff that bothers me and makes me worry doesn't. And its hilarious how he is so concerned with Michelle (best friend for those who haven't met her yet) finding flaws in him so things aren't like 'too good to be true'. I don't know, I like the way I feel when I talk to him and .... I'm gonna stop all this talk because I think I'm rambling a little too much here. (Sorry Rob  *wink wink*)  Besides that... more randomness. I haven't been able to get passed an idea that is so simple: Time has never stopped for anyone. Even Jesus was a slave to it. There has never been anyone who didn't have to turn old, who lived forever, remained a child for eternity, etc. It's a fascnating notion really that everything must give way. Water can dissolve absolutely anything through time. Time is so great there is no way of expressing its greatness. How long is infinity and forever? This does help one's everyday struggles as well. Though we may be completely finite, there is comfort in knowing 'this too shall pass.' Everything must come to an end and a new beginning is waiting to get started. Pain can not last forever, niether can sorrow. Though life is full of these emotions, take solace that everyone is on this adventure and carries the same fears and loathings as torches through the endless tunnel of life. They are not permenant and do come and go like other emotions. Some go on to the end where the light has teased and begged them. Others are weary and have stopped on the sides to catch their breath. And still there are those who have stopped all together going or even starting and trying.  \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
