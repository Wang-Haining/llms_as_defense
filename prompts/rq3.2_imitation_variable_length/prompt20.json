  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic:\n\n           Guess what...a fren of mine by the name of Zai called, he hated when I call him that, the kelkatu man.heheeh,hmm...he sounded suprise. He asked me, ' Do you know that .....in your CC,' I said ' Yeah,Ive discussed it with Ayu,' The matter of the fact was, I dont really care...I mean the C.C stuff and more...Im in cloud nine you see and the only thing I can think off when Im marking and stuff like that is to think about my dear Khai in Taiwan.Has he eaten,taken his bath or the most important thing does he look at the stars every night and think of me, like I think of him.ehehhe.    The irony part here, is that Ive known him...what like nearly two months perhaps and the impact he gave me.I have to admit, the first time I met him,it was a mutual thing, a fren thing, like I meet my other frens. Then goes on to the next meeting plus the hours we hang on the phone.hmm...kita boleh bergayut berjam-jam.    Seldom people can just have the same chemistry bonding with me and the one that I want to be with is not just any Tom, Dick or Harry, he must be confident but at the same time humble... Any Tom, Dick or Harry can be found anywhere,under the drain,clubhouses,brushing their ego or just looking at themselves in the mirror and telling it straight to their face that they are big time losers.   Being in a relationship is not just uttering a few words like  I love you  or  I want you  , being true to each other,and to truly feel at lost when the other party is not around. Nevertheless,his picture or his last words somehow cure the emptiness inside.  I don't understand on how sometimes relationship is build on  a stupid lie. To be truthful is a responsibility to the loved ones.When you commit to someone, you don't only give your words...its more than that.     Something to digest ....Les Brown - I believe there are three kinds of people. There are winners, who know what they want and understand their potential and the possibilities. They take life on. Next are losers, who don't have a clue as to who they are. They allow circumstances to shape their lives and their self-image. I believe there is a third group as well. This consists of potential winners whose lives are just slightly out of alignment. I call them wayward winners...                  I was surfing, when I saw an article on one of the websites...saying that Dikir barat is a no good influential tingy... so being a kepo person...I replied...  Dikir Barat A Waste of Time…  “ I wept because I have no shoes….until I meet a man with no feet. – anonymous “  Dikir Barat is an art form, an expression of the mind and at the same time the soul. Based on the few drop of experiences, it is sad to see someone concluding that “  dikir barat is like poison to the Malay society - Irfan Kasban”. We should judge problems or matter arising from different angles and perspectives. Stereotyping on a certain issue will only make the picture hazy and therefore the conclusion would be devastating. To look at our society and to pinpoint that dikir barat is the caused to all the injustice that is happening in the Malay society is another grave mistake. The youngsters are becoming what they are today is not due to dikir barat but another bigger picture which is the family unit. Everything has to be nurture within the family unit itself. The role modelling of parents which does play an important role especially when money is always the main agenda when living our life as Singaporeans. Parents have no time for their children and thinking that money can replace any form of communication between a mother and a child. Thus, children are being brought up without instilling ethics and moral value, which is the foundation of any great society. To the younger brother Irfan, this you have to realise that wearing a hijab is important for a muslimah. Then again, to wear one and to sing on stage is an irony which must not be blend together. I shall no touch on these much further.  “Janji Melayu”, every group has this problem. It is not only in dikir barat, shall I say it in general that it intersects our everyday life. If we were to look into the history of the word Janji Melayu, I have to search for my Sejarah Melayu and ask all the great philosophers, which could take years. Then again, in looking at things we have to keep our mind clear and no stereotyping.      From my own judgement, without dikir barat the ethics of our youngster would be much worse that what it is portrayed today. Dikir barat teaches us the value of commitment, brotherhood, responsibility and being confident in what we believe in. From my personal view, dikir barat had taught me to believe in what I am capable of doing and to stand on my rights when the need arises. It teaches me to be confident. As a teacher, enriching my students about the beauty of dikirbarat and magical Malay language used in the lyrics is overwhelming. I am proud to say that once upon a time I used to be among those rowdy audiences in a dikir competition and experiences are things that last forever. To be passionate about this art form is not merely by writing it in poetry or repeating “I’m passionate about dikir barat “ again and again without realising the real meaning. To be passionate, is being able to commit and defend this beautiful culture of ours and to do that… we have to respect it first.
