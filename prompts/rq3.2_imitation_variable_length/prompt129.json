  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic:\n\n       In today's topsy turvy world we often go looking after things that are new and progressive.  The latest idea out of some philosopher's book or some think tank seem to dominate political circles.  The new fads coming out of the music and movie industry, trying to push the envelope even further, having already broken traditional boundaries.  Now, before some people fly off the handle, don't take this to mean I support censorship of any of these above mentioned things.  The first amendment of the Constitution guarantees them the right to produce what they will.  However, we must make a distinction between what is permissible by law and what is moral.  Lying to your mother about taking the car is legal, but not moral.  Committing adultery behind your wife's back is legal, but not moral.  Refusing to comply with an immoral law is illegal, however, it is virtuous.  Murder, however, is both illegal and immoral since it violates that persons moral right to the life given them, and it harms society by devaluing human personhood to the level of animality.    This is where tradition and culture are so important to the liberal society.  What do I mean by liberal?  Liberal in the classical sense; a society which recognizes that to allow virtue, you must also allow vice.  One that values the life of everyone from conception to death.  To do this you must allow the human person to spend their money as they will, do with their property as they will, and to think and believe what they will; all within the limit of reason.  By this limit I mean that as long as they are not adversely affecting the natural rights of another.  For example, if they spent their money on hiring a hit man to kill you, that is clearly immoral and illegal and falls outside of their rights.  Or, poisoning you land with radioactive waste, when you clearly know that it will irradiate other peoples land.    As an Anglo-Saxon I value my cultural heritage going back to the 5th century.  Anglo-Saxon society brought us Shakespeare, Elliot, Ricardo, Jefferson, Washington, Calhoun, and countless others.  The Anglo-Saxon virtues of honour and loyalty to ones lord and friends, as well as rugged survival instinct that has allowed us to endure tyranny and invasion both from foreign enemies and often our own government.  The Anglo-Saxon tradition helps me realize who my people are and I feel joy in this.  These comments are considered racist by some, that is, by those who hate Anglo-Saxon culture.  Feminists, black racists, neocons, socialists, and hosts of other want me hate the fact that my ancestors lived in a deeply religious and patriarchal society.  Anglo-Saxon men are evil, it is good when they are killed or oppressed.  They deserve punishment for their ancestors actions.  Nonsense.  If there was no Anglo-Saxon cultural heritage for America to build upon, we would not have the concept of freedom.  Germanic cultures (of which the Anglo-Saxons are the standard bearers) resisted every attempt to be dominated by those who claimed superiority over them.  The Romans spent hundreds of years in failed campaign after failed campaign.  Our Celtic brothers of Gaul fought for freedom to the point were almost all of their population was massacred by Julius Caesar in his Gallic Wars.  Society is held together by common beliefs, respect for other inherent rights, faith, music, marriage, friendship, and trust.  This is what tradition is and why it matters.  By forsaking all of this, we turn our back upon all of human civilization for nearly 10,000 years.  I don't care if you are Anglo-Saxon, Slavic, Arab, Chinese, Latin, Jewish, or whatever.  Just realize that these traditions give us the combined knowledge of all our ancestors.  They weren't right about everything, but, they at least deserve a fair hearing.                 Article by Victor Davis Hanson  urlLink here . I find myself more than a little dumbfounded when I read articles such as this. It's hardly an original message- The National Review and other neoconservative publications have been hammering the mantra of 'The War in Iraq is the only moral thing to do' for a year now. Davis' thoroughly banal sermonizing gives me the urge to point him to a much more important sermon- Jesus' Sermon on the Mount.  Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the Earth.  Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.   Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God.   If we are to discuss morality and the National Review, I must remind you that this is the magazine that has writers who have expressed their desire to have the troops 'kick one for them' after the Abu Ghraib crimes became public. It's the magazine that believes that it's ok to kill 10,00 civilians in a war, and millions more in a blockade, as long as you get what they deem good results. And it's the magazine that sees nothing wrong with what Sherman and his troops did to the city of Atlanta in the War for Southern Independence. They may preach morality, but when it comes down to it, they're relativists.                   urlLink This must be the product of government schooling.   Let's look at some quotes.   You think Iraq's a quagmire? Lincoln's ''new birth of freedom'' bogged down into a century long quagmire of segregation, denial of civil rights, lynchings. Does that mean the Civil War wasn't worth fighting? That, as Al Gore and other excitable types would say, Abe W. Lincoln lied to us?   Why I most certainly do think reconstruction was horrible, and that Lincoln was a liar! No, the Yankee invasion of the South was NOT justified. Go read DiLorenzo, Wilson, and other revisionist scholarship on the war, and then tell me that Lincoln was right.    hey had victims galore back in 1863, but they weren't a victim culture. They had a lot of crummy decisions and bureaucratic screwups worth re-examining, but they weren't a nation that prioritized retroactive pseudo-legalistic self-flagellating vaudeville over all else. They had hellish setbacks but they didn't lose sight of the forest in order to obsess week after week on one tiny twig of one weedy little tree.   Wrong again! If not for Lincoln's dictatorial policies, Delaware, Maryland, and even New York may have drifted out of the union! And let us not forget that Lincoln shut down more than three hundred newspapers during his war on the South, effectively silencing criticism of his regime.    Playing by Gore-Kennedy rules, the Union would have lost the Civil War   If he means by telling the truth about the motives, implications, and costs of the war, he's absolutely right. However, as I have said before, Lincoln didn't allow that to happen because he silenced, shut down, and exiled opposition. Hell, he even arrested the head of the Supreme Court!   Mr. Steyn has unwittingly proved the point of the paleoconservative/libertarian anti-war camp, and for that I drink to his ignorance.                  Article  urlLink here .     In fact, it could be argued that one of the most serious emerging threats to human rights today is Amnesty's decision to spend a disproportionate share of its limited resources attacking the United States--at the opportunity cost of focusing attention on governments that are slaughtering, enslaving, torturing, and imprisoning millions of people around the world....   I think Ghitis is drawing a false dichotomy between 'governments that are slaughtering, enslaving, torturing and imprisoning millions' and 'The United States.' The US Govt. embargo of Iraq has led to over one million deaths. Ten thousand more, at least, have died as 'collateral damage.' Similar 'collateral damage' is also found in Afghanistan. Say what you will about our motives, they do not justify this level of death. Let's not forget that the only reason Saddam was even in power was because we propped him up as a counterbalance to the Ayatollah Khomeini, whom also only came to power because of US meddling.   And if we are to talk slavery, let's talk about the legitimacy of the very existence of the State. If we reject slavery, and define slavery as a condition of subjection or submission characterized by lack of freedom of action or of will, then we must also reject the state. Allow me to illustrate-  1. Slavery is immoral 2. Slavery is a condition of subjection or submission characterized by lack of freedom of action or of will 3. The State is legitimate.   One cannot hold two of those views without rejecting a third- The State's existence is only supported by the subjugation of a segment of the population through taxation, coercion, and intimidation- slavery.                  The Libertarian Party  urlLink nominated it's candidate for president  yesterday. Catallarchy has an  urlLink interesting article  on the matter and I think I'll weigh in on it.  To be blunt, I'm for the total abolition of the state. Not limited government, not constitutional republicanism, but market based anarchy. To me, the LP and other mainstream libertarian organizations are acting foolish. They're spending so much money on getting in good with the government that they arenâ€™t taking the time to support and take part in major research and educational efforts. I hate to sound pessimistic, but the LP isn't going to make a splash anywhere anytime soon if they do not have a major refocusing of their efforts from electoral politics to education. Lew Rockwell wrote a great  urlLink column  on the issue a little while back. I borrow from him when I say that to become a bureaucrat to fight bureaucracy, to join the state in order to roll it back, makes as much sense as fighting fire with matches and gasoline.                  Story  urlLink here . The neocons have actually been calling for a gas tax for a while now, but now supposedly free market Chicago economist Gary Becker is calling for a gas tax as well. Slate does get something right though:  ' The irony is that the free market forces that many of these writers normally extol are actually working. Americans are buying more Priuses and fewer Hummers. Ford is rushing a hybrid SUV into production. Car-buyers need to be bribed to purchase gas-guzzlers. The Wall Street Journal reported today that U.S. automakers have jacked up SUV rebates by an average of 17 percent from last year. Givebacks on tanks like the Cadillac Escalade and Lincoln Navigator are up 50 percent.  '  This is very similar to what the government's own statistics show about the period after WW2 and before the EPA. During that time, emissions were down about 25%, and gas consumption in vehicles was down in similar numbers.  All of this before any regulatory agency was established to watch over the industry.  So... why did we need that agency again? When asked in the early 1990s, the head of the EPA could not answer that question.          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
