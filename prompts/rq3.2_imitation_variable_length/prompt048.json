  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic:\n\n             As a hurricane survivor myself ( urlLink Celia , 3 August 1970), I feel for our friends in Florida.  urlLink 'Much Stronger Than Expected'  was very much like the headline for  my  hurricane. We lived in Portland, Texas at the time (Celia's eye passed directly over Portland) and our house was completely destroyed. I was just short of 8 years old, but it left an indelible mark on me and who I am. To this day, I scoff at the weather: if there aren't four door 1969 Buicks getting tossed about by the wind, it just ain't a  storm .  I have a load of stories about the experience that I'll save for another time; now is the time for the Charlie survivors.  Here I sit, safe and dry and comfortable; with the lights (and the 'puter) still on and not having to worry about finding a safe place for my family to sleep or wondering where we'll get fresh water. And you are, too.  So if you can see your way clear to spare a few bucks; pony up at your local  urlLink RedCross  office. I'm sure that they have a 'Hurricane Charlie' fund set up. No cash? Give some blood. It's all good, it all helps.  If you have the time and are available, load the truck up with bottled water and diapers and cans of tuna and batteries and some bottled water and first aid kinda thingies and maybe a bottle of rum or two and some bottled water and your hammer and work gloves and sturdy boots and a couple of sheets of plywood and some bottled water and some 2 x 4s and some more water and some duct tape and some heavy gauge plastic sheeting and some bottled water and a couple of bottles of rum and head on down and help. Be sure to coordinate with the RedCross (do your own Google search, dammit), they can direct you to the communities that need the most help. When you get there, find the neighborhoods that were impoverished  before  Charlie and help there first.  BTW: If you ever wanted to know what a 'hero's welcome' felt like, stop at a Piggly Wiggly about 150 miles out and put a couple of dozen cases of popsicles / fudgesicles/ creamsicles on dry ice. Trust me, you hand a popsicle to an  adult  shortly after a hurricane and you'll be a hero. Just imagine how you'll look to the kids.                   urlLink Rachel Lucas  offers some excellent commentary on&nbsp;Flight 327.&nbsp; Go read&nbsp;all her posts in the 'Gimme Valium' series right now.  This whole 'Flight 327' thing should drive us all into some serious introspection:&nbsp; what would you have done if you were in Annie Jacobsen's seat?&nbsp; I'm semi-observant and obnoxious enough and my voice carries well; I'd like to think that I'd have been spouting out a very loud running Keith Jackson-esque play by play commentary regarding the goings-on in the cabin.&nbsp; What would I have done if I were travelling with my wife and children?&nbsp; Would I have been more vocal, or less?&nbsp; And why?&nbsp;   If there were Air Marshalls on the flight, what were they doing?&nbsp; The in-flight magazine is not that interesting.&nbsp; Picture all the sheeple, talking in hushed tones and passing notes, waiting for someone (else)&nbsp;to Do.Something.&nbsp; Are we still so deeply embedded in political correctness that the 'Todd Beemer'-type personality is rare?&nbsp; Where is the man (or woman) who would stand up and say 'Hey! WTF are you people doing?&nbsp; Sit down or we'll kick your ass'?&nbsp; To continue in&nbsp;the line of thinking that Rachel explores, prior to 11 September we had no frame of reference, no hard reasons to overcome our political correctness to question 14 Arab-looking men merely on the basis of their Arab-looking-ness.&nbsp; We have such a frame of reference now.&nbsp; I agree with her: the next time I get on a plane and see a congregation of Arab-looking men, I'm going to be singing like a canary, and not worry about who I piss off.  Go read Rachel's posts, follow the links&nbsp;and sit down and do some serious soul searching.  &nbsp;  I'm actually waiting for the left to bring Flight 327 up as an example of GWB's failure to do something about terrorism at home.&nbsp; It is an election year, after all.                    It's crap like  urlLink this &nbsp;that really frosts my cookies.&nbsp; Front page of yesterday's Moscow on the Huron edition of Pravda, above the fold, in a large font is this:&nbsp;  Talk of military draft persists despite denials; Some fear mandatory service is on the horizon. &nbsp; Of course, for the aging hippies at the AnnArbor News, it's always 1968.&nbsp;  &nbsp;      Rumors about a possible draft have been circulating for months, fueled in part by Web sites such as StopTheDraft.com, which claims the draft is just 'five minutes' away.        Fueled entirely by the left.&nbsp; There's no substance here, just wild-eyed speculation in smoke filled rooms after the bong has been refilled with the last of the 'good stuff'      Lawmakers say it is unlikely Congress would call for compulsory service in an election year, and that the Bush administration has taken steps in the short term to shore up gaps in troop strength.      'I don't think we're going to need to reinstate the draft,' said U.S. Sen. Carl Levin, Michigan's senior senator and the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee. 'The combination of recruitment and retention is doing fairly well. Some of the measures that have been taken will give us temporary respite from the draft possibility.'      &nbsp;              So anyway,&nbsp; The Missus and the kids and I were out and about the other evening, and she wanted to swing by the bookstore to pick up a book she wanted.&nbsp; I dropped her at the door of B.Noble-WaldenBarnes and went cruising the parking lot for a parking spot.&nbsp; Now, this particular bookstore is in AnnArbor (aka Moscow on the Huron) and shares a parking lot with Whole Foods, a hippy grocer of the first order.&nbsp; Being semi-observant, I started to take note of the bumper stickers on the cars parked in the lot.&nbsp; Discounting the 'local' and 'music' themed bumper stickers and focusing only on the political, there was a lot of what you'd expect for Moscow on the Huron: NARAL, NORML, GreenPeace, World Wildlife Fund, 'No Blank Check For Endless War', 'Not In My Name', Sierra Club, etc.&nbsp; I saw two cars with Howard 'Screamer' Dean stickers, two with 'GWB-04' type stickers, five with anti-GWB slogans, but only one car out of several hundred (500? more?) that had a john kerry bumper sticker.  &nbsp;   Only one.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  Only one kerry sticker, on&nbsp;the quintessential AnnArbor 12 year old Volvo.&nbsp; Two GWB bumper stickers (both on late model SUVs, I'm happy to report).&nbsp; In AnnArbor.&nbsp; I have to tell you, I was quite relieved.&nbsp; I mean, there I was, in the heart of liberal-ville, where sloganism via bumper sticker is  required.&nbsp;  Relieved, indeed.  &nbsp;  For the past several weeks I have been knocking about the notion that GWB might actually lose in November.&nbsp; (Read it correctly, not that 'kerry would win', because he can't win without GWB managing to lose the election).&nbsp; Polls, schmolls.&nbsp; I've long held the theory that in politics hatred is un-sustainable, eventually you have to come to the marketplace with ideas and vision.&nbsp; Your platform can't be simply 'I'm not Him'.&nbsp; And that's exactly what the left has been running on.&nbsp; Jebeezus, I can tell you more about algore's platform and positions on the issues than I know about  urlLink FATAC 's.&nbsp; The only time that pure hatred of a candidate or a Party has worked (for either side) was in 1976; when Gerald Ford died for Nixon's sins.  &nbsp;  What's my point, you may ask?&nbsp; Call me crazy, but I'm interpreting this as good news, from a 'boots in the dirt' perspective.&nbsp; Say what you will about AnnArbor liberals (don't get me started), but they're not complete idiots.&nbsp; The fact that there aren't more kerry / edwards bumper stickers out there, in what is arguably one of, if not the most liberal of cities in this country, speaks volumes about the left's resolve and search for substance.&nbsp; Now if I could only find the link for the  urlLink 'Ralph Nader for President in 04'  campaign, maybe we could swing this.....             \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
