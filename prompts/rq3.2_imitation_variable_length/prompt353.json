I just need to find some images. Tomorrow I'm going to school to scan my very own 'signature' and an ornamet that I drew...   I'm hoping to somehow turn them into proper images I can use on my website with this program (Macromedia Fireworks MX 2004). And I have no idea of how it works... oh shhhh.... it. Just realised that my thumb is covered in ink, lol! That's what you get from using a real ink calligraphy pen... But my ornament kicks ass :D It's worth the thumb.  Remember  NOT  to copy it :P Just reminding you in time...  I didn't remember how much time writing code can take! And it's a very simple code for that matter! But it's fun.... nice figuring out what's not working there and how to fix it...how to do things creatively, so that everything looks just right... This is the type of brain activity I like.... *sigh* maybe I should have become a programmer instead... lol. Nah, I like this as a hobby, that's all :)                                 ...and it's my dad's fault =P Kidding. Well, technically, I could be home right now, or going home today or tomorrow... but no, dad can't pick me up from the train station before saturday, so I have to rot here alone. All friends have gone to their homes... I've been desperately calling them and sms:ing them for company, lol. Pathetic... shouldn't be too hard to be alone for a couple of days. I want to get back home to meet my old friends. I miss them.  Hmm, I should sms Tanja and ask her about the horse :D I hope she's taking the whole thing seriously... I have my doubts, but I also know she adores her pets more than anything and treats them right. Hmm, just sms:ed her, and Sari too. I recently found out that Sari considers me as her closest friend, hmmm... I was a tiny bit surprised, but...well. She's a wonderful friend too. We're both kind of alike... at least in a sense that we don't talk much about very personal things.. feelings or stuff... Well, I don't know if she's really like that, but maybe she doesn't tell because I don't tell. Who knows.  Lol, sms:ing is taking my time now... I'm just making so many plans, son all my weekends will be full... gosh, I'm going to be broke before I even earn any money :P Nah, taking kind of easy the whole June, but when the payday comes...!!! Well, July is full of plans... barbeque parties, summer cottage parties, fun fair plans.... Well June's not going to be boring, cos my wonderful, lovable 9 year old(gosh she's so old!)niece is coming to visit. I love her sooo much. I'll make sure she has a lot of fun. I'll take her swimming, to playgarden, all kinds of places :) I might even bake her a nice strawberry cake (sure sign of summer) =)  Oh nooo...Sari invited me to Ruis Rock with her (a massive music festival event in Turku during one weekend). The tickets are expensive, but.... well anything for a friend =P And it's guaranteed fun too. We'll probably get just a 1 day ticket.  Hmm... I guess that's all. Got too busy sms:ing Bye for now.                \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
