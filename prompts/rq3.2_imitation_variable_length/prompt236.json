  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic:\n\n           “I am a whore I do confess/I put You on just like a wedding dress/And I run down the aisle/Run down the aisle/I'm a prodigal with no way home/I put You on just like a ring of gold/And I run down the aisle /Run down the aisle to You”   The lyrics are from the song 'Wedding Dress' on Derek Webb's new solo album.  Webb was formerly with Caedmon's Call.  As you can imagine, several retailers had trouble with these lyrics, along with others on the album.  Another song includes the word 'damned' in the context of being damned without God's salvation.  Derek actually agreed to edit the word from the final album after the prerelease was shunned by one particular, large retailer.  What was he thinking?  I know he's not commercially minded.  To compromise lyrics that were written from the heart to the Church seems to defeat the point of writing them in the first place.  After the 'damned' controversy, the initial retailer agreed to stock their shelves.  It was a different retailer in the South that had a problem with the 'whore' line in 'Wedding Dress'.  Thankfully, Webb maintained his artistic integrity (not to mention Biblical integrity) and refused to change the line which was inspired by the imagery in Ezekial 16.  If artists who are Christ followers are going to enter the world of secular poets and communicate with power, they must use the same tools that everyone else uses.  Or, at the very least, they must use the Bible - a book containing many words, including 'damned' and 'whore'.  My suggestion to Derek is that he make the art that the Lord has put in his heart and then present it to whomever will listen.  If the Church won't, maybe others will.  It wouldn't be the first time.                     My friend Greg is in Mozambique with a ministry team from Azusa Pacific University.  They are currently in rural Africa and on their blog, they described the church service they attended recently.  I was very interested by the description of worship and thought you might like it, too... :::::::::::::::::::::::: Church Here, worship isn’t just lead by one or two people. Once a song ends, someone from the congregation breaks out in a new song and everyone else falls in with them. Anyone can start a new song. There’s an accordion player stuck somewhere between the youth (up to 25-year-olds are called the youth here, so most of our team would be youth!) and the accordion would soon catch on, finding the right chord to accompany the singing.   As others had written, people dance here till the sweat rolls. Even the little kids dance. Africans really do have incredible rhythm and an amazing ability to harmonize!   Since this is a new church plant from “Mountain of Praise Church” (the ministry Pastor Rego and Mama Tanneken have founded), Pastor Rego first shared a little, just talking about some of the foundational stuff of their church. Then some women sang, and then the kids, and then other women again. Finally, Greg could preach and then Pastor Rego preached as well. Hence the 4 hours. :::::::::::::::::::::::::                     June 6th, we're going to be working on the instrumental tracks to Organic B, and Organic C.  For those who don't know, these are part of the 'unkept:organic' series of acoustic worship recordings for simple or house church worship use.  Organic 'A' has been a great success and we're excited about taking the quality up a level and recording some newer original songs that haven't yet been put on tape.   To go with the concept, Peter Schrock (our graphic designer/photographer at Unkept) came up with the idea of having an artful photograph of an organic fruit or vegetable on the cover of each project.  Instead of #1, #2, #3 albums - we have 'A', 'B', 'C' and so on.  Organic 'A' is known as the Apple album for its wonderfully  captured green apple.  (to view:  http://www.unkeptrecords.com/store.html/)  The fruit for unkept:organic 'B' is still up for grabs, but some options are the 'Banana' album, 'Berry' album, or 'Beet' album.  Despite the way some evil people might twist Banana into some sort of offensive phalic reference, I DO like the possiblity of this fruit  being on the cover.  Towards that end, I've begun to compose a new song that could serve as the title track and bring more cohesion to the theme.  Admittedly, it needs some work but I thought I'd share it with you.  I'm open to comments and constructive feedback.  Remember though, this is an artist putting himself out there - I'm naked, and vulnerable.  Please be honest yet kind.  Thanks!  HOLY BANANA verse1 'Oh Lord, make my life long  Like a banana from Mexico May my pages yellow as I grow old in your Light Make my life 'a peeling' to others I don't want to slip on the discarded skin of the evil one I want to be a fruit for You' (I'm not sure about this line)  chorus 'We are Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy Whole big bunch of bananas Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy Big, big bunch of bananas'  Thoughts???                     During intermission, Greg asked me what I thought of the music.    Well, I am a Mozart fan, but probably not as much of a fan as I am of some of the Romantic period composers like Brahms or Chopin.  Though Mozart's music is complex in melody, harmony, and rhythm, it can sometimes become boring and seem pedantic after hearing large portions of it in one sitting.  I'm probably the pedantic one, nevertheless, I've been seeking more specific reasons for my vague 'boredom' with Mozart when taken in, hours at a time.  I've determined that for me, it comes down to harmony and melodic endings.  Though Mozart's music often has complex harmonic shifts sometimes coming at unexpected times, his melodies hardly ever fail to land back on the 'root' or 'one' of the diatonic scale.  In case you are not familiar with these musical terms, what I am talking about can be illustrated by humming a tune we all know, 'Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star'.  Though this melody was written by Beethoven it does the same thing that much of Mozart music does melodically.    Hum the tune, noticing the starting note - the 'Twink...' note, if you will.  This is the 'root' note or 'one' of the major scale from which this melody is written.  After singing the entire song, we return back to the same note on the last word, 'are.'  Some may say this melodic turn sounds comfortable and resolved, however others (myself included) might feel that it can sound trite, too final, or simplistic.  I am in no way trying to belittle the amazing musical gifts of either of these composers before whom my own musical composition skills seem like rudimentary abilities.  What I am trying to communicate is that living in the year 2004 and having the privilege of experiencing all the music that followed Mozart including all the romantic composers, the impressionistic composers (Ravel, Debussy), Traditional Jazz through modern Jazz, and even modern avant garde orchestral music, the 'ears' of today's musician - if well listened - are used to less 'settled' harmonies and melodic turns.  The more complex harmonies of Chopin's piano music foreshadowed the extended harmonies of contemporary jazz in its richness and disonance.  Strangely, as one listens to more disonant music, the music comes to sound less disonant and more familiar.  Perhaps this is why after the first two acts of 'Le Nozze di Figaro' I was longing for some unresolved music, just as the plot at the end of act II was lacking in resolution.  But, what I told Greg was...'I like it.'         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
