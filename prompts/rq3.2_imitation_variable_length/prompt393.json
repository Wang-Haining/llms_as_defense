My aunt and her boys is all we have been talking about for a day and a half now...and whenever I think of it, it makes me sad.  I get tears in my eyes.     And the living situation that they are in right now isn't helping either...and noone sees that but my mom, my aunt alma, and now thankfully my oma!          I'm just tired from crying...we need to hear some positive news for once.  Or something good needs to happen....fast!  We are all slowly starting to think the worse.           Amanda starts her second round of treatments at the end of the month.  They are giving her some sort of modified version of chemotherapy.  But everyone at home knows what happened the first time she had chemo....          My mom, who is ever-springing fountain of hope and faith, is slowly giving up on her as well...and it hurts me to no end to see my mom suffer through all of this too.  I just wish there was something I could do.  More so, something for those boys.  I need to have them here with us...my mom needs them here.  Zach and Connor want to be here...but Amanda and Ann don't see that.  They don't see that they are miserable.  I jsut want them here!          On a better note, our basement is halfway done and we get our new stuff in a week!!  We will still be living in a construction zone, but it will all be worth it in the end.          Stef's birthday is on Saturday....so I will definately have to go and see her for her birthday...I can't cut myself off from them entirely...I need my friends too!  However, I did cancel the pool party that was originally going to run tomorrow....I just want to spend time with the family right now.  I think that is my most important priority!!          Anyhow, I called Andrew tonight at 8:00 before I went out for the night.  I was kinda frustrated that he didn't call before that.  So he is calling me tomorrow when he is off work so we can talk.  It should be an interesting conversation to say the least.  It was  nice to hear his voice today though.  I haven't heard it in over a week and half.  So i will be sure to fill you all in as tothe happenings with my dear boyfriend.          Anyway, I am gonna try and get some decent sleep tonight.  Tomorrow is a carefree day that is going to spent lounging by the pool with my family.  Tomorrow would be perfect if Zach and Connor were there!          Goodnight all!  I love you!     Nat                             Hey All!     Today was a pretty good day I guess.  I got up at 2 this afternoon after falling asleep sometime shortly after 4.  I had so much on my mind last night!  Plus midnights really mess with your body!          I ended up going to see Steph at work at 230am and got myself a tea...she was working with supervisor Jen, who we both don't like...so I thought I would go save her for at least a half hour!  We had a good chat too!  I really needed to!  I had to get some stuff of my chest about Andrew, and how much I really miss him and still wondering why the only contact I've had from him in a week now is an email I got from him on thursday.  I keep shifting back and forth as to my feelings towards him and I really don't know what to do....arg!  I'm getting more confused everyday!          We are all going to my aunt Ann's cottage tomorrow to see my aunt Amanda, Zach and Connor!  I miss the boys like crazy!  I actually hate not having them around...life is a little empty with them not around everyday!  We are actually going up there tomorrow because my aunt Amanda wanted us all up there to visit.  She is on morphine now, so she is mentally alert for bit through the day to actually visit.            She did her will yesterday with my uncle Marty.  And now my mom is paranoid that if anything happens to my aunt Amanda, she won't get custody of her boys.  I told my mom not to think of that right now and just concentrate on helping Amanda feel more comfortable and do what she can for the boys and Amanda right now.  I just can't wait to see them all tomorrow!!          So today we finished peeling the wall paper out of our hallway and now we only have to clean two more walls of our bathroom and strip one more small wall of the hallway (if any of you who have been in myhouse, the small wall on the way up to  mine and Brads' rooms).  So it looks good.  As good as can be expected when we are in the middle of renovations!!  I'm so excited to see the final product!!           We also decided today that we are going to get the bigger television that we wanted at the Brick!  My brother and I figured, bigger room, bigger t.v.!  26' is sooo much better than 20'!!          In any case, I'm gonna head out for now...I will write more tomorrow!     Love y'all!                             Okay....so I've realized that I just miss Andrew like crazy!     I miss seeing him, talking to him, being around him...     I just get to thinking about him working so much and it sucks, no doubt about that!  And he does need to concentrate on his work, but concentrating on me once in a while isn't too hard...so I think at least!  A simple email would have done! I just realized, that when I was talking to a co-worker last night, I realize how much I miss him...how much I just want to see him...how well he treats me...how much he does love  me...     I guess a week of nothing can make a girl question. And i know I shouldn't question, but just the fact that this is how my last relationship ended, it scares me, really scares me!     I just wrote him an email of how i feel about him and what he means to me!  Maybe I'm an idiot for doing that...but I can't help how I feel about him!  He is everything to me!     Some of you who know what is going on and maybe have read my past posts are gonna shoot me in the head, but I can't help how I feel....     Anyway, I'm off for the night...I will write more tomorrow!     night y'all!         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
