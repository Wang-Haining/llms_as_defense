I was sad about something else and thought that just like when we were dating, talking to him might make me feel better. But he didn't pick up the phone and so I got even sadder.  I am ok, though. I am at the stage where I'm beginning to see some benefits to us no longer dating.  I can also now see myself without him and I can see myself with someone other than him. Just as I can see him with sommone other than me--albeit probably not without laughing. Cuz I just know she's gonna either be beastly or brain-dead, with no fine balance.  I guess you could say, I've come to an acceptance. And yet I still feel sad. I feel sad because of the good times. I miss them.   The thing about loss is that it's always the things you take for granted that you wind up missing the most.   I popped myself some popcorn just now and I kept thinking about how we'd wait for them to go to bed, then we'd smoke, eat popcorn, jokingly arugue about whose turn it was to go get the popcorn out of the microwave.   I put it in. Yeah but I put it in and then took it out last time. You're more stoned than I am. They're not gonna wake up. But then I have to go grab the bowls, too. No you don't, just open the bag and we can eat it out of the bag. Then my hands get greasy. I mean open the bag so that it's like a sheet. Then the popcorn will spill everywhere. No it won't. If you go get it, I'll do it, and I promise it won't spill, okay? Fine.   We used to put the popcorn in for 2 minutes and 45 seconds. Now I pop it for 2 minutes..popcorn for the single woman.  He used to eat the kernels. I'd laugh at him and offer him my popcorn instead. But he always refused, saying, 'No, I just like the kernels. They're good.'  Maybe that's why I notice the little things (when I'm not drunk, that is). Like candy, small things are intended to be savoured.  Shitty analogy of the week, number 17.                 Turns out I had this blog on the wrong time zone. Trying to figure out what time zone I belonged in was made difficult by the fact that I don't know the difference between the pacific and atlantic ocean, much less which one I'm closest to.   But anyway, an old friend, now avoidance of mine, once told me, 'I'd write much better zines if I weren't so afraid someone would come along and steal a particularily ingenius line that I'd written.' For the longest time, I thought this was just an excuse for his being lazy or having no talent, possibly both. But now that I'm blogging, I do find myself censoring certain things that I'd like to save for publication. It's annoying, though, because I find it easier to write when I'm on-line (whether it's a blog or an e-mail to someone). Maybe this is because I feel more connected to someone/something and not so lonely and isolated as when staring at the blank Microsoft Word page.   Up until this post, I had checked my profile 8 times for the 7 words I'd written--and you thought you were self-absorbed!                  Crush. It's such a suiting word.   Add two letters,  You've got, crushed.  It takes only two. And yet it takes two.  Blah blah blah blah  I have not worked a single day of May. I have not gone to a single class. I have not volunteered a single second of my time.  And my days have been killing my inspritation and my nights have been killing my brain cells. --and yet, as always is the case with me, a fool who only really experiences and appreciates an episode once it's passed, in a month from now and for the rest of my life, I will look back at this month of May and long for the solitude and boredom.  If I had money, I would --go to Montreal for the weekend --buy myself a new item of clothing --visit my family in T.O. --coerce one of my friends into drinking alongside me at a bar right now --buy myself a hotel room, listen to music all night, write, chain-smoke, and dance in front of the mirror  Aha! On a positive note, I have not been on a date with MaryJane since ___ dumped me.   And who's the addict, ___?                      Imagine people applied for relaitonships in the same way they applied for jobs; get all dressed up, go hunting, hand them a summary of all your fine points and valuable experiences, not to mention contact info, envelop summary in an impressive and engaging cover letter, and follow-up with a call back, eventually get called in for an interview, primp yourself, practice your responses, make sure to not talk too much, or too little, smile and make eye-contact..I think I'd have more success if we functioned that way, instead.  __________,  I am writing to express my interest in the upcoming position of girlfriend for _______ inc. ________ inc appeals to me because of it's attractive building, it's friendly and laid back atmosphere, it's high productivity levels, it's ethical and compassionate stance on global and national political issues, it's employment security, and it's rewarding fringe benefits. I feel that I would be a valuable asset to your company as I have both long-term and short-term relationship experience, an extensive and expert background in physical relations, and an unyielding passion to settle down in a challenging but fulfilling position such as the one currently available at ________ inc. If hired on by ________ inc, I would not disapoint you. A position like this comes along only once in a life-time, and I am ready and willing to compete for it because I am certain that I am the woman for the job (oh yeah, that job, too).   Sincerely, drunkbridesmaid                   Like 'meh', only with more of a whine to it. Went walking off a nasty hangover this morning. Down along the canal, then back up through the Glebe. The advil kicked in but I've still got fuzz-brain, a feeling I used to enjoy. I had an acid flashback along the way, spotted faint shadows creeping along the pavement. Fuzz-brain is a lot like the come down from acid--disoriented, tired, but unable to sleep. I wish I'd never done it. Feelings arose in me that I'd never experienced before, and even though I haven't touched the shit in seven years, those feelings have stayed with me since.   My doctor is a young guy, looks no older than twenty-seven. Last time I saw him, he made me promise not to drink for the next two weeks. The other day when I was taking out the garbage, I saw him walking down my street, hand in hand with his girlfriend. We caught each other's eyes and quickly looked away. I just know he's gonna walk by again, but this time on one of those nights when I'm stumbling home from a bar, blotto to bits.  Heh. Like 'meh', only with slightly more spirit.                 First of all, an announcement: I am blogging for one purpose only and that is, therapy. I think it's healthy for me to express myself and because I'm too lazy to ever pick up a pen, this is the best medium. Don't know why I felt I had to announce that, but whatever.  This weekend. What a weekend.   I'm happy that after 23 years, I still manage to suprise myself--unfortunately, my suprise is often mingled with fear. If I had not spent the past 23 years with myself, I'd sometimes be inclined to take off running.  But this being an on-line journal, I won't get into any details.  I got together with some old elementary school friends last night. Suprisingly, I had close to one of the best nights out in years. By the end of the evening, I was holding hands with someone I've known since pre-school. I actually have a class photo from back in the day with the two of us at 5 years of age, posed a mere few feet away from each other. Isn't that cute? Wouldn't it be just picture-perfect if something came of it? I'm such an idealistic, irrational romantic that I don't even trust my own instincts anymore.  I checked my e-mail no less than 150 times today.   I hate 'The Rules'; if there were no rules, we'd never give anyone the wrong idea. And if we never gave anyone the wrong idea, often enough, eventually we'd become de-sensitized to rejection.  A couple weeks ago, my friend suggested that relationships would fare better if everyone just stretched out getting to know one another so that it lasted the rest of their life and they'd never bore of each other because they still had so much more to learn and experience about one another. This was in reference to some movie--the name escapes me--in which two couples take a lifetime to get to know each other, a pretty stark contrast to the conventional couple's 3-month butterfly stage. But I disagree. I've always dreamed of doing in three days and nights what takes most couples 3 months. Get it all out while you can; you could die tomorrow! Dive right in head first and aim for the deep end. If you find someone attractive, or interesting, or just generally stimulating, why wait? Why postpone dialing their digits or returning their phone calls. Why pretend to be uninterested or indifferent when really, all you can think of 24/7 is getting to know that person, inside and out. Why do we do this to ourselves and to each other? What is the fucking point? The point is, I believe, that for some fucked up reason, we're always bound to want what we don't know wants us.  I was only suposed to drink on Saturday. But I drank Friday and Sunday too. The units are in bed; I'm thinking about stealing a few glasses of wine.   I am not an alcoholic; My life is just so boring that drinking speeds things up.  I hardly thought about ___ the entire weekend. And now that it's Sunday, can you believe I actually feel guilty for this? I should not feel guilty for this.  My Dad bought me flowers today. It would have been mine and ___'s 2-year anniversary.                      \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
