With all of the recent bad press associated with the prison abuse scandal in Iraq, it amazes me still that no one has touched on what is really the central issue here.  U.S. Army MPs go through 8 weeks basic training, (like everyone else), and then have a very challenging 9 week military police training course.  Now here is the difference.  Regular Army MPs continue their training year round and are constantly putting their training to real world use.  National Guard MPs are sent home to their state units where they will be lucky to ever attend another training session geared specifically towards military police and prisoner of war operations.  Now, we send these under trained and under staffed units into Iraq, to replace regular Army MP units, in a very high stress volatile situation, and then we have the audacity to wonder where it all went wrong.  How could we Americans with our supposed hold on the high moral ground be involved in such brutality?    Simple folks.  You took out the pros and brought in the backbenchers.  This is not intended as a shot at the National Guard which serves many useful purposes.  Running the main prison op in Iraq is simply not something they were properly trained for.      Two more comments regarding this.  Brigadier General Janet Karpinski is an embarrassment to the Army and the President should ask her to resign her commission.  For her to backtrack and say she had no reason to check on her troops or conditions at the prison is assinine in the extreme and simply shows her complete misunderstanding of being a person in charge.    And lastly on this particular little ditty, did you know that in all 50 states of the Union, that an individual must be 21 years of age to attend the state police academies and become sworn law enforcement officials.  Same thing applies to the federal government.  If you wish to become and FBI agent, or US Marshal, or any of the other alphabet agents, you must be 21.  Not so for the military however.   As you need only be 17 to join the service with your parent's permission, that is also the only requirement for entering the law enforcement side of the military services.  ALL TOGETHER NOW... This doesnt make sense.  No it doesnt.  With that in mind, if it doesnt make good sense, then how can it possibly make good policy?
