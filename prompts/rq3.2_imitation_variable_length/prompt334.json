They actually went out of they're homes, traveled down to the polls and voted for an actor to be Governor of their state-- for a second time. The only saving grace this time is, since Arnold wasn't born in this country, he can never run for President. And at the very least, Reagan had a pretty good grasp of the English language. Albeit, he often used it to put his foot in his mouth. Maybe the idea of California experiencing a major earthquake and falling into the sea doesn't seem as catastrophic as it once did. I'm happy for the country's comedians though. They all have fallback topics for the next gubernatorial term at least. Unless the people of California wake up tomorrow with a hangover that could kill cow and realize they need another recall to fix the recall. My suggestion, Alf runs on the independent ticket. When he wins after promising to put a cat in every pot, he is assassinated by his running mate-- Doctor Evil. Dr. Evil then proceeds with his plan to dominate the world by threatening to detonate a nuclear device in the San Andreas fault causing California and all of it's inhabitants to slide into the ocean. Officials, having seen the movie Superman, refuse to submit to Dr. Evil's demands and he pushes the button. California splits from the continent and disappears into the Pacific and The United States as a nation can hold it's head high again.                           Wow. I read that article, Maureen, and I think Hitchens may be the first conserative who reacted correctly to the film. I agree, this film can only be a piece of opinionized propaganda put forth by a filmmaker who, by his own admission, considers it nothing but his own views backed up by what seems like lopsided facts. But again, what was the President doing when he landed on an aircraft carrier that was close enough to shore that could have been reached by boat? It's  all  propaganda and politics. But Hitchens has done what he should have-- what all consrvatives should be doing-- he discussed specifics. He discussed issues. Aside from the first two paragraphs, which look like the same old vitriol spewed at someone who just doesn't agree with the writer's views, Hitchens then fell into a point by point civilized argument against the what the film suggests about the President. I'm not sure if the writer would admit this, or if he even cares, But I think he did exactly what Michael Moore wanted him to do. He did what we at this Blog want everyone to do-- speak to the issues.                           I knew It. It just didn't make any sense. The New York City Transit Authority is always moaning that it doesn't have any money. Last year the MTA narrowly avoided a walkout by it's employees because they said they weren't going to give its workers a fair cost of living increase. Then they said they needed to increase the fares for it's subways and buses while at the same time talking about making some stations completely automated by removing the token booths and booth operators. This would be done by converting them to Metrocard accessable only. All this because they said they just didn't have any cash. I did some research, and by research I mean I just did a quick search on the internet, and I found out that 5 million people ride the subways and buses every day. That means the Transit Authority takes in $7.5 MILLION a day! That's $2.75 billion a year! How is possible to be insolvent with that kind of revenue intake? Okay, I'll have to admit, their operating costs must also be astronomical. But let's remember something-- the MTA is not a business. They are not there to make a profit. Aside from what I would have to imagine to be a necessary buffer in case of an emergency, the only thing they should be spending their money on is salaries, safety improvements, upgrades, and repairs and mantainance. Now, I might be simplifying things a bit, but it seems like a simple equation. Oh, okay, I conveniently forgot to mention the money that goes into paying whoever it is goes around and making sure all the staions reek of urine. And I guess you have to also consider the high cost of sending token booth operators to sensitivity classes every year. Now I guess I have to mention the bill they'll have to pay to the accounting firm that cooked the MTA's books. Although they should consider not paying that invoice because whoever they hired didn't do a very good job of hiding that $250 million surplus from 2001. Well, if you see some guy who doesn't look quite cool enough in  his bike helmet huffing his way down Broadway on his way to work, say to your friends that you saw Steven King pass by. And they'll say, 'The writer'? And you can say back, 'Yeah, but not that Steven King.               \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
