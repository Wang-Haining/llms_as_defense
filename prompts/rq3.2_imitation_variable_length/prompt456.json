I finished my last final (Physics) a little bit ago.  Im actually off work today, so I'll be going to go look at some apartments with Steph.  Thank god I'm done with school for a while (feh...it's back to school in a few weeks).    I got a speeding ticket yesterday.  And I think its funny.  I was going down Interstate 270, maybe about 5 miles from work, going about 85.  I saw a cop in the distance parked on the side of the road, but I wasn't going to put on the brakes.  If the cop saw that, that would probably piss him off.  I opted to just take my foot off the accelerator, but my car didn't decelerate fast enough.  I passed him a few seconds later, he pulled out behind me, and pulled me over.  He busted me going 77 in a 65 zone.  So what...shit happens.  The humorous part of this situation is that my radar detector didn't go off.  Maybe it didn't detect it if he was radaring me as he followed me instead of as I passed him parked on the side of the road?  Hmm.  Anyways, I was expecting this situation to piss me off and I was expecting the cop to be a dick.  But neither happened.  I actually had a positive experience getting a speeding ticket.  I even thanked the nice cop for my $100 ticket.  Heh...  Mom and Dad are going to be pissed when I tell them.  Other than that, life's decent, I guess.  Been slacking on the guitar playing, because I've been feeling oh so not inspired to write anything.   Maybe I'll work some more on a song that I've been working on.  And, of course, I'll be working a gazillion hours a week, working doubles on Saturdays and Sundays.  I know I'm stupid for doing nothing  but working, but oh well.  Money is good!  Well, thats the current adventures of Jen for a while.  Talk to you later.                           Today is a:  9!!  I figured out today exactly why I want to go into radiology.  I, a five foot nothing, can make a difference in people's lives.  Even though I might only speak with a patient for a few moments or help out on a X-Ray, CAT Scan, or MRI exam on them that only takes a short time, I can still use that small amount of time for a lot of things.  I can use that time to comfort a patient, I can use that time to reassure a patient, I can use that time to relate to that patient's concerns or medical problems on a more personal level if possible, I can make a patient laugh when he or she feels anxious or uncomfortable, I can answer a patient's questions, and, most importantly, I can listen.  I remember one time I assisted in a Lumbar Puncture back in Fluoroscopy.  My job?  To hold the patient's hand.  I realize that I wasn't really doing anything, but I still felt like I was doing something important.  It didn't really matter that my ankles and feet got the shit fluoroed out of them (the fluoro tube is on the floor, and I was standing next to it).  I think what all this leads to is the epiphany that I am a humanitarian.  Some people might disagree, saying that I'm crude and dont care about others, but I feel I need to contest that.  My reasoning?  I don't like to see people suffer.  I don't like to see people hurt.  Inversely, people don't like to suffer and they don't like to be hurt.  And that's why I think the medical profession is right for me.  I see patients with terminal cancer.  I see patients with badly broken bones that need painful surgery.  I see patients on respirators hanging on dearly for their lives.  Yes, this deeply upsets me to see any human being in such shape, but, i know I can at least try to make a difference.  I know I will have accomplished something great in my life.  And thats why this X-Ray kid loves her job.  'A light heart carries you through all the hard times'      -Fortune Cookie                                DE blog is back!  After many issues (like my blog being given away...), I'm back in school and anxious to write again.  I'll try my best to get back into the blog of things.  I know not too many people read this and/or comment on my postings, but it's personally fascinating to watch me grow as a person through my blogs.  Hope my loyal readers agree with me (Sharon, this is where you come in. lol).    I spent the majority of my summer in Fluoro (always a treat... :) ) and was quite anxious to start school.  The third week of classes has already went by, and we've already had 2 quizzes and a midterm.  Was I dissilusioned into thinking I'd have an unfair advantage?  Because I don't think I have any type of advantage in classwork.  We start clinicals on Monday.  I'm at Childrens for 4 weeks.  I don't know what to think about that.  Well, I'm out.  I'm going to try to enjoy the rest of my weekend and not stress too much over clinicals.
