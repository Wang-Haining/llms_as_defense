  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic:\n\n       I want to write my own epitaph but I don't know the details yet, so this will do for now:   Rhodora Encarnacion Pascual    Daday_da_Makulay    System Shutdown: MM DD YYYY  though now in the grave, her colors will never fade  you may also visit me online at:  http://www.daday.com   ----------------------------------------------------------------  Here are some funny epitaphs I found on the web:   The children of Israel wanted bread  And the Lord sent them manna,  Old clerk Wallace wanted a wife,  And the Devil sent him Anna  --------------------------------------  Here lays Butch,  We planted him raw.  He was quick on the trigger,  But slow on the draw.   --------------------------------------  Here lies the body of our Anna  Done to death by a banana  It wasn't the fruit that laid her low  But the skin of the thing that made her go.   --------------------------------------  Here lies an Atheist  All dressed up  And no place to go.  --------------------------------------  Remember man, as you walk by, As you are now, so once was I, As I am now, so shall you be, Remember this and follow me.        - To which someone replied by writing on the tombstome:         To follow you I'll not consent,        Until I know which way you went.                  source:  urlLink http://www.personalitytype.com/types/istp.html    It's very important that we take time to know and assess ourselves. Go to the link above to find out what kind of personality you have.  Are you  1. Extravert or Introvert (Where is your energy naturally directed?) 2. Sensor or Intuitive (What kind of information do you naturally notice and remember?) 3. Thinker or Feeler (How do you decide or come to conclusions?) 4. Judger or Perceiver (What kind of environment makes you the most comfortable?)   As for me, I am an ISTP.    Life as an ISTP           (Introvert, Sensor, Thinker, Perceiver)            People of this type tend to be: logical, pragmatic, and matter of fact; quiet, unassuming, and autonomous; realistic,   pragmatic, and aloof; impulsive and curious about the physical world; flexible and resourceful; objective and unemotional.  The most important thing to ISTPs is the freedom to act independently and follow their impulses.    How to Love an ISTP              • Appreciate my ability to calmly and quickly solve problems.  • Be a patient and non-judgmental listener.  • Give me plenty of space and freedom to follow my impulses and explore my world.  • Try not to nag me about order or force me to make decisions to quickly.  • Have fun with me, and be open to new adventures I suggest.  • Above all - Don't pressure me to share my feelings or reactions before I'm ready.    So freaking true!                  Our Numerical Methods final exams was scheduled 7-9pm.  We all hate this subject. We don't really give a damn about the proximity of x to c, or when numbers go through standard deviations, or when they reach infinity either by bisection or secant method.  What I know is that I need to copy from my seatmate because my chances of passing approaches zero as well as my food level.    After the gruesome exam, we decided to have dinner first before we go home.  The canteen is already closed and we thought that we deserve something grand after that exam and add it to the fact that it's very rare that the original engineering barkada is complete. Jim, Paul, John, Enoch, Mhel, Onat, and the prettiest of them all, me. We went to Congressional Ave. but no restaurant seems appealing, so went to West Ave., Quezon Ave., and Timog Ave., (no gimmick place in Morato yet), but we couldn't find a nice place for us to eat.  We were losing hope already when we found ourselves in a dark portion of the Greenhills parking lot good thing Goodah was there to save us.  Lamon to the max. Kanin at lugaw, hirap pumili eh. On our way home, at the end of Annapolis St., we found a not-so-packed bar, Music Hall! We went in to peek. Soon we were already dancing to YMCA and having a pretty good time!  Too late when I realized that we just finished the band's last set at 2AM.  I'm dead! I'm sure my mom is going mad already because I did not ask permission. My good buddies Mhel and John brought me home (naturally because we live near each other).  As we go down the bus, we saw my dad waiting for me already.  He didn't say much but from what I remember, he said 'Lagot ka kanina ka pa hinihintay sa sala!'.  Badong and John took off when we reached our gate.  I want to go with them and escape what awaits me in our living room.  When I entered the house, everybody's present, all furious. My mom asked me: 'Sa'n ka galing? Alam mo ba kung anong oras na?!'.  With my head down and in a very soft voice I answered   'Kumain lang po ng lugaw'  . My mom was quiet for quite a while then my sister asked:  'Kailan pa nagka lugaw sa Music Hall?!'.   Huh?! Patay!  'Pa'no n'yo nalaman?'   Apparently, Jim returned my sister's call when he reached home.  I can just imagine them calling all my friends looking for me as if I were kidnapped. The verdict:  'Mabuti pa wag ka muna mag-aral! Puro ka lakwatsa!'.   I really thought they are going to make me stop schooling so I called Paul and told him I'm not going to enroll for the next trimester.  I was crying the whole day.    That's my famous lugaw story.  My friends find so much joy in teasing me by re-telling this story over and over.  When I look back at it, I couldn't help but smile too.  It was one heck-ova-gimmick!  Today, both Goodah and Music Hall do not exist anymore.  Buwahahahaha! Tumalab ang sumpa ko! Hahahaha!                     Daday  . Do you think I like my name? Like it? I love it.   When I was in first year high school, turning thirteen and all, I said I don't want to use Daday anymore, it's immature, peculiar, and so pinoy.  I wanted to be called Rhory -- that’s my original nickname which I cannot pronounce when I was little.  Somehow Rhory didn't work for me, so I dropped it.  Daday is easier to say, easier to remember, it's down-to-earth, it's unique, and it's me.  So far, there's no one I know personally that has the same name.  The closest I know is Dada, and her brothers Dodo and Denden and sister Didith.  I should be a member of their family and together we can sing A-dadada-a-dududu.  My friends call me Daday, my teachers call me Daday, my classmates, my officemates, my boss, everybody does.  Some people are not comfortable with it at the beginning but they get the hang of it as soon as they see how well it fits me. Although, there is one person I know that finds my name unacceptable. I could never forget the day of my first class in Informatics, the first time my name will be in the schedule board.  She asked me, 'Uh, what name should I write? Daday? Don't you have another name? Can't you think of some other name?' HA! She surely tapped my bitchy nerves so I said slowly as I control myself from strangling her, 'Miss, my name is Daday, may problema ba? Put there Daday, that's D-A-D-A-Y.'  Everybody in Informatics know that messing up with me was the biggest mistake of her life hahahaha. (Any guess kung sino s'ya? Hahaha.)  Harold calls me Daday Doods, Gen and Abby calls me Daday Kups ('kupad' yun ha!), Cheche calls me and Gen 'C'mon-c'mon', Bel calls me Duday (sometimes Dudaykoy when I call her Belekoy), Kudz and Toti calls me Dadskie, my students invented Ma'am D, some call me Da, Dads, Dayday.  The only people who calls me Rhory are my cousins, at least three of them.  Whatever! I consider pet names as term of endearment, it's sweet and very personal.   You might ask where “Daday da Makulay” came from.  It's from a birthday card I received on my debut. Since then I embraced the name and lived up to it.  Life is colorful.  No matter how boring or how simple your life is, it's really a matter of how you take notice of the tiny details and appreciate its value.                    I will go to Butuan tomorrow to conduct a one-day seminar.  I really don't like to do that but my assistant and my supervisor really wants to travel so I lost.  It's not that I don't want to travel; I just don't like to go there and work.  The dark skies and the strong winds are now giving me the jitters.    Yesterday, my badminton buddies and I were talking about two of our officemates who passed away last year.  Both of them are badminton players too.  When the first one died from a motorcycle accident, the news spread in the office like wild fire.  Everybody was talking about Red  (let's call him Red because he's from the Red team).   There are about 2000 employees in our central office so it's hard to recall his face.  My friends were trying to describe him to me: 'Si Red, yung may highlights tapos medyo mahaba yung hair'. 'Yung laging kasama ni ano...'. 'Yung partner ni ano nung laro natin sa Sheridan'.  I still can't remember him so in desperation, Paolo tried to make a sketch.  I had a person in mind already based on his drawing but imagine my shock when I saw the guy I thought was Red in the canteen.  The other guy, Yellow, died of leukemia.  This one I am familiar with because I once had been in a meeting with him.  Now it's my turn to describe him to my friends.  'Si Sir Yellow, yung naka brush up yung hair, tisoy na taga 15th floor.' 'Siya yung tumalo sa min nung first game.'    Tomorrow I’m traveling by air and the sky doesn’t look too friendly.  My partner was teasing me, asking me on how he should describe me to those who will ask him.  “Si Daday, yung mataba, taga MIS sa 1407” “Kailan lang nakasabay ko pa sa elevator yun eh” “Naglaro pa nga yon ng badminton nung isang araw e.”  Creeeeepy!  I told them, if something happens to me, please refer them to my web site or to friendster. Please don’t try to describe me.  I would really hate it if you can’t describe me well.  I also warned Paolo not to draw my face.    It’s a funny conversation really, though a bit morbid.  Alone in the bus on my way home, it made me think, how would people describe me? How would they remember me? 'Si Daday yung taga orange. Yung nakipag rematch sa table tennis, yung nagbigay ng seminar sa `tin, yung kasama natin sa Tagaytay'.    Oh well, I better make good and lasting impressions while I can.  I hate to spend 8 hours sitting here in front of my desk.  I can end a day without talking to anybody.  How on earth would they remember me?!  Lord, please keep us safe! I haven’t updated my photo and profile in friendster yet.           \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
