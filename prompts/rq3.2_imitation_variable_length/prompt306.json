To help you adjust, I've collected twelve sure-fire ways to confuse your grandmother and set them down here. I hope they prove useful.  What you do: Tell your grandmother that your grandfather is gay. Grandma: 'Oh yes, he's a merry old fellow all right...' You: 'No, Grandma, 'gay' means 'dead.''  What you do: Take your grandmother to a gay bar. Grandma: 'Why are all those men dancing with each other?' You: 'Those aren't men, Grandma - those are holograms.'  What you do: Take your grandmother to a gay porno film. Grandma: 'Oh my word!' You: 'So, Grandma - how do you like Nintendo?'  What you do: Go to your grandmother's house for dinner and pile your plate sky-high with peas. Grandma: 'My, junior, I had no idea you were so fond of peas!' You: 'Peas? I thought they were marijuana pellets.'  What you do: Show up at your grandmother's door wearing a false nose. Grandma: 'Oh you, always the kidder!' You: 'Don't laugh, Grandma; I have lyme disease.'  What you do: Go for a drive with your grandmother. Turn the radio up to full volume on static. Grandma: (covers ears) 'Make it stop!' You: 'Aw c'mon Grandma, don't you dig jazz?'    What you do: Take your grandmother to the zoo. Grandma: (admiring the ducks) 'My, such lovely creatures...' You: 'Can I have five bucks Grandma? I wanna go get a microdonkey.'  What you do: When your grandmother comes to visit, sit in the living room playing with a viewmaster. Grandma: 'Hello, junior, how are you today?' You: 'Shhh! I'm recalibrating my penis!'  What you do: Ask your grandmother what year she was born. Grandma: '1914.' You: 'Wow...so you were alive when Jethro Tull was president!'  What you do: Buy your grandmother a gold necklace and have her try it on. Grandma: 'How does it look?' You: 'Oh, Grandma - it's perfectly cumfucked!' Grandma: 'What?' You: 'I mean it looks like shit.'  What you do: Sever the corpus calosum connecting the left and right hemispheres of your grandmother's brain. Grandma: (pointing to spoon) 'Fork.' (clutching head and trembling) 'Fork!' You: 'Ha ha, Grandma. I confused you.'  What you do: Buy your grandmother a V.C.R.; ask her to set it to record your favorite show every weeknight. Grandma: 'I'd love to, junior; programming V.C.R.'s is something of a hobby of mine.' You: No!!
