Anyone really want to hear me talk about sex? I thought not. :)  Politics? I'm going to the state democratic convention this weekend for a bit. I'm an alternate, and who knows but I might well end up being a delagate and if good fortune shines I might even get a berth to the national. Sure it's pie in the sky but I LOVE pie in the sky. Always tastes better with a bit more atmosphere on it if you ask me.   Then it'll be home for more YARD WORK. The bright spot is, of course, seeing my Lowa. The other bright spot? I'll get to take my shiny new ebay truck to Pueblo and back! Yes, lovely, fabulous downtown Pueblo. What the hell is that about anyhow? WHY do they hold ANYTHING in Pueblo? Sure, sure I know they have a wonderful selling point. ....... Just look at all the empty hotel rooms! Perfect for a convention! Maybe that's it. It doesn't really explain why the state fair is held there, but I guess it's a start.   Why do I think Pueblo isn't a world famous destination spot? Let me count the ways......  It's dirty and it stinks  It's too hot in summer and too cold in winter  The mall is a sad poor excuse for a shopping experience  No Best Buy  It's too far to be close and just close enough that it seems like a good idea to go there instead of Denver for shopping  On the weekend you can count on running into people you know from the valley, there is NO escaping these damned inbreeders.  And lastly? It just FEELS depressed and depressing. Like a pall is hanging over it.  Other political news? I got some unplanned advertizing for the union election I'm in. If I win it means I go to Denver once a month for meetings. Not bad really.   OK, now it's time to talk about sex!  See, I just KNEW you didn't wanna hear about that.                       About 25 years too fucking late if you ask me. Ronald Reagan is dead. I won't miss him. The man that lead the conservative revolution, drove us to the brink of bankruptcy and brought us Iran-Contra. As one of my co workers said today?   'I hated the fucker. I wouldn't piss up his ass if his guts were on fire'  I know some colorful people and thank goodness that they aren't the kind of phonies that pretend to like you when you're dead if they didn't like you when you were alive.   I watched Reagan work what he called supply side economics. It was really spend-yourself-out-of-a-depression economics. Cut taxes and run giant deficits to spend your way out and let the future generations pay for it. I think that must be where the chimp got it.  He was evil, nothing should be named after him, and he should be buried face down because he always wanted the world to bend over and kiss his ass.  We're not the kings of the world. We're people. Just plain people lucky enough to have been born into a pretty free country. I was reminded of this listening to NPR today. Someone was complaining about Iraq and the new government to be installed there. Their point was the role of women. That they should be equal. OK, time for some common sense.  THIS country didn't have equaility for over a hundred years for women and 200 years for African Americans AFTER we won the war of INDEPENDANCE. But all of a sudden the country we INVADED should come out of the cultural dark ages in a couple of years? Are they that much more advanced than we are? I say that because we don't have equality YET. Women don't get paid the same as men (unless they're union and that is a socialist organization anyway). People of color don't get the same treatment and opportunities as white men. You cross the street to avoid confrontation with teen age black kids, don't you? Well don't you? You know that you, yourself, practice the self same acts that tell the other people on the planet that they're not part of YOUR world and aren't as good as YOU are all the time. And if you don't think so then you either aren't paying attention or you're really good at lying to yourself so that you can preserve the air of entitlement about your place in life being what it is because you're SO smart, SO good, SO kind, SO deserving, SO the member of the right religion, SO well bred, SO well mannere. SO FULL OF SHIT.  Wow, that went somewhere I didn't plan on.  Where was I?   OH yeah. Give Iraq some time. IF they want to change they'll do so. Yep, prodding is good, showing is good, examples are good. No not the kind where we torture them in prisions, but the other kind.  Patience. The thing we need to practice is patience. That sure self knowledge that I didn't get where I am over night and I shouldn't expect it of you.   Try it, for just a day.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
