However, skywatchers can get a treat almost any clear night of the year, especially in Algonquin Park, where dark skys reign.  Countless stars and the band of our galaxy, the Milky Way are clearly visible.  Something I like to call 'The Show' also takes place a few times each day.  Extremely bright satellites made of Iridium are used to transmit satellite telephone calls.  Our remote sat phone uses these satellites which pass over head frequently.  A wonderful website called  urlLink  Heavens Above   lists regular occurances of Iridium Flares for virtually any location on the planet.  These flares occur in pinpoints in thy sky when the antennae of the satellite bounces the suns light in the direction of observers on  earth.  The flash of a few seconds grows in brightness to 10 times as bright as a full moon.  And then quickly it disappears.  Most who see it let out an audible gasp.  The neat thing about  urlLink  Heavens Above   is  that the web site lists the exact point in the sky as well as the time of day to seek these neat happenings out.  I also recommend getting a list of the visual passes of the International Space Station as it soars overhead.  It doesn't take long to find your way around the night sky with a watch, a compass and a field manual for the stars.  Incidentally, this too is available in lots of places online including SkyandTelescope.com. Although usually much more brief and certainly smaller than Northern Lights, the show makes me say, ' Wow!' every time I see it.                       We're greatly enjoying the mild temps this summer on the Edge of Algonquin Park.  Sunny skys and 20-23 degrees C seems to be the norm.  We're hoping for more of the same as the summer moves on.  Our first   urlLink Quest for Balance retreat  is this weekend and our first sea kayaking trip on Georgian Bay departs the following Thursday.  I'm very excited to be getting on the water myself for the first time this year with Greg on that  urlLink Big Sky Sea Kayaking trip .  We're excited to welcome Wendy MacCrimmon into the office this week.  She's getting a handle on all the neat experiences we've got planned this summer and we're quite excited that she has climbed on board.  Her expertise in Ecotourism from Sir Sandford Fleming is greatly appreciated and her cheery disposition is sure to make you feel welcome if you have a chance to speak with her on the phone or meet her on your visit to the Blue Canoe.  Our lodge computer hard drive crashed over the weekend.  Totally disabled the lodge pc and although we've lost a number of images, we have a pretty good back up of our important documents so we will cope.  It is refreshing to realize that it is a physical breakdown and not something caused by a virus.  In the meantime, we're all scrambling to make the most of the computer resources we have.  Also on that front, we're finding all sorts of interesting hidden talents of Scott Shailer, one of our guides.  Seems he's fascinated with databases and the like and is helping us make the most of our computers for registration and reporting to be well prepared for our guests.  That's what working at the Edge is all about, finding your unique talents and fitting them in where they are needed most.    Scott rose to the occasion a few nights ago with the word 'Qana', to stave off a last minute comeback by yours truly in Scrabble.  I'd like to serve notice to Scott that he should gloat while he can, because I'll be better prepared next time.  FYI, Quana is some type of tunnel or moat in the middle east according to the third edition Scrabble Dictionary by Mirriam Websters.                        Tim and I went on a driving adventure this morning.  Backroads tour! We happened upon a decimated turtle nest.  A recent rain made it difficult to spot who the invader was, but it was likely a fox from the evidence.  Dozens of egg shells a bit smaller than ping pong balls were scattered about from two nests.  There were three opaque eggs left in one of the nests about 10 inches below the surface.  We covered these eggs over in the hopes that the snapping turtle yolk within, continue to develop and crawl to the surface to see the light of day in August.  A bit further along we came upon a bruin at the side of the road.  Upon hearing us, he headed for the tree line.  We stopped the car and turned off the engine and looked into the forest.  To our surprise we could clearly see the bear's head as he looked us over for a few minutes.  The full size of the bear became apparent to us.  We watched him amble along as he made quite a racket crashing through the branches on his way up the hill away from us.  It was quite exciting as we really felt like we were on a safari.           \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
