I've been in Washington, D.C. for 4 weeks.  for those of you reading this (like that's anyone), I am a D.C. intern.  Now, don't think i've sold out completely.  The little non-profit i work for is called CAST, or the Council for Agricultural Science and Technology.  I'm supposed to be doing the prep work for this national essay contest for jr. high kids, but so far, i spend about 7 out of the 8 hours of my workday fucking around online.  no one wants to fund this gig, so it's hard to make preparations.  no money=monkeying around on the internet.  Now, i really have put forth an effort to get what i can get done taken care of.  I've looked for alternate sources of funding.  we've written letters to people, etc.  the real holdup is the fact that i have to answer to someone.  yes, a boss.  and she's tied up with things a little more important than an essay contest.   in one word, i summarize my intern position as 'frustration'.  and i don't get paid.  so i've been searching for jobs.  i think i've applied to, like, a thousand places, but haven't heard from any of them.  it makes me wonder if i'll ever get hired.  are they so dim as to overlook my great and infinite potential?? i think i'm going back to grad school in a year.  the city is cool, anyhow.  it's political, intellectual, artistic, and fun.  you can get involved with anything here, it caters to ever interest.  the restaurants are great, because so many different people, really great cooks, from all over the world move here and sell food.  there's nightlife for everyone.  ESPECIALLY if you're gay.  i'm not gay, but gay bars are fun.  i think i want a gay man to decorate my house.  when i get a house.  that will be after i get a job. LOL!!!  as far as living situations go: NEVER LIVE WITH 5 OTHER GIRLS.  ESPECIALLY SORORITY OR SORORITY-LIKE GIRLS.  this was not my fault.  it was random housing assignments, courtesy of the omnicient and well meaning TAMU staff people.  i had a pet rat once, about the time they were rushing.  I MISS MY CAT AND MY SOLITUDE.             \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
