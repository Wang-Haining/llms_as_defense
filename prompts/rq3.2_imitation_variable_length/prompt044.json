The United states has launched offensive military operations against the Taliban forces still in Afghanistan.  US Intelligence agencies in recent weeks have stepped up security apparatus around the country based on 'considerable chatter' by the terrorist network.  There has been considerable concern on an attack trying to intimidate the US elections this fall.  This military action is an attempt to keep the Taliban on the run and to disrupt planning for their continued activities.    It can only be hoped that any actions on the part of US and Coalition forces in Afghanistan, will shake the Taliban and al-Qaida leadership.  Osama bin Laden remains in the mountainous region there, and still is the most dangerous man in the world.  His ultimate capture and execution will end a lot of motivation for the people who continue to reek havoc around the world.  ANY ACTION OR MEASURE SHOULD BE USED TO ACHIEVE THIS PURPOSE!  There are times when the ends does justify the means, and this is certainly one of those times if there ever was one.  ARRICK                       Are we ever going to learn from our pettiness?  Secretary Ridge over at Homeland Security asked last year to change the name of the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement to Bureau of Investigations and Criminal Enforcement.  This has apparently gotten a lot of panties in a wad over at the FBI.  In their minds, they simply can not allow another federal law enforcement agency to have the name 'Investigation' in it.  Does this sound like the kind of bullshit that the Secretary for Homeland Security, the Attorney General, and the FBI Director should be wasting a lot of time on?  It sounds to me like the same kind of crap that was going on when people in the field were trying to get the leadership to listen and stop the worst attack in American history.  You people are supposed to be the best and brightest.  It seems that all of the lessons supposedly learned since 911, (better communication among government agencies) has passed the three of you right on by.  Shame on you for wasting time on something so petty.  Settle this, and get back to the people's business.  If you guys aren't paying attention to what's going on out there, then who is?  Im very sorry to say that it certainly doesn't sound to me like we have reached that spirit of interagency cooperation that is so vital for our success in the war against terrorism.   Arrick                       God am I sick of this moron.  This guy has been lying to the United States and the whole world longer than I have been on the planet!  We have a word in our President's second term, in his last year which we refer to as 'lameduck'.  Unless something critical comes up, this is generally a time for the President to get ready to make his exit, and only the most routine of matters gets through Congress.  Under those criteria, this idiot has been a lameduck for the better part of 35 years.  Get a clue over there would you people?  Those of you who want a Palestinian state, and I think there should be one, are never going to get it with this horse's ass sitting at the table.  Nobody in the modern age takes this guy seriously and most people haven't for the longest of time.  The next move is up to the Palestinian people.  You can blow up all the buses you want.  You don't even get to come back to the negotiating table until you are serious.  The most expedient and rightful way you could make this clear to the world, is to kick this guy's ass out in the street and get someone else doing your talking for you.   Arrick                          Man did they blow this one!  The Court did what it has been famous for doing for two centuries.  They simply dodged the entire thing.  The man who brought the dispute is in a custody battle with his ex-wife, so the Court said he didn't have standing to bring the case to begin with.  The Court has a long and storied history of doing just this.  Dodging politically flammable objects by just blowing them off on a technicality.  What i didn't hear anyone ask was this.  So the man involved is in a custody dispute.  If the girl is still his daughter, then why doesn't he have standing to bring this suit?  Now don't get me wrong folks.  I think this guy is completely full of shit and he is only making a case out of this to get his fifteen minutes.  But having said that, he should certainly have the right to defend his daughter, especially if he is going through the judicial system the proper way.    To the heart of the matter now.  The Pledge of Allegiance is NOT a prayer.  It has no bearing whatsoever as to the mixing of religion and government.  It is simply a patriotic 'ceremony', and a very pleasant way to start a day or begin some special event with.  If you don't want to say it along with the rest of us, fine.  That is also your right to do so.  But don't expect the rest of us to capitulate to your obvious state of being out of touch.  America is a great country and this is just one way for the citizenry to show that.  Arrick                        The United States has posted a bounty on the head of Abu Musab al-Zaraqawi of $25,000,000.  This prick is the head of another bunch who thinks that by blowing up cars, buses, mosques, people whatever that they will win over the hearts and minds of those they are 'defending.'  It's always obvious when the US gets serious about gettin in somebody's ass.  How you ask?  The same thing we have always been good at.  We just throw a shitpot full of money at the problem.  Have no doubt friends this is a very effective policy.  The US is going to give you 25 mill and set you up like a king anywhere in the world your heart desires.  Mr. al-Zaraqawi let me give you a little clue about how this is going to work.  The problem with you son is that you have now brought yourself very unwanted attention from the mightiest country the world has ever known.  You've killed thousands in your quest to prove your point.  And what have you really accomplished?  You and that other idiot Osama, while you are both obviously serious players, we have mastered the game.  You have now seen what we are capable of.  Dont be surprised when one of your people sees the greener pastures of America and freedom and of course 25 million dollars.  You people have very badly overestimated your limited capabilities.  It was an old Brooklyn mafia chief who said,'When the elephants dance together, its the mice who get hurt.'  al-Zaraqawi, I hope you've got a good tracker with you son, because I think I hear the elephants comin!   Arrick                        And so it continues.  The al-Qaida have now beheaded a third foreigner, a man from South Korea no less.  How do they think this is going to help their cause?  Do they really believe that if they keep cutting people's heads off, and posting it on the internet, that all of a sudden world opinion is going to rally around them?  These people are extremists in the absolute sense of the word.  They think they are going to have total Islamic control of the world and that they are doing absolutely right.  There is only one way that has proven proper down through history to deal with such people.  Total annihilation.  Completely wipe them out.  Just days after the disastrous 911,  Vice President Cheney brought up an idea of having 'hunter-killer' teams established by the CIA and the American Special Forces Community.  The sole purpose of these teams would be to track and hunt down terrorists cells worldwide, and eliminate them.  The idea was rejected by several other members of the Administration as to extreme a reaction.  I could not disagree more.  I think the VP had it absolutely right the first time.  I think the development and deployment of such hunter-killer teams in desolate places such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Jordan, Indonesia, Malaysia, The Phillipines  and probably dozens of other places would be a fantastic way to take the offensive against this continuing worldwide threat.  I wonder how many heads would continue to be cut off if the full power and might of The United States military and intelligence establishment were fully unleashed?  How much more shit are we going to tolerate from these people before we decide there has to be a better way of dealing with it?  Arrick                        I have searched and searched and I just cant find it.  I thought for sure I was doing something wrong, and as I continued to look I became more fascinated as to who would be the first to help me find it.  GOOGLE News with their superfast news page?  Nope.  How about world famous Ted Turner and CNN?  No, not here either.  Well if not them, then surely Rupert and the boys over at FOX News will have it.  Hmmmmmm........I just dont see it.  MSNBC?  I mean surely with Bill Gates at the helm I will find what I seek here.  NO Damnit, frustrated again!  What about our foreign friends?  Maybe they can help me find that which I seek.  BBC, my fine British cousin, how bout you?  Do you have it here?  NO.  How about Pravda our fine new Russian allies.  Do you have it hidden away there somewhere?  SKYNEWS?  Anybody???  IS ANYONE STILL LOOKING FOR OSAMA?  Well the sad truth is that no one is apparently minding the store and keeping an eye on the most dangerous man in the world.  Al-Qaida works in cycles for those of you who are uninitiated in the martial arts, and the summertime schedule in the US provides a whole plethera of target rich environments for those wishing us harm.  And yet as I searched through the main pages of the world's most recognized news sights, I couldn't find word one about this man?  Have these people forgotten about 9-11?  Are they ashamed to remind themselves as well as the rest of us about what happened that day?  Those of you in charge of these news organizations should take a hard look in the mirror and ask yourselves if you are doing your jobs to the best of your ability.  People care and they should be able to rely on what they are told.  But what about when none of you are doing the telling?  I hope the next time Osama is back on the front page of all of these websites, its not because he's killed another 3000 Americans.
