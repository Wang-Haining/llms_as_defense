Well had a good day so far, pick up some SEK and some Euros at the post office in town and also bought the one thing I had wanted for so long! A DIGITAL CAMERA!! WHOOPPEEEEEEEEE and boy this thing rocks! Got myself a bargain I did! £99 from Currys, well with the extra memory card I spent around £140. Hoping to bag another memory card at the airport for tax free shopping with a bit of luck, only problem is what do I do with those 7 rolls of camera film I bought!!!   Been testing the camera out, took some pictures of Alfie, well there isn’t much else to take pictures of at the moment. Would like to go into town with it, and shoot some pictures there, might do that tomorrow as got to nip in town in the morning to pick up the camera film I put in this morning for developing. Ha ha, hopefully will be the last for a while!  Well going to visit mum laters, called her earlier check she was okay and mainly to see if she needed anything taking up but she didn’t.   Well few days left, having my hair done tomorrow, going blonde! ;)                  Okay we both had a great day today, we met up with Spyboo at the city hall and exchanged money for tickets! we then headed back to the hotel as Jackie wanted to collect some more dosh to spend! We then did the TV Tower and had an hour of so there, went to the top, chilled out and took the tram back into town. We then went onto the Vasa Museum where I got a free poster for taking part in a survey, the swede was mighty impressed that I had been 4 times already. Gave Jackie the poster as she is going to frame it. Bought some bits and bobs but not manged to buy any CD's yet!  Headed back to the hotel at around 3.30pm as I wanted some much needed sleep before this evening! It is now 17.21 and Jackie is getting ready and we are taking the tube to the stadion very soon!   I think we did an awful lot of walking today, god we even walked to the city hall from the hotel, did not think it was far but it WAS!  Tomorrow I intend to go buy my gifts and some CD's, not sure what Jackie wants to do.  So excited about this evening, spotted someone in Mcdonalds yesterday with the Gyllene Tider hat on! I want that so much!!!   Well I guess I shall try and report back here after the concert, unless I am pissed! and also depends what time we get back to the hotel! the joys of free internet access even if the PC is from the year dot!  Missing my baby, I am sure he is fine, not phoned home yet will sometime tomorrow...  I am still sneezing and coughing to death but NOTHING will spoil tonight!  Now I must go prepare for this evening!!  GYLLENE TIDER............. HERE I COME!!!                  My god did last night really happen, I know for me it was the second time to meet Per, but it was so good, and so god damn relaxed!!! We where usher into this little changing room area through the backstage area, thank god so we oculd get away from the noise of TLK!!! We all sat down like we where waiting for our exams results...... must have been around a 10 minute wait or so. Jackie was shaking, her legs and jumping up and down so much, thankfully Linda gave her a few tips on calming down, which she did.  The time came and in walked Anders first.... who just waved his hand and shouted 'Hej' followed by a very cute Per! Micke who is so god damn sexy laughed with his sense of humour, the Goran and MP came on in too!  The guys signed our stuff, and I got some photos, not all that great but a good one with Micke took by Jackie. Eugene took some official fanclub photos.   Me and Jackie where having a joke with Micke. Anders laughed cause we where from England! (yes he remembered you three Fliss, Klair and Ailsa from the carpark!) He seems a little worried when I warned him would be back soon to haunt him!!! :)    MP and Goran did not really do much just signed our stuff....  I think it lasted around 15 minutes then it was time to go, I got to shake Per's hand on the way out when really I wanted to give him a big hug. I certainly said more words that I did last time.  The guys went and we had a few minutes to gather our stuff. Everyone from the fanclub M&G showed up and there was also a family there with there 2 children.   We went back out and me and Jackie headed outside to think and to STILL avoid the noise of TLK! We found a bench and Eugene came out some time later to transfer the pictures to his laptop, so we got a sneaky peek at them! :) Very good camera is that he has!!! some good photos of all the M&G winners with the band can't wait to get my hands on a copy!!!  I swaped my standing ticket with a tout for a seat as I did not fancy standing so long, Thabkfully I got a good seat, in block A again okay I also paid an extra 300 SEK but it was worth it. I took lots of photos with my own camera, so I can't wait to download them when I get home! Jackie was sat over in block O but she also had a good view and was a little higher than me, some of the photos she took are fantastic!   The concert was as good as the last one... the guys where so good on that stage, I know understand why some people go to more than 2 concerts, you get so hooked!   Met up with Jackie on the way out, and she thought what I was thinking!! should we head to Falun, it would have been so great to have caught a 3rd concert!   But alas when we got back to the hotel I went onto ticnet and there where no seats left to buy, it would have been a bit risky to have gone up there in the hope of using a tout and a major let down to have missed out if there where no tickets!  Well I have to go for now someone is waiting to use the PC here at the hotel, catch you soon!
