Mr. Anonymous:  First of all, never insult my wife again. Name calling is a clear indication of a lack of a real argument. It is immature and annoying. If you're so mature, act like it.   Second, the only difference between me and all the officers is two years of college. I have people telling me what to do who are younger than I am and have less than half my military experience (and some of them haven't even finished college). Hell, I'm being led in war by bank tellers and pig farmers. No, I do not think that my officers' 'sacrifices' are an excuse for them to treat us 'uneducated' folk like trash.   Third, I did not ask to do this job. I did not join the National Guard to go invade countries. If I wanted to do that, I would have stayed in active duty. I DO feel obligated to do this job because 1) I signed a contract, and 2) there's obviously not enough 'Patriotic Americans' willing to do it. And just in case you're wondering, yes, I'm a damn good worker, so good, in fact, that my bosses went to great lenghts to help me get citizenship just so I could keep working where I am. I have earned the right to complain after I've given these people four excellent years of work and all I've gotten back is a fake promotion.   Oh yeah, and this job does not disgust me, it's just the people who seemed to have forgotten why we're here. If they ever knew.    I'm done.   In other, sadder news, a member of the 1/150th Armor Battalion was killed by an Improvised Explosive Device in the town of Balad Ruz, about an hour away from here, two days ago. This kind of news makes us very sad here, because he was in our brigade. He is only the 2nd person we've lost so far.   Good news? We know which unit is replacing us now, and have an approximation as to when they'll be getting here. We have officially reached the half-way point of this deployment, and we're starting to make plans to go back home. How exciting.   OH wow. I'm watching Bill O'Reilly yelling a Peter Jennings. I wish I knew what they're saying.                      In this day and age it's very important to speak English. Especially if you're an Iraqi who's applying for a job as an interpreter at a US Army base. Seriously, people. We had a guy come here a couple of days ago saying that he wanted to be an interpreter, so my friend and co-worker interviewed him. He said the guy didn't speak a lick of English, just Kurdish and Farsi. C'mon.   From what I hear Kurdish and Farsi are very close, so all the Kurds that live around here can understand the Iranians who come across the border (both legally and illegally) pretty well. Kind of like Spanish and Portuguese, I suppose.   We hire a lot of interpreters here who only speak Kurdish. I don't think that's very smart, seeing how a large majority of the inhabitants of this area are still Arabs. There's a lot of thigs around here which make no sense. Here's another one: Locals come up to the base all the time, asking to speak to some captain or another for a wide range of reasons, anything from their brother being detained by the IP (Iraqi Police) to wanting to get a bid on a contract (usually for construction) somewhere. Some of them have appointments, some of them don't. Well, the ones who don't have appointments, are usually sent on their way. I understand that, to a certain extent. However, whenever these captains don't feel like talking to someone, they just tell them to go away, usually without even an explanation other than 'I don't feel like talking to any Iraqis today' (of course they mostly use other, stronger words for 'Iraqi'). What is that? And we wonder why all these people are getting increasingly angry at us. WE DON'T WANT TO HELP THEM.    It feels even worse to be the little guy out there at the gate who has to tell the pissed off Iraqi people to go away because no one wants to talk to them. I've been there.   I have also been in the meetings the officers have. They really treat us 'enlisted' members (that is, everyone who's not an officer, i.e. privates, sergeants) like we don't matter. An example. Most of us here at FOB Cobra live in 'Containerized Housing Units', which are basically big metal boxes with windows and a door (and A/C and electricity, of course). Some unlucky souls live in tents, and it was a big deal because it wasn't fair. The tents have no A/C or anything. So what was the officers' solution? Put all the enlisted members in tents. That was their actual answer. Nobody said anything about rearranging the officers (they all have 1 or 2 people to each room; each room is designed for 4 people). Fortunately, this didn't happen and how we should have enough CHUs for everyone, but just the fact they someone actually suggested that... And all this goes on behind closed doors, so the average Joe doesn't ever hear about. It's sad.           \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
