Basically found out that my b/f Clint is a pathological liar who thinks that he can get away with it but not with me. It seriously pisses me off to know that I've been lied to more than once by him so now I have no idea what to do. The other day I told him I needed a day to think about it, and I wanted to stay with him but I didn't want him to feel like he could just do it and get away with it all. Mainly bugs me because he knew about Anthony and how I wouldn't let someone just take advantage of me like that or try and play me, which is exactly what he did. At school it was really awkward cause we both didn't know what to say or do so we just kind of stayed away from eachother. Earlier today I told him I'd give him another chance but if he fucked up then I'd just leave, simple as that. Then when I got home I was in my room listening to music so I didn't hear the door but my dad came down and told me someone was at the door for me and I'd never guess who. Sure enough it was Clint with some flowers and a card, he came over to talk to me about everything. We talked for awhile and hearing him tell me how uch he loves me and how he wants to spend forever with me made me wanna push my pride aside and just hug him and hold onto him, but i just kept staring at the floor listening. Once he left I gave him a hug and a kiss on the cheek and he told me he didn't wanna lose me and I told him he wouldn't..whether I gave in too easily or not I'll find out..    \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
