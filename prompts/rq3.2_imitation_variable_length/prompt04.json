  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic:\n\n       srry thats the title of my fave song..well actually the title is only one but ya kno..if u know yellowcard, you'll get it, and if u dont ur a loser...yeah so i got kicked out of the car pool today..kate got stuck with the reject...and we watched club dread...worst movie ever..i'll spare u the details..dont ever let kate pick out movies...silent night deadly night...enough sayd haha but none of yall get that.oh well...yeah i downloaded like 20 yellowcard songs last night..some of their old ones, avondale is a really good one..and underdog and big apple heartbreak to name a few...i'm watchin that 70's show...its cute eric's gonna ask donna to marry him! how cute...but stupid! hes like we're happy and hyde goes 'u dont get married when ur happy, u get married when ur backed up against a wall and have no other way out' haha great line...haha kitty wants eric to be a pharmacist..lol haha i swear shes high as a kite...ahah there was a line in club dread that was like bogo the crab was as high as a kite until he fell down and broke his shell haha i tought it was funny.....lol kelsos such an idiot...man ive got the munchies...im kinda hungry..hha he thinks the dog looks like fez...lol the dogs high!!!!! haha reds like that dogs gotta go! and bobs like i think he just went (like pee in reds chair) ahhaha it was realy funny...well i gotta go i'll catch yall cats lata!                 HE ASKED ME!! yay! so i guess i DO deserve a bf don't i ashley? or at least he thinks so...yeah so i'm in a great mood..except that my allergies are KILLING ME!  they suck hard core..haha yeah so i don't have too long to write cuz i have to go to band, fun right? yeha i know u wish u were there...or not... yeah so i had my big algebra test today, i think it went well (cross ur fingers for me) and if i do good i can go to cinderella at the ballet! but by mom will prolly let me go regardless of my grade cuz we all know cinderella is like THE BEST EVER! yanks lost last night... 11-2 honestly that SUCKS but so did boston so we're stil 1/2 a game behind...which is ok cuz if we can stay in 2nd we cna go to the playoffs, hopefully jeter will wakeup....maybe he just needs to see me and he'll be like OMG I need to play gooder! haha yeah so I'm grounded this weekend cuz i have missing hw in algebra, among other classes, but its ok...unfortunately i dont get to see my NEW BOYFRIEND! but its ok...nothings really changed between us since we started goin out but i think its for teh best just to take it slow for now...yeah this summer is gonna be bomb! kath i cant wait for july! alska here we come!!also me allee and kath will be volunteerin at a summer camp with kids so we'll be able to go lay out but the pool and get our tan on when we get off! yeah so i really need to do my nails cuz they look bad....ok well i gotta run! actualy drive, anyway we're goin to band....yip! catch yall cats lata...I'm not single!                  have you ever noticed how people can be so mean? and not just to you i mean havent u ever caught urself and sayd wow im such a jerk? and how its so hard not to hold grudges...i mean u know its wrong but somehow its just so hard to forgive and forget? and how you would just love to press the rewind button of life sometimes?  but i think theres no rewind button for a reason...we have to make mistakes and learn  how to avoid that in the future, and if we dont avoid it again, we have another screw up to remind us, and we're just gonna do it over and over again till we get it right, which can ultimately hurt you if u dont do it right the first time... sometimes life lessons are so hard and they hurt so much...it ultimately comes down to self control i think...possibly that you lack some...thats just my opinion if you want it..just that we wanna be nice sometimes but we dont have enough self control not to argue back...and we're such hpocritical beings, have you ever noticed that? i think its so much easier to see the flaws in other people than ourselfs because we're so stuck on us...and doesnt that thought just make you sick? that we're so high and mighty on ourselves that we cant see the problems that we have? and we dont have enough self control to change the flaws that we do see? we're just incredibly sick creatures..i mean which brings me to the point of why on earth would God have chosen US to do his work? it baffles my mind to wonder why in the world he would put me here and what kind of purpose he could have for someone liek me whos totally spoiled and has no self control to change herself for the better, what use could i possibly be to him?...chew on that thought for a while..                 yeah so today was wednesday..i can spell it!! tomms is a week for me and sam! yay! i'm excited!! it was sooo sweet we were comin home from hard rock and we dropped him off and he like came over to my side of the car and opened the door and was like 'i want a goodbye hug' AWW i was like ur the best EVER!yeah so yanks are in 2nd place right now but its ok....i'll live..i hope...today was kats bday yay! the big one five! kath if u read this do u wanna go to my bros game tommms night?
