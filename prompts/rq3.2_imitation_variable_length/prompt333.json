My mood is struggling, its hard for me to reamain optimistic in face of all the problems, but i will try to keep myself cool and happy.  Last sat had fun in the nite with bbq at pasir ris park with jansen and his pals. that place was infested with mosquitos and i was wearing shorts, the moral wear long pants esp when it rained in the afternoon.. had loads of fun unwining and eating the food. Saw a lot of new ppl from jansen's church, managed to get the aj badge from him in exchange for my cj pin. THanks a lot dude. Played games like erm polar bear..erm some detective game, anyway left the place at like erm 11 with jed and jun liang, jansen's pals ...but we reached the mrt station too late, last train left at like 1125..what the hell.. stranded... most of the buses had also left... luckily we managed to squeeze into jansen's car and his parents kindlly sent us to amk, from there took nite rider to town before a cab home, reached home at 0115..freaking late  sunday nothing much xcept pw.. went to town to meet group memebers, lester was also there. Had to finish up all the surveys, first time really asking pple to do surveys, learned a few tricks from lester on asking pple to do such stuff. later slacked around at macs while waiting for joanne and lingzhi who were filming pple for our video clip  Monday, tuesday zipped by so quickly, got napha pre testing, man i got to improve my 2.4 km time, mind over matter... my standing broad jump has to improve too i think the best i can get is a pass.. got to work harder, get in shape soon.  Wednesday to friday was practically lawn bowls training at scc near city hall. On wed had lunch at funnan and after training had fast food again at raffles city.Argh got ripped off, jackson bought a whooper meal with 4 bucks and i bought a kids meal with 550...blargh, anyway course quite enriching, got some pointers                  ok havent blogged for a very long time like almost a week, find it very hard to type when i want to. Ok last sunday had lawn bowls competition in the morning, one word describes it 'disastrous', totally off form and couldnt concentrate. Boy was i glad when it was finally over, aniwaes after that went to meet my folks for lunch. Went home and took a nap, super tired. Then i managed to study a bit for chinese. IN the evening went to meet my friend for dinner, ate at bk cineleisure.After that we went bowling, i finally realised that u are not supposed to throw the ball but instead roll it, thats why i bowled so lousyily in the past. Anyway had loads of fun, played 3 games and at the same time burned a hole in my pocket, finally went home around 2300.  Monday studied a bit in the morning for chinese, its like its the subject that i am least prepared for. After that in the afternoon went to meet jansen and his pals.In the process, i asked them to do so surveys for my pw. watched spiderman 2 which was super cool and fascinating. Its better than the first one in my opinion, the hero really has grown and matured. AH that ends officially the holidays, as on tuesday its back to school  Tuesday basically had chinese in the morning, my water bottle was confiscated by the teacher, was SUPER ANGRY as i was very thristy, had to bear with it for like 3 hours, Joel my classmate was unfortunate..his english chinese dictionary was confiscated.. hopefully he managed to use it before that happened. IN the afternoon had NE quiz, quite hilarious some of the questions.After that had oral exams for chinese AO, was alrite in my opinion, finally went home to catch some sleep.  From wed to thurs i was practically slacking at home after school not even touching my homework. I still feel as if it was the holidays.. argh cant believe its term already..everyday go home play comp..still trying to dload gundam seed..  Friday finally i managed to grab gundam seed after a tip off from one of my friends. THere was a council investiture and a very entertaining youth day concert..BLar after school went to town....but with no one!!!!!!! why cant i fit into a group!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I REALLY MISS THE FIRST 3 MONTHS.. oh well, the good thing was i had some quiet time to myself. Tried eating some freezed dried food from 7 eleven, after that met bingshan, one of the lawnbowlers and went to kallang for training, along the way we were crapping about the upcoming exam results..                  hm going to talk about this long weekend thanks to youth day which happens like once a year. on SAt went to see the eye doc for the last time, waited for like close to 90 mins....which seemed like eternity, and went i finally saw the doc, lasted for like 3 min...ARgh make me wait for so long, was in the process of getting stoned.. After that went to macs at tanglin mall for a quick lunch.. saw a lot of crescent girls around . Then i went to holland village to meet jx and the other ppl for cell group meeting.Jx was telling me more about the holy spirit and speaking in tongues, i find it rather interesting.. hope to experience it sometime I could see that she is influenced by the holy spirit and this helps her through her problems in life.What the pastor said felt so real, it takes commitment to make things happen.. u are in a difficult situation cos god has plans for you, wants u to change your character or something.  Its probably things u havent thought of.. after all HE is ALMIGHY. After the meeting ended, i was planning to go home, but decided to follow jx with her friend jieyun to town. Hm starting from the heeren, we walked all the way to suntec city, my first time doing so on foot, along the way , we stopped by the singapore art musuem(old SJI :) and a shop selling some church stuff. Along the way, it was just chit chat and some sightseeing(churches)Dinner was at food court at suntec, at first we couldnt find it and had to ask for directions, it was shifted to another location.Hm saw chong ying and his friends, we gave our seats to them. Jing xuan then found her friend dywanne and from this point onwards, non stop bickering occurred, jieyun told me that once the two of them get together bound to quarrel. ITs very amusing actually...like watching free show, we went to macs at citilink mall where dywanne had his dinner and had to coax jx to eat some food. And the bickering continued...entertainment. After that, we went to esplanade rooftop, admiring the view.. listening to a free concert. There was some talk of some ppl getting married and who becomes the flowergirl/boy..ahem the two ppl bickering -_-''. Left the esplanade around 2200 and headed back home. Phew then its off to bed. Just something that came to my mind,treasure the ppl around you.. whether or not they like u does not matter..human life is so limited, must try to enjoy every moment.                 i seriouly dunno what is going on in my life now... i seem to be drifting just trying to survive....barely making it through daily life.....SOMe things never change......i am still struggling inside my head.
