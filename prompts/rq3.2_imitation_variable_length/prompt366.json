Well im over half way done with high school and so i guess its time to reflect(no not really but we are going to anyways)...ya the whole time ive been in high school have been like a roller coaster for me...like highs n lows...well actually...the high's arent too HIGH and the LOWs are nt to loww...so i guess my life is like the Judge Roy Scream...cuz its not really the big daddy of all rollercoasters but anyways...ya....idk my high school 'career' has just but been ok....i really havent changed a whole lot since 9th grade...in my eyes...i mean ive just been the same person...with a few exceptions...those late nights are killer......no j/k....but seriously.......im trying here......ok ya i havent really changed and well in the spiritual aspect of things i mean ive definitely had my highs and then there has been times where i just leave God outta my life for a while....i mean no joke...i would pretty much leave my house to go out one night and leave God at the house saying...Alrite God ill be back at 12!...see ya then big guy....and he is sitting there going....ok he just slapped me in the face again...i mean i just got back from camp and this is one thing i was hit hard with....I really in the past have just had times where i have 'God TIME OUTS' and i just forget about all he is in my life and all he has done in it and all he wants to do....i just leave it be and go my seperate way...EVen in the short time ive had at camp i find my self doing things and going places...not thinking a thing about God....and im like OMG...didnt i a few days ago RAISE MY HANDS and praise the God of the Universe and SING....HOLY SPIRIT RUSH RIGHT THROUGH ME...FILTER EVERY PART OF ME... LOVING FATHER HOW I WAIT FOR YOU.... OH MY GOSH how ignorant am i???....dont answer that....I praise him like i love him and absolutely need him like the air i breathe one moment...but put me out in the real world and God is only a Krutch....a help...a provider...and yes he is those...but he is everything else...he SATISfies...but yes that has hit me hard and that is definitely something i want to change in my life....I want an INCREASE IN GOD in my life....i need more of him and less of me....JOhn 3:30....'We must Decrease, BUT HE  MUST  INCREASE.' Man.... more of him less of me...and ya I can say this stuff....and write it out as passionately as i can but...the truth remains that FAITH WITHOUT ACTION IS DEAD...and until I break my pride...and become less....and become nothing...i will never be anything....UNTIL i become nothing...and well...its a work in progress...so ya thats it for tonight....pray for me and ill pray for yall...i sure as heck need it man....LATA...     ALL OF MY REASONING FELL TO THE GROUND WHEN I FIRST HEARD YOU SPEAK  WHAT A BEAUTIFUL SOUND   -unbound-                          Would you like to be known as someone who is easily read...and someone can automatically know what you are likely to do in a given situation???Or would you like to be someone who is  Mysterious  and can never be read at any given moment due to their wild, or   just longing to be different   type of personality....I dont know about you....but&nbsp; a part of me wants to be that person that has that mystique about em' and people are always wondering what he'll do next in life...and yet they will never find out due to his/her&nbsp;persona...i think everyone wants to be that type of person at some point in their life.........yes/no,maybe so?( most &nbsp;everyone i know is like the first person i described....easy to read...and thats why alotta people long to have that mystique...because its not them...and well its fun to not act yourself for a little bit....... thats why the girls are attracted to the bad boy....least every girl is to some degree deep deep down......but yes, the very sad thing about all this is......no matter how EASY to read a girl gets....i'll never be able to read one of em'....i mean She could be at the first Grade reading level and i wouldnt even have a clue...i guess thats how its supposed to be?.....All th girls who read this will probably IM me and say OMG U ARE SO WRONG...DADAdadad....GIRLS ARENT LIKE THAT............and that will just prove my point........o well......sometimes i wish i was Mel Gibson...he knows what women want...&nbsp;but i dont...and i guess thats alrite...it makes things a little more interesting....yet annoying at the same time..............but ya anyways its not like im caught up in this mess right now anyways....but i bet i will...anyways IM OUT...  &nbsp;  'What we do here&nbsp;on earth ECHOES through eternity!'  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Maximus   &nbsp; ummm PS:....idk...just a little side note.......I think its pretty cool about how THE AD BANNER at the top of the page advertises stuff that i talk about in my blog....For instance, when i talkd about CHipotle....it had a little thing up there for chipotle....anyways i think that was pretty awesome....but im probably the last one to discover this phenomenon...          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
