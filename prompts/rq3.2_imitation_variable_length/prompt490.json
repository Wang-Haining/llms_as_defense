Erica and i were leaving so she could run to her house and get some medicine and there were 4 old ladies outside the gate wearing survivior sashes adn they were smokeing. it was terrible.adn i had started to wonder what the point was. I could see if someone was paying so much for ever mile or something like that but we were all walking for no reason. Also they were haveing a blood drive which i thoutt was kinda commical because usually when you donate blood thay have you wait a while or you have soemone with you to drive you home becaude some people get all dizzy. at least that is what i thought could easily be wrong since i haveent been to one. But were all walking and they would draw blood and o could just see a whole bunch of ppl passing out on the track after it nad then haveing to go to the hospital and then they get blood maybee and altought its not th e same blood it would still hve made it pointless. Oh i feel so bad for michael.they lost what would have been the 2nd to last game they would paly by one point in overtime from what i hear they were doing verry poorly at the beginning and in the last 10 min. started playing like themselves. but he still has 2 years to go to state, that is his goal. i think thast there is a ring they get once they go that he wants because he was talking once and was all the only ring i am ever going to wear i sth e on e i get hwen we win state....... ok sleep is sounding good now later                  'i was chewin some watermellon bubble gum yesterday. And you wouldnt believe it unless you had seen it, but while i was chewin my watermellon bubble gum a truck passed by. Now i know your probably thinkin why in the world does it matter if your chewin bubble gum when a truck passed by. Well i know i didnt mention this before but that truck, it was red. AND i was chewin watermellon bubble gum and well watermelons, there red too. It was a sign i was convinced. Now i know that you sayin well I see red trucks everyday but thats you city folks. Yep i only see a truck about once every week when the mail comes and it blue. A red truck is a pretty unusual thing of what you be seein around here. Now i couldnt see the driver but when i was asleep last night i was dreaming that i was chewin some whatermellon bubble gum. and you wouldnt believe it unless you had seen it, but while i was chewin my watermellon bubble gum a truck passed by it was red. and in my dream there was an old man with a beard drivin. He looked like a city folk.  maybe a city country folk cause he had tattoos and wore a black vest, like a motercycle ridin person is what i amagine. a motercycle ridin person is all i could figure him to be. And you know how i know that my dreame was rite. cause he is been sitin right there in that booth at the back of the caffe by that window. And see that is the red truck, that one right behind him, that i saw when i was chewin the watermellon bubble gum and i think i should get a beard like that but then i would look liek a motercycle riden person liek how that guy in the back of the caffe by that window and i dont think id care for that too much.' The guy in the back of the caffe by that window got up and walked twords what he thought of as THE LOUD MOUTH.  'I just over hered you and i wanted to let you know that my name is Jed and i have never seen a motercycle in my life. THE LOUD MOUTH grabbed the hand that Jed stuck out. 'HI im Jeff and I just figured you did.' 'Jeff. You obviously know what i drive. What do you drive?' Jeff smiled                  'A motercycle.'          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
