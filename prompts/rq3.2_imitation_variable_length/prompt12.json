  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic:\n\n       first of all, let's clarify:  i am not a 'tool belt wearing' kinda person... i can swing a hammer, screw a screw (shut up...), build a quaint little birdhouse, even paint... but when it comes to the actual building of a structure, well, i can hand you the hammer or hold that ladder for ya...  so today, i helped a friend and his girlfriend do some work on what will be a 30' x 24' barn when it is done... they've got all the posts up, marked by way of laser level... secondary posting in, next up, lifting 20' boards up to near the top of the posts, and bolting them in place.   *note*  i hate ladders.  but so does his girlfriend, and she is afraid of heights, so feeling bad for her i volunteered to climb the ladder with one end of the 20' board, yeah heavy as all hell.  and while i am standing too high up on a ladder, holding this heavy thing, shaking like a leaf in a tornado, i am thinking maybe the horses will be fine in a tent...?   i'm pretty sure this is one of the 485675639 reasons why i am not in the construction business.   hard work never killed anyone right?  just leaves you with scrapes, bruises, broken fingernails, and a grand desire to descend that ladder and dive into a pool full of margarita....                  how do you answer that question?&nbsp; especially if you've never been to another country.&nbsp; do you need to have a comparison?&nbsp; is patriotism supposed to be blind? &nbsp;  depending on your age, i'm sure there are a lot of answers to that question.&nbsp; maybe if you're older, seen some wartime, it takes on a new meaning.&nbsp; maybe if you're&nbsp;younger you lean towards arrogance at the whole idea of patriotism because all you've known all your life is what you have been handed and what you feel you're owed or missing.&nbsp;   whenever i hear on the news of someone joining the military because they want to 'serve their counrty' i cringe.&nbsp; do you really?&nbsp; do you honestly understand what that phrase means?&nbsp;  anger is easy, they bomb our buildings and kill our people, let's go bomb them and theirs.&nbsp; that'll work, have we learned nothing from history?&nbsp; unfortunately&nbsp;a flip side to that, letting the big corporations step in, make it all about money and power and yet again forget about the actual people involved...still we get nowhere.&nbsp; how do we know the 'democratic way' is the right way?&nbsp; we don't all subscribe to the same religion, why would one set of politics work if one God doesn't? &nbsp;  being a proud american is not a simple statement anymore.&nbsp; human beings as a whole have successfully managed to complicate everything.&nbsp; nothing is simple anymore.&nbsp; you can't be tolerant if you can't agree to disagree.&nbsp; our opinions have become our war-stance.&nbsp; do we feel like we have something to prove?&nbsp; or maybe we have something to disprove?&nbsp;   i have strong opinions, if you don't subscribe, fine, if you'd like to express your opinion, do so.&nbsp; it's always good to hear how others feel.&nbsp;   i am proud to be an american.&nbsp; yes, i've lived in another country but i don't feel that it is necessary to do&nbsp;&nbsp;to be proud of the country you live in.&nbsp; i believe in God to a certain extent.&nbsp; and i love the fact that here in america i can say this out loud and hear it from others without fear.&nbsp; if you want to pray in public, knock yourself out, i don't... but i also don't feel the need to dictate how you 'praise' your God.&nbsp; in being tolerant, you have to learn how to allow other people to have their 'freedoms', after all, isn't that what america is about?&nbsp; personal freedoms, personal rights.&nbsp;  too many americans today have adopted the notion that they are underpaid, underappreciated, unfairly judged or wronged in some way.&nbsp; maybe these people need to take a step beyond the borders just to see how 'rich' their lives really are and what great opportunites they have available to them.&nbsp; i'm not so blind to think that there aren't any people at all that have been wronged, i'm sure some issues are real and deserve attention and justice.&nbsp; if money is how you rate quality of life, you're missing out on so much.&nbsp; same goes for fame.&nbsp;  in my pursuit of happiness i expect only one thing, that you respect my personal space, which i have right here in my home, where i am free to turn off the television if i don't care for the programming, shut of the music if i don't care for the lyrics, seperate myself from my community if i don't agree with the way things are being run.&nbsp;  i vote so that i may retain the right to complain if i am not satisfied at the way things turn out.&nbsp; being inactive is the same as being ignorant.&nbsp; do something.&nbsp; because doing nothing and complaining is meaningless.&nbsp;   this rant all came about after watching the news... i don't normally climb on my soapbox and vent, especially here in my blog where i am sure to receive a heaping of shit mail for my views.&nbsp; i won't tell you who to vote for in the upcoming election but i will tell you i am voting for kerry/edwards because i am unhappy at the way things are going.&nbsp; i only hope you'll be active in how your country is run.&nbsp; being a 'fair-weathered american' is like only rooting for your favorite sports team when they are in the finals.&nbsp; i get angry when this country behaves stupidly.&nbsp; i am thrilled when we make a difference in another country.&nbsp; either way, i am still&nbsp;proud of my country.&nbsp;                    Back about three years ago i made my first webpage, all with the help of my ISP at the time.... i blogged when blogging wasn't 'in'.  problem was it was a pretty lame page setup and i let anyone including my family read it.  that was a mistake.     so after a while i ditched the page, moved and got a new ISP and decided to try again, this time with my own ideas and lots of swiped icons, backgrounds, etc... even learned how to create a template, though i've forgotten tons already.   anyway.... new ISP, free space, new page went up.  some of the bloggers i read frequently would comment, i added a '101 things about me', and a sort of bio page, and a few other things, nothing special...  i'm not exactly sure how, but one of my family members got to my page, this time i didn't outright share it... i didn't censor my page a bit, not like last time where all my posts were read, re-read and edited to make sure i didn't cross anyone.   that got tiring so i was not so careful.  i spoke my thoughts thru my blog, never particularly vented toward anyone yet still my opinions and thoughts we always scrutinized by friends and some family that read it.   so fuck 'em all, set me up at blogger.com and off i went... now mind you, i haven't posted anything thought provoking, nothing that would earn me a slew of hate mail, and certainly nothing that would anger my friends or family but when i was checking out my nedstat (tells me who comes to visit here), i recognized an ISP and just about fell off my damn chair.  granted this may be anyone at all and not who i think it is, afterall, more than one person will subscribe to this service.  but holy crap what a fright i had.  i was tempted to go back and read my archives to make sure i didn't set off another reason to 'beat on jan for her blog'.   so to that lovely bunch of people i am so lucky to call family, go away, not like you've got a clue about me anyway... and to those friends who want to know the 'real me':  i swear.  a lot.  i have opinions and like to say them out loud once in a while.  whether they fit you're mold of me or not, too bad.  and um, thanks for the tequila robin, if you can't make the world go away, it's nice to know you can make it numb.   joy to the world, all the boys and girls, joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea, joy to you and me....          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
