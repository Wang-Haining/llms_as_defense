If you have spent any time listening to him or reading his books, you have undoubtedly heard his view on personal development. Here is the gist of it:   Work on your strengths, and strengths alone. Most people, on a scale from 1-10, will not raise an attribute more than 3 notches. So, if you are a 6 in one area, you could bring that up to a 8 or 9. On the flip side, if you are a 2, you will only advance to a 4 or 5; and people don't pay for average.  I'm struggling with this view PO!NT on a couple of levels.   The f1rst  It's an excuse for not being well rounded. For example: If you are a 2 at dealing with conflict, dealing with people, being honest, finding the good, empowering people, loving your neighbor, etc., you should NOT stay there. You HAVE to move up a few notches! Even if you only make it to a 4 in dealing with conflict, it's better than a 2. A 2 will only leave a path of destruction.   The 2econd  I don't think you will ever be a 9 or 10 in leadership if you are 2 in dealing with people. You can't delegate kindness, and still be an effective leader. You can't delegate a smile and still empower people.  Personally, I work hard on my weaknesses. My weaknesses build walls with my own ego and isolates the ones I love. By Gods grace, I'm knocking down those walls.                                 I’m sure that most of you caught up on our mini-vacation at  urlLink PO!NT of Contact .  Be sure to check out the pictures at that site.  I’m sure no one knows, but I have been working on a VERY BIG project for OPMG. It’s a product I would like to launch this summer. I’m sure it will be a big hit in the CMS world. I won’t bore you with the details… or give away my brilliant ideas. =)  For those of you who have been keeping track, the CSA drama is over. I am still working with them; however the drama is down to a dull roar. I love those guys; it’s the Stone I get frustrated with. They help me rise above it though.  On another front: It sounds like I may have company on the drive up north this summer. My uncle Dan may be riding with me. I am truly looking forward to that! He is a great guy, and I think we will have a blast! I’ll be sure to post some pics of our trip.  Well, no big PO!NTS today. I have some rolling around in my head, and should be flushing them out… however; I have some work to do.                                 This clipping was taken from the  urlLink President's Memorial Day Proclamation . I thought I would be worth posting on 2 levels. The first; it's informative. The second; it lets you know what a sound man GWB is.   In respect for their devotion to America, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved on May 11, 1950, as amended (64 Stat. 158), has requested the President to issue a proclamation calling on the people of the United States to observe each Memorial Day as a day of prayer for permanent peace and designating a period on that day when the people of the United States might unite in prayer. The Congress, by Public Law 106-579, has also designated the minute beginning at 3:00 p.m. local time on that day as a time for all Americans to observe the National Moment of Remembrance.   NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Memorial Day, May 31, 2004, as a day of prayer for permanent peace, and I designate the hour beginning in each locality at 11:00 a.m. of that day as a time to unite in prayer. I also ask all Americans to observe the National Moment of Remembrance beginning at 3:00 p.m. local time on Memorial Day. I urge the press, radio, television, and all other media to participate in these observances.   I also request the Governors of the United States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the appropriate officials of all units of government, to direct that the flag be flown at half-staff until noon on this Memorial Day on all buildings, grounds, and naval vessels throughout the United States, and in all areas under its jurisdiction and control. I also request the people of the United States to display the flag at half-staff from their homes for the customary forenoon period.                                  There is a reason they call it “ urlLink The Magic Kingdom .” The magic there can bring out the kid in anyone. Maybe that’s why I like it so much. I love being a kid; just ask Amelia.   As you know, Disney has 4 parks: The Magic Kingdom, MGM Studios, Epcot and The Animal Kingdom. They all are very different, and obviously very successful. One thing I noticed this time around about The Magic Kingdom was that it felt old-school…  reeeaaalllllly  old-school. It felt like it was conceived at a time when little boy’s adventures consisted of broomstick horses and giant lollypops. I’m sure it still strikes a cord with all the grandparents that get dragged around the park by their grandchildren though. Never-the-less, it’s still a great park.  As a creative professional, I get a charge from going to those parks. You can’t help but be swept away by the magic there. I get back to the office with so many buzzing ideas. The atmosphere allows you to think bigger, and dream longer. I love it.  The same love I have for Disney isn’t shared by many of the locals though. I hear the same small thinking as I did in G.R. about  urlLink Quixtar/Alticor . I don’t think people like to face the fact that 1 or 2 men can change the world through something as basic as capitalism and a dream. It forces them to deal with their own lack of ambition and lack of dreams. That’s a sad way to look at success if you ask me. The success of those companies aught to inspire you, change you, motivate you and free you. Maybe that’s why I like visiting those places. If you have been to Disney you know how overwhelming the attention to detail can be. Also, if you have ever been through the “miracle mile” you know how awe inspiring that can be. Both built by big dreamers. Both inspire. Both challenge your thinking.  I have a gabillion more thoughts on dreamers and inspiration. I’ll save those for my book.               \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
