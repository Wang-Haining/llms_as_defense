I found her voicemail odd because she never really calls me at work unless it's to say she saw someone or to catch me up on some little bit of bullshit. I returned her call to hear her whining about Steven.  'Have you heard from him at all?'  she said.  ' I have emailed him dozens of times, left voice messages, I've even contacted G! He hasn't even heard from him either. I thought maybe you had because y'all have talked a few times.' I can hear the distress in her voice. This freaks me out for 2 reasons.   1)  Steven is NOT her boyfriend.  They are not dating exclusively or even on a slightly serious level.  2) Why am I the appointed go to girl? sigh.  So I tell her that I haven't heard from him.  Which, I haven't, in at least a week or so.  And to be honest, boy am I glad!!  It's one thing to become friends with a friend's friend.  But when that line gets crossed, like Steven did with me, I could give two shits less if I ever hear from him again.  I wanted to tell Chris that Steve thinks she's bonkers, a bit on the psychotic side, to quit mailing him letters, little presents & collages.  I didn't though.  Because the cover would have been blown that I know & I'm not suppose to. I hope that Steven never contacts me again.  I hope that Chris can see that he isn't interested.  I'm hoping all this because I just want, for once, to be out of the damn loop!!                  My day is moving along like a Sloth. Thank you Hurricanes Bonnie & Charley.  Typically Friday's are fairly slow in our office anyway.  It gives us gals a chance to catch up on tossing the papers off our desk, gossiping, giving facials , catching up on whatever all between our phone calls.   Today? I feel like I've been here for 10 hrs.  It's a slow hell.  The phones aren't ringing, there are no orders, we've helped all other members in the office, so here we sit.  And sit.  And SIT. Good Lord, it's only 12:45!!! I've got another 3 hrs to go! Groan.  So I figured I'd sneak a few random thoughts on here.  ;)  On lunch today Sharon & I kicked it over to Big Lots.  Damn I love that place. I got myself this little black tank top w/ speghetti straps and a super cute pair of white panties that have a fake 'secret'  pocket on the front. Yknow how boys have those on the tighty whities? It's like that, except it doesn't open! Ah, I know.  Nothing a little seam ripper can't fix. hahaha.  Tonight I have an overnight sitter for M.  My husband has to work though.  So there won't be an exciting date night or anything. However, I am going over to Sharon's house.  We've decided we'll give one another pedicures, facials, girlie crap.  We'll probably drink a few martinis & end up watching movies in our undies.  I love having girlie nights!                     I just recieved an email that said I was a 'Sweet & Sexy Southern Chick.'  I hate to burst that guys bubble but A) I'm not always sweet and B) I'm really not Southern.  Ohwell.  The thought that counts, ay?  Of course it is!  That email was from the Jersey Shore.  Tsk Tsk.  I know!  I figured I'd make myself part of the welcoming committe for Steven.  Why not? Everyone else is looking forward to his move.   I doubt I'll see him for more than 4 minutes once he arrives in the state.  So I wrote back. Nothing major, nothing flirty, just regular ole stuff.   He did want to know why G never introduced us before I met my husband! Oh surely you JEST!!! I couldnt' believe he'd say such a thing! Well, yes I could.  So I'm not going to persue that comment or Steven, because c'mon... does it really take a brainac to figure out where it would lead?  I can't do that. But I do think it was nice of him to note I was Sweet & Sexy.  Made me think of Sweet & Sour Chicken... maybe that's who I really am. Sweet &amp; Sour.  Eh, aren't most women? :)                   Oh my GOSH what a day! It has been the kind of  day that just consumes every little detail. Every thought you've thunk (ha!) has been devoured by a project. You feel like your head will collapse from overload.    I feel like I'm going to fall apart or worse go home and get drunk! Ha! Actually, I hear my big garden tub, Mr.Bubbles, candles & a glass of iced tea callin' my name tonite.  Oh yeah!!! ** Friday night, over dinner, my step brother asked me to be his assistant. I slightly hesitated and then struck him a deal.  I told him if he graduates, shows me his client list, that he's made a name for himself & oh yeah PAY me enough, I'd do it.  We shook on it. (no spit envolved).  This afternoon I was dreaming about that job.  To just have this kick ass chill job w/ my brother.   Booking appointments, meeting the stars, travelling all over the place.  Then I snapped out of it when my phone rang.  I wonder if he could do that.  Hmmm... he's asked me since day 1 to be his assistant.  I do know that I'm creative enough to help him do an updo on a few drag queens for extra dough, apply makeup heavily, and what size bra a 6'5 man wears. Ahhh, to dream . **                   I just got home and it's 3 A.M. I haven't driven home this late since college.  It felt kind of weird, being on the road that late and not a soul in site.  I passed the plant where my husband works and thought about popping in, but I don't even know where to find him in that place.  Well, I forgot I was taking my stepbrother out to dinner tonight.  So as I was getting ready to go to Sharon's he called. Awww hell!  I had to shuffle my schedule a bit, but I made it to meet him @ TGIFridays for drinks & dinner.   Afterwards, I headed over to Sharon's for a little girlie makeover/slumber party blah blah whatever. I got there and Juicy & Sharon are pretty lit.  It was only 8pm.  Figured I could get a few more hours of hang out time with them. Wrong. Juicy passed out around 10.  Curled up on her air mattress with Enya playing in the background, mumbling about how she misses her international boyfriend.  I hung out with Sharon & her man for a bit, that is, until Sharon disappeared.  I made it upstairs to check on her to find that she's passed out in her bed mumbling about how she never should have eaten that hot dog! I said: Sharon, how many martini's have you had tonite? 'Oh, 6 or 7 I think' she said. Great.  I ended up falling asleep next to her watching Letterman.  Only to wake up at 2am.  Just wide awake.  Weird.  So after a brief struggle trying to find my jeans (I didn't want to wear her jammy pants home) I grabbed my purse & keys and hit the open road. I'm feeling like I should just give up on Friday nights all together and have my folks keep M on Saturdays.  Well, I guess I'm gonna try to get the rest of my sleep in. M won't be home till 4 pm tomorrow.  I think I'll set my alarm and take RD to Waffle House in the morning when he gets home.  Till then! J                  Working in an office, as we all know, does not come without a rule book.  I would like to point out a few of those that are not being followed here in my building.  1. No matter what the urgency, DO NOT have your cooter Dr. results faxed to your office.  No matter who you 'think' are your friends, no matter how many 'confidential' stamps upon it, someone will read it and disclose your identity.  *  I will not reveal who or what disease was discovered yesturday via fax*  2.  If you purchase clothes off Ebay such as a J-Lo brand, don't flash it off like it's freakin' Versace.  It's not.  It's J-Lo brand and you look like a ho.  3.  I'm over dried up flowers.  Sentimental or not I don't wanna see 'em everyday.  4.  If you're going to talk shit about another co-worker, please wait until all employees who may hear you leave the building.  For they will just come right out & tell that person: BTW,  Ms. Thang over there's talkin' shit.  Now look! We gotta take a step outback!  I think that's all I have.  I'm headed out of town! ;) I hope to enjoy my weekend. I also hope my husband comes to his senses by tomorrow.  Blondie & The Psychodelic Furs are playing in downtown &amp; I don't want to hang solo.                   I really want to sock it to my poet buddy.  He's getting a bit weird on me. All this talk about the shifting of the Earth, the white buffalo,  how man & nature are about to become one and the chosen ones will find the Red Road.  On and on and on he goes.  I'm lost in his vortex of mismatched ramblings.  I have no clue as to what he's talking about.   I remember the night he had this 'enlightening' expierence.  Or when he told me about it rather.  We were at a Shoney's resturant right outside Nashville.   I had just moved back home from Japan and was looking forward to meeting up with him, drinking coffee and talking about the shit I'd expierenced.  Didn't happen.  I instead listened to him go on and on about some crazy expierence he had with lights and visions.  How he spoke to some 'higher' thing.  Holy cow I thought, he's lost it.   Which, the ramblings have continued, much to my dismay.  Whatever will become of him? I think he's eating shrooms on a daily basis, that he's fallen off the 'wagon' and gone back to drinkin and drugs.  I doubt it though.  Something has seriously come across his way that he can't leave alone.  I'm beginning to believe he's turning cult like.  He's freakin' me out.   Ah, but you know how it goes... To each his own.  I want to wish him well on his travels of the Red Road and never talk to him again.  But I won't.  Too much history, too  much friendship, too much intrigue.   So I'm hoping he'll enlighten me.  And I'll find my purpose, whichever it may be.          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
