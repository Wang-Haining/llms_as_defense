The first two questions about academics and potential to contribute were very easy! But the third question is a toughie. It's why I'm out blogging instead of answering. It's an open-ended question. Sounds easy but no; I'm suffering from writer's block.  This is the part on the UC application where I put down anything that I think the universities should know about me. My friend Robert advises me to put a sad, sob story---if I have one. It's pathetic but true. Colleges really lap up heartbreak. It's too bad I've been mostly spoiled throughout my life. Damn. I can totally write a fictionally sob story but then (knwing my luck) I'll probably get caught. Then no other college will even think of perusing my application. Cheaters only cheat themselves. So I'm told.  I still think Mrs. Cutler (the AP English 12 teacher) is an evil slave driver. (I thought the same for Ms. Burrows--my 7th grade teacher, but I dubbed her a minion from hell.) I know this is AP, but  come on ! I have a life too. Well it's like this. In addition to finishing the UC essay (which I guess I appreciate, lord knows I would have procrastinated in November), I have to do an annotated bibliography for 25 essays out of the Fields of Writing (someone should burn those those fields) and another annotated bibliography for 20 'My Turn' essays out of Newsweek. Hmmm....I don't know about anybody else but that a LOT of analyzing! Oh the slave driver also wants the UC essay due Monday, Aug. 2nd, I have less than a week left. Oh joy.  Earlier, I sent an IM to my 'friend' Jessica. I used quotations because as of late I don't considered her a true friend b/c sometimes she is, sometimes she isn't. We're in a lot of classes and clubs together so I see her a lot. She's friendly when she needs me but when it's the other way around it's all ---> 'oh, sorry, I'm busy...I have music...I have this...I have a test...I have mono...' Well okay I made the last one up but she's really is like that! It's only academics (and the flute---out of all the instruments to choose...the flute...) with that girl. Another thing is that I would be talking to someone in class and she butts right into the conversation. All of the sudden I'm out of the conversation because she has steered it to something I either really don't care about or have no clue about. Or we're in a club meeting and she hardly acknowledges that I'm there. Well, that's  some friend . Honestly, that why I hardly study with her. Also, it's not as if she needs me there anyway; she can handle it herself---she is uber brainy.  Anywayz, I need to get back to the essay if I want to meet deadline. Bientot!                          I just got interviewed by a Press-Enterprise reporter!!! I was kind of nervous at first but it went fine. She asked me questions about what I thought of the college admissions process and what i was doing to prepare for it. And she said she would ask her editors if it would be okay to photograph me for the article!!!! I started jumping around my room, shouting out exclaimations of excitement (when we hung up of course---I didn't want her to think I was crazy or anything...)  The reason why she called me was because I participated in the 2004 P-E Journalism Boot Camp. They didn't make us run laps or do push-ups. It was a work shop that taught teens, who were interested in journalism, about the whole business, how to get in it, how to interview, ways to improve our writing, etc. For a week I came to the Press-Enterprise office and stayed from 9 a.m. till 5 p.m. to be around professional journalists and learn from them. There were also GREAT luncheons. And they gave us bootcampers porfolios with notepads for interviewing, an AP style manual, and other goodies.  So when Kim (the reporter) e-mailed for a list of names that she could use as sources for her article, I casually slipped in that I too was going to be a senior going off to college next year...which just proves that you should never waste an opportunity!!!                           I went to Maji's 1st b-day today. The first thing she did when I saw her was cry. I didn't think she liked me that much...(and who wants to be known as making babies cry??) but she actually warmed up to me later. I also saw a bunch of other aunts, uncles, and cousins. But I was mobbed by my grandma (from my dad's side) who then proceed to grope my ass while hugging me. I've noticed that my other grandma, and occassionally my mom, do that sometimes.  What is with the butt thing?  Leave me alone!! ::sigh:: It was still great to see them all again.       How kawaii!  It's s/t my aunt gave me from the cake.   I saw another lil cousin, Anica (she's 3 yrs old), which is always amusing since she's used to having her way and does that most hilarious things. She started to strip her clothes off because she had wanted to swim but Sophie (another baby cousin) had her suit. LOL. Geez, she's bold. Then again, I guess all three-yrs-olds are typically carefree.       Here's the b-day girl!  Eating my kitty...no!! Well, maybe she's attracted to the frosting still on it...                               My family went out to this chinese buffet for dinner tonight. The exciting part is that I got to drive there (in a separate car from my siblings and with my dad to supervise, of course). It was going good and I even parked correctly this time! lol. Not something that's frequent with me.  However, after dinner...I swear my dad showed signs of PMS. What's his problem? Kept screeching about take turn now, no this turn!! Well, if I could concentrate maybe, just maybe, I could pay more attention to the light. Wouldn't that be much better? Not to mention, safer? I should just ignore him completely and only pick up when he's talking about turning. There. Well, it's seems childish--but that's how he's acting too.  Then, we came home after stopping for a few groceries from VONS (which btw he didn't help me upload or put them away--the selfish...). Oh, I bought a few magazines and some gum to add to the cart at the store in vengence. Do I need to know what the lastest trends for fall are? Maybe. Or what celebrity is dating who? Hell, no. But will it make my dad spend more money than he has to? Of course. (It's not as if I don't like teen magazines because I do read them but I can live without them.)  My brother Ryan, who's as irritable as hell, comments 'Oh, you have no taste in food....oh, why did you choose that?' My response: where you there--NO, did you bring the food in--NO, then stuff yourself. That and I didn't tell him where the ice cream was or that we even bought it, well, Mr. Think-He-Knows-All can find it on his own.  Why is my family so damn moody?? Later, at home I found my siblings fighting over a ball. A stupid rubber ball. Of course, that triggered my mom. And well...the rest is chaos. Now, I'm not going to say that they're dysfunctional because they aren't but they freak out at the littlest things  way  too much.  On the plus side, I think I'm ready for my behind the wheel test. My permit expires on Aug. 14th and my test is on Aug. 10th. Think that's cutting it too close? It is! I can't believe it. One chance to make or I start all over again. I'll do fine if I'm not nervous though. And as long as neither of my parents are in the car with me (and they won't, yes!).         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
