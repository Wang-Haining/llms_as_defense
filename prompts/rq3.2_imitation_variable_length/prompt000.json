I am so very excited and have missed them terribly: Katie Camille, Morgan, Eric, Rachel,  EVERYONE! YAY!  I'm sure they all had a fabulous time. Morgan was apparently the choir slut.  Hehe . I saw Eric today which was glorious and he told me that he is directing Barefoot in the Park this year.  Lovely.  I am going to be doing the cabaret and it will great, simple, elegant fun.  I gave Miles a ton of the paperbacks which Mom and I read. She is reading The Notebook as I type this, most likely off of the sugar high from the  insanely lethal cookies  we had today. She and Xander and I had a grand time dancing to her mix in the car. Poor Xander didn't get to steal it though.  Sad.  Perhaps I'll steal it first.     We sit here Silently Watching the ducks  And eating mystery meat   We wait here  Lying  In a dandelion ring Tossing toothpicks in the air  We dance here  Serving  In a sea of comedy  With words we've never heard  We help here  Smiling Seeing it clearly A group of good hearts and minds  We laugh here  Waiting  Random anticipation  Falling over onto gravel   We love here  Reeling  Day like no other And the dandelions sing...                      No comments on the last two?  I am going to go crawl into a hole and weep . To the sounds of Josh Groban whose voice makes me  melt . (Happy now, Catherine? haha) Oh well. At least Miles is happy with the poem. Ian has yet to talk to his mother. I think I might break out the rosary for this one. I think God's sick of me saying 'If you do this, I'll become a nun!' though.  Oops.  Maybe this one last time...    Today is Bastille Day!  I stormed Herb Parsons Lake with my bike in honor of this lovely French holiday. Last Bastille Day, Derek gave me a Celine Dion CD to celebrate it. I'm going to miss little things like that. Perhaps I shall go pull out Celine and dance. Ahh...  No wait! I can't dance! I'm too busy packing! Yes, as of today, I will be leaving in a week to go far away to  Pensacola, FL  with Randi and my surrogate family to find seashells, check out boys I'll never have, and hang out on the beach. Then, I will return home and the next morning I will catch a flight down to  Dallas, TX  to be with my  amazing  cousins, the only people I really love to be around on Dad's side.    I can storm as much as you  Bring the rains and lightning too  I could cause a hurricane  In an altered view of pain  Fire would be blazing bright  Winds whipping in the night Hail could just come falling down And still would not create a sound Thunder would creep along the way  To embrace the night or curse the day Tornadoes would have a job that's kind  To sweep bad memories from my mind A storm to clear my head from grief  To blow away what all I've seen  To somehow form a new clean slate Someday soon before it's too late  I'd control nature just for a time   Even if it's only inside of my mind    Do you ever have one of those times when you just write like crazy?  It's quite fun.           \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
