LOVING FATHER HOW I WAIT FOR YOU.... OH MY GOSH how ignorant am i???....dont answer that....I praise him like i love him and absolutely need him like the air i breathe one moment...but put me out in the real world and God is only a Krutch....a help...a provider...and yes he is those...but he is everything else...he SATISfies...but yes that has hit me hard and that is definitely something i want to change in my life....I want an INCREASE IN GOD in my life....i need more of him and less of me....JOhn 3:30....'We must Decrease, BUT HE  MUST  INCREASE.' Man.... more of him less of me...and ya I can say this stuff....and write it out as passionately as i can but...the truth remains that FAITH WITHOUT ACTION IS DEAD...and until I break my pride...and become less....and become nothing...i will never be anything....UNTIL i become nothing...and well...its a work in progress...so ya thats it for tonight....pray for me and ill pray for yall...i sure as heck need it man....LATA...     ALL OF MY REASONING FELL TO THE GROUND WHEN I FIRST HEARD YOU SPEAK  WHAT A BEAUTIFUL SOUND   -unbound-                          Yeah so half of the summer is already gone and man its FLOWN by...i guess because its been so fUn so far but ya its going by too fast...Just got back from SLU(Student Leadership University) and  yeah it was a ton of lectures and ya...alott of them were boring...but alot did have good messages as well...the good came with the bad...but all in all it was a good trip; got to know people that i didnt know all that well and that was cool...and even tho we couldnt go to islands of adventure because of rain...universal studios was still FUN.......o ya the fireworks at the disney resort hotel were Amaziing...best ive seen at aleast...so anyways that was my trip to orlando and now only one more thing left for my summer really...Church Camp! Now thatll be fun but ya until then nothing too fun..hanging out...And you know what....getting your wisdom teeth out isnt as bad as people say it is...i mean besides alotta blood and soreness...its not too much to write home ABOUT...anyways...ive come to the conclusion that i definitely wont have time to keep up with this thing during school so i guess this is like the SUMMER DIARIES 2004....man that sounds like some gay disney movie but o well.... maybe i should send it in...yes?no?...
