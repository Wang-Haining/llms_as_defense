He still dosen't like tummy*time, but it is helping him and he is doing much better compared to 1 month ago. We've had a busy week. Today it's raining and the candles are lit and the house has cooled off and Nick is napping! When he wakes up, we have more errands to run. Nick has done a good job sleeping the last 2 or 3 nights. He has been going to sleep at 8:30-9:00 and up at 2:30 and again around 5:30 or 6:30. After that feeding, he goes back to sleep  again  until 7:30-8:00. Last night I could not sleep, so I just watched Nick sleep. He&nbsp;is so precious! I think he is the most beautiful baby in the whole wide world!!! I love his chubby, chubby hands! Nick  loves  to stand! His face lights up and he gets this huge grin that takes up almost his entire face!~his eyes crinkle, too! I love days like today. The only thing missing to make this day perfect is Shawn. But...he'll be home in 8.5 hours!                    I just finished a book called, Sarah. It is about Sarah & Abraham.   IT WAS SO GOOD ! I am almost shaking! I love when a book can transport you to another time...to become so involved with the book and characters that their emotions become tangible. Ahhhhhh! Good Book. Today was beautiful! I set up Nick's swing outside our back door and actually got to lay out for almost an hour! Nick slept basically slept through the night!~He got up around 1 but the pacifier worked its magic and put him to sleep until 5. Then we both slept until 9!!! Lucky us. We went on a long walk today, too. He also had tummy time and only fussed for 5-10 minutes before falling asleep on his  left  side which is great. Nick turns his head to the right when he sleeps and just in general all the time...so his head is now flat...YES FLAT on the right side. All the time I can get him to be on his left side will even it all out and make his skull more round. This happens all the time to babies and it will go back to normal...I hope ;) In August, Shawn & I are going to Valleyfair for his work picnic! I am so excited. I  love  rides!!! The faster the better.  Nick and I miss Shawn a lot. He both got used to having him home. I found out yesterday (& it's been on the news too) that Shawn will be going to Iraq from May 1st until Aug 30th next year. After that, he'll be home for good!!! No more leaving!!! Thank God!!! At least next summer, I will be busy with Skills  all  summer long! But, Shawn will miss my graduation. =(                    Yesterday I took Keke and Nick to Barnes & Noble then we three visited G&amp;G Koski then we three went home to feed  the monster  then to Chester Bowl for Music in the Park. Nick had a blast! We all did. The park was absolutely packed with families-kids, dogs and food vendors. We listened to a band called,  The Fish Heads . It's a bluegrass band. They are awesome! Nick played on my lap for an hour without fussing! He smiled, danced, and even sang! Nick Sings! He really likes looking at dogs and babies that look similar to him. It was sooooo much fun. Next Tuesday Keely and Nick and I are going back to hear Beatles music. This early afternoon Keely and I took Nick down to the lakewalk and there was a huge boat coming in. So, Keely and I walked fast and found a spot along the crowed pier. The boat blew its loud horn and I said something to Keely about I hope that doesn't hurt Nick's ears. The spot we found was not so conveniently located under the bridge so when the bridge answered the boat by whistling back, Nick cried. It was one of those scared out of his mind cries. The type that break my heart. But, it didn't last long...10 seconds maybe. I took him out of his stroller and held him as the boat went by.    Nick's weight update...19.5 pounds.                 \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
