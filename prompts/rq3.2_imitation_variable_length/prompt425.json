Highs:  Highs for the week for me are that i lost 2.5kilos (5.50pounds) :) Yay!!!  Lows:  No exercise and Andrew came home with a chocolate for me (so sweet and obviously i couldn't hurt his feelings by not eating it *G*)  Aims:  Mum is coming down for a week on Thursday so my aim is to stick to the food plan while she is here and not eat out to much and also to still exercise.  Thats about it for me, have to decide what to do for Easter cos i want my eggs :) which is ok but when we drive home (8 hour drive) we always have junkfood to eat, and because i'm so bored i constantly eat in the car...have to find something a little more healthy but still yumm!  Hope everyone elses weeks have been good, i like the comment option now to Leslie by the way and hope your back is feeling better Aleta, more so for your trip :)                        I have company for the next week.  My thin, curvy sister and her lanky fiance are staying with my thin, muscular husband and myself.  *sigh*  I'm determined to still get into the gym a few times, but it's going to be sketchy while they're here.  The past two days, my eating habits have gone to hell.     Exercise:   Spent three hours in the gym last Wednesday.  Spent Thursday being very, very sore.  Friday did the 'Flight of the BumbleBee' cleaning exercise, which includes me running up and down my stairs cursing violently at how messy Ralph and I are.  It WAS aerobic, though.  Saturday was spent wandering around Sea World for 7 hours.  I'm hoping I managed to get enough exercise that I at least made up for not going to the gym yesterday or today.     Eating:   Very, very badly.  I'm consuming a lot of junk that's just not good for me because the kids have brought it into our home and I am weak.  :(  This week will be better.  I hope.  Still ignoring the numbers and trying to keep an eye on how my clothes are fitting and how I'm feeling.                          I went out running Monday (Brrrr!) morning and out of 1.5 miles, ran about 3/4 mile. I didn't go quite as far as I would have liked, mostly because we dipped back down to freezing weather. On the plus side, when I started walking (I walk about half a mile to warm up), I thought running was going to be painful and unpleasant - it just didn't feel good even walking. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it actually felt really good...and not just because it helped keep me warm. :)  I didn't go walking yesterday, but I'll be taking advanatge of my days off the rest of the week to run in the afternoon when it's warmed up a bit. I also found a Web site called www.connectingconnectors.com that's for overweight women who are running or walking to lose weight. They have state chapters as well and membership is free, so I signed up for that. Hopefully that will help me keep on track with running.  Eating's gone better as well, though I did succumb when one of the copy editors brought in a bag of cheetos. We have entirely too much food at work. Other than that, I've stayed on track and kept my foods healthy and portions reasonable.                        Misty, I'm going to echo what Aleta said. Muscle does weigh way more than fat. When I was running track and throwing the shotput, people always underestimated my weight because so much of it was muscle. Plus, muscle burns more calories at rest than fat does, so the more you have, the better off you are, weight-loss-wise. I walked 2.6 miles today (two loops around the park) and kept up a pretty brisk pace. I'm planning to start running either Sunday or Monday, so my big goal this week is to get out every day but Wednesday and walk.  I did better eating today, though I've figured that instead of breakfast lunch and dinner, I eat before work (usually abour 11), at work (usually about 7) and after work (lately, about midnight). Usually all I do after work is eat dinner, then read for a while and go to bed. I think I'm going to try cutting that meal down to some steamed or raw veggies and tea or water and see how that works.  Oh, and I have another tip that I've found works really well. On Sundays (most weeks), I try and plan out my at-work meals for the week. Sometimes I'll make a big pot of soup and put it in tupperware containers, or grill chicken. Monday and Tuesday's meals go in the fridge, the rest go in the freezer, and I don't even have to think in the morning. It helps me stay away from the restaurants and sandwich places downtown on my dinner break, plus I can keep the amounts fairly small. This was a great idea, guys. I'm a lot less likely to skip a workout or scarf down cookies when I know I'm 'reporting' to somebody. :)                       I'm starting over again.&nbsp; School is almost over.&nbsp; I'm a research paper and a business plan away from completion, so I think I can manage to add a little to my schedule. &nbsp; Also, I went ahead and joined weight watchers about a week ago.&nbsp; *sigh*&nbsp; It feels like failure, but I know it isn't.&nbsp; I'm getting used to eating less crap and more vegis, which is a good thing.&nbsp; Ralph tried to talk me into ice cream last night, but I resisted.&nbsp; (I swear that boy is nothing but trouble!&nbsp; *g*)&nbsp; &nbsp; Exercise: We took the dog for a walk last Wednesday.&nbsp; At noon.&nbsp; In Texas.&nbsp; I've never sweated so much in my life.&nbsp; We also went for a walk last night and I think we might add walking to our evenings a few times a week.&nbsp; We also got up this morning and went to the gym.&nbsp; I spent 30 agaonizing minutes on the elliptical, but feel pretty good so far today.&nbsp; Tonight is yoga, then home for a quick dinner by myself.&nbsp; Tomorrow is my weighing day, so I'll let you guys know how I do! &nbsp;          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
