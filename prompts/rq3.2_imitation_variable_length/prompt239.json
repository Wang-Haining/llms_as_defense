Harvey station is a good 1/2 hour from Fredericton and Frog lake is even further.  We got out into the general area using the map and then played a game of 'drive around with the windows down and listen for saws'  Funny enough this worked after a while.  We pulled in to the most hostile, pot-smoking, thinning scene imaginable.  Our whole crew had been told that the next place we were going was Harvey but they hadn't told the guys who were already out there we were coming.  By the time we showed up the 4 guys who'd been working this 18ha block had allready been there for two weeks and weren't exactly making headway.  Crappy quality and very little acreage cut could very easily be attributed to the joint chain-smoking we witnessed in the hour we were out there.  They were pissed that we were there, we were pissed 'cause it was such a far drive and in the end after looking at the land you'd need to be part billy-goat just to cut it.    There was only one strip left and a guy that smelled like auto's jacket and looked like a 25 year old zz-top member said he wanted it, who was I to object?  We'll probably get screwed tommorow trying to find some new strips to cut but anything's gotta be better than driving 45mins to cut shitty ground at a shitty wage.   Oh, and did I mention it was 30 degrees celcius today?  That helped make the decision too.  Six Tanks of Gas - Pre-Commercial Thinning in New Brunswick - The Blog                                  Last Friday I finished a 1.10 hectare block that was brutal. It was a grown up clearcut and the 3rd block I'd done in the area. Super thick and it was raining. Worst of all it was full of maple clumps.   A maple clump usually comes up where a maple has previously been cut. The stump gets left and then 3 to 50 stupid little stems grow up in its place. We've got to space our trees at 6 feet but usually if the maple clump is big enough you can just leave 2 stems on either side of the clump somewhere more than 3 feet apart. The way most guys deal with these clumps is to leave them until everything within about 30 feet of the clump has been thinned. This is so the trees won't be as likely to get hung up.   A sharp saw is the best weapon because the maples are so hard to cut through. Since they're all 'clumped-up' you can't really get your saw bladE on a good side of the stem do direct the fall so you just have to hack at them. Also its a good idea to double cut your trees. By cutting them twice, once up around chest high then again as low as you you are less likely to get hung up.  Anyway, at the end of the day on Friday I'd left a maple clump that was 15 feet in diameter and must have had at least 50 stems on it that was surrounded by these huge 10' thorns that I havn't yet identified. It was the very last thing to be cut for the whole day. I was wearing my damn rain pants because it was wet in the moring but buy the afternoon it was 20C and I was sweating my ass off. I cut the whole thing in 10 seconds flat but the clump had grown like a corscrew with every single branch tied up in its neighboor. I had it cut in 10 seconds but then had to take 10 minutes to drag the cut stems down into the friggin thorns.   Six Tanks of Gas - Pre-Commercial Thinning in New Brunswick - The Blog                                  Every second Monday is 'time card hand-in' day.  What this usually means is everyone spends half the day sitting in their trucks at the entry-way to the road into the block.  We do this so our foreman who no-longer has 4x4 in his truck (regardless of what the stickers on the quarter-panel say) can get to us and get us paid.    The other every second Monday ritual that goes along with this is that something happens to defeat the previous ritual's purpose... Today kept true to form.  We got our paper work (failed blocks) cleaned up by 9:30am and headed back out to the road.  When we got there we ran into 3 more crews that were all bitching in the road about the outfit.  Rumours of who'd quit and how close others where to quitting.  And we got the news that there were no more strips left at the old block.  We headed in to the office to get our time cards looked after but the runners still hadn't gps'ed the old stuff so we had no firm numbers to calculate pay.  I called the foreman on his cell to see where we should be headed to next and he assured me that he was out at the old block and there were strips left... oh.. and that he was stuck up to the damn axles in mud. But he assures me it won't be a big deal to get out and he'll be right along.  Noon comes by and there's no strips at the old block and an even bigger set of crews is hanging on the road bitching.  I borrow a cell and call the foreman.  He's still stuck.  I get enough info out of him to figure out how to get into the next block but its not layed out.   All the 2wd's follow me into the new block and all the 4x4's head out to rescue the forman.  Since nothing's layed out I don't dare start cutting since, even though I'm 99.9% sure this is the right place I sure don't wan't to cut somebody else's shit for 3 hours with no pay.  Everyone decides beer is the better option so we redneck hillclimbed out of the trans-canada ditch (the same 2wd chevy fullsize got stuck again.. ha ha) and headed home.  I stopped at the office an picked up some blue and red tape.  From here on in I'm gonna run my own damn blocks if they're not ready.. The lazy-ass line runners who can't keep ahead of us for some damn reason can gps the bastard later.  Oh.. and as for the title,  C.J. Munn Equipment on the Hanwell Road rocks.  Leather work gloves that fit for a buck a pair, sweat shop child labour all the way baby!    I bought ten pairs.  Six Tanks of Gas - Pre-Commercial Thinning in New Brunswick - The Blog                                   Well, I havn't done much with the site and my official excuse is that I've been sleeping.&nbsp;&nbsp; We've been getting up at 4am because&nbsp;until last week we continued to work out in Deersdale moving progressively farther away from Fredericton until it just became too much.&nbsp;&nbsp;We kept getting promised that ground was opening up in Fredericton but it never seemed to come.   The real story is that the only ground around the Fredericton area is private and private ground thinning is controlled by the  urlLink York-Sunbury-Charlotte Forest Products Marketing Board  (YSC).&nbsp; They have a certain budget that is equally divided between pre-commercial thinning contractors and we had long blown our quota and the company was practicing some not quite legal means of continuing to work that had finaly been shut down.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This also explains why the YSC quality checkers were being so damn hard on us.   In Deersdale all four of the Fredericton thinners who had yet to quit (including myself) started working together on blocks so that we'd all be done at the same time should any Fredericton ground open up.&nbsp; This was good since the cutting was terrible.&nbsp; Spruce so thick that you couldn't see the blade at the end of your saw.&nbsp; We also broke two saws slowing down the process significantly.&nbsp; I blew both crank seals in my saw which set me back $75.&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy I travell with completely destroyed his saw by&nbsp;melting the crank bearings and then insisting on still trying to use it.&nbsp; I wasn't there that day but everyone told him to stop but his stubborness and lack of knowlege of engines landed him with $778 worth of repairs to his saw.&nbsp; They warrantied $600 of it but it might get disalowed once the parts get to the manufacturer.&nbsp; Keep in mind that a brand new saw is only around $1000.&nbsp; The saw shop now hates him so hopefully he wont require any more work before the season's out and things cool down.   Anyway after all this the rate in Deerdale was only $385/hectare but was worth atleast $550.&nbsp; Three fast thinners still took 3 days to do a single hectare and we bured 36 tanks of gas between us.&nbsp; That works out to less than half of what we would expect to make on a a shitty day.&nbsp;  In the end we all quit working for the contractor we'd been with for the start of the season.    Three of us have ended up with a new super small outfit (4 guys and a foreman including us) and are working fairly close to town.&nbsp; The outfit seems kind of rinky-dink so hopefully there's no problems getting paid.&nbsp; The other guy had ended up working with an outfit thinning about an hour away with some of the guys from our original crew that quit 2 weeks before we did.   In the end everyone's still&nbsp;got work and were's not getting lied to (hopefully)&nbsp;everyday like we were so here's hoping for a good last month of thinning.&nbsp; I'm done to go back to university the first of September.
