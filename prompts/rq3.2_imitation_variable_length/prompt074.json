It is sufficent to say, I am trying to keep my mind busy, very busy.  Some are no doubt shaking their heads wondering when my poor little brain isn’t busy with too many things to process.  Well, that’s true, and I usually let it run and run, but this time, there are some ideas and thoughts that I don’t want to dwell on.  But all that is beside the point.  When I got home from work today, my folks had gotten home from my brother’s retirement ceremony.  He’s retired/retiring from the air force.  That too is beside the point, I know, I know, get on with it already, well here you go.  My dad was watching one of my all time favorite movies, The Rookie, about that teacher that goes to the Major Leagues in his forties.  I am a sap I know, but when he gets called up, and he has that look of joy… well, it reminds me that dreams do come true.  The story of Jim Morris and his rise to the major leagues is the story of baseball.  For those who don’t know (I manage to keep it pretty well hidden) I am a huge fan of baseball.  It is a sport that grew out of the most difficult time this country has ever gone through, the American civil war.  Baseball is America to me.  I don’t know exactly how to express how I feel about it.  Baseball is not a game I watch on TV, and it has been a long time since I followed my favorite team (Atlanta) during the season.  But I will always stop and watch a few minutes of a little league game, or maybe an inning or two on TV.  I really don’t watch much TV so most of the time I run into a game it’s live.  I remember buying Topps cards with the chewing gum with the cards.  I also remember cutting my mouth on that same gum, from the fifties I think.  Once I even managed to blow a bubble with some of it, four or five packs went into that bubble if I remember correctly, and I got a Tony Gwynn.  I remember playing ball my junior year of high school.  Something about that uniform, having it on made me feel right.  I honestly think that a baseball jersey is one of the classiest looking shirts in the world.  Now if you have been paying attention, you have already realized, I never ever claimed to be any good at playing baseball, heck, I’m not very good at slow pitch softball.  But that is all beside the point.  I own a ball glove, and I have a few baseballs kicking around.  There is nothing in this world like a game of catch with a friend.  The feel of letting the ball fly, the sharp snap of a baseball in a well used glove, the sound of summer.  Satisfaction is to be had in a game of catch.  I don’t know if I have gotten anything across here except I am more than a little verbose and I like baseball.  I really like baseball.  I like what it used to mean and what it means.  So I guess that this whole post is dedicated to the boys of summer, from Babe Ruth to Hank Aaron, from Jackie Robinson to Nolan Ryan.  To the day I saw Mark Maguire knock number 62 out of the park.  To those guys who tried and failed, like Mr. Manning, my ninth grade English teacher.  To Jimmy Morris.  To a six year old some where breaking in his first glove. To an old man who played ball as a young man just home from World War Two.  To any one who has held that little white ball, swung a bat, or caught heard and felt the snap as their glove closes around the ball.  To baseball, to summer, to youth, to dreams.
