  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic:\n\n       Keith Barton, a magician in Hueytown, Ala. with Mississippi ties, received national attention after Matilda, a 14-year-old chicken featured in his magic act, was officially named the 'World's Oldest Living Chicken' by Guinness World Records.  Barton was born at Keesler Air Force Base, grew up in Gulfport and graduated from Harrison Central. His father, James Barton of Orange Grove, still lives in South Mississippi.  During the 'Mort the Mystifying' magic show, Matilda's role is to appear in a pan that contained only an egg yolk and some hot sauce moments earlier. Barton's wife, Donna, is also in the act as the magician's assistant.  Matilda has practically doubled the lifespan of a normal chicken, which is 7 or 8 years. Matilda has never laid eggs and is very pampered, and Donna Barton said she believes both contribute to Matilda's long life.  The Bartons began performing their magic show in 1989 for children at libraries and churches. In July 1991, Matilda made her magic show debut.  Barton is a member of the Fellowship of Christian Magicians, International Brotherhood Of Magicians and Ring 35 (Judge Arnold Drennen Ring) of Birmingham. He has extensive training in magic, including completion of the home-study course offered by Chavez College Of Magic in Los Angeles. He also spent a year mastering the Chinese Linking Rings, which are one of his signature routines.                  Happy Father's Day to all of you dads out there. All of the gifts that dads bring to their children are overlooked too often, so enjoy your day. I visited my Dad in Waveland a little early and made him his favorite bread pudding with whiskey sauce so Quentin and I could spend Father's Day with his father. We're off to Father's Day lunch and to check out the new Harry Potter movie (which will hopefully be much better than Garfield was!).  Wit and wisdom from my father...  * It's better to be pissed off than pissed on. * Life's not fair...get over it. * I don't care who's right or who's wrong. She's my wife and I have to live with her long after you are gone. * Your ass is grass and I'm a lawnmower.(reserved for special occasions, of course) * Some friends come, some friends go  * You can buy them books and send them to school but that doesn't mean that they will be successful. * Life's too short for cheap whiskey. * Cheap isn't always the best deal. * If you fall, get up, dust yourself off and try again.  * No one ever learned to ride a bike in a day (and Rome wasn't built in a day either). * Buying a tutu doesn't make you a ballerina. But who the hell wants to be a ballerina anyway? * No matter where you may wander (and you need to wander a lot to find this out), there's no place like home. * If you don't have anything else to talk about, there's always the weather and the job. Always. * Just showing up is 90 percent of success. * Growing old is hell. Until you get old, then it sure as hell beats the alternative. * Hot, humid summers beats shoveling your way out of winter any day. * He's your brother and you need to watch out for him--even if he doesn't want you to. * There's no explaining the human heart--it wants what it wants. * Take care of the things that mean a lot to you. * Failure in business does not equate to personal failure. You just got to find the right gig. * We're all still trying to figure out what we want to be when we grow up. Just keep looking...   And, in honor of my father, here is the recipe of the bread pudding I always make for him, one of his favorites:  Bread pudding with Whiskey Sauce  1 qt. half and half 2 cups sugar 1 large loaf Frech bread 3 eggs 2 tbsp vanilla 1 c. raisins 1 stick butter  Tear bread into bits and place in greaded 13x9 pan. In separate container, mix milk, eggs, sugar, vanilla and raisins. Pour over bread and mash bread down till soaked. Top with one stick of butter cut into slices. Bake at 350 degrees for one hour.  Whiskey Sauce  1/2 cup butter 1 small can evaporated milk 1 cup sugar 1 egg yolk, beaten 1 jigger bourbon  Combine butter, milk, sugar and egg yolk in top of double boiler. Cook, stirring over simmering water till thickened. Stir in bourbon. Serve warm on bread pudding or plain cake. (Or, if you're like my family, just eat it straight out of the bowl with a spoon!)                     For the past six months Mississippi's unemployment rate has been lower than the national average, following a trend showing the South is leading the country in job creation. The April unemployment rate in Mississippi was 4.6%, compared to the national rate of 5.4% and Mississippi's rate a year ago was 6.3%.  According to the  urlLink Mississippi Development Authority (MDA) , new facilities and expansions of existing business from January through May of 2004 in Mississippi are expected to create 4,627 new jobs. MDA said there has been 73 new facilities announced, which are expected to create an estimated 1,917 new jobs and bring in an estimated capital investment of approximately $544.16 million.  The largest new facilities unveiled were Textron Fastening Systems in Greenville (500 jobs), Faurecia in Cleveland (250 jobs), D&G Foods in Gallman (200 jobs) and Lowe's Home Improvement Warehouse in Starkville (175 jobs). The largest expansions were ATK Southern Composites Center in Iuka (300 jobs), M-TEK Mississippi Inc. in Gluckstadt (153 jobs), Cingular Wireless Customer Service Center in Ocean Springs (150 jobs) and Pioneer Aerospace Corporation in Columbus (110 jobs).                  urlLink The Mississippi Girlchoir , composed of 27 young women, are Hawaii-bound for the Pacific Rim Children's Chorus Festival in Oahu. And they're learning songs in Hawaiian, Korean, Taiwanese, Samoan, Japanese, Filipino, Tearawan (New Zealand) and Tahitian for the trip.  The choir auditioned and was accepted for the July 6-14 festival. There, three mornings on the village grounds of the Polynesian Cultural Center will introduce the young singers to ethnic dances, Polynesian musical and dance instruments, the language and chants. They will sing in two major mass choir concerts in Honolulu, and also perform their own concert repertoire. They'll rehearse under the director of Indianapolis Children's Choir conductor Henry Leck, a prolific choral music composer/arranger.  Mississippi Girlchoir is an audition-only choir. Try-outs for the 2004-2005 season will be held through the end of September for the beginner and middle choirs. The older choir will probably be filled mid-July. Tuition costs are: $200 a semester ($400 a year) for the Bel Canto; $300 a year for Jibilate and $250 a year for Apprentice, with a $50 registration fee for each. To make an appointment for an audition or more information, call 601-362-9337 or 601-981-9863.                    While watching Harry Potter at the movie for Father's Day, for some reason it hit me why I was so intrigued by a scene in the book I'm reading, The Master Butcher's Singing Club (very good, so far). A young woman finds her lover in the park with another man--she's shocked and relieved, because now she understands why he acts more like a brother than a lover. It hit me right in the middle of Harry Potter that the set-up is very similar to Blanche discovering the sexuality of her husband in Streetcar Named Desire--the beginning of the end for poor Blanche. It got me to wondering how many other stories had similar situations...if you know of any let me know. I would be interested in investigating the thread.  Harry Potter was good (a B or B-, I would say) but a bit long, especially when viewing with a four-year-old. I found myself groaning when they had to go back in time though, because I knew I would too. I don't know if it's because I just saw Mystic River at home or not, but it seemed like both hinged on the idea that changing one small thing in your life could make huge changes in other ways. In Mystic River, the philosophical ones are always wondering 'What would have happened in my life if I got in that car?' And Harry Potter's life changed for the better when they went back in time and saved the bird (whose name sounds like Hypocrite but I have no idea how to spell!). What a difference 5 minutes can make, I guess!                 Renovations have begun on the Westbrook House in  urlLink Mynelle Gardens  with hopes of making the Jackson park a larger tourist attraction.  The city will spend $311,000 to improve the interior of the historic house located at 4736 Clinton Blvd. Eventually, supporters hope wedding receptions, meetings and horticulture shows could be held inside the house.  Built in 1921, the Westbrook House has been closed to the public for more than a decade. The gardens are named after Mynelle Westbrook Haywood, who was an expert in flower arranging and gardening and lived in the home.  The city bought the house for $150,000 in 1973. Mynelle sold the property to preserve the gardens and house. The property was last occupied in the 1960s. About 6,000 people visit the park each year but have not been able to tour the house.  The house was designed by Noah Webster Overstreet and is considered a landmark. It was listed as one of the state's most endangered historic sites by the Mississippi Heritage Trust in 2000. The improvements will make the building eligible for listing on the National Registry of Historic Places, a designation which opens the door to federal grant monies.  The Mynelle Gardens Botanical Society begins a campaign this summer to raise $300,000 to complete renovations of the house. Tax-deductible gifts may be sent to P.O.
