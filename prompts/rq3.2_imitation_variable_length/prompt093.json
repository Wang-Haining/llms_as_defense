I'd say it's like 85% as good as the first one, but it's always hard to meet or beat the original.  anyway...I'm not going to ruin anything for you fuckers, so just chill.  all I'm going to say is that they talk some about how everyone needs a hero, and that you shouldn't change who you are.  you are who you are.  I really took that to heart, and yes that's lame of me, but it makes sense, and I sorta got some glimmer of hope from it.  I think I'm hanging from a single thread here, and I'm _this_ close to cutting it myself instead of letting it break.  I'm sick of just hanging here, for all to see, and mock, and laugh at.  It's BULLSHIT.  but yet again, I see a sign.  not a fucking sign from god in a religeous aspect, but in a 'haha, you fucker. take this. in your face' aspect.  prick.  Let me explain.  tonight, in my boredom (not so much boredom as pitiful me), I'm browsing the personals on yahoo, as I do every now and then, and I'm like, fuck goldsboro, this place sux.  so I go search Columbus, OH, where I used to live.  I'm moving back there when I get out of this monotonus, ass-kissing excuse we call a job.  I'm sorry, but I kiss no one's ass to move up the ladder.  I will work for my pay, and not by making my knees sore.  I prefer to earn what I reap, not skim the top.  anyway, I'm moving back to cols.  so I'm browsing, and I come across this ad.   urlLink Nicole (I hope she doesn't mind)  She is absolutely gorgeous.  And the intellect to go with.  I tried my damnedest to get in touch w/her.  Icebreaker.  searching the member directory, and finally, actually (attempting to) PAY YAHOO to email her.  Yes, I was actually going to spend $20 to send an email.  That's the level I have reached, and it's not the first time.  only THIS TIME, this is where god, murphy, and who the fuck know who else intervened and as a group got on a microphone and yelled in my face 'F U C K   Y O U,   S E T H'.  Yeah, the shit wouldn't go through, so I couldn't even send a goddamn email.  why does god hate me?  he must.  someone does, and I'm sorry for being stupid, but what did I do to piss him off?  he must be a woman, because I don't understand what I did wrong, so I don't know how to fix it or not do whatever I did.  it's fucking stupid.  this is the part where I stop giving a shit.  I don't need to spend anymore energy watching my hopes become the hindenburg.  I just can't take the ups & downs, the stress, the bullshit anymore.  i give up                       I think someone needs to slap me, and hard.  I must've watched too much tv or too many movies, or some shit because I just have this _stupid_ idea that one day - BAM! - love at first sight.   >  Wake the fuck up, Willis; not gonna happen.  Especially when you expect it to happen.  That's when Murphy's at his greatest.  Oh, I've tried NOT expecting it, but that really doesn't make sense, does it?  How can you NOT expect something, because you're always thinking about NOT expecting it...stupid ass catch-22... And then on top of it all, (hypothetically speaking here, of course) if it ever did happen, it's not going to be w/some woman who looks like Shania Twain.  Or Sophie Ellis-Bextor.  Or Sandra Bullock.  Or Jane Leeves...you get the picture.  Basically I'm screwed.  Mentally I can accept that, but even w/all this proof (history), I still have the hardest time NOT believing in it.  When I was a kid, I used to think how someday I would just live by myself, away from everyone, and how much I would enjoy the silence and peace.  Now I realize that it would SUCK, because I kinda feel like that now, even though I have a roommate, talk to people everyday, etc.  But I feel so secluded, alone.  For some reason I feel like people talk to me because they have to, to be 'considerate, or nice' to fit in w/their peers.  I just wish I could be a 'fly on the wall' when I'm not there one day and really hear/know what they say/think about me.  How pathetic is that of me...that was a rhetorical question, ass :)                          Yahoo! is experiencing temporary communication issues with the banking network. Please try placing your order later. (7)    now I fucking dare you to tell me that I am not hated by someone.  no shit, this is the 2nd time I tried to attempt actually spending money to email a woman, and this is the fucking response I get.  fuck it.  I just need to spend that energy doing something that actually yields me results (you should've seen me the second I knew she was online; you would've thought I just drank 2 pots of black coffee).  but I _need_ that; a woman who just by her looks can give me energy I never knew I had.  Life I never knew I had.  to hell with it.  to hell with it all.  I'm not bitter towards others who have achieved what I only dream of, I'm truly happy for them, I just don't want it flaunted in my face.  ...maybe I need to start drinking.  heavily.  solitude, depression & I shall be as one.  everyone else can fuck off, I don't need your fucking sympathy, so save your breath.  really.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
