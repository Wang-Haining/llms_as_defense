I guess I was just depressed&nbsp;because I know I'm going to miss Crys, and I know that I probably won't see her for a week and a half, which blows chunks. The fact that Walter went batshit on me didn't help. I got to talk to Sarah for the first time since she left for Germany today. She said she had a lot of fun on her trip and got to go to a strip club. That made me laugh, which in turn cheered me up a bit. She passed all of her exams too, which I knew she could do. The only thing still keeping me sad&nbsp;is the fact that I let Crys down. I feel like crap for breaking my promise to her. She expected me to do something and I couldn't do it. Well, I'm done hitting myself. FOR GOOD. Violence isn't the answer to anything. I realized in my thinking that it's stupid, pointless, and I'm not the only person I hurt when I do it. Everyone around me is affected, especially Crys and my mom, and when that happens, it's time to stop. It's pretty weird how I stopped hurting myself today.&nbsp;A simple image made me stop and think about what I was doing to myself. It was one of the prom pictures, and she was looking at the camera when it was taken. I broke down when I saw those eyes staring at me.&nbsp;It hit me like a ton of bricks that I hurt her more than I hurt myself when I hit things. Then I went into the bathroom and looked into my own eyes and saw how dark they were, and that scared me. I remember yesterday morning they were almost a greenish color and I was as happy as could be. But yeah, I'm done. I'm done hurting myself, and even more importantly I'm done hurting Crys. I love her, and it's about time I start proving that. What I've done is not only unethical, it's childish, not to mention self-centered. &nbsp; Well, I've stuff to do, so I'm going to go do it. I'll type again tomorrow after work.                         Despite it being under crappy circumstances, I actually did have some fun for Gram today. I kept everyone's spirits up with my accents. There was a lot of anti-gay humor, but it was all in good fun. I hung out with Scott a lot today. This was the first time we've really bonded in a while, which is cool. We've gotta do it more often. I also played horse shoes with Scott twice. First we played against John and a guy named Mark(who we nicknamed Lifetime on account of the fact that he watches women's television). We lost. The next game was against Nate and Margaret's boyfriend Casey(who by the way is a very cool guy, good pick on her part). We didn't lose by much. Scott and I also went to Wal-Mart. The funeral however wasn't so happy... I broke down when I got to the coffin again. Saying goodbye for the last time wasn't something I ever wanted to do. It was weird walking into the house later and not finding her sitting in her chair. Not having Grandma around is going to take a lot of getting used to. Crys can't call me, which pisses me off a bit, but I guess it isn't her fault. I want a day to myself with her not long after she gets back. Her and I have only had a few of those days in the nine months we've dated, and I think I want quite a few more in the future. It's weird, but I've managed better than I thought I would without her here. I feel single though, and it sucks. I want her back damnit. Oh well, about three days now. Well, I need to go to sleep, I got work at Butch's in the morning, and I may or may not be milking with Monz.  Mood: Happy for my good time I had today in her honor.
