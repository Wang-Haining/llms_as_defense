A while ago when my thoughts started to erode.    Erode away to what?   Who knows. But as long as there's something to replace the erosion, the change will never stop.   I keep fueling it. Feeding it more. Filling the void with...Who knows...What should be there?   It's been so long...   The pain from it all... Forces me to adapt.    How do any of us grow?    We adapt.    Learn from the mistakes.   Who needs teachers.    Teach yourself.   You can't be taught how to live. You have to learn that.   I'm learning.      It's a cold world.   The key is to be colder.   Heartless? Yes.   senseless? It helps.   Stupid? No. That is the one thing you can't be. Not today. Not in this world. Being stupid is what makes you fall.        Because this is dedicated to the kids Dedicated to wherever music lives Dedicated to those tired of the same ol' same And dedicated to the people advancin' the game What's real is the kids who know that something's wrong What's real is the kids who think they don't belong What's real is the kids who have nowhere to run Who are hiding in the shadows waiting for the sun              More and more things are beginning to feel unreal. The other day, I was reading the paper and all of the storys in it seemed pointless.    Maybe I just don't give a shit about anything anymore.   Maybe I never did.      I found myself with friends the other morning, talking about all my past girlfriends.   I quickly realized that almost all of them were...well...'special'.   A lot of my friends were probably jealous that I had...Someone, and they had no one. Well, I honestly think I'm a hell of a lot better on my own. All of my girlfriends have been nothing but trouble.       Someone really fucked up once said: 'Behind every great man, there is a woman.'    You know what? Fuck that.   If there is a woman, she's probably not a great one. And the great ones are gettin harder and harder to find. Or at least in my life they are. Seems like almost all the ones I know are hellbent on fucking up my life as much as possible.    Whatever.    Bitches come and go, right?      Anyways, I'm here alone this week. Everyone's out of town on some vacation with their family's.   Wish I could be out of town. At the beach. Hell, maybe even with out the family.    If only I could drive.     I'd be outta here faster than you can say 'road trip'.    As soon as I get a fucking car, I'm doing these things:     Going to visit all of my friends that I've met on xbox live.    Planning a road trip with all my friends I've met on xbox live.    Going to the outer banks and living care free for a few days. Maybe by myself, maybe with...Someone. (Right now I can't really see who that 'someone' would be...)    Driving to New York to see the site of the World Trade Center.    Driving backwards down my street. Just because I can. Well I'd probably do that one before I do any of the other ones...but...who cares.      And my car would have one of those air freshener thingys that hangs from the rear view mirror.    Maybe some fuzzy dice.    And a hood ornament.    And leather seats.    And a bunch of other cool stuff that I would actually  use . Not just have in my car so I could say that I had a 2,000,000$ Security system, that activates in case of a monkey attack in the middle of the kenyan rainforrest in the middle of the night during a leap year.    ...Because that would be really stupid.        ...Losing it so fast...               Allow me to flame my own buddies for a second. Allow me to aim my gun at my own comrades, and squeeze off a few rounds in their backs just because I can because I lag behind. It seems that eek and grimes love their websites and html. Now I can respect that. If they want to practice something that's actually going to be useful to them later on in life, I'm not gonna stop them. And I respect their html code writing skills. But they want to go beyond that for their websites. Websites that could possibly be abandoned in a year or less. Investing 200$ in hosting, and 60$ in movable type just doesn't seem reasonable to me. I mean, the website has no real purpose. It's their game site, yes, but seriously, how many hits does it get, and are there repeat visitors? No. Not really. Now I'm not complaining about them learning html code. And I'm not jealous of them for doing it. I just can't. And seriously, in tomorrows job market. Our job market, there's going to be too many Einstein's, and not enough average grunts. I for one don't mind hard work. I just don't want a desk job. No. That's not for me. Anyways. I'm just trying to make a few friends realize that they might wanna spend less time on html. And more time being kids.  Childhood only happens once. Blink, and you miss it.              Hello all of you who come here to read stuff about my life!   Everything is going well here.   Recently, I bought NFL 2k5. It's a great game. It took me from knowing nothing about football, and not caring, to loving football and knowing...some stuff.      Another game I got today was Rainbow Six 3 : Black Arrow. I wasn't so pleased with this game.   Anyways, to keep this post ending on a high note, I'll have reviews for both games sometime later.      I've been shopping a lot for my games and gear lately, and I've noticed that urlLink  Red vs Blue  has made a promo dvd to run in the demo xbox's at stores.   It's funny.  If you can ever hear it!  All of the stores have the volume turned wayy down on the xbox demos. But of course the pseww and gaycube demos are turned up more than loud enough to hear. 'Ref, I'd like to challenge that play!'    So of course they want the psew and queercube to sell. Sure folks, complain about not having jobs and all the jobs being overseas. THE PROBLEM ARE THE ONES WHO ARE COMPLAINING! BUY AMERICAN BITCHES! XBOX IS AN AMERICAN BRAND! NOT PS2! Who cares if Bill Gates is a prick, his products are great! And you're probably already using some of his stuff, no matter how much you hate him.    How can you keep the jobs in America, if no one wants anything to do with them?   And if you are a ps2, or gamecube fan, and think my politics talk is going no where, just wait a second, shits commin your way too.   Just because Xbox is newer, and has better graphics, doesn't mean that yall have to be haters.    I don't hate gamecube because it has shitty games.   I hate it because it has shitty graphics and no internal memory.    And ps2 is just old.    Don't buy something and love it when you know you can go better.    The choice is simple.    Buy an xbox. Not a ps2. Not a gamecube.   Why stand the crappy graphics, or low memory?   And if you think the xbox has bad graphics, don't blame the xbox! Blame the developers!    In the gaming business, it's all about the money. And supposedly, whoever gets their games out the fastest will make the most money. WRONG! Crappy graphics on mediocre games don't rake in the cash.    Blockbuster hits with innovative gameplay and graphics keep the money train riding along for a good long time.   Look at Halo, it's sold over 1 million copies, and people are still buying it!   Either way you look at it, when Halo 2 comes out, it will own you all.    November 9th, 2004.   Are you in?               Although school doesn't start for another month, it's all I'm thinking about right now. I'm scared to death. I don't want to start high school. I really wish I was a kid again. I don't want to grow up and have to get a job and worry about things besides having fun. I'm worrying about too much stuff. I should just relax and enjoy the rest of summer while I can.    Another thing that's on my mind is the lack of storms. We haven't had any big jizznourmous storms that knock out the power and leave the city f'd up the a for a bit. And, if there's any truth to it, a mild/calm summer means a active/cold winter... Or something like that.    I'm just now realizing that all of this time when I haven't been doing work, it's made me really lazy. I need to start going to bed at a decent time, and getting up early, and actually doing something during the day.    Speaking of doing something, I've got to go mow a lawn for some money.    I'll post more later. I'm sure I'll have something. I've got an upset mind right now. The thoughts won't stop churning and popping up.    (Upset mind=Kinda like an upset stomach. Not upset as in sad.)                [random thought/]Ok...So there's a few things on my mind right now.  Since schools out, I need something to exercise my mind with, but not too much. So I've decided to follow the 9/11 hearings. While I was sitting there watching the news, I started thinking about interrogation. (GAH! GOD DAMN IT! IT'S FUCKING IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND SOME QUIET AROUND HERE! MOTHER FUCKER! Ok, now it's quiet) What is interrogation? Basically, it's getting someone to lie, but getting them to lie for you. You want them to say what you need to hear. In essence, that's what you get them to do. Anyone who's ever found themselves in trouble at school or elsewhere knows this. But I have another point. What good does interrogation do? Nothing. How do you know how truthfully the information you're getting is? You don't. You might as well go use something like ask jeeves instead of asking osomas body guards, because either way, it's not doin one damn bit of good. I've got more to say, but it's not for this post.[/end random thought]    \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
