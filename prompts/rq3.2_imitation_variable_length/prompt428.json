I went and saw 'The Day After Tomorrow' yesterday, and was not overly impressed. Don't get me wrong, its not a bad movie. The visual effects are pretty darn outstanding, there is some nice action set pieces, a wolf attack, a Russian ship floating down a New York street (an idea which my Mum thought was hilarious) and reasonable acting all round.  The problem is it's just dull. I can't quite put my finger on why but maybe it's the simple notion that you know they aren't going to fix it all up at the end. And you sure as hell know which main stars are going to survive, so ultimatly it just comes down to watching them go through their paces.  I love end of the world movies, especially the cheesy, fun, bad ones like Independance Day, Armageddon, Deep Impact etc. They tend to be large, overly produced, CGI filled popcorn fests. Seeing two Americans destroy the massive invading alien force with a computer virus in ID4 is such a stupid, ridiculous and out there self serving ending, that you can't help but laugh. Sadly there is no such moments in Day After Tomorrow.  Really, it's not bad. it's just dull.                 I had a dream last night about a girl I used to know. Since I'm feeling in a bit of funk because of it, I figured I would share the story with you all. I'm a dork, so what?  I first met Tamara when I was working at Chicken Treat. They were opening up a new store in South Perth and her and a bunch of other people where training at our store.  First time I saw her she was wearing a white sweater and looks gorgeous. I was in year 12 at the time, but we got talking and she asked me what I was doing at Uni. I had to laugh at that, and from that moment on I was hooked.   She was always very friendly and we got on really well. She was in first year Uni, studying Bio Technology, or as she put it, 'Jurrasic Park stuff'.  Anyway, after about 2 weeks, I came into work to find that she wasn’t there. The training had finished. *Dum dum dum!!*.  Anyway, about a year later I just happened to walk into the South Perth Chicken Treat to find Tam working the counter. She remembered me and we got to talking. But again I was to be stymied!  I started going in regularly to see her, but one night I went in and she wasn’t there. Now, I was a little upset cause I'd planned on asking her out finally.  I had her address from seeing her personal file in the office once, and besides, her name is reasonably unique so it wouldn’t have been too hard to find her anyway.  In a fit of sheer confidence and audacity that had never been seen from me before or since, I drove to her house and knocked on her door. She answered, still in her uniform (She'd left early, slow night).  I smilled, said I was sorry that I had missed her and would she liked to go out sometime? She was suitably taken back, but agreed. On the drive home the adrenaline wore off and I almost fainted.  Anyway, about a week later I borrowed a friends car and we went out to dinner (Funnily enough just around the corner from where I now live). It was a nice night, I think she enjoyed herself as well. I was young and naïve and tried to make the night like something in a movie. Didn’t quite pull it off. I would do things a lot different today.  When we got back to her place, I told her I had a nice time and would she like to go out again. She said she would, but that I had to know she was seeing someone. I was gobsmacked! I left her place that night very very confused, if not a little hurt.  I decided that being her friend was better than not knowing her at all, so we started a friendship that lasted a while. We would go out to the movies, have a bite to eat, nothing major. Occasionally she came over and we'd watch a video or something.  In hindsight I know now what I liked so much about her. She always called me on my bullshit. I should also mention that I got a job as a kitchenhand at the Chicken Treat she was working at. I wasn’t stalking her I swear. I just needed the money. Working with her was just a bonus.   Once, I was waiting for her to get out of work, I was laying on the bonnet of my car with my hands behind my head in what I imagined was a Brando-esque pose. She came out and the first thing she said was something like, 'Are you trying to look cool?'. Heh, God love her.  Another time we were driving and having a mini debate about something. I said something stupid like 'You don't know anything about me'. She of course replied, 'Oh what, like you're so dark and mysterious?'. Funny thing was, that’s exactly was I was trying to give the impression of. She could always see through my crap.  She had her 21st at home, under a big tent in her backyard, and I felt quite honored to be invited. She was with another guy, but so what? I loved her anyway.  Before we sort of drifted apart, we were driving again, and I turned to her and said, 'You know, we would be really good together'. She gave me a simple 'I know', but never explained why she wouldn’t be my partner.  After that, we saw each other less and less. There's a few other stories in there that I wont bother with, but suffice to say I found her pretty amazing. If I could ever meet a girl just like her, I would be a happy guy indeed.  And that’s the end of that chapter.                 I got home from the gym last night to catch a story on Today Tonight about a fat kid (I think he was about 13) who had always been obese and picked on etc. He decided to do something about it, and has lost 56kg (almost the same amount of weight I want to lose) in 12 weeks by exercising and changing his eating habits.  His eating plan was this:  Breakfast: high fibre cereal with skim milk Lunch: 1 tub low fat yoghurt Dinner: 1 Salad sandwich Snacks: fruit  While I think its great that he decided to stop eating all the junk food, put down the playstation controller and do some exercise, I think this eating plan is ultimately detrimental to his health, and unsustainable for a long period. Hopefully now he has shed the weight he will start eating a more balanced diet. Experts agree with me that dropping that much weight in such a small time frame is very very dangerous.  While I want to see more kids bucking the obesity trend, I want them to do it safely and wouldn't encourage them to do this extreme plan.                  I was out with  urlLink Jimbo  the other night for his partner's graduation get together.  As I was perusing the drinks menu (Which I can't actually partake in because I'm DISEASED!!) I noticed that they had Absinthe on the list. When it came time to order my non-alchoholic girly drink, I mentioned to the barmaid that I've always wanted to try Absinthe (the colorful drink that make you INSANE! Seriously, it looks like Dr Herbert West's re-animation serum from the movie Re-Animator) and it's just a shame that you can't get the real, full strength stuff here in Australia, due to the Government's nanny like laws.  'Oh no!' she replied, 'This is the proper imported stuff. That's why its $13 a shot'. My eyes opened wide in delight and I was *this close* to ordering one, until I remembered, I'm DISEASED!.  But no matter. At least I know its there now and  urlLink Jimbo  and me have made plans to partake of this particular poison at some point in the nearish future. So if a post suddenly appears on here talking about green fairies and how I'm a talking Hippopotamus, just ignore it (like it would be that out of the ordinary anyway).                  I've been whinging to people around me for some time now that I have no hobbies, no projects, no 'thing' that I do. I don't mean work or even collecting DVDs (184 and counting!), but one thing that I can spend my other free time doing. Something I can get really good at.  I've been playing around with the idea of taking some photography courses and maybe setting up my own black and white darkroom. I've also been putting quite a bit of energy into thinking about getting a motorcycle. I've had my licence for about 8 years now and never ridden a bike since I got it. I've wanted to get into motorbike touring around this great land of ours, as well as learning general maintanence etc.  Now these are all great things to do, and ones I intend to persue in the future (definitely in the case of the bike, I'm about halfway there to being able to afford one), but I realized last night that I actually have a ready made project/hobby just sitting there (literally) waiting for me.  My body. No not like that you dirty birds!  I mean, with all this stuff happening with the Diabetes, and having to lose weight and eat better anyway, I figure I might as well turn it into a hobby and do it properly. I swear I'm not going to turn into one of those 'My body is a temple' kind of jerks. I'm not going to be sitting at a party expounding on how many reps I can do or how I can crush walnuts with my butt cheeks (14), but I can focus on getting better, feeling better, eating better and looking better. I think that's sounds like a pretty good project to me.  Anyone want some freshly crushed walnuts?         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
