Girls who wear hijaab n tight clothes    'Asalamu Alaikum  in my area and in many western countries you see these moslim girls wearing hijaab but tight clothing such as jeans n tight tops. once i said to this girl that she shouldnt bother wearing hijaab because it contradicts with the other clothes she is wearing and told her that if she wants to wear hijaab she should cover her WHOLE body in an appropriate way to make the hijaab worth wearing. she also flirts. i mean whats the point in wearing a headscarf if you going to show off your backside and your figure and chase guys? was i right in doing this? By the way, am I backbiting by writing this question?   jazakallah    'Re: girls who wear hijaab n tight clothes  As Salaamu Alaikoum,  Praise be to Allah.  Yes you told this girl right. The Prophet (SAW) said,   'There are two types of the people of Hell whom I have not seen yet. People with whips like the tails of cattle, with which they strike the people, and women who are clothed yet naked, walking with an enticing gait. They will not enter Paradise nor even smell its fragrance, although its fragrance may be detected from such and such a distance'  The scholars interpret   clothed yet naked   as referring to women who wear tight clothes or light clothing that does not cover what is beneath it, or short clothes.  To warn or speak out or warn against something that harms the Ummah is not backbitting.  AND ALLAH SWT KNOWS BEST'            \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
