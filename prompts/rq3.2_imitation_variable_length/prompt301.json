The long, languid days of August have coated me thickly, nearly smothering me with their weight. And now I trudge along under this burden of days, dripping with honeyed illusions. The last days of summer roll out from beneath me and tumble along like water o'er a mill. Some days pass swiftly and vigourously, laden with youthful virility and impulsion. Others slow to nearly a standstill, with naught but necessity keeping them from a halt.  Now autumn is at bay, and before or after we are ready, but always when we are not prepared, the chill winds signifying the passing of the seasons slip through the web of summer. The leaves shall die away in their glorious coats of red and gold, and our minds will turn to harvests and cider. But ere long, in our minds, the chill turns to cold and we grow tired of autumn. And then, then! we will look back on these summer days with regret and desire. For we are simple minded, and little remains in our high esteem for long.  We cannot and would not keep the wheel of change from turning. We cannot force it to spin faster, though we always try. We are caught in an endless and eternal cycle of death and re-birth, of the passing of the seasons, of change.                        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTrust is a funny thing.  So difficult to build up, so easily shattered.  And then you start to wonder if you've only built up trust because you haven't been observant enough to notice what would kill it.  But can you ever fully trust anyone but yourself?  What is trust?  Truth is a big part of it.  Does trust mean telling each other the truth, no matter what?  But brilliant minds such as Machiavelli contend that it is not always necessary, nor even good to be truthful.  If you lie to protect someone, may that shatter trust?  And what of love?  What brings you to care so much about someone that the love remains even through broken trust?  Looking at Machiavelli again, he insists that the ends justify the means.  But it takes more force to begin a motion than to continue it.  Love too can be shattered easily.  But then, what is love?  And in love, what is peace?  There is no black and white.  Only darker and lighter shades of grey.  There is no good, no evil.  It's all in the eye of the beholder.  It's a huge mishmash of grey.  The world is not our perfectly balanced black/white, male/female, yin/yang that we believe it to be, or wish it were.  But I digress; is trust a good thing?  Is it necessary?  Perhaps we ought to all live for ourselves solely, but then to quote Thomas Hobbes, 'No arts; no letters; no society; and which is worst of all, continual fear, and danger of violent death: and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short.'  Ah, perhaps we are all the cruel joke of some creator.  Current: Knitting project: none! :o Favorite color: blue so deep it's almost black Reading material: Summerland by Michael Chabon Metaphor for life right now: An author in a coffeshop, hidden in the corner, silently observing all and writing it down in detail, with a sad smile on her face.                       First off, sorry Elm, I didn't see that you had already explained the whole Ralph Nader thing.  I didn't even see Siri's comment on VW's blog.  I was just replying to Siri's comment on your entry 'Rather Bored.'  Speaking of which, Ralph Nader is a rather obstinate old bat, isn't he?  Oh, I want to see 'Farenheit 9/11' really horribly badly.  But it's rated R.  So I won't be seeing it any time soon.  Crap.  But anyway, back to the subject at hand, the Divorce of Responsibility.  Or rather, a tiny fraction of it.  Depression.  Can I argue that the only people who enjoy life are those who are completely ignorant of what goes on around them?  I could, but I will not.  But I do see that it is something of a bell curve, and that there is no point beyond ignorance in which you could be totally without depression.  Cogito Ergo Doleo.  But I'm tired of America's view on depression.  You're sad, have some pills.  The expanding range of mood-altering drugs is insane.  By offering drugs so easily, this takes control out of the realm of the person's own control and places it solely in the realm of mental illness.  There's nothing wrong with most of the 'depressed.'  America is catering to the wills of its consumers to make more money.  People don't want to be sad, so there's drugs to stop it.  There's a drug for everything now.  America's consumption-based attitude is bringing it down.  All day, America is shouting 'Consume, consume, consume!'  Feel bad?  Take a pill.  Can't 'go all night,' take a pill.  Eat to much, yeah, we'll cure that too.  How?  You guessed it, more consumption.  Drugs everywhere.  Along with ignorance comes more ignorance, such as the Twinkie Defense.  I'll probably butcher this story, but roughly and shortened, there was a man convicted of murder.  His psychiatrist testified that he killed because he was depressed, and when he was depressed he coped with his depression by consuming a lot of junk food, and being an ex-athlete, he knew it was bad for him, which made him more depressed.  Hence the Twinkie Defence.  God, I hate America.                          &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I'm kind of into dream interpretation right now.  Not like 'if you see a tree you'll have a long life.'  But when I think about my dreams, I can usually dissect them into portions, and I understand where each part came from, like if I was thinking about my friends they might appear in my dream, et cetera.  And dreams usually have an underlying feeling.  Like fear.  Nightmares usually have an underlying base in fear.  When I was younger, I used to have nightmares about being chased by a monster or a cloaked figure.  My fear was death.  It was something I (obviously) hadn't experienced.  But now I don't fear death.  In fact, the idea appeals to me sometimes.  And I don't have those dreams anymore.  I also often had a re-occuring dream in which I was with my family and there were small monsters running around.  They scared me, and I tried to escape but my family just laughed.  But in that dream, death wasn't my fear.  It was me being upset that my family wouldn't take me seriously.  So if you want to test my dream-interperating abilites, maybe you've got a story to tell me. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I haven't had a nightmare in ages.  Does that mean I'm fearless?  Not on a small scale, no.  But on a larger plane, perhaps.                       &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp For a brief moment, anarchy sounds good.  But it doesn't take long to realise what total chaos we would be thrown into.  Government is an ancient idea, and all in all a good one.  But then when you look at it, most of our governing leaders are bad.  Then there's the question of whether or not they are really bad or if it is just our perception.  Does an effective leader remain in the public's favor no matter what, or does s/he do what is the best choice for the public, even if it means falling out of favor?  It seems as if the choice of one who is pure in heart would be the latter, but if you are in the public's disfavor, they will do what they can to stop you.  By choosing the 'right thing,' you may inspire a revolt, throwing the country into political turmoil.  And then have you done what's best?  A people is only at peace if it believes its leader is doing a good job, so if you go against public opinion, might you be taking away the peace? &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp It seems as if our problem is based in that the only people that would run for government office are those not intelligent enough to realise how difficult it would be to make such decisions.  Only those that don't think through all the options are willing to make such decisions.  And then there's people like Bush, who neither make good choices nor remain in the public's favor.  Or does he?                          &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI love swimming.  I love submerging myself under water and listening to the silence, propelling myself along.  I love somersaulting, twisting, turning, just enjoying the mobility and near weightlessness of it all.  I love swimming alone.  When you have the whole dang pool to yourself.  That’s the best. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSo why don’t I swim very often?  It’s because of that blasted Bever pool.  A few years ago, my sister would take me to the nearly-deserted pool and we’d swim for a while.  I loved that.  And then they remodeled it.  Now it’s a wade-in pool with fountains and waterslides, and all the people in their tiny bikinis go there and tan in the two-inch-deep water at the shallow end.  Caged in.  What happened to the little, dirty, cracked-bottomed, pool I loved so?  Now it’s a popular place.  And I hate it.  Sure, I might go there once, maybe twice a year, but I never really enjoy it.  This is where “improvement” leads us.  It drives away what was there before.          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
