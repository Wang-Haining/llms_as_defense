HERES MY SLEEP PLAYLIST AS OF A FEW NIGHTS AGO:  > doves _ m62 song > sondre lerche _ it's over > mice parade _ two, three, fall > ellen allien _ abstract pictures > little wings _ i saw reflections > parsley sound _ yoyo > air _ alone in kyoto > innocence mission _ tomorrow on the runway > figurine _ time (his mix) > broadcast _ winter now > the delgados _ coming in from the cold > pluramon _ noise academy > jesus & mary chain _ just like honey > the arcade fire _ my heart is an apple > elbow _ grace under pressure > asobi seksu _ walk on the moon > broken social scene _ anthem for a seventeen year old girl > devics _ the end and the beginning > on! air! library! _ five > my bloody valentine _ loomer > stina nordenstam _ stations  and the final alarm clock snooz'ish song: > +/- _ no one sees you like i do  this track is going to make wake me up, let me fall back asleep for three seconds, wake my fat ass up again, lull me back to sleep for another three seconds, and repeat.                                  nice PHOTOSHOP LENS FLARE?! respect for  urlLink moving units  plummetting.   march 9th is going to be an AWESOME DAY. alongside  urlLink deerhoofs  new lp ( milk man ),  urlLink blonde redhead  recently signed to  urlLink 4ad  alongside total pothead neil halstead and have a new album entitled  misery is a butterfly . the site reads a release date of feb 23rd BUT I KNOW IM RIGHT ON THIS ONE. MARCH 9TH DAMNIT.   tracklist:  01 Elephant Woman 02 Messenger 03 Melody 04 Doll Is Mine 05 Misery Is A Butterfly 06 Falling Man 07 Anticipation 08 Maddening Cloud 09 Magic Mountain 10 Pink Love 11 Equus  if you havent heard already,  urlLink ladytron  is going to be remixing interpols  untitled . i've no idea when this is supposed to be out and im sure it wont be too good anyway.  this is largely based on arthur bakers remix of obstacle 1 which is just a series of awful cut and pasting  in cool edit or something. SUCK! at least interpol made  blue jeans  way better.  anyway due to my SCRATCHED CORNEA, my ability to update this site has been largely hindered, mostly due to any  BOLD FONTS  that definitely cause severe pain upon viewing. no. joke.                               whenever i cant find something new to like, i cycle through some of the phases of my past musical lexicon. there would be weeks on end when i'd only listen to 90's britpop ala shed seven, kula shaker, rialto etc etc. seven of the twenty eight or so days would've been solely dedicated to going through  urlLink jarvis cockers discography . on a sidenote: i reckon the only fools to have picked up pulps greatest hits disc were also the ones who went out and bought nirvana's best of. seriously if you dont already own nevermind and friends then you really need to work on not being a sack of dumbass.   my early high school days were basically all about elastica, the rentals, and of course nirvana. throw in weezer to further ruin any credibility. track back further and you have me listening to bel biv devoe and brian adams in grade 4-5. everyone is a big fat liar if they tell you they never listened to new kids on the block.   moving out of my parents house involved lots of mogwai, refused, tristeza and blonde redhead. i remember my electronic/dnb phase immediately following watching the movie groove. sprinkle on some chinese/j-pop/early 90's emo bands/the cure and you have the basic map of steve lams jingles. flash forward to now and if you're reading this, im probably listening to whatever hip/pretentious/cool bands you're listening to.   i've no idea why i bothered to articulate all of the above. i actually did find new albums to dig:   urlLink clearlake - cedars    urlLink the coral - magic & medicine    urlLink devics - stars at st. andrea.  this came out a while ago but i dont think it received the attention it should have. clearly mentioning it on here will make up for it! portishead'ish if you didnt know.  miscellaneous blabbery:  urlLink the watchers  just finished up their tour with  urlLink james chance ! RIDICULOUS. this definitely makes them hotter than the  urlLink liars  right now.   im not sure how i feel about jarvis cockers  urlLink relaxed muscle  project yet. if noel gallagher says attempts at avant garde'ness are needless, then THEY ARE NEEDLESS. either way, we need the sexy jc back, not the idiotic deranged misfits costume bullshit.                                i cant shut up about marcus schmickler aka  urlLink pluramon . all i can think about when listening to  dreams top rock  (his other albums are all over the place in terms of genre ranging from IDM (yah yah thats like saying 'emo' whatevs blahbablh) and electronica) is MY BLOODY VALENTINE!!! if  loveless  was responsible for inspiring a wazillion shoddy shoegaze bands (the more i listen to  urlLink my vitriol  the more grossed out i get? i dont know i used to love them!) then it should also be noted that at least one sweet follow-up (AKA THE ALBUM IM TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW) came out in the aftermath.     julie cruises vocals (aka the roadhouse singer from TWIN PEAKS) remind me of a cleaned up  urlLink stina nordenstam , and although not nearly as eery and threatening as belinda butcher, her vocals are just so PERFECT. meanwhile pluramon has the whole kevin shields guitar sound down pat. i am writing like a giddy schoolgirl right now.   DOWNLOAD THIS PLURAMON TRACK NOW. its totally mbv's 'touch my breath' & 'loomer' combined.   urlLink pluramon - hello shadow                                   for those of you who've absolutely no idea whats going on ever, the strokes have been appearing weekly every tuesday this month on conan. im assuming they're going to finish off with 12:51 but where was THIS END HAS NO END? gaaaah. in case you missed them you can download each performance here (whatever happened/reptilia/under control):   urlLink thestrokesfan.com   yah so i dont really see why anyone would bother reading this blog. i talk about/bash all these nyc bands despite the fact that i dont even live in the same country! there are plenty others much more firsthand and informative than my sporadic babbling but whatevs i guess. i think im going to have to find some HOOK or 'thing' that i and only i do and write about. suggestions would be awesome. t'was my birthday last week and im too old to come up with anything fresh anymore. also complete and utter laziness ad infinitum. until then, boring nyc-wannabe blog it is! eat it.  ps thanks giulia/ urlLink new york doll  for the sweet mention!  listening to: talking heads - mr jones                               firstly, new blogger layout. all comments seem to have vanished, but  urlLink giulia  you're welcome for the  urlLink film school mp3s ! everyone check them out and let me know what you think?  how the hell did i not know about the  urlLink two streaming killers videos  on their site?   urlLink hot fuss   may or may not be the only record i actually buy this year.   other records to look forward to this fall:  -debut lp from canadian assholes  urlLink death from above . its so weird seeing them mentioned in blogs alongside bigger american bands now. i remember touring with them to places like buttfuck oakville ontario playing in community center gymnasiums. now they're headlining  urlLink vice parties  in australia and touring with  urlLink the fever . awesome. download an  urlLink mp3  of this two piece bass & drum fuckfeast if you somehow havent heard of them yet.  -new  urlLink interpol!  'In addition to 'NARC' and 'Length of Love,' songs that have been recorded and are being considered for the new album include 'Not Even Jail,' 'Evil' and one that has the working title 'Rod Laver.' some geezer tennis player i dunno. is it me or did paul banks gain a few pounds?    if you're somewhat savvy with film you should enter the  urlLink interpol short film contest . i would except the only video i ever tried to put together was a movie about cyborg ninjas and our costumes included nintendo power gloves with the wires cut off. so um yah.   ALSO GO WATCH  urlLink THE ASOBI SEKSU VIDEO!!! . just scroll down a bit. sondre lerches two way monologue is on there as well but i cant stand watching him cause he looks too much like  urlLink clay aiken ? anyway the video is awesome cause it has a couch for the centerpiece and interpol sings about couches so woohoo.   urlLink franz ferdinand , alongside  urlLink the dandy warhols  and  urlLink super furry animals  are featured on a soundtrack for a  urlLink PORNO FLICK !  nine songs  directed by michael winterbottom premiered at the cannes film festival a few weeks ago. its supposed to be a love story told through the act of blowjobs and vagina licking and cumshots and etc etc. yes im sure when it comes to video everyones going to be renting it for its sentimental value and totally NOT  pulling their goalie  to it.             \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
