My birthday had fallen on election day that year and the teacher thought it would be nice to let me have all the fun and attention. After giving my speech and tallying up votes it was determined that I would be the new president of the United States.   When I got home that day my parents were beaming with conservative pride. Not only had George Sr. just been reelected, but their little girl was out spreading conservatism to the third grade. Whereas everything else in their life together was a total failure, creating staunch Republican children was a success. Everyone was so happy that they went out and had a trophy made just for me. It was a plastic Statue of Liberty that read, 'To Our #1 Republican.'   Fast forward 16 years and things are a little different. This #1 Republican is now #1 Sinner because she called the current president a 'creep' and thinks maybe, just maybe, there are bigger fish to fry than worrying about gay people getting married. A small rage burns inside me when politics are discussed among my family because their views are so out there and inconsistent with the way they live their lives. They are the numero uno hypocritos.   Just a few days ago my husband put a Kerry/Edwards bumper sticker on our car. I'm not crazy about Kerry, but I'm passionate about many of the democratic views; on all polls and surveys I fall pretty far to the left; and I do like Edwards a lot. Given our two choices, I am happy to support Kerry with a bumper sticker. However, the first time the car left our garage with the new 'A Stronger America' sign on its bumper, someone felt the need to honk and flip us off. Maybe instead of the Statue of Liberty on my trophy that day it should have been THAT guy with his middle finger.                  Late this morning my subconscious decided to entertain me once more with the sequal to the Stuck on an Island dream. This dream was a perfect example of the warm and fuzzy kinds of dreams that make me want to stay in bed just a little longer...  I'm sitting in a bar with a nameless, unidentifiable 'friend' whom I suspect is actually Scarlet Johannson (the actress in Girl With a Pearl Earring), and as we're talking over our expensive cocktails about what a dork the bartender from New York is, the scene suddenly changes: in walks Kurt Cobain (never mind that he's been dead ten years) and a Courtney Love look-alike, who is actually his new wife (she looks like Love but sweeter and not-so-skanky). Immediately, Kurt approaches me with business offer: he wants me to join Nirvana.   First, Kurt explains, I will need a 'new look,' then I can learn to play the guitar. He informs me that the public doesn't care if I'm talented, they just want someone who  looks  like a rock star. I tell him that being in a band could be difficult because I have daughter. He tells me he has one too, but he never gets to see her. Her name is Frances Bean.   I tell him I'm not into Heroin. He tells me he isn't either, it was all just a big publicity stunt.   So as we are discussing the details--how this Love look-alike is going to be my mentor and Kurt will buy me anything my heart desires--we turn to the television that's on in the bar. The screen shows an island that's beginning to shake and wiggle, and then--poof!--it disappears. It was a natural disaster first: the very first time an entire island ever sunk to the bottom of the ocean.  I woke up just after Kurt and New Wife put their arms around me. I was disappointed as I lay there in my bed, knowing Kurt is really dead, I am really not a rock star, and oceans don't swallow islands whole.                  I am publicly making a promise to myself, right here, right now, to resist the urge to take another single bite of raw, homemade cookie dough. This is the third batch I've made in a week, and I'm feeling a little sinful and bogged down by a total of 6 sticks butter, 3 cups sugar, and about 250 milk chocolate chips. The dough is waiting for me in the fridge at this very moment, but I am strong, I will not break. 'I know it's only 7:30 in the morning,' the dough says to me. 'But you know you want to eat me. It's so easy; just get a spoon and savor those crunchy chocolate chips mixed with cold whipped butter and egg yolk for breakfast. Eat me now and you're insulin levels will be spiked sky high before lunchtime. It'll be great and don't worry: when you feel like you're gonna crash, just come eat some more of me. I'll be right here waiting for you.'    It's like heroin. Yesterday I gave in to the dough's persuasive calling; in fact, other than a couple bites of cucumber salad and pasta for dinner, I didn't have anything else to eat but cookies or cookie dough. Today will be different though. Not only am I breaking things off cold turkey with the dough, I'm going to exercise as well! Because it's been a very long time since I've done anything that required energy or movement, I will probably just start with stretching. Gotta start somewhere.   This is my what? Third? Fourth post this week?  Get a life, Kala , is what you're probably thinking.  Don't you have anything better to do than change everyone's name into Hawaiian and blog about your pathetic slothy existence?  Well, the answer to that question is: no, I don't. And I bet neither do you.                  I've requested the next available Sunday morning off from work so that my friend Lakele and I (I know she wants to hit me every time I call her that ridiculous name) can go get our worship on at the Black church. I went there once before on an assignment for Sociology class and had to duck out of the service early because I needed to get home; I wasn't prepared for a three hour service! But it was a good time and I want to go back.  In my essay on the church, I wrote about how nice and accepting the congregation was. And I LOVED the choir music. Who else can belt out the same five words over and over without ever losing enthusiasm?  Jesus, I'll never forget you  can go on for a good twenty minutes, and no one gets tired of it. Everyone claps and bobs and shifts their hips to the rhythm right up until the very last 'you'  is sung. It was one of the coolest concerts I'd ever been to. You can just feel the love in the air.  In prayer, they all shout out encouraging words to the deacon:  Amen! ,  You said it! ,  That's RIGHT!  I never dreamed of doing such a thing in the conservative Baptist churches my mom took me to as a child. Services were so quiet that my own eight year old thoughts seemed to echo like tumbling lottery balls in my head. And we were forced to learn long verses of songs that felt like funeral music. Church seemed more like after school detention, something to dread and fake an illness for. At the African American churches, the services are big parties with singing, dancing, and a few quiet moments mixed in to say thanks to their heavenly host.                  Writing a blog entry at the library must feel a lot like having a private conversation in jail. There are people everywhere yet everything is completely silent, and this 14 point font might as well be screaming my words to the other patrons. The screen of this computer displays my innermost thoughts to all the people and goings on around me; meanwhile I can't see anything but the wall, leaving me totally absorbed in the fast click-clack of the keyboard that is noticeable (and probably annoying) to all. With this kind of anxiety I think I would make a terrible prisoner.   Anyway, it is good to write again. Writing is many things to me: it's my 'me' time, my escape, my one (semi) talent, and it's my way of cleaning out the millions of wandering thoughts that muddle my overactive mind on a daily basis. I hope to return permanently the South Pacific soon.   Unfortunately my time is already up and it's back to my cell where I stare at the wall all day and try to dream of clever ways of escaping. I'm counting down the days until my release. Until then...tell my two readers that I'll be coming home soon (hopefully next week).          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
