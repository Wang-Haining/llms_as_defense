Firstly, I would like to apologise to Handy for my straightforwardness and probably for giving u such a hard time. I really am giving constructive criticism but it might be too much for u too handle. Had a talk and discussion wif Jie Hong n Kin Leong abt me going too far and me being in deep trouble. I dun really mind as long as i made my mark however most of my remarkz were really misunderstood. I neva wanted to bring the club up myself but together with u all bring the club up. together. I juz wanna be a helper. to noe and understand what is going on. not being thrown ard juz to play. Tatz how we feel as players. I'm reallie sorie to put u in such a bad mood but it was neva meant to blast ani1. Not even a single person. Anger reveals the evil in evri1 and i was stupid to succumb to it. Sorie man. I'll shake hands wif ya somedae on saturdae on the nxt trg ya? As to the rez of the management,i'm sorie guyz n galz alike. I'm speaking on behalf of the rez of the guy playerz. Oh yeah, Jie Hong told me about the exhibition match and stuffz. I neva meant to ask the hall of the booth. I was asking for the hall in fc3~ Aniwae,thankz for evriting the whole management haf done for the club. I'm reallie sorie to all..  Yours Sincerely, Mohd Akil   If there's aniting u all wanna tok abt feel free to approach me on msn. I should be there moz of the tym. Thankz.                  NEWS UPDATE!!! Experimental SP squad beat RP 5-0...-=]Guys[=-    It was a babelicious day as the babes from NP,SP and RP meet at the FC5 hall in SP for combined friendlies. [Sorie..Tanni overdose...] Aniwae,back to the match report...    SP and RP met for the first time as they faced off in a friendly match. Play started out pretty fast with the SP floorballers controlling play well in the centre and defence. RP was struggling a little and it seemed that cracks could appear anytime soon. SP's first goal was a set-piece that worked very well as the positioning of the players were perfect. Adzmin got a free-hit at the corner of the RP goalpost and swung a perfect ball across the mouth of goal. The ever-present Akil ghosted in at the farpost and gave the perfect set-up to Hafiz to half-volley into goal. The crowds roared as SP begin to gain control of the game.    The next period came in fast and powerful as tackles and the pace increased. SP and RP were coping with the increasing pace pretty well as both traded early blows to both goals. However an error by the RP defence led to another goal. A ball was gifted to Jie Hong who then slipped it to Andy who slapped it into goal. GOOOOAAAAAAAAALLLLLLL!!!! The crowds cheers were so loud it could have brought the whole hall down. Then a few minutes later,Yew Jie scored from a free hit by Kin Leong from the far corner. WOOOHOOOO!!!! SONG BO!!!! wakhakahkahkhakhkha! [Heineken must have been the caused of this error in typing] However,the freshies do not want to lose out in the scoring fest as Faliq did a fancy turn around in front of goal to score a stylish goal. What arrogance yeah?    The third period came pretty smooth as RP played all their players in one line. This proved futile as their endurance began to wane. SP continued with their controlled play and scored against the run of play via Faliq who received a nice ball from the right and whacked it to GOOAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLL!!!!!!!!!!!! [this is another case of carlsberg swimming in this writer's brain....] SP was overjoyed as RP would find no way into the SP goalmouth. They conceded valiantly and we wish them gd luck in the IVP!!!

Plz give the reporter the benefit of the doubt. Thank you.]=-  These guyz had a hell of a good tym. They were eating out to celebrate their emphatic win against RP. Some decided to go Mohamed Sultan road for some beer while others suggested geylang for some fun. -=[ehz dei, please refrain from doing these stuffz ahz...]=- In the end, they ended up at Holland Road eating at KFC. -=[Nasib baik nie budakÂ² tau makan makanan yg halal. ]=- Anyway,these dudes were not as good as u think. After their kiddy meal, they went into 'hyperdrive' probably due to some hormone rage caused by some amino acids in KFC's Hot and Crispy chicken. hmm...as for the belly dancers.....FUUYOOO!!!! They were a fest! Gyrating away like some motor-powered barbie doll was a turn-on to many. Even A-che-min a.k.a manja kid was picking up the feathers that dropped from their costumes! WOOHOOOOOO! -=[Jangan matair tau sudah ehz?]=- Don't you think it was a waste? zzzzzz~ i'm gonna chill out at Mohamed Sultan with a bottle of Carlsberg now...adioz~                 Early News Update....    The 2nd period and third period was a seriously tensed affair between YJC and SP. Both were going in hard with tackles trying to get the upper hand in midfield as well as creating goals. Many goal oppurtunities were spurned well by the midfielders yet moz of them were squandered by the bungling strikers from both sides. YJC was always the one who took the early one goal lead but could not hld on to it fer long. SP's determination and spirit showed and they came roaring back each time YJC scored.  At the score of 4-3 with YJC leading, SP was desperate as the lines were reshuffled with two holding midfielders introduced to stem YJC's flow of play. The tactic worked miraculously as 2 goals were scored in quick succession. First,was a backhand shot from Gary who received a nice flank pass from the right. It caught the keeper off-guard and went into the bottom corner. FORZA SP was heard evriwhere as the stands cheered. Next,was Rizal, a solid central defender playing as a holding player,who scored a simple tap in from a slide-rule pass from a seemingly tireless Adzmin. Once again,cheers were heard. Everyone was ecstatic as SP was surprisingly in the lead! Amazingly,YJC counter-attacked well and got the lead again through another seemingly harmless defence error. YJC was a brave and courageous team. Overall,both teams did very well. Three cheers for SP n YJC! HIP HIP HOORAY!!!!!    Warning! The reporter for today is high on 'tanni'. Due to the win,he may have been celebrating at Sultan road over briyani with Carlsberg. Thousand apologies to all concerned.  Exaggeration is purely coincidental and for  amusement.
