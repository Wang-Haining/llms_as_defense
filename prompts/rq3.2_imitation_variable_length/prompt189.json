I found it easier than I expected to corral small children and get them to work in a programming type project.  Either way, they did well, better than my CompSci class faired getting these rudimentary concepts.  Oh well, all that says is that our school has many people in classes they should never go near, which should come as no surprise for anyone.  I did do one positive thing, after the event my mother was talking about the qualifications for the SDS (Software Development Systems) are and how they look for the degree I wanted to get, the real thing here is I finally know the name of it: Computer Engineering.  It's supposed to be a combination of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, in other words it deals with both the hardware and the software of a computer.  Well, that aside I returned home at about 1 and I didn't do much of anything after that, I played a game of Starcraft with Russell, after which I continued to listen to peoples and browse the intarweb.  Well, with the account of my day gone, I need to talk to you about your comments.  I know there are peoples I know reading this, I have but one request for all of you:  make comments.  Without your remarks no matter how snide, I have no real way of knowing if anyone is reading this, or if people do, who they are.  Just make sure they aren't entirely random (like the ones on yesterday's blog entry (which reminds me:  who posted those?)).  So, take that note.  Finally I have a few notes for all of you people.  I need to find something to do.  I'd hope that at least some of you would be nice enough to invite me along on some of the activities you all have.  It isn't to uncommon for me to hear about an activity I missed, for a simple reason like I wasn't online.  I know that I'm usually online, but because I'm offline doesn't always mean that I'm busy with some entertaining engagement.  Well, all of that aside, I'd like to put this song in:     Well, my day accounted and then some, I will bid you adieu, content (not happy with, though I don't expect anyone to be invite me at 10:10 PM) in the idea that I will not be doing anything.                 Well, today I finally remembered to get my VOE (Verification of Enrollment), so I got my permit and got to drive for the first time today.  For those of you who get those exemptions, I simultaneously condemn you and congratulate ya...too bad I can't get them...oh well.  Alright, I'm seeing that people are complaining about gas prices (on  urlLink MSN ) for those of you who actually are, realize that it is over $3.00 where I'd like to be (see yesterday's pics).  We're even mentioned to have the most affordable gas in the Gulf coast, which, by some freak accident, has the cheapest gas.  While guess who, that's right California had the highest.  Beyond that today was yet another boring day, complete with my pathetic thoughts, which reminds me: can anyone think of anything good (as in attractive) about me?, and wallowing in my own self pity.  Well, that's it!  Nothing else to cover, so I bid you adieu.  The place I'm going when school is out:  urlLink Strawberry Music Festival  Not sure I want certain people to see that, but it's not that bad.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
