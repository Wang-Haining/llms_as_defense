Baby Ashton spent the night then my brother and Amanda showed up for easter breakfast. They didn't even do the whole easter bunny thing with him. Which I do believe was kinda wrong! :-(  So I guess Easter went 'okay' other then the fact John is to selfish to show up for breakfast OR dinner. Why is it I'm the only one that sees the tears in my moms eyes when no one shows up for the holidays? But on the other hand I know why they don't! It's my dad's fault, instead of just enjoying the holidays - He always has to turn it in to some fucking yelling fight between someone and him. Then someone always goes home in tears, which is usually me because I'm stupid and I take everything to heart.  I just wish I had the nerve to just call John up and tell him what he did wrong but it wouldn't do me any good because I'm younger then him, which means I don't know shit in his eyes. Whatever. At least I showed up for the holidays despite the fact I couldn't eat anything.  I really really hate this no-eating-through-stress-bullshit. I want a chocolate bunny! :-(                  I've survied a whole month after surgery. Yay! :-) It just sucks I have no idea how much I've actually lost but I'll find out next week... finally.  But on the downfall - I'm starting to realize what people REALLY think of me having this surgery and to be quite honest its really hurtful. Like I choose to be THIS fat and then have to have this sort of major surgery. I didn't have it so I can be a size 6 or get the men or whatever.... I had it so I'd be healthier, why is that so hard to believe? I'm not going to actually tell someone whats in my medical file because really its none of there business but you would think if they cared just a tiny bit they'd be more supportive instead of puting me in to tears and making me feel like some huge failure.  Blah. I knew this was going to be hard but I never imagined it being THIS hard because I really did think friends would be a hell of alot more supportive then they are. I should of known better or maybe I'm just in the wrong crowd? I dunno but at this point I just don't know where I belong yet - Hopefully soon that will change.  I wish Josh or Tonya was around - They always make me see the postive side of things and I know for a fact they support me through this. I'm a lucky girl for that too.                 'Self-love is the only weight-loss aid that really works in the long run.' -Jenny CraigHmm...  That's to true. But why's it feel like I have to loss weight in order to find that self-love in myself? Ugh!  'Sometimes in your life you will go on a journey. It will be the longest journey you have ever taken. It is the journey to find yourself.' -Katherine Sharp  I just liked this one because it seems so true.  'Difficult times have helped me to understand better than before how infinitely rich and beautiful life is in every way and that so many things that one goes worrying about are of no importance whatsoever.' - Isak Denesen  With all that I've been through in the last few years of my life - That quote couldn't be any truer(if that's even a word). It's funny though... How much you can realize about the life around you during the worst times of your life. I guess my parents did well when they taught us to always look at the brighter side of things, or realize things aren't has bad has you think, or... the list can go on and on.  However, I must get to sleep now! Sweet Dreams!                  It's finally 2004!  Which is hard to believe however, I'm happy to have 2003 over and done with, way to many bad things happened last year and the worst was lossing my grandfather to cancer in July.  It's still hard to come to terms that he's gone!!  This year I've decided not to make any resolutions however, I thought I'd make a do/want list of all the things for this new year!   Loss weight - I'll be having my gastric bypass surgery soon!   Follow the doctors orders to the T!!   Take my meds everyday without some stupid ass excuess!   Go back to school and finish with my accounting degree!   Spend more time with family and friends!   Spend less time on this stupid computer!   Finish all my cross stitch projects that I have started.   That's all I can think of for now!! I do know that within the next year my whole life is going to change and I'm gonna need some time to process it all which I know I'll be able to get through because I have so much love and support behind me which means more then I can ever say.   So with all that being said -- Cheers! Hope you have a Happy, Healthly, Loving New Years!                  Ahh! It's been a frustrating few days.  I finally had the talk with Josh and to my surprise, which I sorta knew deep inside - He thinks we're only friends, that's all we've ever been, even after I sleep with him!  I can't help but to feel used though!  He knew that I was never into being friends with someone and having extra benefits.  I've told him that from the start of our friendship but I guess it's funny how guys remember what they want and forget everything else.   Anyways, now I need to decide if I want to keep being 'just friends' or just move on with my life and forget it.  I mean is the friendship that good? If it was, would he of done this to me?   But the main thing that really gets me is - When we met, I was really shy with him but he keep trying to get me out of it, which finally happened and we sleep together.  However, if he just wanted to be friends - why the hell did he work so hard?   Blah.  I'll figure it all out soon enough but for now I'm keeping my distance and if he wants to stay friends, he'll just have to prove himself.  I don't think I'm asking for to much there! :-)  However, on a good note!  I love my life right now! I'm happy with the way things are going, I'm even happier that I'm more active then I've ever been, and the best part - I'll be returning to school in the fall to finish my college degree then I'll be able to move on with my life.  And who knows where that will take me but I think good things will sooner or later come!   On another good note - One of my cute dresses in my closet FITS! It use to be so tight before surgery and now I can wear it again! Oh I'm so happy and I look cute! Hehe! :-)                  The other day I was walking in to Wal-mart and eyed a old friend of mine.  She, however, had her nose up in the air like she was queen of the day or better then me, somehow.    She didn't say Hello, nor did I.  Which is probably for the best seeing I completely don't agree with anything she's done in the last few months.  I know I have no right to judge anyone for their actions!  But I don't think you should walk away from your own child, so you can go off fucking some guy.  But anyways, after this happened I realized how lucky I am.  I have some of the most amazing friends.    Tonya - She's been there for me through my ups and downs with everything, whether its with my surgery, friends, life, or even that one special guy that makes me smile!  Josh - There's not a day that goes by that I don't think of him.  He's made me realize what a beautiful person I am, inside and out.  He's made me learn to trust again, even when I didn't want to.  And I honestly think he's the only person I know that can get me to smile or giggle, even on my worst days.  I just hope that I make him as happy has he's made me over the last year of knowing each other.  With all these things and so many more, is the reason I adore him, cherish our friendship so much, and love him so dearly.  Tracy - My online dad!  He's stood by me, believed in me, supported me, and so many more things that I couldn't even begin to list.  I love him with all my heart!   Heather, Billy, Jill, Darren - There all amazing people in different ways and no matter what I know they'd be there for me - Just as I would for them! :-)  Friends like this are so hard to come by and the fact there in my life, is what makes me so darn lucky!                 My 20 year old, size 0, perfect body cousin is graduating from college next weekend. This just makes me realize how fucked up and screwed up my family is and sadly my mom finally sees it. However, my dad is to stubborn to open his eyes and realize how badly he's messed us up, then again I'm not even sure stubborn is a good word to put there.  It's really hard to go from having everything you wanted or needed, then one day someone robs your home while your whole family is sleeping. It ruins your trust in people - Forever. Instead of being wiser about what happened, my father packed what was left of our lives and moved us an hour away from our family and friends. After this all he did was work - We rarely saw him and when we did he was probably pissed off and yelling or sleeping on the couch.  Of course, life never got better but we were living in a beautiful neighborhood. But what did that matter? 3 years later his business went down the drain due to....   1 ~ Driving an hour an half to work. 2 ~ Stopped listening to my mom when it came to business. 3 ~ LIED, LIED, and LIED.  By the time, my mom figured out how bad business was - it was to late for her to even try to save it. A year later we were living in Tennesse with no house, no water, no electric - Nothing but everything we owned in rubbermaid tubs. What a fucking joke that was, no wonder all of us are messed up. Dad had this screwed up idea that if he built the barn first - Business would come pouring in and sadly that's never happened because he lies, he makes up stories, he doesn't listen, and he never finishs what he starts unless its something he wants.  It's been 11 years since we moved here and still so many promises that were never keep and never will be. They're still living in the apartment that was built for us to live in until the house magically got built and yet I don't even think he cares if it does or doesn't but really at this point - what the hell is the difference?   I know its not right to blame your parents for your fucked up life.... but hell who's fault is it in this mess? who dragged us away from our lives so many times? who promised us stuff and never allowed it to happen? It wasn't my mother because she always tried to make the best for us despite what was happening and now it's like she doesn't even try or care anymore.  I can go on and on with this subject and I'm not really sure what brought it all to the surface. I guess the fact I'll be in Michigan in less then a month - seeing all my family, which I don't even want to see due to realizing how screwed up we look to them.   It's like I've been able to sit back and watch what was going on and I've just been to blind to see it until now. I just wish I had the nerve to sit down with my brothers and see what they say about this topic because even there messed up. Brian's been in trouble with drugs, John's a drunk, and then there's me that turned to food and became really fat. Ugh. Apparently, we all have our choice of drugs.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
