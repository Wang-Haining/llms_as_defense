Over 4,000 words written and 20 posts later(not to mention one loyal fan, *cheers for Ryo* thanks Ryo, you kept me blogging) we are finally here. Today was a good day, I got to play B-ball with Benny. He is supposed to come over tomorrow, but I found out I'm going to a theme park with one of my friends. I'm going with my friend Chris, he's pretty cool and he used to be my favorite friend until Benny moved in at Easter time. I feel really bad changing my best friends, but Chris isn't gay and Benny might be. It makes you wonder 'How do you know Chris isn't gay?' Well I guess he is the first guy I tried to be with. It didn't work out to well, and for some reason Chris doesn't think I'm gay witch is supprising since I tried to screw him a few years ago. He just pushed me away and thought I was joking I guess. I've got all the Gravitation finally downloaded, now all I have to do is watch it all. Shuichi is my favorite, he is the best looking. Yuki is also pretty hot. I've got another good yaoi website. Its  urlLink YaoiHell , and its full of good yummy yaoi. Well I better get to bed so I'm not tired tomorrow. TTYL              Technically since I started writing this at 12:29 am it is day three. Well I am bored on the internet, but I don't want to go to bed. Lets talk about more of my personal life, shall we. Well there is this girl that is obsessed with me. She is really annoying, her name is Kym. I just wish she would give up, obviously she not my type. At one time I did go out with girls but that ended this year when it all got to complicated. Blah. I am getting really nervous, this parade Saturday will have 20,000 people and I have a trumpet solo. Its also localy televised. I might just pass out before I get to the judges stand then I don't have to play. So far our marching band is undefeated, but then again we only marched two parades. We have a really small band with like less than 40 people. We have no color guard, to bad. I hate being a virgin, it makes life very boring. At the moment there is only one person I want to lose my virginity to and that is Ryan. Ah you basterd why do you have to be some god damn stubborn. Thanx for the comments Amanda, at least I know someone has read my posts. Well that's all for now. TTYL            Ok real quick news then I’ll get to the story. I went to graduation today, Ryan was looking uber hot in his white button up tee shirt with the collar up. But other than that grad. was really boring. My lips really started to hurt after playing the songs over and over again. Then I went to a graduation party for my distant cousin. I met my other distant cousin Tony. He went to the same college I want to go to, Berklee in Boston. It’s a music college, sounds like lots of fun. Then I went to the carnival with my three cousins. I had more fun then I thought I would. I am really tired right now, and I even drank a Redbull. It’s not working though! Ok back to the story.  At first, Goku and Hakkai are facing away from each other in bed. But goku’s stomach mumbles and he flips over. He stairs at Hakkai’s back for a little while thinking of the last time he had pleasure. It was with a boy, about the age of fourteen. Goku thought of it so much he got hard and accidentally poked Hakkai in the back. Hakkai feels the poke and immediately turns over. “ Goku did you just poke me or am I feeling things?” Goku blushes a little “I think your just feeling things” He turns his head still blushing. Hakkai looks at Goku, and Goku looks back at him. Hakkia now starts to blush as he puts his arms around Goku. Hakkai looks down at Goku’s moist lips. Goku closes his eyes and they lock together. Goku moans a little as Hakkai starts to move his hands across Goku’s body. Hakkai then starts to kiss Goku on his neck and goes down the to the middle of his. He then moves his way back up to Goku’s lips. Goku feels the pleasure surging threw his body and he moans again. Hakkai starts to go down to Goku’s neck, but Goku stops him and pulls him back to his lips. Goku starts moving his hands around Hakkai’s body and Hakkai gets goosebumps and shivers a little. Goku then starts to kiss Hakkai on his stomach. Hakkai moans a little “Oh Goku”.  - To be continued in part 3  Leave a comment someone please, I haven’t had a comment in decades. TTYL             I think I'm in love once again. But this time its over the net. Its one of my co workers at dbgt.com. His name is Ashton and the picture I saw of him was pretty hot. But his looks are not the thing that attrack me to him. I just love talking with him, and I feel happy when I'm talking to him. There's only one problem, he lives on the other side of the country. And most likely hes not even gay. Oh yeah, he's also 2 years older than me. The wierd thing is I don't like older guys but for some reason I'm attracted to him.   I'm gonna order the Neon Genesis Evangelion platium edition this week. Its gonna be awesome, especiall since I should get one of the first printings whish comes with a special slip cover.  It looks as though I'm gonna be workin at a new site, thanks to Ashton. It's gonna be located at Anime-Eden.com. I dont know exactly when were gonna put it up, but it should be a pretty cool site. I designed all of the banners, and they actually look good.   Now that school has started here there is nothing to do. Benny has stoped comming which is a good thing. I dont have to worry about hitting on him. I think I sorta scared him when I put my hand on his thigh. :D  Well I should probably get some sleep, see as I stayed up until 11am this morning. I hope that everything will work itself out and I'll finaly be happy. TTYL             Aaahhhh, Kym called me today. I forgot to tell you that I have told her most of the stuff I have wrote so far. Well anyway, she asked me what my reaction would be if she wrote me a letter that said 'I love Ryan' all over it. I told her I would shoot her. I was being sarcastic, obviously. I think she is just trying to get back at me for being gay. I hate her guts, I should have never told her anything.    I have told two people ever, Kym and a girl named Beth. Beth was the reason I stopped dating girls. I hated kissing girls and I knew that if I went out with her I would have to kiss her. Well we got really close, and then my friend Mike showed up in the middle. I was in love with him at the time. At this time I told Beth I was gay, and she decided that sense she couldn't have me she would go out with Mike. She got really close to kissing him but stopped for my sake. She also told Mike I was gay, and Mike told a lot of people. Now I had to deny everything I told her. I also was forced to go out with her to keep her away from Mike. It didn't work out to well, three days after we started going out she cheated on me with Mike. We then broke up the following day.    After that Kym thought that she would try to go out with me. I then told her that I was gay and that I was in love with Ryan. Even though I told her she still wont get over me. Well since she told me that she likes Ryan today, I think I will ignore her. That will make her real mad.   Other than that there isn't that much going on. I helped my dad build a Horseshoe game pit...thing...whatever you call it. It started to rain and I got soaked and really muddy. I don't even like horseshoes, so why are we building it? I guess so we can spend more quality time together, it sounds like so much fun. I found out what it's called. It's a backyard horseshoe court, oh boy it sounds fancy. I have my last final tomorrow, I am very happy. It's earth science which is my best subject. It's also a three hour long test which really blows. Well that's all for now. TTYL             Benny is supposed to come over tomorrow, which makes me made because I'm not sure if I should kiss him or not. Whatever happens, happens. Fate is really starting to piss me off and I think I'm gonna give it the slip and control my own life from now on.  I was gonna respond to what you said Joshua, but I figured I don't need any enemies. I really didn't want you to take what I said the wrong way. Your right, we are different, I just ment that we have a few things in common: yaoi, love problems, and a blog were we express our problems. Sorry that I offended you and I promise I won't ever say another thing about you in my blog.  I got Saiyuki Vol. 3 in the mail today. I guess I should change my fanfic because it really doesn't fit that well with the story. It was a good vol. but it wasn't as good as the others in my opinion. It wasn't as funny as the rest, but I like the storyline better this time. Well, wish me luck tomorrow and just hope that I do the right thing, whatever that might be. TTYl            I downloaded the first two episodes of gravitation today. I only had time to watch the first one. It was great, I really like the end. For those who have seen it, you know what I mean. Yuki and Shuichi kiss and its so beautiful. *cries* Oh yeah, I'm finally in NC. Its really hot here, but that's ok because I'm inside at the computer all day. I have a cable modem here, so I download as much anime as possible.   I'm really starting to miss Ryan, even though its been less than a week since I've seen him. I missed him so much I changed my profile picture to Shinji to remind me of him. I think I will write up a yaoi story involving me and him. Then I will get someone to draw it and I will have my own manga. Ryan didn't get on the net at all today. Hopefully he will be on tomorrow so I can talk to him for the first time since I confessed my love for him.   Today I went swimming, but it didn't cool me down much because the water was really warm. But I had fun never the less. I also rented some DVD's; one is scary movie 3. It was very funny, I give it a 7 out of 10. Oh god what's wrong with me, now I'm reviewing movies on my blog. I also rented a game for PS2, I got 13. I'm on the third level now, and the game is really fun. Oh crap, now I'm reviewing games, what's next food.   I think I going to go D/L some more gravitation, so I will TTYL.    \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
