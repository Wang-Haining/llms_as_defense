I worked a lot and that's been about it, I have secured about £110 for doing up my room and that's going to commence on Friday when my cold blue room turns to a dark red lair with  urlLink bats on the wall . I shall be envied!  Well I still have little time to write here, just a few notes; I am still off finding myself a girlfriend, it’s all too much hassle really at the moment and I am still addicted to the deadly concoction of concentrated fruit drinks warmed to lava-like temperatures. But in all the mayhem, I did have the following thought;  Squirrels. So the grey variety are rather detested but they do have a few trials in their life as I noted this morning that manufactures of bird feeders often make squirrel proof accessories, most commonly 'THE DOME'.  [see this link  urlLink http://www.duncraft.com/prodimg/1092_200.jpg ]  Anyway, little squirrel comes along, asses the situation - can't get at it from anyway than via the top so he climbs a tree, gets on the dome and thwump, he's fallen to the ground and he can't stand on it. Now we must think how they test them, they probably have a garden where they trial the new bird feeders, now think of the poor resident squirrel, each month or so a new feeder comes along, and each time he has no such luck, that squirrel is going to be getting mighty paranoid, he's probably scared of picking up little berries in fear that there is a grand piano suspended above it ready to be dropped on him. Maybe not. Well it looks like I am ranting which means something is bothering me deep down.  Ah well, another long post will arrive on Thursday and then every day after that if your good boys and girls.            My shirt is signed and I have had more hugs than a bear, yes - today was the end of high school. Except I have to go in tomorrow. Then next Monday, and Tuesday... Well it was the last  official  day. According to my shirt I'm God and I have enough 'good luck's to repel a lot of those cursing chain mails.  So I have spent over 12 years of my life in education now, taken from society and not given anything back. A pleasing thought that. Last night I found myself watching Question Time from St Andrews featuring some 20 something who I announce to be very irritating. On the issue of  urlLink a 14 year old becoming pregnant and having an abortion without the mother's knowledge  she said that it showed that the government's health and education departments have failed. Now I am not a great supporter of the current British government isn't this a little extreme? It's like saying that because one crime occurred, the police have failed. This same woman had this annoying habit of calling 'here here' to anything anti-government - I dare say that if it was announced that Tony Blair 'smells' she would have called 'here here' to that as well.  On a more personal note I finally asked someone to the prom and she said yes. Now I need to find my self a tux and everything else that goes with it... She's worth it though!

Site:  urlLink http://www.faultline.co.uk             This was going to be quite a bleak posting but the events of the last five minutes have managed to cheer me to a level above that. Most notably is my newly found cruel hobby of engaging arguments with argumentative people who don't have a chance of winning the said argument. It's cruel I know but secretly fun.  I had another dream which I can recall again, I don't know whether it is the fact that I am recording them that helps me remember them or what but here is last nights; I found myself in a shop with my father, the shop sells a variety of 1930s toys, especially models of cars, boats and trains, the shelves are dusty and the shop keeper wears old clothes and looks tired, I don't know why we went in there but when we come out again we have bought the shop. The next day I start work in the shop and decide that it needs to be cleaned and that way it can become successful, I start my attempts at cleaning it but I get tired and put on an old jumper and over the coming days I find myself transforming in to the old shop keeper. Well in other news I bought myself a replacement copy of Dracula [Bram Stoker] as I had lost my original copy, £1.50 - a bit of a bargain really. I have decided to re-read it as well, beats revision...  Music: The Rolling Stones - Sympathy for the Devil Mood: Aloof Site:  urlLink http://www.bbc.co.uk/.../...             Yesterday I neglected to mention that I had a letter from my  urlLink Careers advisor  the letter consisted of some 20 pages of the following; Notes of what I said [just encase I forgot what subjects I am taking at A Level] and careers that match my preferences, some of my favorites include 'Virtual Reality' and 'Science Fiction'. I'm guessing the former is where you have an imaginary job and the latter is where you pretend you work on a space ship. Maybe not.  Also I seem to be under constant attack from beetles looking rather similar to  urlLink May Beetles . While these pose no threat to my existence, I still feel it my duty to dispatch them, except I can't bare to kill the things so the result is a twenty minute chase in order to corner the thing and then send it out through the window and hope that it managed to survive the fall. I worry too much.  Anyway, I better do some  more  revision. It's all good.

I'm not really too worried which in itself worries me. My current movie recommendation is for Van Helsing. It's not really a great film, its alright but Richard Roxburgh is in it who is rather special in his own little way.  In other news I discovered that 'painting' your nails with permanent marker is  not  a good idea - I thought it was yesterday while idly colouring them in blue, now 24 hours on I have been able to get most of it off except the bits around the edges which prove to be the most annoying.  Finally my father managed to get a small bargain from Aldi yesterday, a Pocket PC, or a 'Multimedia Pocket PC PDA with GPS Navigation' to be precise. But like all things from Aldi which seem to good to be true, this little technological master piece isn't all that it could be. Think of it like this; just because it is a fraction of the size of a standard PC, doesn't mean you'll have a fraction of the problems - quite the opposite. Still it has Solitaire on it so I'm not too bothered plus I have managed to fix number of these problems.  Oh and at the bottom there is a link to do a practice theory exam; 26/35 means I failed!  Music: The Smiths - Panic Mood: Fairly good Site:  urlLink http://www.dsa.gov.uk/mockpaper/theoryintro.htm              One more day of High School left; I won't be sad, quite happy that it is finally the end, High School was never my thing. Today I had my German speaking exam it didn't go too bad apart from the following mistakes I made;   &#8729; I eat pizza for breakfast.  &#8729; I don't go swimming in the swimming pool; I go swimming in the river Rhine.  &#8729; My father is dead. [He isn't]  In a bitter irony though I have since been told that my  grand father has two months to live: On Monday he was admitted to hospital, on Tuesday he was diagnosed with cancer, on Wednesday they operated and now it is Thursday and he has two months to live.  It's a common question, but what does one do if they are told they have two months to live? I don't really know, but surely if we do  live  then there is nothing to be done, just to carry on with our lives until something does happen? For example by going around the world on holiday, aren't we saying that we haven't lived and now we are trying to get something back that we lost? Could it not also be said that we are giving up - admitting that we're beaten, a doctors judgment our death sentence?  Music: Aerosmith - Jaded Mood: Shocked Site:  urlLink http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/             Today was  the  definitive typical day. I mean there was nothing unusual, nothing to cause any emotion in me. Subsequently I am feeling quite tired for having had such an uninspiring day. Tomorrow I have my German oral exam, after calling my examiner a dragon last week (and yes, she did hear me) I am not entirely looking forward to it. On hindsight I think she not really like a dragon - more like  urlLink The Watcher  from Lord of the Rings [I'm not a big Tolkien fan, just someone bought me the game at Christmas which I felt obliged to play].  In other news a small ray of sunshine hit my inbox this morning with news that Ross Noble has returned from Australia to unveil his new show 'Noodlemeister'. Which is a good thing but it now makes my t-shirt for the 'Unrealtime' tour look somewhat dated. If anyone does want that t-shirt they can buy it off the site at the bottom as well as find listings for the new tour.
