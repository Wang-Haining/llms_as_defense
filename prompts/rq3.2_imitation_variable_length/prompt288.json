First, i remembered that i went to a grad party today, and i knew three people there, and they were my uncles. It was bad. Second, i rememberd that potvin got married today. Maybe he'll soften up a bit... and stop beating me... I accidentaly thought--that he was sleeping right now... HMGH! ok, new thought... Now at home, and after the party, which was disapointing, due to my performance. The party itself was great. But, i did realize a few more things.  First, in the course of the 'courting' of the opposite sex, there are two ways to go about it. For example, take me and one of my friends. We are quite similair, i would like to think... after all, we do have many of the same interests and mannerisms... heck, we're only four days apart from each other in age... but the way we think about girls could not be more different. I belive that when thinking about his 'relationshipal' life, no more thought has gone through his head than 'oh, she's hot.' Then, magically, he has started to go out with some of those girls.  With me, it is completely different. I have the trait of overanalyticalness. It is terrible. I have looked over and analyzed my situation twice as much as the pentagon looked over the plans for WWII. I have thought about it so much, that probably most of my life since Febuary 3rd, the year i was in 4th grade, has been spent thinking about it. About every instant, waking or sleeping. What is bad, is that there is little difference in quality of the two methods. Actually, i would say that the first way is a little better. That sucks. Another thing is that there is a breaking point to 'bust a move'. A deadline. If you step over it, there's very little chance that anything will ever amount. That sucks, too. I love you all. Goodnight. I shall go and wallow in a puddle of my own self-pity now.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
