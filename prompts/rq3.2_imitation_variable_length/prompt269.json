The burning emotion that fuels a passionate romance or the devistating monster which destroys a home, the horrid pain that shoots through your genitalia from a sexually transmitted desease, the relief of satisfying an addiction for a long awaited smoking agent and the necessary ingredient with which to keep the body at a liveable temperature or to make food edible.  The natural chemical reaction which makes life possible.   One fourth of the elements which represent all natural activity.  It runs your car, your house, a factory, the planet earth.  It explodes from the earths core as the most powerful energy known to humankind.  It mutates the body and inflicts great pain.  It is an insturment of torture used to control and punish.  It is encountered by people everyday.  Children are protected from it and taught it's dangers and it's benifits.  It is a horrible demon that extinguishes life and simultaneously provides nourishment for life to be possible.  It can be enormous or portable, beautiful and hideous.  It is an emotion, a sensation, an action, a noun, a descriptive, an insturment, a revelation and a dread.  Battles have been fought with it, wars have been weakened by it and patnerships started with it.  It provides employment and serves as entertainment.  Some have a compulsion to let it breathe and stare into it's emmensely captivating aura.  Some must inflict it's path of destruction on others and some need it as a necesary stimulant to themselves for sexual gratification.  It is orange. blue, violet, black, red, green and can grow at alarming speeds.  Some spend their entire lives dedicated to studying it's behavior.  It can be tracked from point of origin and it's entire life mapped out, course by course, until a biography is constructed.  It is reinacted, simulated and examined for clarity.  It can die as soon as it is birthed.  It's remains can provide evidence for the incarceration or legal ramifications of an individual in a case.  It is an infinitesimal force which will, most likely, live long after every human being has perished.  It is a symbol of divine worship and can serve as proof that no higher being exists.  We cannot live without it.  It is the universe.                                                                                     -BEAVIS                 jules what does marcellus wallace look like?  brett good golly miss molly  jules what country are you from?  brett good golly miss molly  jules 'good golly miss molly' ain't no country I ever heard of.

Blessed is he who massages the midgets through the valley of ice cream for he is truly his brothers bee-keeper and the finder of lost waldo...  And I shall strike down upon thee with great time- management and furious personal-planning those who attempt to use puns and personify my campaigns and you will KNOW my name is teddy ruxpin when I lay my delicacies upon thee!!             Rectumali is a game that inmates play during longs bids in prison, usually for murder, robbery or drug posession.  Contraband, such as a baggie of heroin is injested by an inmate and passed, cleaned and reinserted into another inmate.  That is how the 'ball is passed.'  Teams are divided on each side of the living quarters.  The baggie must pass through every one on the tier.  Referees are designated to watch the insertion of every bag when it is placed into an oriface and again when it comes out to ensure no one is cheating.  The time limit for each team is half a day for each player.  Whatever means necessary to move the object as quickly as possible through one person to the next is permitted, so long as the judge agrees it actually went through.  If a person on your side of the tier refuses to play it will count against you.  The next cell will not be able to pass the ball until the refusing prisoner passes the contraband through their intestines.  One can see what interesting dramatic circumstances will insue if refusal is abundant.  The main rule is: 'Pass the ball. Don't get caught.'.  If a guard or member of the prison faculty becomes aware of the game you are automatically disqualified.  All paid guards must be registered with the judges before the game commences.  Winner gets an extra serving of Jello.    \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
