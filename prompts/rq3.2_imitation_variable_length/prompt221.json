Harry Potter and the Prizoner of Azkaban   I want to start by saying that this is my favorite book in the series, so far.  After two essentially similar episodes, part three offers a really interesting adventure in which the main villain,  never shows up !  In this book, the details are so carefully laid out that the reader begins to feel that the series may be much more sophisticated then originally thought.  Needless to say I was  very  excited about this movie coming out.  It was good.  I liked it.  I was dissapointed by it, as I'm sure all die-hard Harry Potter fans will be.  The intimate details that J.K. Rowling is so good at are generally glaized over to the point that I wonder if I had not read the book, would I have understood everything that happened.  In the movie, we never really learn who Mooney, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs are.  I believe this is a terribly important detail to the course of the story.  Perhaps an extremely intuitive brain could put it together with the tiny shards of imformation allowed into the screenplay, however the person I went with had not read the book and didn't really understand what that was all about.  My rave through, is for the cinematogrpahy. The pictures in this movie were absolutely stunning.  I could just watch without the sound and be very content.  The new director was very successful in his craft with this story.  The other new additions to the cast were also quite wonderful, specifically Gary Oldman as Sirius Black.    Yes, I think you should go see this movie, just know it's quite seperate from the book.  And if you haven't read the book, shame on you.   The Tony Awards   Definately the most exciting Tony Awards in several years.  Highlights for me were:  Phylicia Rashad (Best Actress in a Play), Idina Menzel (Best Actress in a Musical),  Assassins  (Best Musical Revival), and  Avenue Q  (Best Musical).  It's phenominal to me to see a show like  Avenue Q  (it's a puppet show - think Sesame Street meets South Park) beat a very traditional Broadway show like  Wicked .  Overall, the awards were widespread with Assassins taking home the most at 5.  If you'oll remember,just a few years ago  The Producers  took every single category that a new musical could, and it was a rather boring event.  (And ticket sales have not been so great for that show since it's stars departed, so it makes you wonder how good the other elements actually are, or if it was other factors that led to its sweep. Remember  Full Monty  was the show most overlooked that year.)  Alright, well, I guess it's time to get on with my day.  I'm kind of waiting to see what shows post their closing notices today... I have a bad feeling about  Fiddler...  (sorry, Haviland!)            Wow.    First off, I got a letter from Justin from Iraq.  I can't even describe how great that makes me feel.  We used to talk on the phone at least once a week and then crap happened and we didn't speak to each other for over a year.  Now it's a quick game of catch-up.  I miss him alot.  One of the few people that understood all about me.  it's funny that while I was in college, my close friends tried to discourage my friendship with him, just because...  and I didn't really stay in touch with any of them.  I'm glad I didn't listen to them, only to my heart.    Second, I have an interview for a driecting gig at one of the local high schools. yay!  Almost total artistic reign...    Third, I GOT A JOB AT THE FULTON!!!!!  A production of  The Secret Garden , making some good money and getting equity points! whoo hoo!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Lastly,  Zelda  is going really really well.  I'm in a time crunch learning lyrics and lines but the choreography is done and now it's just a matter of memorization.  I also have a flapper dress to make!            Tonight I saw Stephen Sondheim's  Assassins .  It was amazing.  Two things really struck me as extemely moving and unbelievably well thought-out.  The first is the use of a projector image of JFK's assassisnation onto the white t-shirt of the Lee Harvey Oswald character, just after he is convinced by John Wilkes Booth to kill the president for all the attention and notariety he could ever dream of.  The second is the idea that all these people did what they did for the love of another human being.  John Wilkes Booth shot Abraham Lincoln for the love and adoration he wasn't getting as an actor.  Squeaky Fromme attempted to assassinate Gerald Ford for the love of Charles Manson. (Isn't that messed up?!)  John Hinckley attempted to assassinate President Reagan to show Jodie  Foster how much he loved her.  In the play, Oswald finally decides to kill JFK in order to win the love of friends and family, instead of committing suicide.  Love is a very powerful thing, not ever to be taken lightly.  It makes people crazy in every possible way.              Man, Talon's most recent weblog post and Geoff's response to it have really put me in a funk.  It generally talks about women's behavior in regard to relationships.  I can't help wondering if what's going on between Geoff and I instigated any part of that post.  The thing is that we (women) can't make adjustments, can't fix things unless men express to us through words (not telekinesis) that something is bothering them.  I know that I've always been willing to listen to anything a guy I'm dating has had to say, but the problem comes up when he won't say anything.  I can't help feeling that if Geoff had been honest with me about this last situation, instead of just assuming I could figure out what was wrong even though he wasn't telling me, I would've been able to better deal with it.  Instead, for two weeks I was left guessing and trying to put the pieces together.  It was rough, at one point I worried that he was dead.  It drove me absolutely insane.  The good news is that I'm recovering.  The bad news is that the only way I know to recover is to become cold and distant - two of the biggest complaints about women.  What to you want me to do?  Wallow in my sadness and grief until I die?  Forget it.  Yes, I'm sad and hurt, but I can't continue to waste entire days wishing that I could fix things.    So to answer Talon's question:  I can't speak for all women.  However, what I want is someone who likes me, who is willing to grow with me through the good and the  bad , because there will be bad.  Someone who understands that relationships are never stagnant, but ever changing and is willing to let go and ride the waves. Someone who can teach me things and wants to learn from me also.  Most importantly, I want someone who will let me try to make them happy.  Men have walls too.  So when I find one who will let those walls down, I'll know I've done well...    I've never been one to group all men into a category.  I've known too many, I guess.  I've met a few men that I could be willing to spend my life with.  But the thing is, it's such a careful balance to find that perfecct relationship.              I've been going through a lot of 'stuff' in the process of packing.  I have found many things I'd forgotten about along the way.  One is a notebook I used to carry with me everywhere.  It has everything in it:  Phone numbers, love letters, audition information, cartoons, random thoughts.  I've had this notebook pretty much since I moved to New York, so you can imagine the stuff that's in it.  I decided not to toss it.   Another thing I found is a song that was written for me.  I'd like to share it with the world, as it comes from the absolute happiest part of my life.  A man I once loved wrote this:   I'm starting from scratch I feel so brand new And I've never been happier than when I'm with you. I stare at you silent, deep in your eyes And I know you see the me I lost in all of my lies  I could walk with you forever Each second I see something new And I'd be the happiest man in the world If I could stay right here with you.  A kiss on each corner, a walk around noon Each moment is beautiful because of you My hands are so rough, tongue ties everywhere But with one look from you I could dance in the air  I wonder just what you see When you look into my eyes 'Cause I've spent the past years convincing myself There's nothing in me but goodbyes  But now I'm with you and I hope that you'll stay To laugh with me, cry with me, share every day So, I'll hold you close and whisper in your ear: That when I breathe you in it's magic, my dear.  I could walk with you forever Each second I see something new And I'd be the happiest man in the world If I could stay right here with you.   To the composer:  Thank you for everything.  And, thank you for still being in my life, these years later...             Last dress rehearsal tonight.  Technically tomorrow is still a rehearsal, but we'll have an audience, so I'm not counting it as a rehearsal.  Things that went wrong tonight:  Janna forgot to yell from off-stage, forcing me and Joel to have to kiss until  someone  covered for her, I forgot to put on the engagement ring for the scene in which I'm supposed to give it back and then Joel is supposed to throw it at me, I went to pull a petal off the flowers and the whole flower came off the stem.   Not too bad overall.  Something's bugging Joel and it's getting to him on stage, mostly in a good way, it's empowering his performance.  Today was the first day I didn't totally dislike the guy.  It's a weird thing to not like the person you're playing opposite of.  Especially, when the characters are supposed to be as in love as Zelda and Fitz were.  Maybe if we'd had a longer rehearsal process together things would be different.  Instead, we're just getting to know one another, and we lost time getting off to a rocky start.  Anyhow, if he doesn't go to the city for the day, we are going to try to get together for dinner.  Might be nice to spend some quality one-on-one time...  Speaking of which, Meagan and I  need  some alcoholically enhanced gossiping time sometime this weekend.  I wonder when/where the cast party will be...             Momma, do you see what I see? On your knees and pray for me Mathilde's come back to me Charley, don't want another beer Tonight I'm gonna drink my tears Mathilde's come back to me Go ask the maid if she heard what I said Tell her to change the sheets on the bed Mathilde's come back to me Fellas, don't leave me tonight Tonight I'm going back to fight Wretched Mathilde's in sight My heart, my heart, stop beating so Just make as if you didn't know That Mathilde's come back to me My heart, I don't want you to say She's lovelier than when she went away Mathilde, whols come back to me My heart, stop being overjoyed Remember you were once destroyed By Mathilde, who's come back to me Fellas, please don't go away Tell me that I mustn't stay Mathilde's coming back today My hands, you'll start to shake again When you remember all the pain Mathilde's come back to me You'll want to beat her black and blue But don't do it, I beg of you Mathilde's come back to me My hands, remember all the years Remember when you caught my tears Mathilde's come back to me My hands, you'll want to touch her now But please try and be strong somehow Mathilde's here, she's coming now, now Momma, can you hear me yell Your baby boy's gone back to hell Mathilde's come back to me Charley, champagne right away I know you've been saving it for the holiday But Mathilde's come back to me Go ask the maid if she heard what I said Tell her to put the best sheets on the bed Matbilde's come back to me My friends, don't count on me no more I've gone and crashed through heaven's door My sweet Mathilde's here Once More, once more.   I introduced someone to the joys of Jacques Brel today.  ;-)    \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
