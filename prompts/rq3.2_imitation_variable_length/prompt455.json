I’m actually kind of glad that I didn’t see it in the theater – it was very moving to see, but I think it would have been even more overwhelming if I had seen it ten feet high in the dark with no distractions.  I almost had the opportunity to see it when it came out – my dad picked me up one weekend when I came home from school in Milwaukee, and it was playing at a second run theater.  I was the only person in the family who would go see it with him, but when we got to theater, it had stopped showing, despite what the sign outside said.  So, six years later, I finally saw it.  I had heard about the first twenty minutes and the graphic carnage it showed of the D-Day landing at Omaha Beach.  It lived up to its reputation.  The senselessness of war became obvious as I watched the men try to get on the beach and just die, creating piles of bodies.  I had heard about the beaches being washed with blood, but the movie made it real.  The moments of silence – as I later learned were supposed to be Tom Hank’s character’s moments of deafness – seemed poignant and almost worse than hearing the whiz of bullets and explosions.  What I imagined was going on was almost worse – and it seemed to point out the hopelessness of war, how it doesn’t make any sense.  The second act – when Hanks and company go off in search of Private Ryan – proved to be the typical narrative of a WWII movie.  Although, I might say, it was rather refreshing to have average, normal, what I would think are representative soldiers, instead of a cast of characters like many of my other favorite WWII movies (The Dirty Dozen, The Great Escape, etc.).  I read  urlLink Ebert’s review  of the movie afterwards, and I thought his observation that the translator (who I totally thought was  urlLink Henry Thomas  – he and  urlLink Jeremy Davies  could be twins!) was the point of entry for him into the movie.  I agreed – I felt that if I were in a war, I would be the civilian unprepared for the realities of actual fighting.  His confusion with the war – and especially his expectations for the company to accept him – gave me a way to understand how to come to terms with the rest of the film.  The third act – after Ryan is found and the company defends the bridge was probably the most interesting.  After recently seen The Bridge of the River Kwai, I found this part of protecting a bridge fairly interesting.  And I began to identify the characters more strongly – they had actually bonded before the Germans came.  I understood the fighting in vague terms – what they were trying to defend and how their movements affected one another.  Although I was slightly disturbed by my reaction to the translator’s inability to fight with the Germans – I kept urging him to go upstairs and save his comrades.  Well, this wasn’t a Hollywood movie, and he couldn’t manage to pull himself together until it was too late.  Saving Private Ryan was a great movie – one that I don’t think I will soon forget.  It makes me think about war differently, although I still believe that WWII is the main touchstone of the 20th century for Americans.  It is hard to watch a movie about a war right now and not think about the differences between back then and the war we are fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Things seemed so much clearer back then – the enemies were more black and white – you were either Axis or Allies, German or American.  WWII seems to be a war that we as Americans keep going back to, perhaps because it has an ending that is easily understood.  Good triumphed over evil.  WWII was also so well documented, even as the war was  going on, Hollywood made films to inspire those on the homefront.  I’m always a fan of watching the Memorial Day marathons on various cable channels, and the amount of WWII movies always outnumbers WWI and all the other various wars or conflicts that the US has fought in.  Perhaps going back to WWII and creating fiction out of the facts makes us hope that we can create some understanding out of the wars fought afterwards – that understanding reasons for a war that is clearer can help us understand why the more confusing wars were fought afterwards.  But enough philosophy for now -- I loved the use of color in the movie.  It was washed out and felt real.  The use of handheld cameras for the beach scenes and most of the combat scenes made it feel less like a Hollywood movie made in the 1990s harkening back to 1944, but as if it could have been a documentary, that a camera crew followed the search for Private Ryan.  The opening and closing shots of the transluscent American flag was just right.  Seeing Saving Private Ryan makes me question how  urlLink Shakespeare in Love  managed to win the Best Picture Oscar over this film.  I have no doubt which one will be more talked about fifty years in the future -- and it will not have Ben Affleck in it.            I got new DVDs on Tuesday night.  It always such fun to come home and actually have a package sitting on the register for me.  It so rarely happens that I was especially happy to see the DVDs.  And they are the last DVDs that I will be getting until September.  I have officially sworn off DVDs -- in fact, I wasn't even supposed to buy these.  But I got them from  urlLink Deep DVD Discount  which has awesome prices in the first place and then I got an extra 20% off with a secret code.  So I got three DVDs for $7.50 each --  urlLink Breakfast at Tiffanys ,  urlLink Sabrina , and (although this one hasn't been delivered yet)  urlLink Paris...When It Sizzles .  I also got  urlLink It Happened One Night  for under $15 I believe.  So it was like around $10 per DVD -- an excellent price.  But, unfortunately, I cannot afford to keep getting DVDs.  At the rate I'm going, I could get cable and it would be cheaper.  But it is so fun to get new DVDs.  I love unwrapping all the plastic, peeling off the stickers, and opening them up to remove the security tags.  Ah, what fun.            While I was home on vacation, I managed to go through some of the books that I left back in Wisconsin.  These includes some of my film reference books -- some of which are better than others.  But one of them came back to Baltimore with me --  urlLink The Great Movie Stars: The International Years  by David Shipman.  It's another great biographical dictionary of movie stars.  Sadly, it does not include lists of films (as The MGM Stock Company did), but it covers a wide variety of actors and actresses from the late '40s through 1972.  And it includes a lot of international stars (hence the name!), many of whom I have never heard of.    It's got lots of pictures, and best of all, entries on people like  urlLink Tab Hunter ,  urlLink Terry-Thomas , and  urlLink Laurence Harvey .  Quality!  I remember when I bought -- it was in Lansing, MI at a bookstore during the mid-1990s.  I didn't have enough money to buy both volumes, so I decided to get the second one.  I don't know what led me to buy it -- but I'm glad I did.  I've read lots of books on golden age Hollywood stars, but not so many on the stars of the later years.  And I will eventually track down a copy of  urlLink The Great Movie Stars: The Golden Years !              Van Johnson, that is.  My friend Shayna has kindly offered to tape two of his movies for me recently --  urlLink Easy to Wed , a remake of Libeled Lady, and  urlLink Invitation .  I watched Invitation this afternoon, and what a hoot it was!  It is a total soaper -- Dorothy McGuire plays a woman (Ellen) with a heart condition.  She can't be active and ends up leading a rather quiet life.  Her father dotes on her, and after finding out she only has a year to live, he sets her up with Dan (Johnson) -- a struggling architect -- who he tempts with the offer of work.  Dan doesn't necessarily take him up on directly, but he does end up marrying Dorothy before falling in love with her.  Flash forward ten months -- and Ellen finds out!  Maud, Dan's ex-girlfriend, is extremely jealous and sends her an invitation to a dinner for a heart specialist -- and Ellen finally puts two and two together and makes four.  She confronts her father and Dan.  Dan tells her the truth -- he didn't exactly love her when they got married, but he does now, and he's found her a specialist (from Baltimore!) who will operate on her.  Ah, happy ending, and Ellen lives to see the spring.  Invitation was fairly entertaining, but primarily only as a soap.  I wouldn't recommend seeing it unless you're a die-hard Johnson or McGuire fan.  The story is pretty far-fetched, but it seems a relict from the early '50s.    \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
