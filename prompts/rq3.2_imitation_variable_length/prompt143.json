Its more like making sure she don't burn the house down.  I love the child, but she really is liable to do that.  I brought my laptop with me (cause although they have a computer with internet, it sucks).  Once I got here, i noticed that someone in the houses adjacent has a wireless connection and I can pick up on their signal.  Depending on where i am.  so i ran around the house trying desperatly to get the signal.  But the only time I got it, it was actually too weak for me to do anything.  Sucks eh?  Well, probably not since I'm not actually suspose to be stealing signal...  I've just watched the opening cerimonies of the Olympics.  Very interesting since the order of the countries depends on the host countries own alphabet.  And Canada, being something like K - triangle - N - triangle - D - triangle...or something like that.  So we ended up marching after the States this year.  Not that i really care, but I thought it was an interested dynamic.  So I was up at the summer home last night with my friend.  It was relaxing and actually a pretty good time full of drinking vodka with my parents.  Who knew three or four years ago that I would be sitting around a fire, drinking and having a good time with my parents.  But true story.  Times theyt are a changing..                      And I'm off. In 22 days. To Calgary. Leaving home once again. Gezz...I give almost anything to have a permanment residence. AllI really want to do is have a magizine subscription. You know, the one where your required by the law of magazine laws to stay put for something like two years. This is all I ask. Oh, this and to be eternally happy doing something I love. But thats it. For now.  But on to more immediate matters. This weekend is the Folk Festival. I didn't go last year and I feel poorly about having not supported my local music scene. But I will go this year, come hell or high water (which might happen in this port city). And I promise not to embaress my best friend in front of Hawksley Workman (this time), as long as she promises not to embaress me in front of the cute bass player from the Trews. This time. I think its a fair deal.  Does anyone else feel that the upcoming U.S. election is overshadowing the more important matter that we have the devil as PM?  And did anyone see the Oprah where she talks about her time in South Africa (I realize she talks about it more than once). I'm passivly watching this one right now and I'm realizing that I was in Cape Town the same time she was there. Not that it would have mattered had I known at the time...but its a 'humph' moment for me...an 'I didn't know that' moment.          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
