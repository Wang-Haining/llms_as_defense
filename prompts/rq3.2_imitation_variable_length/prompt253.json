GAH.  that just about ripped me down to the core.   ask and you'll get the answer.  i asked nick, he told me straight up.  i asked the spirit, he told me straight up.  now it's a matter of acting on the knowledge i gained... that could prove to be harder.            ...or so my sister is convinced.  her husband has been accessing it at work.  now here is where my double-standards come in, because i am amazingly not cool with him doing that, but i don't see anything wrong with porn.  i don't think it's bad per se, i mean like all things when it gets to the extreme nature of it and all that, there's a rather evil side to it.. but i kind of see it more as another medium of experiencing sexual pleasure :) but with him doing it there are all sorts of problems, like him lying about it, like him doing it at work, like him keeping it a secret, like the nature of how bad it is, like his attitude towards being a victim to it, like how he has chosen a strict work environment and lifestyle so he should not participate in it, etc.  my sister is convinced it is a sin because he was lusting after other women, it's the same thing as committing adultery.  to which i disagree, basically because when it comes to actually LUSTING after other women, he doesn't even know these people, that's like women going crazy for brad pitt or something, they're still true to their marriage and stuff, nice to look at but they know they have the best of what's real at home.  it's not like he knows the girls, but then that opens up a can of worms and leads to objectifying women because it's not THEM he's lusting after, just that the pics and stuff arouse him.              so my therapist (who i've been released from by the way) before our final session last friday she had asked me to prepare an outline of ways that i've changed since we started this whole process way back when.  topping my list was that i've gained weight.  how is that improvement?  i don't likely know.  but i do know that it's made my breasts even bigger, for those of you who don't know me i thought that was rightly impossible, but nevertheless they are now a nice juicy fleshy pair spilling over a tiny pink bra.  and to make matters worse, my sister, who has always hated my body in the first place, is now convinced i'm pregnant.  which is impossible, because just last week i celebrated my 6 months of being sex-free, a huge deal for me.  now the good thing is my stomach hasn't been the house for the newly added weight, it's all pretty much gone to the appropriate places for curves, so i'm not big in that area whatsoever.  yet she still kept pushing me to admit that i was pregnant and hypothesising who the father was, as if all she thinks i do in st louis is have sex with various men.  anyways i'd seen my sister this past weekend, and then the next thing i know, my mom calls, starts asking if there is something i haven't told her yet, leading into that she'll still love me if i'm pregnant because she knows how i always get into these messes.  LORDY!  i can't weight (lol) for my sister to get over her bulemic crap so i can start making comments about her!             i know i'm on the verge of something good when all hell breaks loose.  this is a quick rundown of my past week: i made a spiritual decision to let go of some things that were holding me back, actually causing me to regress, and thus open up the passage to be able to take some big steps in the right direction.  my grandma died, i encountered financial struggle, i had to miss work at the most inopportune time, i had a horrid return to work when i did go back, i had to pay a nice $250 for my kids to attend daycare just two days and a rigid businessman who wouldn't cut slack off the price, next i found out my best friend e was in a really bad car accident on the highway late one night and is not doing well at all, and then the next day i found out my brother in law is dealing into internet porn at his work, which just happens to be in the most rigid church environment, not to mention the impact this is having on my sister who's married to him..  so all this is happening, a lot of distractions popping up to rid me of focus and throw my mind into a whirlwind, just when i thought i had gained clarity.  and i have no doubt in mind that i'll even get a chance to see n this week and it will go so well that it will throw that 'well, maybe' hope back in there and.. gah this is just what i had determined to let go of so i can accelerate my advancement..            so yea let's catch up.  i didn't end up going out with that guy on friday.  and as previously stated i didn't end up getting to go to nick's to pick up that tape, but after work i did call to see if i could still get it but he didn't call me back.  so yea, oh well to all of that.  friday night i went to church instead, that rocked.  saturday morning i woke up at like 4 and prayed about whether to go back to my hometown to see my grandma, she's been sick and hospitalized as of late  and i wasn't sure if she was going to make it another week which was when i was planning to go see her.  so i drove down there saturday, saw her and stayed for awhile, then drove back home.  so then sunday i was supposed to go across the state a different direction and pick up my girls from staying with their dad, but my mom called that morning to say my grandma passed away.  so i had to go get my girls and then drive across the state even more to come back to my hometown.  it was a mess, a good 13 hours of driving in a little over 24 hours.  my car is tore up anyways, i was freakin out, but it is now at the shop being fixed before i have to trek back home in a few days.    \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
