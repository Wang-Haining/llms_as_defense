  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic:\n\n       the kiss was deep and amorous. 'ah!'cain pulled his lips away. pain was in his injured shoulder.  'Are you ok? we should stop, it's causing pain in your injured shoulder.'  'no, i'm fine..' he tried to resume what they were doing but kai placed her finger to his lips.  'no, your not-'  cain had pushed her finger away and captured her lips with his own, cutting her off. she could not resist..she had to kiss him back...then she had built up enough self control and pushed him away.  'illegal use of lips!'  he looked at her with these eyes...that weakened her  '..am i not a good kisser?..'  'yes,yes,yes you are!' she thought, '..must not give in....' but those eyes...and lips...they taunted her...  his lips brushed her, he then kissed her lightly, slowly getting deeper...  she gave up...she could no longer take it...she had to kiss back...  but then, she felt a sharp pain in her head. she broke the kiss.  '..i told you i'm fine...'  'No, it's not that...i have a feeling...about rook...i think we should go back over there...i think she's in trouble...'  cain agreed-even thought he didn't want to but he had to-. they left and rode one of kai's motorbikes to her living...space thingy.                    (outside, a few minutes later in a park conveniently placed near the hospital...)  'Iye!' cried Jack, trying to catch up with her, 'Wait!' She stopped, turning slightly to show him she was listening. 'I told her i was with you, Iye, you have to believe me,' Turning a bit more, to look at Jack, Iye said, 'If you did why were you kissing her?' Jack sighed, 'I wasn't, she kissed me just as you guys were coming in.' This time it was Iye who sighed, 'Just leave me alone, ok?' She started away again but was stopped by Jack. He had took her hand and said, 'Remember in Russia when you hit me with the snowball?' Iye didn't respond, 'I still have the picture,' Jack took it out to show her, 'I carry it all over with me, Iye. If i didn't care about you then i wouldn't have it.' Iye took the picture, looking at the smiling girl then to Jack, 'I remember,' she said quietly, 'but i...i just can't, Jack, not now.' With that she ran away into the night, heading for home while Jack stood there watching her go, holding a picture of the girl he loved and betrayed.                  *(note: this has nothing to do with his death, i was planning to do this anyway..wasn't sure if i should...but oh well, it was fun...apart from the deaths..and people trying to kill us...and the crying and mourning.......while it lasted)  Kai then made up her mind. She couldn't take it anymore. She stood upon her bed and grabbed a book off her shelf. Her legs werent very stable, she was shking when she stood up. She then got up and walked-her legs sorta shaking still- over to her desk-though she was walking slow and she stumbled a few times. She opened it up to the next blank page and wrote something down**. She then walked over to her nightstand where she picked up a picture of him. She brought it over to the desk and set next to the open book. She stood there for a moment, staring at his picture through her red, tearing eyes. She stroked his cheek then lifted it up to her lips. She set it back down and then walked over and into the kitchen. She pulled out another bottle of sake. She poured some into a square sake cup, brought the bottle and the cup over to the desk and set them beside the picture. So there was the open book and to its right, the picture and to its right up at the north corner was the bottle and cup. She took a sip from the cup and set it back down in its place. She walked over to a closet type furniture and opened it up. There she pulled out his sword. She then walked over to the desk and set behind the book and picture. She walked over to her stereo, set to play 'Whiskey Lullaby' a few minutes later. She, also, set it so it would repeat that song over and over....until someone turn it off. She walked over to her weapon closet and pulled out her sword.  She walked over to the middle of the ,unsheathing it along the way.  She held it high in both hands, and with all her might she............... Her body fell hard to the ground.  A red pool formed. The trail of tears upon her face, now fell to the floor and into the red pool. One last tear brimmed her eyes, it glided down her face and it dripped into the red below....now it was a pool of blood and tears. Then the song started to play... ''(guy)She put him out like the burnin' end of a midnight cigarette She broke his heart, he spent his whole life tryin' to forget We watched him drink his pain away a little at a time But he never could get drunk enough to get her off his mind, Until the night. Chorus: He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger And finally drank away her memory Life is short but this time it was bigger Than the strength he had to get up off his knees We found him with his face down in the pillow With a note that said I'll love her 'til I die And when we buried him beneath the willow The angels sang a whiskey lullaby. (Both)La la la la la la la La la la la la la la. La la la la la la la La la la la la la la. (Girl)The rumors flew but nobody knew how much she blamed herself For years and years she tried to hide the whiskey on her breath She finally drank her pain away a little at a time But she never could get drunk enough to get him off her mind, Until the night. Chorus: (Both)She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger And finally drank away his memory Life is short but this time it was bigger Than the strength she had to get up off her knees We found her with her face down in the pillow Clinging to his picture for dear life We laid her next to him beneath the willow While the angels sang a whiskey lullaby. La la la la la la laLa la la la la la la. --- Instrumental --- La la la la la la la La la la la la la la. --- Instrumental --- La la la la la la la La la la la la la la.

''  *his-meaning Jack's...just in case someone was confused..or...some..thing..... ** ....See ye'all on the flipside.....and whatever you do  don'  be like me.....                   Iye looked Dominick in the eyes, not even noticing his new appearance. A look of disdain crossed her face and she looked away. 'Leave me alone,' she whispered. He stepped closer to her, 'Poor, poor Iye.' The Italian stopped just behind her, 'If it's any consolation he died asking me not to harm you,' Iye shuddered a sob, 'you know,' he continued, 'you can just make it easier on yourself,' he produced a switchblade from his pocket and handed it to her. Iye took it and looked at the metal shining with newly spilled blood. She pushed herself away from Jack and stood, turning to look at Dominick. 'I'll kill you,' she whispered so quietly it was almost inaudible. He smiled, 'I'm sure you will,' Just then, Iye rose the blade and lunged at him. He easily deflected it and grabbed her arm, tossing her aside. Moments later he had her from behind, holding her arms behind her back. When he spoke, his voice was heavy, close to her ear, 'When i'm done here, care to know who i'm going after next?' Iye tried to get free but she hadn't the strength compared to him. 'A bit of an irony i might say,' he purred, 'he'll never have a  Chance ,' That gave Iye the strength she needed, that simple threat. She elbowed his rib cage, bringing her head back to smash it into his face. Dominick stumbled back, covering his now bleeding nose. Iye scrambled to grab the switchblade and came into a poised stance, ready to attack. Dominick laughed at her, 'I wanted to take my time with this but it looks like you won't go down without a fight,' He pulled the gun from his belt and aimed at her, 'tell bunny-boy i said hi.' The shot rang out in the silent apartment and for a moment things froze-until Dominick realized Iye was gone. He looked around but there was no sign of her. Then, as he took a step forward, he was stopped by a blade being pressed into his back. 'Did you forget, Dominick, that i'm a jumper?' He grimaced, 'Apparently so,' with that he spun around quickly, taking her by surprise and shooting once more. Iye dodged and ran at him once more, this time grabbing his wrist and wrenching the weapon free. She picked it up, jumping back from him and aiming. He smiled at her, 'What are you going to do? Shoot me?' Iye's hand shook but she kept aim. 'Give me the gun, Iye,' He took a step towards her, but she stepped back, 'Don't come near me!' She screamed, but he didn't listen, he took another step, and it sent Iye over the edge. The shot hit Dominick square in the chest. His eyes widened and he mumbled something before touching the wound and looking at the new blood on his fingertips. But, it seemed that in that one moment, something changed about him. He looked up and at Iye, eyebrows creased in question as he asked, 'Iye...what...' He stumbled back, against the wall, looking around, 'how'd I get here...' he slowly sank to the ground, staring into Iye's bleu eyes, wanting answers. 'Iye,' he asked again but his voice was fading as his head fell, chin resting against his chest, '...t-tell Chance....I....' Dominick didn't finish sentance, instead he fell into an inconsceousness (sp?). Iye dropped the weapon, sinking to her knees, tears pooling in her eyes.          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
