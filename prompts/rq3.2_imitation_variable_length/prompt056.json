I hate heat.  I love winter.  Even my eyelids were sweating today.  Gah.  At least I didn't have graduation practice yesterday, because as hot as it was yesterday, it was even hotter today.  Bleh.  Well anyways, it's my sister's graduation today.  Yay!  I wish it didn't have to be on such a hot day though, considering the graduation is outside.  It can't be as bad as last years though.  It was pouring and they had a four hour power outage.  I would just walk home if that happened.  Yay for living 5 seconds away from Lower Merion!  Yay for Liz graduating!  On a different note, it was soooo random.  When I was getting off the bus, Nikhil Gregg and Bernard (this 7th grader who's been expelled from 3 other schools) tried to give me a high five.  I was like, 'What the fuck?' and just got off the bus.  Sooo random.  And I know they were doing it just to annoy me, but still.  Whatever, I hate them anyways.  ONLY FOUR AND A HALF MORE DAYS OF SCHOOL!!!  ...la Gu                       Oh my god, I can't believe that I finished all of my finals, even though they were all like uber easy, and didn't even really count for much.  Today I took my Science Final, which was just Mr. Plumly's desperate attempt to have more than 5 people pass his class.  I mean, it's an EXTRA CREDIT, OPEN NOTE Final, how desperate is that?  Well it was really easy anyways, and i didn't even need my notes, so whatever.  Basically, if you get your average or higher on the final, you get 10 extra credit points, which really doesn't do much for the people who actually need it, so yet again, another stupid idea from Mr. Plumly!  And since I have like a 96 average (almost as good as Alicia, grrr), it doesn't really matter anyway.    Oh yeah, and just as Alicia has, I've been trying to find all the secret facts on  urlLink J.K. Rowling's Official Website .  So far I've found three, just as alicia has, and I can't think of anymore places to look.  IT'S REALLY ANNOYING!!! Grrrr.  So yeah, that's basically what I'm wasting my time on at the moment.  ONLY 6 AND A HALF MORE DAYS OF SCHOOL!!!  ...la Gu                        Today my father had like this weird party thing for these Enviromental lawyer people from Mainland China that are working at Temple... or something like that.&nbsp; O_o.&nbsp; It was strange, and I kind of refused to make an appearance until the last hour.&nbsp; Though I was forced to help with the preperations by the evil, slave driving parents.&nbsp; NEVER GET A POOL!&nbsp; It requires waaay too much work.&nbsp; I had to hand vacuum it today, and dang is that thing heavy, and it took forever.&nbsp; Grrrr.&nbsp; And no one even swam.&nbsp; What a waste.&nbsp; I actually had an excuse not to go to the party though.&nbsp; I was 'packing', or more like waiting for my clothes to dry because my dryer is retarded.&nbsp; Grrrrrrrr.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  I finally actually got down to packing at around 6, and I'm currently not finished yet, though I'm close.&nbsp; w00t.&nbsp; Somehow, it seems like I haven't packed as much this year, but whatever.&nbsp; I probably over packed anyways, like I always do.&nbsp; At CTY, I still had clothes that I never wore once.&nbsp; Bleh, labeling everything is what took me so long.&nbsp; It's such a PAIN IN THE ASS.&nbsp; Okay, that's my outburst for the day.&nbsp; Hmmmm... I should probably get back to packing.    &nbsp;  Oh yeah!&nbsp; I almost forgot!&nbsp; I got a haircut on Thursday and now my hair is like shoulder length.&nbsp; I didn't want to get that much off, but my mother made me because apparently I have split ends, which somehow, I am unable to see.    &nbsp;  ...la Gu    &nbsp;  Contact meh:    &nbsp;  Eugenia Dellapenna   c/o Appel Farm Arts and Music Center   P.O.

Even though like, Jen, Amy, Faich, and Dot didn't go into the pool once, it was uber fun.  Everyone came other than Jamie, cause he had friends over, and S'rah, who apparently never said she could come considering it's her birthday, but apparently, I have hearing problems when it comes to the phone.  Can and can't sound very much alike you know.  Anyways, everyone came in little groups that kind of amused me.  Both people from Villanova, Sam and Rachel came together.  All the guy Narbs came together, Faich, Tim, and Ben.  And that's about it for groups.  And I have no idea why I found that amusing.  *ponders*.  Anyways, we had food and stuff, even though we were a little behind schedule.  There was pizza, cake, and soda, all the necessities for a heart attack.  The pool was actually pretty clean, though it was kind of cold and Tim, Sam, Ben, Rachel, me, and finally Maggie and Sophie in the last half hour of the party actually swam and played games.  The other people just kind of hung out in the hammock and talked and ate and junk like that.  Mia didn't come until near the end of the party, and since she goes to a different school, only really talked to Sophie, my sis, and Dot.  It saddened me.  But eh, whatever.  And there were no teary good byes this time 'cause most of the people are going to Britta's party tomorrow.  w00t w00t.  Earlier that day I went to the mall and got some really cute capris from Aeropostale!  Shut up Alicia/Faich.  Then we went shopping for stuff for the party, like globe lights for the umbrella, and citronella tikis/candles.  The tikis were set all around the pool and looked really pretty at night.  There may have been a fire hazard considering the trees, lol.  But even with all the citronella filling the air, I still got like 2 mosquito bites.  Grrr.  But that's not nearly as many as I got at Tim's party!  Yay!  Hope you guys had as much fun as I did!  ...la Gu                       Yay for being at Alicia's house!  I didn't feel like going home today, so I just got on Alicia's bus, without a bus pass.  Heh heh.  Alicia oh so nervous, but the bus driver didn't even notice me, so whatever.  And now we're having oodles of fun torturing Magus.  And I'm eating slim jims, yummy!    Anyways, tonight is the graduation celebration thingy!  And neither me nor Alicia have any school supplies to donate, but whatever.  Grrrr, I keep making typos cause Alicia's keyboard is icky.  Alicia is defending her keyboard and says, 'It's awesome!  You just can't harness its awesome power.'  Today was like the last real day of school, even though we didn't even do anything today other than graduation practice, which was boring, as usual.  We watched  Scary Movie 3  in Language Arts because Dan Stadlin had the DVD in his locker and it was uber funny.  Mrs. Lawley didn't even mind that they cursed like every 3 seconds.  That's about it for today.  I'll probably post again when I get back from the celebration thingy.  Thank god this week is finally over.  ONLY 2 AND A HALF MORE DAYS OF SCHOOL!!!  ..la Gu                       Okay, so I just back from Tim's birthday party, which was actually pretty fun!  Alicia and I collaberated and just blackmailed everyone so we could get oodles and oodles of cash since we didn't really care about the mystery.  At the end, since we knew we couldn't win with only our money, we just convinced everyone else to give us their money and we won the award for most wealth since we had like at least 7,000 dollars.  All I got were these stupid blue dice though.  But then Tim started handing out prizes randomly and I got a cap gun/caps!  Yay!  Then when everyone was leaving, everyone was like all like hugging and crying cause his party was probably like the last time they'll ever see some of their friends again since we're all going to different schools.  I was like pretending to be really sad with my fake whiney voice (which I'm very good at by the way) and it was fun.  Lots of hugging.  It was really funny, when Faich was leaving, he knows how homophobic Tim is, so he hugged Tim, and then gave him kiss on the cheek.  Tim was just standing there petrified and was like, ewwwwwwwwww.  And then I started fake whining again, so Tim gave me a hug, and he was like, 'I'm gonna give her a kiss to make her feel better' and I didn't think he was actually serious, and then he like actually did give me a kiss and I was like.... eh... and I kind of just stood there frozen for like 5 minutes cause I was not expecting that.  I mean, it's Tim.  He asked me what a hickey was earlier this year.  Bleh.  Before the party Alicia and I went to the mall!  Yay!  We spent like four hours there in a last attempt to get Tim a present, and in the last ten minutes, we just bought one out of desperation.  It's actually really cool and it wasn't that expensive, yet it was very heavy to carry the entire length of the mall and we like switched off who held it every ten feet.  It's a massage chair!  Well actually like a pad that you put on a chair and it massages you.  It was only 50 dollars, and on sale from 100 dollars, so we only had to pay 25 dollars each.  Totally awesome.  And he really liked it considering we were like the only people who didn't buy him a gift certificate.  We kind of told people at the party that it was just a gift certificate in a giant box, and they believed us.  It was fun.  That's about it for now.  ...la Gu         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
