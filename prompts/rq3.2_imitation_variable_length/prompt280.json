  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic:\n\n       my bad habits:  i seriously drink too much coffee. perhaps i should just invest in a caffeine IV? maybe buy stock in  urlLink Starbucks . god knows i'm keeping them in business...  i smoke on occasion when i get terribly upset. (tho i usually remember half way into the cigarette why i quit - YUCK!)  sometimes i drink excessively. like when i'm terribly upset. i quit drinking all together a few weeks ago. i'm too depressed about my situation at home to be a happy drunk. i recognize that it just makes things worse so until i have things more under control, i'm just gonna say 'no'.  i probably don't eat anywhere near enough.  i probably don't sleep as much as i should.  i worry about what people think of me too much.  i stress on mistakes. (even tiny ones no one else would even notice or care about)  i get neurotic about order and clean. if my surroundings aren't orderly and clean, i can't focus.  i'm sure i'll be adding to this list in the future. i'm a mess. i actually asked the question of a friend a while back and he was kind enough to answer me. his bad habits are no where near as bad as mine are tho. Not Even Close.   i think i'm secretly (or not so secretly) hoping that the rest of the world is as screwed up as i am. i seriously need a therapist. too bad i can't afford one.                    i was out buying coffee this morning. yup. i amazed myself too. up, dressed and out of the house at 9AM on a Sunday. will wonders never cease? i'd have never been out there tho if the unimaginable didn't happen:  i  *gasp*  ran out of   coffee!  the horrors, i tell you. The Horrors!  &nbsp;  so i've got the coffee safely in my basket and i'm shopping for coffee 'accessories' and i get to the dairy aisle. i decide to get some cream because truthfully, it tastes oh, so much finer than milk and i was feeling like i  needed  deserved&nbsp;a reward for being out of the house at such an ungodly hour on my day off. as i was perusing the selections i noticed that they have regular Half and Half and Fat Free Half and Half. ummm. correct me if i'm wrong here people, but isn't fat-free cream something like...&nbsp;MILK?  &nbsp;  so i decide on the regular stuff and i turn around and some man is looking at me. i smile, cause i'm still sorta asleep and he says 'five nine and a half! am i close?' WHAT??? what the hell is this guy talking about? am i on a hidden camera show again? is it&nbsp;some crazy psychotic version of  urlLink Jeopardy  this time and the old dude is screaming out random answers at me?  &nbsp;  so i figure out that he has been trying to guess my height. yup. at Vons, at 9AM on a Sunday. criminy. THIS is why i don't leave the house unless i have to. i'm only 5'8' by the way. that guy was a good&nbsp;inch and a half off. i sure hope that question he was trying to answer wasn't the Daily Double...             there is this laundromat down the street from me -&nbsp;i might have mentioned it before -&nbsp;that we used to call the 'tweek-o-mat' because it was open 24 hours and all the meth heads used to hang out in there washing their clothes when they couldn't sleep in the middle of the night. i know all about this place because honestly, me and my friends used to do our laundry and drink beer in there back in the day too. it was a regular zoo back then...  &nbsp;  anywho. i wandered in there a couple of weeks ago because all the other laundromats in town were full and i had a car&nbsp;loaded with&nbsp;clothes to wash and i was running out of places to look into washing them in. my god was i surprised! the place is freshly painted, has all new machines and even real live plants and flowers decorating it! and they even changed the hours of operation - i believe that they are now only open until 11PM.  &nbsp;  i guess some things do change and sometimes, they even change for the better.           i'm sitting here in front of my computer while the whole world explodes outside my front door. i swear to freaking god, it sounds like a warzone out there!   i wonder where these people get the stuff they are lighting up sometimes. some of the neighborhood displays seriously rival the professional jobs! last year while puppy-sitting for the Brother and his Lovely Wife i was treated to a show that was a hundred times better than anything i've seen put on by the pros and it lasted damn near an hour and a half! are these people made of money? that shit's gotta cost a fortune!   the Crazy Guy in my complex was up on his roof earlier - laughing and screaming at all the fireworks just like he does every single year - checking for potential firestarters up there. given the potential for them on the 4th, i'm amazed every year by how few fires there actually are too. you'd think there would be a lot more.   it would suck to be a cop tonight. where the hell do you go first? bottle rockets over here, cherry bombs over there. sparks flying overhead in a thousand different directions! law and order will have to wait until tomorow i guess - i'd say the pursuit is pretty futile tonight!           ok so what is it with  urlLink  the crap   they are selling on TV   these days? and why do i get all sucked in and have to watch the same infomercial a million times even tho i've already seen it, ummm. a million times?  like the  urlLink Power Juicerâ„¢.  is Jack LaLanne a freakazoid or what? actually i think he might be a robot or something. honestly. who is dressing this man? lose the belted jumpsuit m'kay. might have been ok in the 70's when you had that other show but...  or the other  urlLink juicer thingie . the one with the guy with the crazy eyebrows. do somethin' about that would ya,   gramps  ? you are scaring the children.  Husband is particularly fond of the one selling  urlLink those knives . Husband wants those knives Oh So Bad. personally, i cringe every time i watch it because of all the good food they just keep disposing of down the hole at the end of the cutting table. but every time we are channel surfing and the show is on, Hubby needs to watch it so he drools and i cringe at least once a week.  and don't even get me started on the  urlLink Home Shopping Channel . hoo boy. i get roped into those before and after makeup presentations like you would not believe. i'm amazed every single time at how horrendous those poor women look after the stuff gets spackled to their faces. and people actually buy this garbage?  thank god i don't buy any of this crap tho. i'm not that far gone yet i guess. when the day comes that i feel compelled to actually purchase one of these marvels, someone needs to smash my phone-dialing fingers with a mallet, take the credit cards away from me and find me a little bit of professional help.           i didn't know they were either. see, you learn something new every day.  did anyone catch Amish in the City on Wednesday night? whoa nelly! this is gonna be fun i think. i was a little surprised by the clothes tho. since when do nice Amish girls wear bikinis? and when they put the Amish clothes on the city kids, how dare that one chick still look hot. oh i'll get all their names strait eventually but so far my fave is Mose. dude almost drowns and still gets back into the water. go Mose! my hero. *swoon* he can plow my field anytime!  uh. so long as he doesn't speak while he's plowing. the boy has one interesting inflection! YOW.  'inflEction' comes from the Latin  inflectere  which means 'to bend' by the way. doesn't have anything to do with a beating - that would be an inflIction. see y'all learned more new stuff. how fun. but i digress...  Ruth about killed me tho when she was crying at the beach because ummm. she was At The Beach. now, i like the ocean and all but it's never moved me to tears to see it. of course, i've never lived in AmishLand either so maybe that was it.  and have you noticed that they (Amish Kids) almost all have Biblical names? except Randy. where the hell did that name come from??? eh, the names didn't  really  surprise me. i sorta expected that actually. the Amish kid in the camouflage 'I (heart) BEER' shirt, well now, THAT surprised me!  i enjoyed the show quite a lot but of course, you can't please everyone all the time and some Christian people are really upset about the whole thing.   urlLink  Damn Christians   . they think that the Amish kids are being taken advantage of, exploited to some degree and mocked. i didn't see anyone up in arms about stupid people being exploited or made fun of when That Other Show started tho, did you? maybe they should go save   urlLink  Paris and Nicole    before they jump on this new horse and buggy.  \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
