I knew it was comming because someone slipped it to me. (lol thanks Mandie) But he was like .. 'what would it do to our friendship if i told you i liked you' but i just said i didn't like him like that but i hope we could have the same friendship .. so we do. I guess everything's cool with that. I kinda feel bad tho. I hope i dont lead people on like that. Especially&nbsp;him cause he's an awesome kid and I would never want to hurt him. Mandie told me not to break his heart so i tried really hard. Hopefully&nbsp;he didn't like me that much. I've known him for 5 months (since feb 14th) and they have been really great. We&nbsp;became good friends almost imediately and i would trust him with my life. I really hope that&nbsp;continues.&nbsp;&nbsp;xo *later days&nbsp;   Beatles- Black Bird &nbsp; 'Blackbird singing in the dead of night, take these sunken eyes and learn to see. All your life you were only waiting for this moment to be free.'                   alrite well nobody came over tonight so i was ..lets say upset at first. But i didn't really talk to Mandie and Heath so whatever. I ended up going for a run at 9 and it was really good but then I started to feel sick so i walked some and then finished up. It was getting kind of scary tho because i felt like someone was following me and the srteets around me have very few street lights..and also things were making weird noises that i didn't like. Anyway on my XC schudual i'm writing that i did 3 even tho it was probally less because i was suposta to 5 one day this week and i didn't do that =\\  I think i'm gonna ask Carolyn if she wants to run with me when i have to do long ones like that. I feel bad not asking Krissie but i dont think I could keep up..I probally will ask tho.   I have work again .. 15 days left. just think it's all going towards my car which at the moment i want a white Jeep but we'll see how long that lasts and if i like it after i go for a test drive lol .. xoxo -Casey                     Hello =)  well today was nothing amazing I just happen to be in a extra good mood so that's cool. At work Mara came so we played Spit.. what a great time. Then I played Al in spit and lost..and then in checkers.. and i lost again. But whatever it was fun lol. After work I had an orthodontist apt. which was not cool. He said that i have a problem with the way I swallow? how dare he! Well anyway neither of my retainers fit and i'm not getting new ones which is gay.. my teeth are probally going to move and I'm gonna be pissed and if he thinks he's getting me to put braces on again he's joking himself.   After that I went for a run .. a long one. It was exactly 50 minutes. I dont know how far really but on my schedual I'm gonna write 5 cause I'm suposta do that one day this week. Then I did some things that I was suposta be doing all summer, like step-ups and the heel-raise series. So I'm probally gonna be sore tomorrow.   I beleive tonight I'm going to Hoop City for the Hannan Varsity games, both girls and boys. The only person that i think will be playing is Eileen and i'm not even sure but I'll finish when I get back.
