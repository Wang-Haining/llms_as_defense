DOWNLOAD THIS PLURAMON TRACK NOW. its totally mbv's 'touch my breath' & 'loomer' combined.   urlLink pluramon - hello shadow                                  as if there werent enough breasts sporadically bursting out lately. GODAMNIT   urlLink COURTNEY LOVE KILLS HER POSSIBLY FICTIONAL BABY    urlLink further proof that john mayer is the biggest loser in the world   nyc's  urlLink dfa records  have legally forced toronto's  urlLink death from above  to change their name. they're now known as FIRST TO FIGHT.   heres the word from the FIRST TO FIGHT boys:  quote: 'hello due to legal issues we want nothing to do with we have had to change our name the people at DFA records apparently trademarked DEATH FROM ABOVE in america and so our label in america (vice/atlantic) wont release our record as long as they have taken legal action. we tried for the last 3 weeks to make this go away, we had the best lawyers working on it non stop, we tried everything. but now, rather than fooling around with this anymore we have had to change our name to FIRST TO FIGHT. we went through about 100000000 names and they all sucked in thier own special way.  so nothing will change on here for awhile cause im not at home and the all important logo is still the same. its a downer but it had to happen. a rose by any other name, right?  so in closing FUCK DFA RECORDS FUCK JAMES MURPHY WE DECLARE JIHAD ON THEM HOLY WAR ENDING IN THIER DEATH AND DISMEMBERMENT  -j f k'  oh jesse. 'THIER THIER' it'll be ok.                                 urlLink new pornographers ' carl newman is coming out with a solo project on  urlLink matador records . its just some nice catchy indiepop. i love the slight lisp in his voice.  urlLink download here   bands to check out: fans of  urlLink my bloody valentine  definitely head over to  urlLink pluramon . the  dreams top rock  album seriously rivals  loveless .   i've been obsessed with finding quiet, lulling tunes as of late. the only criteria being they still must be ENGAGING. my playlist has just been riddled with  urlLink stina nordenstam ,  urlLink devics , and  urlLink the innocence mission .   pitchfork has been on the ball lately as they've finally slapped on  urlLink hot reviews  of comatose keyboard rockers  urlLink on! air! library!  and they're definitely all over  urlLink ratatat  as most die-hard  urlLink interpol  fans have heard of already.  HERES MY SLEEP PLAYLIST AS OF A FEW NIGHTS AGO:  > doves _ m62 song > sondre lerche _ it's over > mice parade _ two, three, fall > ellen allien _ abstract pictures > little wings _ i saw reflections > parsley sound _ yoyo > air _ alone in kyoto > innocence mission _ tomorrow on the runway > figurine _ time (his mix) > broadcast _ winter now > the delgados _ coming in from the cold > pluramon _ noise academy > jesus & mary chain _ just like honey > the arcade fire _ my heart is an apple > elbow _ grace under pressure > asobi seksu _ walk on the moon > broken social scene _ anthem for a seventeen year old girl > devics _ the end and the beginning > on! air! library! _ five > my bloody valentine _ loomer > stina nordenstam _ stations  and the final alarm clock snooz'ish song: > +/- _ no one sees you like i do  this track is going to make wake me up, let me fall back asleep for three seconds, wake my fat ass up again, lull me back to sleep for another three seconds, and repeat.                                  for those of you who've absolutely no idea whats going on ever, the strokes have been appearing weekly every tuesday this month on conan. im assuming they're going to finish off with 12:51 but where was THIS END HAS NO END? gaaaah. in case you missed them you can download each performance here (whatever happened/reptilia/under control):   urlLink thestrokesfan.com   yah so i dont really see why anyone would bother reading this blog. i talk about/bash all these nyc bands despite the fact that i dont even live in the same country! there are plenty others much more firsthand and informative than my sporadic babbling but whatevs i guess. i think im going to have to find some HOOK or 'thing' that i and only i do and write about. suggestions would be awesome. t'was my birthday last week and im too old to come up with anything fresh anymore. also complete and utter laziness ad infinitum. until then, boring nyc-wannabe blog it is! eat it.  ps thanks giulia/ urlLink new york doll  for the sweet mention!  listening to: talking heads - mr jones                               hi my name is steve lam. im canadian and this is my music blog. NO, THAT IS NOT YOUR SIGNAL TO BOLT. i mean i know stuff! canada has *some* cred! paul anka put this town on the map! mad tv wouldnt be funny at all were it not for alanis morrissette bashings! and what actually sold the robin hood: prince of thieves soundtrack? why, bryan adams of course. i mean who cares if one of the  urlLink most important bands in the world  hates him.  anyway yah. this is most likely going to be your typical wannabe nyc blog. im sure i'll end up writing superfluous amounts of praise for  urlLink stellarstarr*  and  urlLink the stills , anger a few (re: wazillion) kids with my complete disdain for interpol, and all the while keeping the maple leaf/beavers/igloos/whatevs in mind by bringing you the latest news from canadian gems ala  urlLink destroyer ,  urlLink broken social scene ,  urlLink the sick lipstick , etc etc etc. who knows, maybe even the asian in me will whip out some hot  urlLink jay chow  gossip.   for now though, tim delaughter i love you. i dont care that you fronted for  urlLink tripping daisy . though i will admit 'i am an elastic firecracker' was on constant rotation when i first got it in like...1995? even so, puddle of mud ripped off your songs. i mean ewww. (GOD HELLO? 'she hates me' IS 'i got a girl'. EXACTLY). labels constantly drop your bands. when things are starting to look up, your band members OD and die. yet you come back with full on genius in the name of  urlLink the polyphonic spree ! unless you're not even alive im sure you've all heard of this band by now. but seriously CHECK THEM OUT IF YOU HAVENT. also, someone drive me to one of their double toronto shows on sept 29 or 30th!   urlLink whats worse than a terrorist? a child molesting terrorist   listening to:  urlLink the watchers  - two worlds                               whenever i cant find something new to like, i cycle through some of the phases of my past musical lexicon. there would be weeks on end when i'd only listen to 90's britpop ala shed seven, kula shaker, rialto etc etc. seven of the twenty eight or so days would've been solely dedicated to going through  urlLink jarvis cockers discography . on a sidenote: i reckon the only fools to have picked up pulps greatest hits disc were also the ones who went out and bought nirvana's best of. seriously if you dont already own nevermind and friends then you really need to work on not being a sack of dumbass.   my early high school days were basically all about elastica, the rentals, and of course nirvana. throw in weezer to further ruin any credibility. track back further and you have me listening to bel biv devoe and brian adams in grade 4-5. everyone is a big fat liar if they tell you they never listened to new kids on the block.   moving out of my parents house involved lots of mogwai, refused, tristeza and blonde redhead. i remember my electronic/dnb phase immediately following watching the movie groove. sprinkle on some chinese/j-pop/early 90's emo bands/the cure and you have the basic map of steve lams jingles. flash forward to now and if you're reading this, im probably listening to whatever hip/pretentious/cool bands you're listening to.   i've no idea why i bothered to articulate all of the above. i actually did find new albums to dig:   urlLink clearlake - cedars    urlLink the coral - magic & medicine    urlLink devics - stars at st. andrea.  this came out a while ago but i dont think it received the attention it should have. clearly mentioning it on here will make up for it! portishead'ish if you didnt know.  miscellaneous blabbery:  urlLink the watchers  just finished up their tour with  urlLink james chance ! RIDICULOUS. this definitely makes them hotter than the  urlLink liars  right now.   im not sure how i feel about jarvis cockers  urlLink relaxed muscle  project yet. if noel gallagher says attempts at avant garde'ness are needless, then THEY ARE NEEDLESS. either way, we need the sexy jc back, not the idiotic deranged misfits costume bullshit.                                COMPLETELY UNRELATED NON MUSIC POST.   i think when most ppl go to nyc and know whats up they try to hit up all the hot spots before they get old and shitty. i should have gone to  urlLink misshapes  or something completely 'buzz' like that but NOPE. AS FOR ME, i just spent a whole day in manhattan trying to find a fitting pair of  urlLink levi's 518 junior womens jeans  with no luck whatsoever. i am awesome. seriously though is there no actual conversion from mens to womens sizes? ppl who work in clothing stores are worst than radio shack employees. THEY DONT KNOW ANYTHING EVER. i have a 30' waist. all i know is that size 11 in girly girl size is much too big for me. HELP ME OUT HERE!  anyway i'll be gone for a few more weeks. im stuck in dirty new jersey right now but i'll be all the way over in california in the next little while. please dont ask me why. im trying to think of any tidbits of blubbery i can drop here. we all know that  urlLink daft punk are remixing franz ferdinands' take me out . well guess what? they're also doing a  urlLink death from above  tune. i dont know which yet but i guess it wouldn't really matter cause most of their songs sound the same. they're still awesome nonetheless.   you know who knows whats up?  urlLink giulia  knows whats up. we both say keep listening to  urlLink film school !  urlLink click              \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
