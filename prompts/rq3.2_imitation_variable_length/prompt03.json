It just gets people going on wonders who will win this election? Will there be a majority government? Will the Liberal lose? Will the opinion poll just be a bunch of jokes that people will vote for Liberal on election date anyway? Nobody will know until it actually happens...   As for voting, I was going to vote, but it is too late now... I didn't send it my ballot as it will not get back to Ottawa in time (for any overseas canadian, they need to mail in their ballot before election day to be counted)... so my vote will not counts... this is the horrible things about Canadian in another country who wanted to vote... it is not fair and they should have a better system of doing this... There's so many Overseas Canadian who will want a say in their government, in Hong Kong alone, there's an estimate of 200,000 Canadians who lives here... so there's a people who never have their say as to who should be their Prime Minister...   To me, I think technology will help... With our lives so connected with the internet anyway, why can't we vote online? If the government think this is not a safe approach... then why can't we vote at the Canadian Consulate around the world instead of mailing in the ballot? This is something the government should look into in future elections...   Anyhow... let's wait and see the results very very soon :O)  Peter oh Peter                                WHY DOESN'T PEOPLE THINK?   Why doesn't people think before they do something? Sometimes it drives me nuts! For example: tonight I discover that my housemate took my laundry out of the dryer and then put it on the floor and mixed it with my other housemate dirty cloths. WHY WHY WHY? Can't people simply think about the fact that clean cloths wasn't suppose to mix with dirty cloths??? Now I have to put up a sign just so that this won't happens again! Sometimes I wonder why doesn't people spend two seconds of their time to just think about what they are doing before they actually do it!!!   Sometimes, thinking a little might actually be good for you... working your brains out a little will improve your situation awareness and your responds time to common problems. I sometimes really wonder, how do we actually think? Afterall, we were just a bunch of H2O and Carbon and some other atom mixed together... so really how do all of these atoms have the ability to think? This is just too weird... If you ever figure it out how do we think then let me know :)  Peter                               I donno... I felt like such a dork for these past couple of days... I am having a crush on this Brian guy that I met recently... he is cute, sexy and smart.... and I have never fell so weak before... my body were numb because I can't stop thinking about him... but at the same time, I don't want him to think that I am a freak because I do believe that any relationship is a two way things... it can never be forced in one direction. If he shares the same feelings as I do then something could develop... if he doesn't then we will just be friends and nothing will happen. This whole things just bothers me because I haven't dated another guy before. I had one night stand before and what not, but I have never dated another guy. It just makes me really nervous and I did many stupid things that makes me look like a dork. I even called Brian up without knowing what do say... I just totally freeze... I am such a dork... because of this, Brian knows that I am in love with him but I donno does he interest in me or not? I am sick and tired for my horrible love life when everyone that I show remote interests would just wants to be friends. To me, I know that I am a very nice guy, I want my friends to be happy and I want everyone that I know to be happy. But sometimes I do think it is unfair that everyone just wants to be friends. It sucks and it happens so often that I lost confident in myself. I know I am confident in business, I am confident in technical knowledge but I am not in love and relationship.  So this whole thing is really bothering me and I just hopes that I know how Brian feels about me. It doesn't matter if he likes me or not, I just want to know so that I don't have to spend so much time thinking about it and worrying about it. I know I like him and I know that I can love him if he give me a chance but it will never work out if he doesn't share the same feelings as I do. I guess we will just have to wait and see how it goes. Luckily Brian is out of town for a week, so I have some time to calm down. Hopefully, I can be less nervous when I get to hang out with him next time. We will see how it goes. I am crossing my fingers and hoping for the best on this one. Love you guys. Take care. Ciao.
