I mean... we found 2 tickets but we needed 3 so .... we were there ... in front of the stadium .. we could hear the people inside having a good time .. we saw people getting there late with tickets ... they got there around the half time and they didn't want to sell the damn tickets!! Yummi and his friend were even on tv ..hehehehe ... they were trying to make some kids sell the tickets when the camera came and asked what it was going on ..one kid said that we were trying to buy the tickets and he said NO but we didn't leave him alone ...hahahahaha.. Yummi and his friend didn't understand what the gyus were saying and they were just waving ...making 'peace' sign to the camera ..OF COURSE I wasn't there ... I was busy trying to find a hole on the ground to put my head ;-) anyway ...... then we went to the other entrance and they decided to get into the stadium ...yeah poor ME was with them when they tried to pass the security guy ..who couldn't understand English and since they showed their job ID ...he just let us in ... 2nd security guy : SAFE too !!... VOILA ! we were inside the VIP party for Real Madrid !! hahahahaha .... we saw the field ..some players ... until they got us ... poor ME was looking for another hole on the ground ... well ...after all ... it was not so humiliating ... but it would be funny to see Yummi on tv :-)                  I was coming back home today and I started thinking about when I was in Brazil. I don't know why but I can't remember many things ,just some images coming up like flashes ,a slide show.. someone said once that when we don't want to have some things in our minds ,they get erased automatically after a while.. I think this is what happens to me. Which is not always good because there are some things that doesn't seem good at a determined point but after a while they become good memories. I am from Registro ( Sao Paulo), a small city in the middle of nowhere known for bananas... yeah baby .. bananas ! and for tea due to the large Japanese comunity in the area ,they say that when the first ship from Japan went to Brazil ,a guy hid the tea .. seeds?leaves? damn! let's say just tea..well he hid it inside a bread because it was illegal to take such thing to Brazil.. I wonder if a marijuana seedling would pass through.. going back to the tea guy , he just happened to chose my small city to start his business.This whole thing made me wonder how the banana story started......... hihi I don't want to write an autobiography so I better stop here my Brazil thing, eventually I will write more things about this topic.                  ..since I wrote here last time ... I'm surprised but I think I ... I think I ... I like to work with Japanese people ! It can be really interesting.. I am learning&nbsp;a lot and my co-workers have patience to teach me Japanese... so if I don't learn Japanese this time.. I will be sure I have mental problems.. actually it's becoming an commun excuse.. I mean .. that person acts this way because he has problems.. he doing that because he has problems .. everybody has problems!! What I was talking about ? hunnn ... yeah.. the job is still kinda difficult but I am enjoying ;-) There's a fucking BABA on the B1 floor.. she is always complaining about something but I just look at her with my 'I'm gaijin face' and she just give up to keep talking..&nbsp; There is a party next Fri in the building .. not a party party but some comedians are coming and the bank is gonna pay dinner and alcohol.. I'm not going because I think the comedy is gonna suck... I would rather go clubbing .. AGAIN! Wow .. after all D is not getting that old! K has just started a new job too so we are drinking a lot together..you know.. after a tough week of work, relaxing drinks !              \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
