After flying down here and being one of the only people on the flight who spoke English, Paul took me to this restaurant called Chipolte's where you can order these burritos. But they're not like Taco Bell/Hell burritos... these are like 'YOU WANT A PIECE OF ME PUNK?' burritos. They are  massive . I think I ate like a fourth of it. *falls over from spicy-ness*   Kelly and I are going to go out to California Pizza Kitchen... ooo love. Stephanie's not in town yet but apparently she is on the Atkins diet now. She's tiny. Rawr.&nbsp;And OMG Grace is the cutest thing I have ever seen and loves my cell phone rings. Oddly enough, it is cooler down here than it is in Memphis. Muhahaha. Apparently Doris yelled at the MTAM kids today. I'll come next week! Silly disappearing Doris.   Just&nbsp;for the record, this comes from the most insane case of writers' block I've ever had, while&nbsp;also watching a four year old cousin and making sure nothing crashes on her head. Well, actually a glass shelf panel just&nbsp;crashed so this could take a while longer...&nbsp;&nbsp;    Let us lie here on the green    In our minds let's run away    To a world of simple ecstacy    On a not so distant day    Let your fingers travel down my back    Tracing down my spine    Let the spinning objects govern us    And dismiss any lost time    Naive I was and may well be    But I know how to feel    And as we stay up on the table    I question if it's real    Don't leave me here alone yet    For we still have yet to dance    As a magic tiny number    Brings about a strange, sweet chance    It's&nbsp;funny how time can govern    Such an act I've never known    Can we dismiss the seconds    And just simply let go?    I shiver at a new sensation    Want to pull you close to me    Doesn't matter where we've been or are    All I want is just to be    In this moment, in this place    Of new friends and circumstance    Let the walls come down between us    For a different type of dance    I promise I will never break    Your heart, and I don't fear    That you will ever, ever&nbsp;try    To tear me down, my dear    Sternum right&nbsp;down to the small    We'll travel down, a pair    I will be a euphoric version    Just as long as you are there    I wonder if it's possible    To miss you until it hurts    But for now you can&nbsp;remain here    And I will withstand the worst    Who knows where we have been before    Or where our future lies    For now I will just simply tell you    This has been a magic night.     &nbsp;  I'm sorry it rhymes-&nbsp;I couldn't help myself.
