The Buddhist religion was the main religion there until the 9th century when the Hazaras, people of the region converted to Shiite Islam. In the town of Bamyan the worlds largest standing Buddha structure was built, carved into a mountain side.  The statue was 175 ft tall and named Solsol, meaning “year after year”, he was built between the 3rd and 5th centuries.  Sadly, the Taliban who have been enemies of the Hazara people destroyed the statues in May of 2001.  •Definition: Cairn-pronounced ‘kern’, a heap of stones piled up as a memorial or as a landmark  •Urumchi Mummies-Another fascinating topic I have stumbled upon is the Urumchi Mummies of the Tarim Basin in China.  They were found in the Tarim Basin which is the saltiest place in Central Asia and are dated to be as old as 4,000 years.  They are known for their amazing preservation and were actually made by accident.  They have been found between the towns of Loulan and Cherchen.  The reason why these mummies are so interesting is that their features are Caucasian and based upon their physical features as well as the intricately woven clothing they wear (one man was even found wearing ten hats!) they have been said to originate from Celtic tribes of Central Europe.                   Wow!  This is my first online BLOG entry and I must say it is rather exciting.  I usually handwrite my journal entries, now I will be cutting and pasting, literally! It has been a while since I have written anything....let alone a journal entry.  I felt that now was an appropriate time in my life to re-introduce myself to this art.  Lately my mind has been conjuring up emotions and thoughts, some of which may be worthy of the pen (keyboard?), while others are better left to be swept away by consciousness.  I often wonder if a journal is a suitable forum for a collection of thoughts as it provides an open door into the psyche of the author, for others who may trespass upon it's pages.  Do I write selectively?  Choosing carefully the emotions and thoughts that I wish to unveil-or, do I write without inhibition...Allowing my words to flow freely as a bottle of spilled ink?  It is with this thought, that I begin this journey again...To fill the empty page with  MY  unworthy words, to muddle them with thoughts and phrases that can not be left unsaid.  One day, as I have always done, I will reflect on these words and laugh as how I have changed and possibly shed a tear for times and feelings past.          For who I am today, I may not be tomorrow.                                               S.E.S.                       These are topics that were included on a previous post on my other blog...  •EcoPoetics/EcoPoetry- poems dealing with ecological and environmental issues. Some of the more famous ecopoets include Gary Snyder, Mary Oliver, W.S.Mewin and Wendell Berry.  Ecopoetry is a subset of nature poetry and “recognizes interdependence of all creatures, views humbly the relation between human and non-human life, cultivates skepticism towards the hyper rational, overtechnologized  mindset that dominates present-day culture (2002 Cathers Business Information Inc.) Nature in poetry peaked in the centuries between Beowulf and Blake and then took a dive in the age of Darwin.   It was then revived again thanks to the Beats and Gary Snyder. •Dharma-means “protection”, practicing Buddhist teachings protects us from suffering and problems.  Teaches that problems that exist in daily life can stem from ignorance and the method for eliminating that ignorance is Dharma.  Dharma is the supreme method of improving human life and it focuses on the inner development and happiness as opposed to external. Buddhadharma is another name for Buddhism.   •Definition:Waxing Poetic-to become more poetic, lyrical •CuChulainn-an ancient Gaelic hero with superhuman qualities.  His name means “The Hound of Culainn” of which he slain, however he was first called Setanta.  At the age of 5 he left home to join the Red Branch Knights-Ulster Army (Ireland).  He was a great warrior, great at hurling and eventually became the leader of the Red Branch Knights.  He was defeated in an epic battle by Queen Mebd.                        The topics for today:  Relics- word is derived from the Latin word 'reliquaie' meaning remains.  A relic is an object of a departed saint.  According to Catholics there are three classes of relics, the first being an actual piece of a saints body (limb, hair, boneÂ) the second class is an actual piece of clothing from a departed saint and the third is a object that was either touched by a saint or one that was brought on a visit to a saint.  It is prohibited by the Catholic church that any relics falling into the first and second classes be put up for sale.  Relics were also an important aspect of Buddhism and Hinduism.  The veneration and preservation of relics is a primitive instinct which was often associated with shamanism.  The relics trade was very popular during the Middle Ages.  Relic can also mean something that has surpassed the passage of time.  The most sought after relic is a piece of the true cross.  http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com  Dagda-is the Celtic god of the earth and ruler over life and death.  Dagda or The Dagda means 'The Good God'.  Is the leader of the Tuatha De Danaruledrulesed over the Uisnech in Co. Meath.  He is a master warrior, artisan and master of magic.  Dagda is the son of the goddess Danu, father of the goddess Brigid and the god Aengus mac Oc.  He mates with his wife, The Morrigan on New Years Day. His attributes are a cauldron with an inexhaustible supply of food,enormousourmous club-of which one end he could kill nine men and with the other end restore them to life.  He is also known under the title Ruadh Rofhessa-The Mighty Red One of Great Knowledge.  http://www.shee-erie.com http://pantheon.org  Football-(I was curious as to why American Football, is called football as there is very little contact between the foot and the ball)  American Football is indeed named as such, as it owes its heritage to soccer.  Rugby evolved from soccer when players began carrying the ball and American football has things in common with rugby, especially the rugby league.  Hence, the sport is a direct  decendant of rugby union football, which in turn derived from soccer.  American football retained the same name for which soccer is called in the rest of the world.  http://wordiq.com  Phi-is the basis for the Golden Section, Golden Ration and Golden Mean.  It was known to the Greek s as the Golden Section and to Renaissance artists as the Divine Proportion.  The decimal equivalent of 'Phi' is 1.6180339887 and 'phi' is 0.6180339887.  Phi can be derived in many ways and can show up anywhere in the universe from Fibunacci's numerical series, geometry, proportions of the human body, plants, animals, DNA, music and art, the solar system and even in the bible and theology.  Like Pi, it is a ratio that is determined by a geometric construction.  The ratio of the line segments when a line is divided in one very special and unique way...divide a line so the ratio of the length of the entire line to the length of the larger line segment is the same as the ratio of the length of he smaller line segment     A is 1.618...times B and B is 1.618... times C.  Alternativly, C is 0.618 of B and B is 0.618 of A.  http://goldennumber.net/neophite.htm          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
