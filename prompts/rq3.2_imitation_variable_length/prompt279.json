Take a look at Volkswagen ('the peoples' car'), which has been making inroads in China for the last 20 years. Most every taxi in China is a VW. The Chinese are very familiar with VW, and it will be interesting to see how that familiarity will play for VW when the company unleashes its luxury Phaeton model into the Chinese market.      [VW is already playing up its designation as the official auto of the 2008 Beijing Olympic games (the 2008 Olympic logo is fabulous, btw). And, interestingly, when you want to translate the  urlLink site's  Chinese characters into English, you click on a British flag. Wonder if any sites ever use American flags to designate English? The site refers to the Phaeton as a 'saloon,' which is British for a sedan; I had to look that Britism up. The 'saloon' is built in an angular, transparent  urlLink German factory  that resembles a Frank Gehry rather than a plant/factory. VW is touting the place as a 'mobility infotainment center' and offers the chance for a Phaeton purchaser to watch, in the flesh, his/her car being built/born. Interesting, indeed.]      The fleet of new Chinese car owners have been limited in their brand choice up until now, but that does not mean that the Chinese nuevo riche are not brand savvy (though perhaps not brand nuanced). The Chinese, I'm generalizing here, love logos - big, bold ostentatious logos.  Wouldn't you, if you were a citizen emerging from communism?         Enter VW's luxurious  urlLink Phaeton .    VW has had some rough times lately, with dismal sales in North America in 2003. But the Phaeton, which has done rather poorly in      America      may have a future in China.     [The     $64,600-a-pop     Phaeton V8 was released in the U.S. in November 2003.      The ultra luxurious Phaeton W12 starts at a whopping $94,600.  I can't find a price for Phaeton models available in China.]     First, the Phaeton is not made in China, so it automatically gets a 'thumbs up.' Second, as branding is a recently new phenomenon in China, it seems that Chinese are not as deeply entrenched in their branding paradigms as are Americans and Europeans. Granted you see several high end fashion houses in Shanghai and Beijing, but it seems that many American and European brands do well in China, even those brands that are not uber-jet-set.  In other words, I'm not sure if pedestrian is such a horrible thing when it comes to cars in China.  If it's a stylish and expensive car, it might not matter that it's a VW.  For example, Buick, of all brands, makes a killing in Shanghai. It's an odd feeling, being in Shanghai, surrounded by Buicks. Yet these are not your grandfather's Buicks. My friend Chris, on seeing a Shanghainese friend's car from a distance, remarked, 'That's a nice car. Hey, that's a... a Buick???'  When Americans think   VW, they think functional, trendy, well-engineered cars. Americans will not, at least within the next year, make the leap and associate VW with luxury simply based on the Phaeton, or even the knowledge that Audi is VW's sister company (for what it's worth, Audi will soon roll out a less expensive scaled-down Audi dubbed the A3), though the Toureg may have a future.  But the Chinese may very well start to associate WV with luxury - in some ways, they have been doing so for 20 years.                       just for kicks, thought i'd share my microsoft recommendations.  Leverage Suitable Trends, Contacts & Partnerships    1)  Sell, service and support Linux and Linux-based products.     2)  Allow companies to lease software off-site, hosted and supported                        by Microsoft.    3)  Continue talks with Hollywood studios to provide technology that will curb        movie pirating over the internet.   4)  Continue research into wearable computing products, including the use of          holographic displays.     Reassess Profitability of Segments    1)  Decide whether its too late for MSN to compete with Google (July 1, 2004,        MSN released a new search technology in an effort to compete).  Microsoft        needs to evaluate its cash outlays in this field, although many of the        search utilities that Microsoft develops under the auspices of MSN may        have a second internal life in-house.   2)  Continue to invest heavily in R&D.     3)  Explore expanding consulting business, including entering traditional IT          consulting markets, specifically opportunities that may emerge from the        outsourcing of corporate or governmental IT departments.    Reexamine Marketing Goals & Expenditures   1)  Sales functions seem to be doing well, despite dull marketing.  Reinvigorate brand        image (and revamp images associated with working at Microsoft, i.e. a start-up that no        longer can act like a start-up) and brand with a global, mildly edgy advertising        campaign (the MSN Butterfly campaign is a start).  Marketing department seems to lack        focus, i.e. the brands are controlling the marketers instead of vice versa.   Pay Attention to Global Strategy    1)   Develop better software localization and human-centered design strategies    2)   Microsoft must think globally and devise global solutions both for its own         operations and for its customers, now more than ever (perhaps offer global         outsourcing of IT functions and global IT consulting)    3)   Continue to pressure China and other countries with lackadaisical IP laws         (perhaps pledge to help the Chinese implement the laws for a fee).  Tweak People Practices     1)  Microsoft seems to be doing a good job in regard to its HR functions,            although making the Microsoft brand a bit less stodgy could help attract the           best and brightest technical talent.      2)  Microsoft should implement cross-disciple teams in its R&D efforts (guessing it does,         but not drawing heavily enough on people from the social sciences) and then         reward those who receive patents & inventions by team rather than by individual.           3)  Microsoft should stop being so secretive and promote R&D stars in the press to         generate buzz.     4)  Microsoft should have a clear succession plan in place for when Bill Gates          and Steve Ballmer retire.             IE sucks.  Would someone please come up with a way to retrieve, post-crash, text that has been entered in fields?  - Mandarian characters - are they more ardous to input? - ramifications for the ditigal divide - will the web make English even more ubiquitous?  - mental proccesses - difference in writing Mandarian for the web and in transferring print Mandarian to web Madarian  - bermuda ebusiness (a file on the site had a virus, Norton aborted it taking with it my blog entry, fueling my tech rage and resulting in this abbreviated entry in outline format) - further reaching implications for business on the web - changing corporate structures and physical locations  In short, my trip to China was phenomenal     (some of my pics are on webshots  urlLink http://community.webshots.com/user/merebartlett ).  The more I learned about China, the more questions were raised in my mind.  It's a fascinating place - even more so as it is in the throws of sweeping change.  I didn't have much time to learn about how the Chinese use computers and the internet.           \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
