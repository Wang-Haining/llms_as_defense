He's pointing fingers left and right and far enough away from his body so that Americans will try to forget about the mistakes and countless errors he has made and re-elect him. Blaming democrats for blocking his energy bill which would allow for oil drilling in an Alaskan wildlife refuge marks his stance on the gas issue.  It's almost an art form now - the way he literally shakes hot issues off of his body onto those around him and into the laps of democrats.  His chums in Israel don't have much to fear as he refused to condone their deadly actions.  Luckily this has been addressed by the U.N. security council - with a 14-0 vote (the US abstained - shock horror!) The resolution condemns Israel's killing of civilians in the Gaza Strip.  Looks like Colin Powell took a stronger stance against Israel's actions but still not really strong enough if you ask me. I'm starting to think that Colin and Bush are slowly but surely moving their separate ways.  Too bad he's got Rumsfeld tied around his finger, but then again he has to have  someone  who will sit down to tea with him.  I just read about Delta's low-fare carrier Song which is giving out free tickets to passengers who are  urlLink nice to one another .  But even more interesting is the martini bar option which is available on some flights.     Humans are surprisingly deficient in vocabulary for positive social emotions, and unduly successful at naming negative individualistic ones.  - Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson   I definitely agree with this statement.  It seems as though most folks have a hard time focusing on the positive as they are blinded by the negative. I for one concentrate way too much on the negative side of things and realize that this can hardly be called a personality trait. I wonder if sometimes we slip into this kind of negative state almost unconciously and before our eyes it becomes a thoughtless habit. Or could it be that society and therefore our lives have become so fast-paced that we simply do not have the time or energy to exert our mind and actions towards the positive aspects of life and human emotion? There could literally be a million explanations, and none the right one.   I guess that's why I find it interesting to read about the emotions of animals. Currently, I am reading 'When Elephants Weep: The Emotional Lives of Animals' by Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson.  It's very interesting as it takes an in-depth look at the complex emotional lives of animals.  A subject that most scientists have strayed from in order to keep their work and themselves free from charges of anthropomorphism. I've never doubted that animals have emotion, but it never hurts to find out more.  On a final note, it looks like we'll be getting the car fixed for well under the quoted $3,000 and with a party tomorrow, things are definitely looking up.                           la verdad   Tomorrow I should find out some very important information - if I have a job and if the car can be fixed for a reasonable amount of money. Transit and I just don't get along.  We used to but ever since the creation of the Dalhousie station and the re-routing of my regular bus, it just doesn't work.  Example: Mark and I went to the Humane Society today for our weekly volunteering and it took us a total of 4 hours roundtrip.  Yes we knew what we were doing and yes we went the most direct route. It probably would have been faster and easier to walk - which i'm going to do to the post office tomorrow.   Interesting news on Michael Moore's new film - he's claiming now that the White House tried to stop the making and release of his new film. I believe it - Bush is scared of losing the election as his popularity rating keeps falling. Enshallah, it will continue to fall.  The guy's nervous.  Can't blame him really, he has every reason to be.  He's screwed up in a major way with Iraq, the economy, health care, education and civil rights.  I was disgusted when the  urlLink Patriot Act  came into play.  By claiming that they are protecting America and Americans from terrorists, the government has taken away people's basic freedoms and ability to seek out justice. I mean really, why do they need to know  urlLink what books I read? .  Will this help root out terrorism?  As Kusinich rightly stated -  To allow our Bill of Rights to be nullified without judicial supervision invites tyranny.    Under the Dubya regime America has turned into a country with no rights and no hope for justice.  People live under a false sense of security. My father, mother or best friend could have their house bugged and raided, their property taken, daily lives scrutinized and their personal lives invaded.  Can they say no and protect their lives, their property and their sanity?  No. The US government can basically do whatever they want to you and your life and leave you hanging in the dust.  Does that really sound like a free country?  Quite the opposite. The place is in shambles and is quickly becoming the least free country in the world due to an obsession with terrorism, war and oil.  America is the terrorist and if Dubya is allowed to continue recking havok on our freedoms, America will soon be an inhabitable tyrannical state.  And yes, i'm American.  woo - hoo.      \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
