I'm not sure why - I probably haven't been getting enough sleep but then I never do, never have. Tomorrow's my only day off volunteering and I want to spend the day getting a few more of my site pages up. It feels like a load on my shoulders - I know it should be fun, and it is, but I just want it to be DONE already!! I want it to be all finished because I have this picture in my head and I know exactly how it's going to be and I want it in front of me. On top of that, I need to write at least 3 or 4 emails and do some research for upcoming trips to Seaside and Fiji. I know, I should stop babbling here and do it but this stuff is mindless.. it's about all my brain will produce right now.  If I was in better mental shape, I'd be launching in to some of my obsessions I am indulging right now but you'll have to make do with a list:  Ashlee Simpson, Nip/Tuck, North Shore & eBay.  Oh, and visit this site:  urlLink NotBush.com   I know it's not my country but I just hate to see colossal morons in charge of world super powers. Either way though, get out and VOTE! It's such a privilege and I hate to see so many Americans throw it away;  urlLink Choose or Lose .                        I saw this book in the Harborview gift shop about  urlLink signing  to your baby before he/she can talk.   The skeptic in me says 'what a load of crap/waste of time' but the mother in me (waaaaaaaaay deep down in there) says it would be kinda cool to have a secret (for all intent and purpose) language with my baby. I guess if I had time and/or energy I would give it a go.  There was a 24-page Olympic liftout that I snagged from the  Seattle Times  today. I searched frantically for any news on the Australians but all I could find was a couple of references to and photos of  urlLink Lauren Jackson  (Australian women's basketball team) and an article about the rivalry between Ian Thorpe and  urlLink some American  in the mens swimming.   It does seem like I picked a bad year to spend the year away from home, what with my 18th birthday and the Athens Olympics. I'm going to have to stay glued to  urlLink The Australian  website to get regular medal tallies and news on the plight of the Australians. I can't wait to go to some events at the  urlLink 2006 Commonwealth Games , even though everyone knows it's not the same.  xo                        And I thought it was just me letting personal feelings get in the way regarding the judging that saw Paul Hamm make an unprecedented comeback from 12th to 1st with just 2 apparatus to go.   Looks like the majority of gymnasts  urlLink agree  with me, even those out of contention for the medals and hence without a stake in the judging of the final round.  Of course, there's no mention of any of this on US TV that I've seen, which isn't wholly suprising. It's just like we've heard little about Gary Hall Jr's resentment towards Phelps and his spot in the relay team that finished third that is apparently all over the Australian media. Even the Aussie athletes are talking about it in post-race interviews; how there's talk that Hall has lost all faith in his country and his Olympic team because they made a decision to put a player in the relay that didn't deserve to be there - purely so he might achieve an out-of-reach record by winning a certain amount of gold.  But, regardless, I have to agree with one of the last sentences in the linked article above that went something like this:   Did Paul Hamm do enough to make a successful comeback for gold? The only answer that matters now, is: yes.                         It's one of those nights where I don't want to go to bed but I have no real reason not to. I think it's because in my mind, the sooner I go to sleep, the sooner I wake up and catch the same bus to the same volunteer organisation to answer the same phone.   Sometimes I feel like my blog should be the well-written, entertaining type like  urlLink Stupid Evil Bastard  but then I think it's just too much work. I'd rather have a blog for me, that makes me feel better or gives me something to do, than have a blog that's just another part of my list of chores. I think that's why I got sick of  urlLink melo  - I felt like I should be writing long, entertaining posts when all I really wanted to do was ramble.  I feel sorry for  urlLink these people ... for a split second before I crack up laughing!!! Funny shit. ( urlLink want   urlLink more ?)  And now, for a little taste of classic Dubya:    'I know what I believe. I will continue to articulate what I believe and what I believe - I believe what I believe is right.'  -- Rome, July 22, 2001   Is  urlLink this  who you want running your country for another 4 years?    urlLink Choose  or Lose; VOTE !  xo                        Thorpe's  urlLink victory  in the 200m freestyle overnight made a mockery of claims by some that Phelps is the new king of swimming. Phelps finished with a bronze behind Dutchman Pieter van den Hoogenband (sp). Phelps had hinted all week that he can't wait to swim in the same race as Thorpe (presumably to beat him or show him how good he is) and all week I've had to listen to American commentators boast that Phelps is now the best all-round swimmer in the world and that there has never been anyone like him (a young 19 year old).  LOL! What a joke. Thorpe was just 17 in 2000 when he smashed world records and walked away with 3 gold medals and a bag of silver and bronze.  CONGRATULATIONS Ian Thorpe, we're all so so proud of you!  Other great Aussie medal wins overnight include the first woman shooting gold medal, won by Suzanne Balogh. Also a surprise was Brooke Hanson's silver in the 100m breaststroke.  Among the disappointments are 'Lethal' Leisel Jones' bronze in the 100m breaststroke after she beat the Olympic Record in the semi-finals; she was expected to finish gold and her 3rd placing does nothing to quell claims that she's a 'choker'. Missing out on medals are Aussie diving pair Loudy Tourky and Lynda Folauhola that finished 4th behind the Chinese, Russians & Canadians in the synchro 10m diving platform.  Once again, I was up late soaking in the Games goodness. I saw a FANTASTIC game of mens' waterpolo between the USA & Croatia that the US won after being 1 goal down with 26 seconds left in the game. They scored a goal on the siren and that was it.. only the prelims, but it was awesome to watch. the lead changed about 4 times in the last quarter.  I also saw the  urlLink aforementioned  Aussie men lose their second beach volleyball match to a Swiss pair, Norweigan women beat the Swiss in the same sport and the Australian womens' softball team get thrashed 10-0. Also of interest that I saw was the US basketball match that they lost to Puerto Rico. It brings the US Olympic win-loss record to 109-3. LOL! Unbelievable. It's just the 3rd game they've lost EVER and you should hear the doomsday predictions from the US commentators. And they wonder why I prefer to tune in to the Canadian CBC - well, that's mainly because the maple leaves seem to enjoy seeing Aust beat the USA as much as I do :P   Athens 2004 Olympic Games  GOLD: 6 Ian Thorpe - Mens 400m Freestyle, Mens 200m Freestyle Thomas/Henry/Mills/Lenton - Womens 4x100 Freestyle Relay Sara Carrigan - Womens Road Cycling Suzanne Balogh - Womens Trap Shooting Petria Thomas - Womens 100m Butterfly  SILVER: 2 Grant Hackett - Mens 400m Freestyle Brooke Hanson - Womens 100m Breaststroke  BRONZE: 4 Chantelle Newberry & Irina Lashko - Womens Synchro 3m Sp-board Diving Robert Newberry & Mathew Helm - Mens Synchro 10m Platform Diving Leisel Jones - Womens 100m Butterfly Adam Vella - Mens Trap Shooting  SWIMMING: 7 SHOOTING: 2 DIVING: 2 CYCLING: 1   Sydney 2000  GOLD: 16 SILVER: 25 BRONZE: 17  My blog will be largely Olympic Games until the closing ceremony.. it just means that there is nothing else going on here to report and I'd rather spend time finding out Olympic results than finding other articles to blog.      \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
