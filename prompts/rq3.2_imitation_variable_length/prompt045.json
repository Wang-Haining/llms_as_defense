And probably for a lot of weeks to come.  SON OF A BITCH.  I just do not understand why they want to kill me this way.  I am a night owl, mornings beat the shit out of me.  I swear to god, like every morning I have to wake up at some god-forsaken hour, it must take like a year off my life.  YES, that much.  So I woke up today at like noon (swing shift is THE SHIT, YO!) and I was all good and chillin, right, and then I get to work and I find out I'm on days next week and then for like the next 3 or 4 hrs I was the worst person in the world to talk to.  Not even  urlLink Lewis Black  could make me smile, I was so pissed off.  I could barely concentrate, let alone talk to someone in a civil manner.  But I guess it wore off...at least I'll be out of the shop learning new things.  ...fucking dayshift....makes me wanna puke....  And yes, I have to go in tomm morning, so I shouldn't be up right now typing this shit, but I felt I owed it to all ONE of you readers.  That's all she wrote, folks...                       dejected does not even begin to describe the level of depression, pissed off, disappointed, & sadness i feel right now.  jesus christ, i don't even have the fucking urge to capitalize my goddamn sentences.  if you know me, you'll know that's fucking bad.  i had hope for this evening.  i don't know what for, but what i got wasn't it.  i need a companion.  a wife.  a soulmate.  i need more than a friend can give.  and i have nothing.  i need someone who will be there when i come home, who i can ask how her day went, and when she asks me how mine went, i can say, even if it was shitty, 'honey, YOU just made it the best day of my life.'  if i am ever lucky enough to have that for one day, 1 life would be grand, but 2, if she ever left, after have knowing what it's like to have her here, i don't think i could live w/out her.  look how fucking bad i am now, BEFORE i even KNOW what life is like with her, let alone actually feeling and experiencing the joy, the life she gives me and then taking it all away, i don't think i would or could live after that.  what a pathetic piece of shit i am.  look at me, i'm garbage.  fucking going to sleep at fucking quarter to midnight on a goddamn fri night.  fucking worthless.....         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
