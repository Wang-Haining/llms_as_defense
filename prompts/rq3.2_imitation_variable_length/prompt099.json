These concerns were prompted by an evening news piece discussing Councilman Orange's efforts to scuttle the Mayor's nomination of developer Robert Levy to the DC Public Library Board. This was confirmed by a recent  urlLink Marc Fisher column  about the need to revitalize DC's library system. This paragraph alarms me: 'With slots to fill, Mayor Williams chose Richard Levy, a Georgetown developer, and John Hill, the bookish former director of the D.C. financial control board. Levy and Hill have been working behind the scenes with the mayor on a new central library to be built on the old convention center site (along with a Smithsonian music museum and office and retail development.) The idea is to sell off the Martin Luther King Jr. library, gaining about $40 million for the library system.'  This is a valuable building. It is on the  urlLink DC Preservation League's Endagered List . From the AIA Guide to the Architecture of Washington DC: MLK Memorial Library 901 G Street NW built 1972 The traditional Miesian package is the great man's only work in the District. That the commission came from the city government rather than from a private client, coupled with the fact that giants such as Wright, Gropius, and Le Corbusier are completely unrepresented in town, says much about the low architectural aspirations of mid-20th-century corporate Washington. -NW                                  Trend Alert   I know I've been slacking off on my observations of fashion week but I have noticed just a few things.  First of all, I was disappointed in New York fashion week (part of the reason why I didn't have much to say).  Diane von Furstenberg was abyssimal, Michel Kors didn't wow me like he normally does and even my go-to guy, Oscar de la Renta didn't give me much.    However, I've noticed some trends shaping up.  The first one I've noticed is a little fur shruggy thing.   urlLink Kors did them ,  urlLink Carolina Herrera did a variation ,  urlLink Julian MacDonald did them .   urlLink Diane did several.     Another trend is that  urlLink 80's business suit blouse with the big bow in the front .  Look at  urlLink Marc Jacobs ,  urlLink MacDonald ,  urlLink de la Renta .  I think London Fashion Week is shaping up to be the best.  But that's only because Milan never agrees with me, Paris is never very wearable and New York has already disappointed me.  I'll post more later, including my favorite London shows.  J.                                  The Cher, The Donald, The Domald, The Jeannie   I found  urlLink this column on nicknames  in my hometown newspaper.  I have a strange nicknamey name.  I was named after my grandmother Jean.  But my mother's name is Deane, so whenever we were in the same room together, there were too many 'eans' so they gave me Jeannie (although for the first 6 months Momma called me Polly, and my uncle called me by my middle name, McVeigh (?)).  I've been pretty content with Jeannie over the years, it's served me well, I think it's kinda cute.  So why do people after they've known me for a while and have gotten a degree of familiarity with me shorten it to Jean? 'Hey Jean!'  I hate Jean.  It reminds me of my grandmother.  Or people assume my middle name is Louise and call me 'Jean Louise.'  Maybe it's from  urlLink To Kill A Mockingbird ?  So my name is actually not anything 'for short' but actually 'long for' Jean.  And my last name has never had a ring to it like guys who are only called by their last names in high school.  My dear friend Mittendorff, was forever known as Mittendorff among her guy friends in college.  my last name doesn't roll off the tongue with such fun ease.  Do I need a nickname?  Momma calls me Bug, but that doesn't really count since my firends aren't going to call me bug and it has nothing to do with my name (and  urlLink I'm reminded of Uncle Buck  whenever anyone else calls me Bug).  I guess all I can do is hope that one day I'll be known as The Jean (like Donald) or just Jeannie (like Cher), but then wouldn't that have to be just Jean, since it's one syllable?  J.                                  I'm Finally Part Of The Most Wanted Demographic!   I was always so jealous of the Soccer Moms, the Single Guys, the AARP and all the other trendy demographics.  Finally I get my turn!  Single Women Voters!  However,  urlLink after reading this Salon article , I'm just reminded of how often I get steamed at women from Jane Magazine and Candace Bushnell who claim to represent my views.    First of all,  Karen Catchpole, senior editor of Jane  has this to say:  'It's not like they should start thinking 'let's do a mall tour because we're going to talk to women.'' She paused, and said with audible disgust, 'By the way, I'm 100 percent sure that that idea has come up, and that's just offensive.'   Then  Simon Doonan, creative director for Barneys New York  says this:  'The 'Sex and the City' single women are never going to take an interest in politics. They are so completely mired in fashion and style and self-indulgence. They have, maybe quite wisely, decided to center their entire lives on themselves. They're very inwardly focused; they make random attempts at caring about the world by going to yoga class.'  Then  Elle editor in Chief Roberta Myers : As for how candidates could catch the eyes of single women, Myers said that in practical terms, 'One thing the Kerry campaign could do is get John Edwards [as the vice-presidential candidate].' She was quick to add, 'not just because John Edwards is cute. It's that he's got a magnetism, and you can hear the message a little more easily. It's true that you actually pay more attention to people who are compelling speakers and deft with language.'  And then  New York magazine sex columnist Amy Sohn :  '[Kerry] should hire really good-looking men to stand outside the polling places in high-single areas,' she said. 'All the men should have sideburns and good breath. Any time they see a harried woman walking by in unreasonably high heels, they hand her a flier that says Choose, Then Booze...When I was single I always voted because I never had a date and it was one way to make the evening go by more quickly. Plus, it takes less time to vote than to masturbate, and the feeling of satisfaction lasts longer.'   What I find far more offensive than the thought of candidates going to malls looking for women voters, is women who claim to speak to my views on politics saying that women choose a candidate like we choose a one-night-stand, and then compare it to masturbation.  No wonder candidates are listening.  J.                                  Travel Dispatch from Elizabeth in Italy  Ciao,  The town I am in is a lot like Annapolis minus the water, so there isn't much to do but eat gelatto and shop.  The Italians seem to loooooove underwear.  It's everywhere.  Wine and cheese too, as expected.  I haven't seen any gays or references to eBay as of yet.  As usual, my eyes are peeled.  I bought a few things at the market this week, but am pretty euro-poor so I mainly have to stick to eating gelatto.  I do have my eye on a bag from a shop called Pinko.  They don't have one in Alba, but hopefully I'll be going to Torino next week and can pick one up there.  It's just a canvas totebag that says PINKO BAG in sequins.  I don't normally worry about flashing brand names, but this pun is just too funny in English.  And, if anyone needs one of those fake plastic Birkin bags, they are che-e-e-ap here, only about $15.  You will all let me know.   And, on to the people.  They are all wonderful.  Tons of handsome Italian men, but none of them undressing me with their eyes as I'm in northern Italy.  And there is no university here so the people tend to be older or of the jailbait variety.  Oh, and what young Italian girls like as much as underwear are really tacky tee-shirts that say things like FREE SEX on them.  It's almost as if I never left home.  I was also hoping to splurge on a pair of trainers that one can only find in Europe, but the latest craze here is Nikes. Go figure. More later! Ciao,  Bitsy                                   Turbo Conservative   So today some funny things happened when I went to the Whole Foods on P Street. I always enjoy the political volunteers who stand on the sidewalks of the city and ask you to sign petitions and whatnot. Invariably they are liberal activists and it's always fun for me to get a solicitation to 'take a moment for Greenpeace' and then tell them politely that I work for the oil industry. The looks on their faces are always fun and I continue on my way. Simple pleasures. So today I was heading into the Whole Foods, picking up some last minute items for a dinner party tonight, and some guys were standing outside and one asked an older woman if she wanted to 'help defeat George Bush.' She gave him a dismissive look and said, 'Lord, no I don't! I want to help him win!' I was ecstatic! I always assume I'm the only registered GOP in the district and all alone, but lo, there she was! The other Republican living in DC!    So then, I finished my shopping and upon leaving the same guy asked me if I wanted to 'help defeat George Bush' and without thinking I said, 'No, I'm turbo conservative.' Turbo Conservative? What is that? If you don't know me that sounds ridiculous! My friends know that I tend to overuse certain words, 'turbo,' and 'buster' being two of my favorites, but this dude had no idea what I meant by that. However, he gave me a forlorn look and for a brief moment I thought I saw a look of inevitable defeat in his eyes, so I guess he did understand what turbo conservative meant.                 \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
