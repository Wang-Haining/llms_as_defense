This continually happened throughout that year of school, yet I never knew why. Too shiny? Too new? Too girly? Was I the only one wearing them or was I just following the trend? Or does this just prove that kids, of whatever age, have that evil side to them? Okay, that's a given. Hm.. I keep coming back to being the only one wearing them. Maybe that conclusion will quench my mind for now.  ***  The wind blew the tree branches against the window, bringing forth a strange scratching noise. One that Maggie could not stand, but thankfully she was about to have company and the approaching storm would not be a bother to her much longer.  She rose from her chair and padded over to the counter, where a bottle of wine and two glasses rested. Pushing her hair behind one ear, she removed the cork and held the stem of her glass as she poured. Once the liquid had settled, she brought the glass to her freshly glossed lips and took a tiny sip before a knock sounded at the door.  She set her glass down and made sure that her clothes were straightened and that her red hair was flyaway free. Satisfied, she sucked in a breath of fresh air and headed to the door.  Hand tight on the knob, she hesitated. This was something she'd been waiting for for a while. Yet she had her doubts. But this was not the time for them, so she forced all bad feelings out of her mind and softly smiled as she turned the knob and pulled the door open.  There he was, smiling back at her, with roses in his hand. His hair was spiked and his clothes were casual. His blue eyes shined bright as he stepped forward and wrapped his free arm around her waist, pulling her forward and into a hungry kiss.  Their mouths parted, still smiling. She stepped back into her apartment and away from the door. 'Come in.'  Wayne's eyes swept up and down her body before stepping inside and handing her the roses. She was wearing a blue and purple, form fitting sweater with dark blue jeans. They had decided not to wear anything special since they weren't going out. Yet there was something about the way she looked that night that made him think she had spent some extra time in front of the mirror.   Once the door was closed, Maggie walked back over to the counter and turned to him. 'Wine?'  He nodded in response from the chair he'd seated himself in. Her apartment had a vintage look to it, one which he liked very much. It was a small apartment but one that she had fixed up to her liking, making it feel quite comfortable to all.  Before he knew it, she had seated herself in the chair across from him and handed him his glass which he promptly took a sip of. And now it was time to begin.                     Now, since I'm boycotting all personal entries in LiveJournal, looks like here will have to do for a semi-personal-type entry. Okay? Okay. :)  Today I had the unpleasant experience of getting hit in the face. By who? My mom. Not a punch, at all, but actually more of a slap. We were in the movie theatre [about to see The Day After Tomorrow] and as the slides were rolling, the slap happened so I shot onto my feet and stormed out of the theatre to the girls restroom, where I just waited for about 10 minutes. Waiting for nothing really inperticular. Then I went out and sat on the bench by the concession stands [what a nice theatre, by the way] until my dad came out of the theatre and began to lecture me. Hmm...  I must figure out a way to buy a romance novel where my mom won't question the contents.. because I'm craving one and I want one by a published author.. my friend raves about the ones she owns and then another friend highly recommends them, too, so I must oblige and get one!  ---  'My name is Diane. I fell in love at the fragile young age of 17 but sadly, nothing ever happened with him, though I wish it had. Since I met him, my expectations of men have been high, yet I've never met one even remotely as perfect as him.. so there became a void. Some people use support groups, friends, school, and other stuff to fill their voids.. I use men.'  /to be continued.                     A little girl, about 6 years old, slides out of the car, lunch box in hand and backpack on her shoulders. She smiles at her mom before closing the door. One of her front teeth is missing but she’s beaming, ready to go to her first day of school.   She slams the car door shut and turns, facing the school. She’s wearing a white long sleeved shirt, with a red dress over it, and Mary Janes covering her tiny feet. Her blonde hair is curled all around, it’s ringlets galore.   She tightens her hold on her lunch box and marches confidently up towards the school, walking around many kids, much taller than her, some even shorter. She finally reaches the line outside her class, which she has been instructed to wait at until the bell rings and the teacher comes out to let them in.  As she takes a place in line, she smiles around at her fellow 1st graders. But they weren’t looking at her. Everyone’s attention was directed down at her shiny black shoes. The smile remained on her face, not understanding why everyone was staring at her shoes.   A few giggles erupt from the mainly lines outside the schools, all eyes on her shoes. The smile slips from her face, still not understanding.   The bell rang suddenly, and everyone’s attention snapped to the door, being opened by the teacher with curly red hair. A smile was plastered on her face as she ushered the kids inside. But the little girl did not go inside; she stood there, eyebrows furrowed, looking down at her shoes.  The teacher, Mrs. Rowley, walked up to her and gently took her hand in her’s. “Come on inside, Jessica,” she said with soft grace. “You don’t want to be late.”  Eyebrows still furrowed, tears threatening to spill down her cheeks, she let go of the teacher’s hand. “Hold on.” She bent down and set her lunchbox on the gravel beneath her. She then quickly removed each black shoe, leaving her small feet covered only in white tights.   She stood up and took the teacher’s hand once more, hiding her confusion and sadness by putting on a small closed smile. As the teacher led her inside, she kept wondering what had been the cause of the staring and laughter not 5 minutes before.   Though she could not figure it out, she went the entire day with her Mary Janes in her backpack and borrowed sandals on her feet and only replaced her own shoes with the sandals when it was time to go home.  ***  I was compelled to write this once it popped in my mind on the way home from a restaurant earlier. It's a good writing exercise, I would say.                      Not until now have I noticed how similar little girls are. They each go through the same phase, which is funny.   There's the 'Everything Pink, Blue, or Purple' phase, where all they want is pink, blue, or purple things. Barbies, beddings, clothes, walls, ect. In this phase, which also lasts another phase or two, is the barbie or paper doll phase. Now, I remember when I was really little and would save up all my money to get a book of paper dolls. Weither it was Cinderella, Snow White, Beauty and the Beast, or Anastatia [which I personally loved the best], I loved paper dolls and bought them all. Just to put the paper clothes on the paper dolls, and make them walk and talk. I also, of course, had barbie dolls, though I was much more fascinated with the paper dolls. So there's that phase.  Then there's the 'Fake Make-Up, Princess Shoes' phase, where you get very into the plastic princess shoes and those little girl make-up kits with the dark purple, blue, red eyeshadow, and bright pink, purple, blue, white, red lipstick, and you just  can't  forget the blush! Assortments of INSANE colors to dress your face up with.. or your hands.. or the walls, it was just fun to play with.   Then there's the phase where they because the stereotyped 'sporty', 'tomboy', or 'girly'. Sporty is, of course, where sports are your main priority and something you'll love throughout your life. Tomboy is just.. being very hands on. Going outside all the time, playing, getting dirty, not wanting anything to do with pink or girly things.  And then there's Girly. Where nice girly colors are your favorite, and you like fashion with the dresses and the skirts and the extras. Not wanting to get dirty and just wanted to be very careful and lady-like.   There are phases in between, obviously, but these are the main three, I think.  My phases were [in order] Paper dolls, Barbies, Doll Houses, Princess Shoes, Fake Make-up, Britney Spears, Sporty, Rock, Dark Colors... you get the picture. Very different.   And then, once you're in your 'double digits', the adults that knew you as a child, be it somebody related or friends of the family, love to bring up the silly things you did and if it's completely different than your personality, you crinkle your face and make 'ich' sounds, while secretly becoming nestolgic and wondering what other things you did as a little kid.  Of course, these are only the female phases.                     Today I confirmed one of my long time suspisions. I'm afraid of time. Or.. I just hate it. Though, it's crazy, time is passing right now, but I hate time. I either want it to pass or just go so slowly so I can savor the moments.  Earlier today, I met somebody who made me realize this. His name is Kelly. After meeting him, we were walking down the street, passed the Los Altos Apt/Hotel building, and I got shaky in the knees and had to sit on the sidewalk for a second, replaying it all. I suddenly went into this total asshole person, angry that the time was over, the time of talking, the time of meeting, and visiting with this person. Someone who, I never had a clue that I'd meet. I never expected to. Maybe his brother but not him. You know how that is?  So.. maybe I'm afraid of time or of memory, or I just hate them both. Some people get extreme merriment or pleasure out of memories and are fine with the passing time, but I'm not. Sometimes I'll look back on memories and giggle, going 'oh that was fun, that was quite awesome!' but mostly it'll be 'why didn't I do that? what the hell was wrong with me? why did it have to be over so soon?'. I guess it's just the kind of person I am.  I can't stand it, either. I hate being an asshole when it comes around.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
