Anyways, now is not important.  I'm too busy worrying about getting old.  I already use anti-aging cream on my face, OK?  I am worried that my four/five month tanning salon stint last year did my skin in.  I shouldn't have done that.  Anyways, I hope I don't start looking old.  I also hope I don't start ACTING old....  as in like an old person, not old as in mature.  If anyone ever has to help me take a shit, take me out back and shoot me.  I also heard that working out too much makes your skin bad too!  YUCK!!  Like they showed Madonna, and she looks awful since she began that microbitic diet!  Well, I guess that was dieting, not exercise, but still, YUCK!!  Anyways, my media whore dreams are still alive and kickin' and I am beginning to plan my take over of the media!  BWAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Well, you might scoff at this now, but wait until I win my Oscar, and see what you think then!!!!!  I probably won't be there to accept my Oscar though, because the Oscars and Grammys are both pretty boring, but my disco inferno idea still stands.  Even though I don't know what a disco inferno is.    And I am pissed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  A true injustice has occured!!!!!!  Can you believe that Rob Marshall, who directed 'Chicago' beat Martin Scorsese for a Directors' Guild Award??  That means he will most likely win the Oscar for Achievement in Directing as well.  DAMMIT!!!!!!!!!!!  This is MARTIN SCORSESE people!!!!!!!!!!!!!  He needs to win.  I mean, he's sixty, he might not have much longer!!!!!!!!!!!  C'mon people!!!!  'Chicago' really isn't that great!!!!!!!!!!  GANGS OF NEW YORK on the other hand, is a materpiece, but then again, I'm only an eighth grader so I don't know too much.    Things that made my day good: 1. No homework!!! 2. Easy math!!! 3. Star Magazine 4. Peanut Butter Cap 'N Crunch  Things that made my day bad: 1. Liars, especially when I don't know what side is doing the lying 2. Slight 76 trouble  Quote of the day: You catch you child swearing. Do you wash his mouth out with soap? Or do you sit him down and explain that he'd better not fucking do it again? I think you know what to do'  --Conan O'Brien  THANK YOU FOR TAKING TIME OUT OF YOUR BUSY DAY TO LOOK AT MY SITE!!!!!!!!!!!!
