After a fiasco at Hollywood Video, I precededup to go to Blockbuster...then home where I locked myself in my roomand watched the movie on my computer while I worked on spreadsheets onmy laptop. I really enjoy watching really bad 'trash' as my parents call them,movies because they are stupidly gory, or idiotically funny.Seriously, the first scene was pretty good as Commies paratroop intoAmerica and citizens flee with their guns to defend America. Butfirst, the chances of America being invaded my evil paratroopers isabout the same as the chances of us being invaded by paratroopers isabout the same as being invaded by supermodels from Venus. On top ofit all to think that citizens can fight better than a trained militaryforce is absurd. Even a UN force could do better than most citizens.I found Bowling for Columbine much more touching and realistic. But what is by far the worst of this all is the idea that Americansneed to be able to own assault weapons for this kind of purpose. Inreality that gun is more likely to end up killing its owner than beingused against an invading force. Say that the invader was an armedburglar, even in that case would you be able to go get your gun fromthe safe and load it before someone determined to kill you succeeded.If you have to lock up a gun, its useless. If you leave it out,inevitably an accident will occur and someone will die. Really the only part of the movie that made me feel good, was then endwhen I accidentally played Greenday's 'Idiot America' causing me tolaugh and shriek like mad man at 1:30am. Sometimes I think that most republicans don't understand what theyvote for. They don't get reality. I once thought that the centristcounties that I live in were a safe haven from rightist and leftistidiocracy. Well it seems that 'idiot America' led by the Commander inChief of the idiots has invaded hallowed ground. That's right...Mr President Bush is in my school as I write this. I wishI was there, to heckle him , drill him on questioning, and show therest of my community where this idiot is taking our country. Today I call my self a patriot. Trying to fight the demons within.                      Few people understand how what they vote for when they go to polls...orso it seems. There are those that believe that private education isbetter than what the government could ever provide for its own people.Fine take your candy, but there are more imperative and effectingbattles to be fought. You don't have to raise spending for educationalsuccess, you just need to manage funds more efficiently, but what wecant do is continue to push jobs away from our shores with stupidpolices meant to benefit the few that are rich and policies that pushthe rest of the world away from us. Seriously, I wonder what those tax cuts will actually do to raise theeconomy...my answer...not enough. Seriously, you could do much better.Raise income taxes on the rich to generate revenue from the rich, thencut taxes...not on the poor, but on corporations and small businesses,to lower overhead opening up jobs and stemming the flow of jobsoverseas as operation in the US would become cheaper without lesseningthe quality of life.  cut taxes, not on the poor, but on corporations and smallbusinesses   Of course such a plan wouldn't really gain votes, though it seems tobe the only way that one could effectively raise an economy throughtax cuts. Better than banking on consumers not to stuff their taxrebate under a mattress. The same issue holds true for making friends. Even the strongest,smartest and richest people need allies and friends. The same holdstrue for nations. In this age when every bit of information counts,being friends with the weakest of countries might stave off aterrorist attack...so then why are we alienating France, Germany, Italy,and other countries who could make significant contributions tostopping the #1 security threat, terrorism. We might be the strongest,the richest and the overall best, but that doesn't mean that the restof the world is a worthless crump to wipe from our concerns, step onand leave behind. You can never know when a friend can be there tosave you.  You can never know when a friend can be there to save you.  So what angers me is that the President visited my school preachingmore money for the rich, no relief for the poor, insisting that wehave enough friends, because one is all that you would ever need.Really, it strikes me that it seems that the average student at myschool would have a better plan...at least for making friends. It seemsthat Bush isn't intelligent enough to set foot in Southridge. We cant continue to be in denial that we need others. We need torealize that nobody can go it alone. Not the rich man on the corner.Not the United States. John Kerry seems to know all of this promisingto roll back Bush's tax cuts and offer small businesses relief.Promising to mend relations with other countries around the world.Bush? He promises more tax cuts for the wealthy, wars, and the deathof American power...all because he dreams of being the lone cowboyromanticized by American Culture in the age in which he grew up.                      Looking back at all of the songs that have rested in the spot of'favorite song' over the past year I can see that they have twodistinct themes: Politics and longing. Of all of these songs only onewas without words, 'Hero's Dream' the last classical song thatoccupied that spot. It seems that the classical genre is the last of adying art of true music.  . It seems that the classical genre is the last of a dyingart of true music.  Why? Because today many of us care about how the song relates to us.We don't like to admit it but its true. And sadly the moving chordsthat stir such deep thoughts rarely accomplish this goal.But the rest of the songs seem to be divided. But the songs of longinglike those by Blink and Bare naked Ladies didn't stand at the top ofthe list for very long. For me the songs that last are those that arethe ones that give me a message. Like the Stradovarious song 'SoldiersPrayer'. As I became more and more opposed to the war in Iraq as therationale was proved to be false, the deaths of the soldiers for noreal benefit to the US angered me. They had been betrayed and itseemed that song was the embodiment of it. Likewise as I have learnedto loathe the conservative, America wasting policies of the currentgovernment and mainstream America that seems to care amore aboutrhetoric, the President's wife, and which celebrity just married adonkey,  Greenday's 'Idiot America' seems to resonate with me. I can't help thinking that life would be better of only people wouldopen their eyes and take a look outside their own insulated lives.LOOK at what havoc our greed can cause, look what your need to have_______ (item) does to people around the world. I guess I just want people to pay attention more to the 'now' and bemore observant. Look at the world through your song, hopefully itresonates with you.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
