  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic:\n\n                 hey, peeps.  you know what, my dear reader my friend?  i love you.  that might sound corny and/or weird and/or unrealistic, but really properly analyzed it's not.  i love all living beings on general principles.  and i recommend that as a good way to be.  what does it mean that i love you, even not particularly knowing you well?  it means that i recognize you as a precious living being, deserving of happiness and its causes and deserving to overcome suffering completely.  it doesn't mean i know you personally and approve of your every characteristic.  i don't have to to love you as i do.  i wish you every happiness and no suffering at all.  a word of advice:  avoid malice like the plague.  i've decided that malice is the root cause of every suffering.  don't invest yourself in malice, even in subtle ways.  and don't fear malice.  by that i mean neither be afraid of (fear) malice nor obey (fear) malice.  and by malice i mean the wish and/or intention that someone suffer, in whatever way in whatever degree, be that yourself or someone else.  never punish yourself, cause that's a form of malice and you'll suffer for it.  and *noone* deserves to suffer.  dangerous people deserve to be quarantined so they don't harm people, but they don't deserve to be punished in the sense of being made to suffer.  imagine what the world would be like without any malice at all!  seriously, imagine it.  think about it.  invest your energy like that into making the world free from malice.  even those *thoughts* actually help, i promise!  thought power is a very real thing, and it has a greater effect upon oneself and others than most of us have been trained to imagine.  use it well.  use it joyfully to abandon malice in all of its forms.  i *promise* you you'll be making good karma that way and *will* be rewarded.  invest yourself well into the abandonment of malice and you'll be rewarded mightily.  this is no exaggeration.  the reward might take a while to reach you, but it *will* come.  this is a total promise.  we *can* eliminate malice, and we *will* eliminate malice.  this is a vow of mine as well as a promise.  so, dear reader dear friend, remember that i love you.  and write to me if you need a friend, 'cause i vow that i'll be as good a friend to you as circumstances make practical.  l8rz...                        'k, peeps, i've changed the 'contact' button into an 'email david' button and removed some links that blogger automatically put in that i just don't need to have on my site.  i need to learn html, dammit...  but i'm a quick study, so that's okay.  just did my exercise for the morning, half an hour on the treadmill.  yesterday i got the rowing machine taken up from the basement and put in my bedroom, and started using it.  the treadmill is fine for my legs and for general cardiovascular training and weight loss, but the rowing machine will help me with my arms and upper body generally.  like i say, i'm gonna get myself into top physical shape.  plus i'll start doing isometric exercises today too, and i expect to start doing some weight training sometime soonish.  and once i get myself into top physical condition i'm gonna keep that up for the rest of my life, make a lifelong habit of it.  whatever boyfriend/s i have along the way will be pleased, and besides i'll just feel better in every relevant way.  have i told you that i'm very available right now?  anyway, blog atcha l8r.  i luv u,  my readers my friends.                        dear reader my friend, what do we humans really know about especially the long-term effects of all these artificial junks we create?  we weren't evolved to know how to deal with them.  that goes for artificial food additives, other stupid sorts of chemicals, genetically modified foods and organisms, etc.  one of the stupidest things we're doing is tampering with organisms' genetics.  'life will find a way,' to quote from 'jurassic park,' and it's just plain dangerous!  we honestly only *imagine* we know what we're doing when we do that.  we *don't* know the long-term effects of these g.m. organisms upon the ecosystem long-term.  nor do we know the long-term effects upon it of the various new chemicals we produce and dump everywhere.  why are we so blind and unthinking and even uncaring?  it makes no sense.  it's poisonous attitudes that are to blame, of course, things like greedy attachment, malice and (especially willful) ignorance, pride, superstition, and all those, which are called 'kleshas' in buddhism.  according to buddhism these kleshas have been with us, partially dominating us, from beginningless time.  personally i don't think it's worth blaming anyone, because it's only that we've been dominated by these bad patterns which we *wouldn't* allow ourselves to be dominated by if we were *really* aware of their effects upon our happiness and suffering levels.  we need to clear our judgments from these bad patterns if we are to overcome them, which we definitely *can* do.  some people have done it thoroughly, some people more partially, but it *can* be done and it *must* be done, by humanity en masse and generally by all sentient beings en masse throughout the universe/multiverse/all.  it's a big task, but i vow to you that it shall be done.  then we'll have a permanent golden age in real life.  i vow it to you.  nothing is ultimately more important to me than accomplishing that and then enjoying the results forever.  it's a serious vow, so hold me to it (in a reasonable fashion of course).  i've found that the best sources of information about the nature of reality which are practical for building *real* personal strict knowledge upon are theosophy, buddhism, and modern science, in terms of overcoming blindness and the kleshas in general and coming to know the reality of our situation firsthand.  some of the results are in my certain experience surprising and strange, especially how very psychological natural processes generally seem to be.  mind is heavily involved in every phenomenon which has any meaningful existence, and it can be quite surprising to have true revelations about this.  and it can be highly *useful* to come to know this stuff firsthand, i know from my own experience.  it's a universe of *living* energy/matter/sensation which is gradually learning how to make itself (all of us, that is) thoroughly happy.  our happiness (its happiness) is most definitely the one central aim of it all.  even our blunders we make imagining they'll make us happier.  because the whole thing shares a wish for perfect (implying unalloyed and permanent) happiness, and because it's developing better and better intelligence, and because some beings have already achieved their individual perfections, there's real hope for us all in the long run, very real actual hope for us all to be quite happy together forever someday in actuality.  just think about it, eh?  l8r...      \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
