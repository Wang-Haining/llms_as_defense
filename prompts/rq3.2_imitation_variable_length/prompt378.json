I'm part of a group of students acting as summer chaplains at a hospital in one of the Chicago suburbs.  So I'm on duty right now and I feel like I'm getting my 'meet-and-greet-mojo' back.  For about 2 weeks, I've been sad-sacking around, feeling listless and barely able to do the minimum number of visits I'm responsible for.  But it looks like the lamentable days have passed for now.  CPE has been an amazing experience.  I still struggle with the concept of meeting up with 15+ people a day, 4 days a week.   Introverts everywhere cringe in solidarity   But, I'm getting back the strength to do it.  I'm not sure if I lost my mojo due to stress or just midpoint blahs.  But it's good to not feel like a total slack-ass at this anymore.  It's ridiculously draining to do CPE, but it's supposed to be like that.  Being at this hospital and accompanying people and friends and family on this part of their journey is an incredibly humbling experience.  I think this solidifies for me that I'm meant to be in ordained ministry, but that I'm also someday working toward a pencil-neck job.  As much as I love people and I love interaction, I think the bulk of my being will be happiest as a desk jockey.  As much as I hated getting my business degree, I still think if I had done it in management - especially non-profit - I'd be much happier with it.  I think that's my calling.  When it comes to CPE, I feel like my perfect fit would be coming up with a system of deploying chaplains at a hospital and possibly helping them process their experiences rather than being out on the floor myself.  That said, I also hope to do CPE when I take a sabbatical during my 9th year of ministry.  I think taking my 9th year off from the parish (or whatever office I'm residing in) for a sabbatical and ending it with a summer full-unit of CPE would be a good way to reflect on ministry and my call in prep for my 10th anniversary of ordination.  So, CPE sites in the summer of 2017, watch for my application to darken your doorstep.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
