In fact, similar debates have been raging in London for almost 2000 years.  In Roman London, this controversy first reared its head after the unveiling of a new mosaic of the fall of Carthage at the forum. Its depiction of the violence inflicted on the stricken city was said to be graphic, and within a week a man was found two street away cut into half-inch squares. The mosaic was swiftly covered up.  Another notable instance was the infamous furore that surrounded the growing popularity of  urlLink magic lantern picture shows  in the 1830s. At one particular establishment - Messrs Lagrange And Their Coloured Light Amazeum - a show entitled 'Mrs X Walks Her Dogs' is believed to have sparked a craze for dog ownership - a harmless enough pursuit, you might think, until you consider that the show ran as an unending loop and thus led to several cases of exhaustion and The Vapours.  Indeed the Lagranges' establishment seems to have courted controversy. A showing entitled 'The Wronged Customer Wreaks His Bloody Revenge' was accused of directly leading to the Umbrella Salesmen Massacre of 1839. The Lagranges hotly contested this claim, but undermined their case by following The Wronged Customer with an attraction called 'The Satisfied Customer Gives The Lagrange Brothers All Their Money'.  We shall not linger long on the Punch & Judy killings of the 1890s but to say that the culprit was almost certainly a man in a crocodile suit rather than an actual crocodile, all shows at the time carried clear warnings that that was  not  the way to do it, and that the murderer's modus operandi led directly to important safety laws that finally banned the inclusion of six-inch nails and lead shot in sausages.  On a related note,  the world’s first clockwork orange  was shown at the Great Exhibition in 1851. The spring-driven geared citrus could be an orange at three different speeds, easily adjustable by switch, and only needed winding every four hours. It was a popular success, easily outselling Stevenson’s Patent Steam-Piston Pear, which had a tendency to overheat.                 75 Beak Street, Soho, is now a slightly mad Bistro, but until 1861 it was the home of Doctor Bleasdale's Temperance Vomitorium, the last of the great Emetic Cults. It is believed that these mysterious establishments sprang from the coffee-house culture of the 18th century, specifically after an ill-fated experiment with pig's milk at an establishment in Cheapside had unexpectedly explosive and colourful side-effects.   By Victoria's reign, Emetic Cults had risen in tandem with the Temperance movement, in that they encouraged abstinence by permitting patrons to drink until the inevitable occurred.  urlLink Dickens  mentions them in Dombey and Son:   The next morning, refreshed after a visit to Bleasdale's purging-house the previous evening, Dombey again returned his attention to the matter of Paul and Florence ...  Sadly, by 1855 these unusual establishments had fallen from favour and by 1860 only Bleasdale's remained. On the centenary of its closure in 1963, Westminster council attempted to re-establish it, only to fail when three aldermen were hospitalised.                 Wren wasn't the only one to have grand designs for this fair city. In 1951 architect and intellectual Thaddeus Roshanak unveiled his new for a rebuilt London to a breathless crowd in Methodist Central Hall. Roshanak was an arch-modernist and his plan displayed the clear influence of Le Corbusier's  urlLink Plan Voisin  for Paris, but was far, far more radical.  Under Plan Thaddeus, Central London from Ludgate to Bayswater and from Charing Cross to Regent's Park would be demolished. In its place would rise a new, modern city of gleaming white towers and broad, straight avenues. The railway stations would be combined into a new 72-platform central station, linked by tram to  urlLink Paddington Airport , where Oxford Circus now is.  So far, so predictably Corbusier-style. But Roshanak's genius went further. None of his new streets would have corners, which he despised, and would thus only run east-west. Pedestrian traffic would be carried by looping travelators arranged in a stylised form of the  urlLink coat of arms of the Royal Institute of British Architects . In a nod to the city's destroyed heritage, the 40-storey residential and business tower blocks of the centre would be thatched. The central station would only accomodate inbound trains in order to promote tourism. And the new city would be entirely nuclear-powered, with each flat and office having its own reactor.  Understandably, the radical plan met with a mixed response. The National Trust called it 'barbaric'. The Royal Fine Arts Commission wanted to know if it was 'some kind of sick joke'. Malcolm Muggeridge praised its 'excellent benches'. And the  Evening Standard  was so horrified it refused to come out for four days.  In the end, Roshanak lost his fight for the plan and it was consigned to the dustbin of history. Intensely disillusioned, Roshanak quit architecture and became a freelance mermaid.                 Netto Ockwell was born in a disease-ridden swamp south of the Thames in 863 ( urlLink map ). He rose to prominence in 885 after his shirt fell apart during a drinking competition and he preached a fiery sermon on the spot about the importance of low-cost clothes.  Despite having no religious training from the church, or indeed any training at all, he rapidly acquired a following thanks to his vehement and often expletive-laden sermons in the area - mostly on no particular subject other than the audience being 'fuckers', which was believed to be an imprecation against the sin of fornication - and his habit of falling into a deep meditative trance at about 8pm every evening until noon the next day. Thanks to his diminutive stature, he acquired the nickname 'Little Ockwell' ('Lidl Ockwell' in old English).  Reports of his demise vary. Some of his more ardent supporters claim he was burned at the stake by the church for heresy. Others claim he set himself on fire demonstrating one of the cheap lighters he was attempting to sell. All accounts agree, however, that he miraculously exploded and was consumed by flames within seconds - possibly a byproduct of the enormous quantity of lamp oil he drank.  Although he was never officially beatified by the Vatican, the area became known as 'Saint Ockwell's'. This became 'St. Ockwell' in 1705, and by 1840 was commonly abbreviated to 'Stockwell', the name it bears today.                 London has been the venue for many pioneering public health schemes over the years, ranging from  urlLink John Snow's work to identify the causes of Cholera  to  urlLink Bazalgette's construction of the sewer system . But for every breakthrough in public health, there have been numerous horrible failures. Here we list the top 10.  10.  Typhoid: Nature's Beautician for Healthy Skin.  Pamphlet, 1871.  9.  Dr Feniloe's Radium and Lead Cutlery.  Withdrawn 1894.  8.  Barking Spa.  Renamed 'Northern Outfall Sewage Works', 1904.  7.  The Killer In Your Home: Why Privies Belong At The Bottom Of The Garden.  Book, first and only edition dated 1922.  6.  Lawnmower Repairs For The Under-Fives.  Book, pulped 1971.  5.  Botulicks.  Popular frozen-milk snack until 1959.  4.  Our Friend Anthrax.  Government film produced 1952, shown twice.  3  AIDS: It'll Probably Go Away By Itself.  Pamphlet, withdrawn 1982.  2.  The Daily Mail.  Various stories including 'New Asylum Seeker Breast Cancer Threat to House Prices', 'Flirting: The Cancer Connection' and 'Did Nostradamus Predict BSE Using The Bible Code?', 1971-2004 and on.  1.  The Rat Diet.  Controversial nutrition advice until 1348.                 'Moquette' is the robust, deep-pile material used to cover the seats on the London Underground and on London buses.   For many years these seats were simple wooden benches. When the decision was made to upgrade to padded seats, the Royal Geographical Society despatched explorers to points throughout the British Empire to find a material tough enough to withstand the rears of thousands of Londoners.  The breakthrough was made by Sir Magnus Larchwood in south-west Africa. In 1923 he discovered a species called the moquette (a relation of the  urlLink meerkat ) that had checked fur in a variety of striking colours, notably orange, purple, blue and brown. A trade in the moquette was set up and Tubes were furbished with their hides.   Sadly, such was the demand for moquette skins that the native population quickly dwindled. The ranks of this noble beast were further eroded after the second world war when they fell prey to Wrigley's Disease, a malady spread by discarded chewing gum. The last moquette died in captivity at the Royal College of Fashion in 1974 during a desperate attempt to equip the new Jubilee Line.                 It's a common misconception that time constraints and greedy developers confounded  urlLink Christopher Wren 's plan for the rebuilding of London after the 1666 Great Fire ( urlLink here ). This is not true.  The real story is rather more mysterious. After hearing that the city fathers were minded to approve his grandiose plans, Wren went on a terrific all-night drinking session with Robert Hooke. After drinking some twelve pints of Old Vituvius Ale - which he and Hawksmoor arranged into the secret twelve-cornered hexagon of the Masonic God Jabulon (or something) - he passed out and rolled under the table.  When the next day came, he awoke to discover not only that he was late for the meeting that would formally endorse his plan, but also that Hooke had spilt beer all over it. The ink was running quite badly, but there was no time to do it again, so Wren attempted to fill in the gaps and repair it while on the way to Westminster.  A combination of the rubble-strewn streets and an attack of the morning-after shakes meant his new version of the plan possessed few of the clean, crisp lines of the original. Nevertheless, his plan was approved and  urlLink remains the basic layout  of the city of London today.                  From 1880 on, open-air vertical lidos were very popular in London. Requiring little more than some water, a tiled surface and a large diving platform to erect, they sprang up across the city and attracted great crowds.  The largest and most lavish was in St John's Wood. The Wellington Road Vertical Swimming Ponds and Spa was centred around a 45 feet-high cube of freestanding water that visitors could dive into from the tallest diving platform in the world or walk into at ground level. But you had to be careful once inside, because a nasty fall could result if you fell out of the side.  It was, of course, most popular in summer, when people could pay their penny and just stroll in for a refreshing dip, but it froze into a solid block of ice in winter. Nevertheless, it could still be seen surrounded by small children, either because their tongues were stuck to it or, in the bitter winter of 1948, because they were admiring the lithe body of Walter Samuels, who loved the lido so much that he refused to come out and had to wait until the spring thaw of 1949.  Unfortunately, the growing popularity of 'baths' or 'pools' eroded the visitor-base of the vertical lidos and one by one they closed. The Wellington Road was the last, and only closed in 1957 after it was found to breach section 1.1a of the new planning act, 'Gravity: Compliance with'. But even today you can meet people who'll tell up they regularly 'swam up the Wellington'.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
