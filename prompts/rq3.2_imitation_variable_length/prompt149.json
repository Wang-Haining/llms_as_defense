Frankly I expect more from&nbsp;the former National Security Advisor to Clenis.&nbsp; Yes, they are only copies of the original documents, documents that he probably helped create.&nbsp; And on can argue that maybe because of this, Berger, in a lapse of judgment, didn't see it as a violation to walk out with them.&nbsp; But that excuse is simply not good enough.&nbsp; 'My&nbsp;bad' doesn't cut it when you are at his level.&nbsp;   But I refuse to believe that he hide documents in his socks.&nbsp; That is completely absurd.&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the individuals that work at the Archives who reported that is what they saw, why didn't CNN question them.&nbsp;    CNN :&nbsp; So you witnessed Sandy Berger remove documents from the Archives?   ANON : Yes, he stuffed some papers in his jacket, pants, and socks.   CNN :&nbsp;You mean he placed papers in his pockets and what he couldn't fit there he rolled up his pants leg, pulled back his socks, and crammed what he could there as well?   ANON : Yeah, pathetic isn't it, he must have really wanted to hide something bad.   CNN : Well, I suppose so.&nbsp; If I saw him do this it would really make me wonder what would make him go to such lengths to hide.&nbsp; Didn't you wonder, didn't it make you raise your eyebrows?   ANON :&nbsp; Yes, very much so.&nbsp; His actions were near treason.   CNN :&nbsp; And you just let him walk out the door, after watching him stuff his pockets?   ANON:  Yes.   CNN : And socks?   ANON :&nbsp; Well, um, yes.   CNN :&nbsp; And it didn't occur to you to call security then, to stop him at the door?   ANON : Um, well.......   CNN :&nbsp; Well, why didn't you stop him?   ANON :&nbsp; Well, because I'm a douchbag.   This is why I hate reporters.&nbsp; They want a lead so bad, they talk to anyone and print anything.&nbsp; No matter how stupid it sounds, no questions asked.   This is why I hate reporters.&nbsp; They are all douchbags.                    I really don't read Michelle Malkin much as she makes me feel dirty.  And I'm not talking about Christina Aguilera dirty, oh no, it's much worse than that.  In her new book,  urlLink  In Defense of Internment:  Why all foreigners are filthy dogs  The Case for 'Racial Profiling',   she outlines why putting the Japanese in camps during WWII was necessary (I haven't read the book, but I bet it has to do something with Pearl Harbor and them being our enemy or something, but that's just a guess).  Here are some highlights:     What the West Coast relocation centers were really like: tens of thousands of ethnic Japanese were allowed to leave; hundreds voluntarily chose to move in -- and many residents even protested their closing!  You see, they could have left anytime they wanted, is not like there was a  urlLink chain link fence with barbed wire  or anything keeping them there.   they were nothing at all like the Nazi death camps to which they are often compared by craven and opportunistic alarmists on the Left.   To be fair, she is right.  It's not like we gassed them or anything.  But those standards are a bit low, I think.  When you have the very agency in charge of the relocation  urlLink stating  that that the housing provided was 'subnormal and probably always will' and that they were nothing more than 'tarpaper-covered barracks of simple frame construction without plumbing or cooking facilities of any kind. [...] one bath, laundry, and toilet building shared by upwards of 250 people.' It doesn't sound all that great either.   Another forgotten bit of history: the February 1942 Japanese attack on Goleta, California -- the first foreign attack on the U.S. mainland since the War of 1812   This is an interesting, sure.  But all the ship did was fire a small gun shooting up a wooden pier.   Like the  urlLink Fu-Go  weapons, it could have been worse, something that we should all be thankful wasn't.  But this is more of trivia type information than anything else, and these actions were understandable as we were at war.  So what's her point?    Only that she's a racist bigot, like those that support her.  The worst thing is, they can get away with this because she's  urlLink Asian .                 I went to Craig’s List for the first time ever.  It’s pretty cool because I often have useless things of which I must dispose.  I also found out that it’s easy to find a sexual mate on this list.  The people are pretty skanky, though, and I think that there are a small number of people who keep on putting the same thing up.  Either they are big fans or just really desparate, it’s anyone’s guess.  My new favorite show is 90210…again!  I just found out that it shows on FX, and ever since then I have been avidly following the crazy adventures of Dylan, Brendan, David, and company.  I’m so glad that Brenda got booted from the show.  Regardless of being a bitch and a bad actress, she was also quite homely.  Andrea Zuckerman was trash, too.  She never belonged on that show, and outlived her pitiful usefulness quite some time ago.  Maybe I’m getting too involved in this.  In the process of trying to think of witty things to put in for the rest of the day, I have failed miserably.  I think that this means I am not as funny or as clever as I usually think I am.                 From  urlLink Rittenhouse Review  (who was notified by someone else) comes this  urlLink article  from the Baltimore Sun.  But before I explain why I find it worthy to note, there are two other things I want to say to my legion of readers.  First, Jim runs a great blog.  The kind I would love to have, but for several reasons I can't.  Partly because for me to even put up one post may take up to an hour or more, and as I work two jobs, that is time that I don't have.  And also due to the fact  that I lack original ideas.  As much as I'm interested in politics, I'm constantly amazed at how little I know.  But that's why I travel to other blogs online, giving me the opportunity to steal their ideas and present them to my peers as my own.  Jim is a skilled writer (although at times I want to sneak into his house at night and pry off that comma key), a talent that eludes me.    Secondly I really don't read newspapers very often, not even online.  While young my family subscribed to The Aegis (a third rate rag even by local county newspaper standards) and the Baltimore Sun.  My Dad ended the subscription to the Sun when the delivery guy kept tossing it into the mud instead of putting it in the box.  This happened when I was eight or so, and at the point my reading interests had yet to surpassed the comic section.  I'm really not sure what this paragraph is about or going so I'll get back to the article at hand.  I, as you might have guessed by now, live in Baltimore City.  While today's kids might call it Charm City, when I was growing up it was, and always will be to me, The City That Reads (even if it is closing library branches on a regular basis).  That means that I live in Maryland too, a state that is not considered a  urlLink swing state  .  However, upon googling, I  urlLink found  that since 1948, out of the 14 elections that were held, Maryland electoral votes went to a republican 42% of the time (6 times).  Votes went to Reagan in 1984 and his sidekick Bush Sr. in 1988.  This doesn't seem as likely now to happen as the popular vote gap between Republicans vs. Democrats has widen since 1988 to favor Democrats to a safe degree.  Hence, we are not a swing state.      That is why I voted for Nader in 2000.  I knew he would make a lousy president, but that was the beauty of it, he wasn't going to become president.  I think it's important to support a third party candidacy, giving another voice a chance in hope that the voice leads to some kind of change.  During the 2000 election I felt both candidacies, Gore and Bush, where two men trying to sell the same platform.  I didn't see a big difference between the Democratic and Republican parties.  Which frankly, I feel that in the grand scheme of things, they aren't all that different.  Both parties have sold out long ago to the highest bidders and are very good at getting very little done.   But Bush is different.  He has done things that I thought the shackles of bureaucracy would have stopped.  I know that 9/11 changed everything, primarily causing the Democrats to put their tail between their legs and form a puddle on the floor.  But I'm still amazed at what he was allowed to get away with.  And that's why I'm voting for Kerry.  Even though he has Maryland in the bag, I'm throwing my support behind him.     And I wish Nader would see this too.  He can still fight and try to change things for the better, but running for President is not the way to go.    'I'm going to take more votes away from Bush than from Kerry,' he claims. Yet the overwhelming majority of polls say just the opposite. And by selecting a vice presidential candidate who will be anathema to conservatives, Mr. Nader indicated that defeating Mr. Bush is actually quite low on his list of priorities.                       A day after Cheney  urlLink claims  al-Qaida was linked to Saddam, we learn via Drudge that the 911 commission  urlLink reports  no credible ties with al-Qaida were found.      'Bin Laden is said to have requested space to establish training camps, as well as assistance in procuring weapons, but Iraq apparently never responded,' the report said. 'There have been reports that contacts between Iraq and al-Qaida also occurred' after bin Laden moved his operations to Afghanistan in 1996, 'but they do not appear to have resulted in a collaborative relationship,' it said.  'Two senior bin Laden associates have adamantly denied that any ties existed between al-Qaida and Iraq,' the report said.       Drudge, who is a massive tool, finds Dan Rather giving Clinton new book five stars far more shocking, locating the 911 commission blurb off to the side.  Of course, seeing how Drudge's readership is 87% Clinton-Hating-Conservatives (okay, I made that statistic up) his headline priorities are legitimate.  Honestly, this all leads me to believe that the only way the Bush apparatchiks would question Dear Leader's actions was if Bush pulled Clinton up on stage and started to make out with him.  What does Bush have to do to lose their vote?         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
