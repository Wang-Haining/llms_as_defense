I am officially done with hockey for the rest of the summer..:'( ...tear...I tried skating today without taping my knee though. It wasn't like fantastic, but tons better than I had expected! I am getting better at my slap shot I can lots of times shoot it about a foot off the ground now, but I need to work on it more over the summer. Yesterday I helped move things out of my sister's old apartment back home. It was really fun because she had this old chair she was going to throw away so my Dad threw it down the stairs outside her apartment. Then my brother and I totally ripped it apart and were throwing parts of it around. Chad also attempted riding a broken bike. It was greeeat. Then we got home and had Godfather's pizza..mmmm...my favorite....!!! Earlier that day I went to my brother's double header for baseball. They split. But they were both very good games. Today I didn't really do anything at all. I just stayed in my room...should've vacumed..darn...haha. OMG today my cat almost dissapeared! You know those openings you have on your wall they're called cold air exchanges...they're usually near the floor and like little vents. Anywho..my cat, Max, almost went down it! If he had gone down into it he could be walking around in our house where we wouldn't be able to get him!...He would've been walking around in those silver metal tunnels like people do on TV. Only we probably wouldn't of been able to get Max out! Well my mom saw him (she was painting) and had to pull him out by his tail then his back legs. And of course he's hissing and getting really mad that she was doing that. But she had to! That was kinda icky though! He's been crabby all day now. Then I went to hockey and on the way home got an ice cream at Culvers. It was a grand ol' time! Well that's about it. Zanik's FINALLY coming over tomorrow..yay..Well byebye! love yas!--kirsten                          For anyone who reads this and doesn't know...Zanik and I broke up a few days ago. Its been hard no doubt. But I called him yesterday and we talked and we're good now, we discussed why we did. I think we're good friends now. SO nobody feel sorry for me or anything--I'm fine and we're good! Yesterday I went to the Twin's game against the Anaheim Angels. I had a blast! I bought a new MN twins necklace that I just adore. Of course though, the game that I go to is the one they lose of their series...8-3. But that don't matter to me. I enjoyed every moment of it. I love watching them play baseball so much! Tonight I'm going to participate in the Relay for Life. It starts in about an hour so I can't talk forever. Earlier today I went to the track at about ten AM to set up luminaree bags for the event. I helped spell out HOPE on the bleachers with bags and I broke candles apart--to all who did that as well..OW! ....they know what I mean. I got a big sunburned too...whoops. I am downloading songs right now. It's taking a long time. I have about seven now...YAY! Next week captain's practices start for Volleyball all week 9-11 o' clock. I'm kinda excited to go to that to see people and just be doing some sort of sport again. I cannot wait for hockey though. I love hockey SO much. That'll start toward the end of October though. Well that's all I'm going to write for now I think. I need to go eat before I leave and make sure I have everything! Bye! love ya guys--kikster                                   Hey everyone! I guess I haven't written in here for so long! Well I thought I did..guess not! I have so much to talk about. Well let's see I am very proud and excited for myself. Some of you know why, if you don't just ask ;)! Yesterday I went over to Mal's to practice pitching. I really needed the practice of course. I did kinda bad, hope ya didn't mind Mal! LOVE YA! We just hung around while it was raining hoping mostly that we wouldn't have a game for reason I choose not to say. Too bad we had one...oh well it was okay. Most of ya on my team know though! Today I went shopping it was fun! I got a new swimsuit that well it makes me feel comfortable! The bottom is like a miniskirt, but it's a suit! It's SO cute I love it! I got some other stuff too. I just don't feel like explaining EVERYTHING! Now all I need is to tan! I am now deciding to run 1/2 a mile every other day. See I've already done it twice, I run a lap around my circle, then walk a lap for a total of one mile. I know it isn't much, but it's just because I'm out of shape since my surgery I need to get back into shape for hockey. Also it'll help my knee lots! I am also practicing pitching, which I need to do! Oh I got my pictures from the last day of school back today! They're so funny! Like Tara (Hill) is doing her fun pose in like ALL of them, it's so funny! Also some of you know my infamous 'Seducing the Camera' pic right? Well Zanik did one for me and I have a picture of it! Oh gosh it's SO funny! He looks so cute! I guess it's more of an inside joke between a few of us (Mal, Mindy, Zanik, and I) but it's funny OK! LAUGH! Oh a few days ago my cat, Blackjack, had a seizure. Ya that was kinda scary, but he's fine now! THANK GOODNESS! Uhhh...well I guess that is all I have to share. Talk to yas later---love you all! KIKSTER                                 I had kind of a scare yesterday. Zanik called me at like 3:30ish yesterady and that is NOT his normal time usually he calls at 8:45 on the dot! So I was kind of like..ok...? He was like ya.. my house got struck by lightning or something, I really couldn't hear him he was quiet and talking quick so I was just like ya..uhu...It turns out though it hit his phone line or whatever, but the funny part is that he had JUST gotten his computer fixed and was talking on it the day before and now like right away it's like completely fried. I'm kind of sad though that he can't talk online with me but..oh well..The homerun derby is tonight I watch through Round 2 then I got really bored with it so I'm like psh screw that! Tomorrow I'm gonna work at pizza ranch for the Relay for Life bussing tables or whatnot. I'm only gonna be there an hour or so but BE THERE PEOPLE! support us! lol...I only have two more hockey practices left. I have to be sure to work on my shot and stuff during the summer and stuff. Volleyball starts in August, I'm kind of confused. Do I wear my knee brace? and if I do where do I put my knee pad? So many questions! lol the county fair is coming up soon! I'm so excited lol. Well I'm going to go everyone much love--kiksten--that's a new one lol                                  My Twins won today! :) I am so incredibly happy about that! They swept the White Sox, first time since 2001, but hey we don't need to flaunt that fact. That really helped us tremendously now we have a much better position in first place. We needed to win as many games as possible considering the teams that we'll be playing: Oakland, Red Sox, Angels, Yankees. Doug STILL hasn't been traded---but Justin Morneau still played today--He had an interesting game. He really hit two home runs. BUT the stupid umpires changed their mind TWICE. They just shouldn't do that to young Morneau. Teasing him like that...lol. Hunter got a homerun which made me smile because the crowd has been booing him lately so I just thought---take that and shove it where the sun don't shine CHICAGO! In the first game he tagged up from third on a sac fly and to get home safely he knocked down the Sox's catcher REAL hard. The guys suffered a mild concussion--haha WHOOPS! Thankfully Hunter got home safely! However, the rest of the series the fans gave him a hard time by booing him and whatnot. If I was him and like over twenty-five THOUSAND people were booing ME I would cry--lol. I didn't do much today. Not much TO do. Cept watch the Twins game of course. The last week has kinda blowed but ya whatever! I think I'm going to get going now that's all the Twins jazz I'm gonna share for today if you wanna know the WHOLE story of the win which i know you ALL do go to  urlLink www.twinsbaseball.com  !! I know you wanna! LOL--well I'm outty---kikstas                                   I am officially resigning from pitching. And if you are on my softball team and are hearing this for the first time I want you to get the whole story. I am not kidding when I said I am through with pitching, cuz I really am. I can't stand it anymore. I've had enough.  My reasons for quitting are these:  1. My knee surgery has been hard on me. I am unable to do what I know I'm capable of doing. I hold back and I'm not as confident. I'm nowhere near as good as I was last year.  2. Only a few of you know what I'm talking about when I say it's so much pressure being out there on the mound. You HAVE to pitch strikes, no duh. Everyone is watching you. I also can't tune people out: Blair, fans, the other team. I just can't seem to do it like I do in hockey.  3.I'm sick of having people judging me when I'm pitching. If I do something wrong, I know it. I'm not the only one who makes mistakes and you ALL know that! I would like to see you guys go out there pitch, then be ready right after the release. Believe it or not, it ISN'T easy!   I also have reasons why I didn't want to quit or didn't quit earlier:  1. I don't want to let the other pitchers down. Especially Jen cuz I know she pitches a lot as it is. I feel bad that I'm giving her and Janine that huge load. Who knows, maybe they'll appreciate it though..??  2. I don't want to let my teammates down. I know that I'm not a great pitcher, but I don't want them to think that I'm a quitter! I'm not, I've just realized that this isn't my thing anymore and I'm sorry if you have a problem with that.  3. You know what position has grown on me? OUTFIELD! I really want to play it. It's not as much of a pressure spot but you still get some action. I know most of you think that's a stupid position, but guess what it'll be important eventually and I think that's a great position for me.   *******I feel bad that I'm quitting because I've been a pitcher for so long. I would like to thank all of you who have been there and helped me. I feel bad, like I've been a complete waste of time for you guys. I do appreciate it though, thanks.               \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
