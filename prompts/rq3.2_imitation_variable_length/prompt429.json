It helps me to cover multiple topics. Yesterday, I made my long overdue stop at Barnes and Noble, and picked up some assigned reads that will actually be enjoyable.  Although I must say, now that I've read 7 more pages of 'Dune', I'm considering reconstructing it's formerly-charred-hectagonal-vertices (see post below).  I can live with it. To continue, I purchased 'A Walk Across America', about a man who decides to walk across America.  Hence the title.  I also bought 'Hiroshima', and 'Days of Grace', Arthur Ashe's memoir.  I wanted to pick up 'I Me Mine', and I even was interested in David Sedaris's new book, but I was limited to my purchases. I have gone swimming every day this week for atleast an hour.  Pruny-finger-mania.  And I thought I'd have more to say about the Endless Swim, but I don't.  Float on, y'all.                          Hello.... Nashvile is home now.&nbsp; Officially. For good.&nbsp; For all eternity.&nbsp; For serious.&nbsp; Before we left to drive down here, my mom got me  a ghost is born  (Wilco), and it is  now  one of my favorite CDs.&nbsp; I would also like to give Gracias-es to Kirstein, who gave my sister a mix CD, which I claimed as my own.&nbsp; Nonetheless, it is also a very, very good CD.... I have been re-introuduced to Ben Harper, gotten well-acquainted with 'Free Bird', had a helping of Van Halen, and even craved my yearning for more pschydellic pop, i.e. 'Stairway to Heaven', one of the coolest songs ever.&nbsp; Especially the part where it (quote) 'Oooooooh.... it makes me wonder'.&nbsp; Anyway..... the drive was very very good.&nbsp; My music so preoccupied me for fourteen hours, that it didn't seem long a'tall.&nbsp; I especially would like to again note the very-goodness of   a ghost is born . &nbsp; 'Spiders (Kidsmoke)' is just so insane and out-of-whack enough to make me enjoy it to no end.&nbsp; Heh.... it's 10+ minutes long, has incessant but very catchy lyrics, and has the screechiest, strangest, and definitely one of the coolest guitar solos I've ever heard.&nbsp; Hence me giving it an A grade.&nbsp; Congrats.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And it goes like back and forth from like techno to rock.&nbsp; It's awesome.&nbsp; My point is that you should all buy/download/hack it from the library, or by whatever other means you get your music from.     We stopped in South Bend to visit my uncle and my aunt, both who teach at Notre Dame (University).&nbsp; It was very, very cool.&nbsp; And, after my oh-so-tiring stint of car-sitting, I'm tired.... for those of you who can't recognize it (I know a nameless few.), that was sarcasm.&nbsp; Hee.&nbsp; Talk to y'all later--  I live in Nashville now....cripes.&nbsp; :D                         Holy jeebus... Conan is hilarious.  Here's one of his analogies to 'help America's youth with the SATs'. Fantasia Barrino: excited about new CD::Ruben Studdard: excited about new KFC I went to Barnes and Noble for a really, really long time today.  And I previewed music for the entire time.... and created an amazon.com wishlist, derived from that very visit.  I have..... ten cds, and two books. And, of course, my soon-to-be-mine green iPod Mini.  Yay.... getting new music always brightens my spirits.  Not that my spirits aren't bright lately, but nonetheless.  Its... uber-enjoyable, how about?  And included are Randy Newman, Bowie(and I can't get 'suffragette city' out of my head.), Wilco, Counting Crows, Jamie Cullum (who is so incredibly awesome), The Dead, Jet (who is also so incredibly awesome), Lennon, and the I Am Sam soundtrack.  Actually, I have I Am Sam somewhere, but I misplaced it.  Ahg. Look out for Part Two of my A2Z soon.  It's gonna rock your fuzzy socks off...... and now that Angie's informed me that the Dots Dark template is, in fact, royal blue (unlike the maroony-purple I thought it was), that'll be my new template.  Spicy, no? (in a less formal fashion...) I'm moving in 10 days.  That's even weirder than moving in 13 days.                          Hello, yo... harry potter brought out some mixed feelings.  It was very well done, overall, i would have to say, but when Harry became dazzled with the notion of living in the country with Sirius, i kind of faded.  Anyway.... the recap.-Enjoyed Profusely-    -The very different cinematography.  It was a lot more interesting.    -all three of the kids acting.  it was much improved... and very good, for that matter.    -the jamaican head on the knight bus.  rasta spirit, yo.... not really.  he had two amusing lines.    -emma thompson... who was very entertaining, hence the turning on of i to her thanks to cate.    -the company of newly identified st.matts-ees.  awwwwwwww.    -gary oldman and lupin.  actually, scratch that.... i don't know if there was one bad actor in this one.-Disliked (alot(I would have done an inbetweener category, but i have other things to attend to.))-    -the few horrible lines in the end... i.e. harry's inner desires to the country with his ex-convict godfather.  hmm.... that's sweet. i guess.    -the extremely pointless and unwanted ending.  harry frolics over into a courtyard to fly on his broomstick.  and the last frame is a flattering shot of daniel radcliffe's windswept face.  alfonso obviously thought it was tasty.    -what happened to the explanation of the maurader's map???? moony, wormtail, padfoot, and prongs???? that sure pronged my padfoot.  alfonso is a wormtail.  i'm too creative for my own good.      Overall, it was very good however.  WAY better than the preceding two.  and very cool to finally meet cate and alex (i am unaware of your catchy nickname... apologies.).  And of course, the amusing chitting with diana.  the conversation strayed, but it was interesting. OH YES! and there were these horrible people behind us who were chastizing(yes.) us to no end while we were in line.  for having cate and alex and such hop in line with us.  she popped in a couple of snide remarks that i couldn't make out... diana can tell you about that.:-D    Wow... my longest blog entry.  That just means i am a humble man of few words... not a bad thing to be.  oh... and a strange genius.  not bad, either.  A footnote-- I am listening to the very pimplicious soundtrack of School of Rock, compliments of Cate.    Time to eat some stale popcorn and find a country home.  Afederzain.                        me and my posse are going to rule the school of cheering at royette's softball game tomorrow. and bombard the unbeknownst ump with rotten tomatoes for cursing my being.  but we'll have none of that.  my posse and me all think you're cranky.  to continue.today, i played alot of tennis, which was good. i swam alot, which was good. except when i swim my hair turns into a psuedo-flat-tangled-messy-mullet.  it's not pretty.  nonetheless, however, i really enjoy swimming.  then i ate good food.  then i talked to cate, who enjoys alaskan whitewater rafting, meryl streep, and debbie downer. hee. i then saw dodgeball with  urlLink kuehn  and tincher.  that may be one of the funniest movies that i have ever seen-- this year at least.  in fact, i am in the right mood to include a snippit.(the Average Joes, a team from this rinky-dinky gym/club place just lost the regional qualifying dodgeball match against a Girl Scout troop. but at the trophy ceremony....)Judge Person: I am sorry, but we can no longer declare Girl Scout Troop 117 the winners of this match.  It seems in the preliminary urine testing, one of your memebers, girls, was discovered with traces of 3 varieties of steroids, and even an extreme beaver tranquilizer.(spot on the girl. she puts her hands in her face, and it shows her now hairy arms and mustache.)Girls: Bernice!!  (Bernice crys into her hands)It was hilarious.  I laughed forever.  And   urlLink Chuck Norris  even made a guest cameo as a judge in the championship.  it was a great movie.  it goes highly reccomended.... to those of you who are of the male sort. hee.life is, well.... pretty good. :)      \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
