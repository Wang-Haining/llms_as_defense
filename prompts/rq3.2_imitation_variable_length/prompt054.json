that it does not really take that long to work on your vehicle...  an oil change don't take but 15 minutes...  i was getting some 15,000 mile service.  those fools at nissan made me wait almost 4 hours!  and in return they leave a freakin red carnation with a thank you note in the truck.  a carnation?!  they couldn't even splurge for roses? they're already overcharging you for the service.  carnations are like, old people flowers...  damn them!  i would have rather taken a car wash because the truck was filthy.  it wouldn't have been so bad if i was with someone but i was alone...  all by my lonesome i sat in barnes and nobles up the street and read magazines...  then i started getting really irate because i'm not a patient person.  you probably don't want me as a customer because i won't hesitate to get an attitude.  i will be straight up rude to you and maybe even curse you out.  i can't help it.  my mom hates it, my husband hates it...  i try not to let it get to me but shit time is money people...  time is money!  then when i left it was 2:00 and i know general hospital was about to start...  i had to trek the 45 minutes home to catch only 15 minutes...  blah...  i'm done bitchin'...                                 i didn't substitute at all this week.  it's not that they didn't call because they did.  only instead of advance calling it was the type where they call you really early in the morning, like 600ish when teachers unexpectely call in sick.  to be honest, i don't care for that because it means the teacher didn't know they were going to be absent and then they haven't left out things for a sub.  i went to college and all but don't have an ounce of teaching experience.  what would we do all day?  maybe it's not as bad as it seems and i'm just afraid to even try substituting on a whim.  there's only a few more weeks till school lets out for the summer.  i just want to make $1000 more dollars (to put towards my debt of course)  and then i think i might be done with this substituting experience.  at least for awhile.  come september and having spent the whole summer doing absolutely nothing i might be ready for it...    it's friday, the weekend, but then again most every day is like a weekend for me since i don't work.  tomorrow merissa, nikolle and i are going shopping.  i don't have anything to shop for but i'm just going to hang out with some friends.  i probably won't bring any money, just enough to eat...  well there is that 14 dollar credit i have from target.  i think i'll check it out and see about getting some garden decor to spruce up my rose garden (keeping up with the jones' i tell ya).  i don't want to spend too much money on it.  i would hate for someone to jack something out of my yard that was worth more than $5 or something.  they also want to go for a pedicure but i'm against it.  didn't they see what happened to paula?  i was watching american idol the other day and thought what happened to her hand?  it was in a sling and she had her thumb all bandaged up.  turns out she went for a manicure and i guess the tools they used were not cleaned well and she got an infection and they had to take off the whole nail.  no thanks to that!  i'll just sit and read a book while they get pedicures.  besides, i'd rather save money for a facial...    have a nice weekend folks!                                  haven't been out all week long.&nbsp; today i finally get out of the house and the weather is all jacked up because of that big brushfire down near lake hughes.&nbsp; it looks overcast here at edwards but it's just from all the smoke and you can kinda smell the fire.&nbsp; hope they put that fire out soon.&nbsp; anyway lunch at pam's with jeff at 1:30.&nbsp; trader joe's sells bentos with some sushi and noodles and those japanese soybean thingies in em.&nbsp; jeff brought us one each to eat while we caught up on the latest news.&nbsp; after i had to go to the commissary for our weeks worth of grocceries.&nbsp; i did good, only spending $22 instead of the&nbsp;usual $80.&nbsp; it's so easy to fill up your cart with all kinds of junk.&nbsp; i really wanted to get a box to make brownies or something sweet but i didn't.&nbsp; what willpower i have.&nbsp; went right past the cookies and chips and even the ice cream without looking twice.&nbsp; tonight we are having a BBQ at brian's place.&nbsp; don't know who chose to have it on a thursday and it's kind of throwing me off because i want to think that it's friday.&nbsp; oh well.&nbsp; one more day till the weekend.&nbsp; looking forward to lunch with merissa since i haven't seen her in a few weeks.&nbsp; maybe we can swing by the mall and go to new york and co, where she bought me a gift certificate for my birthday.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  i came online to look for my sister but she's not online.&nbsp; thought i would blog about absolutely nothing&nbsp;while i was here.&nbsp; it's been boring around here since she left for boston.&nbsp; :(&nbsp; boo hoo.&nbsp; now that there is nobody to hang out with all i'm left to do is really clean clean clean.&nbsp; alright i'm off, things to launder, floors to sweep...                                   i haven't blogged in over a week.  i would say i was on vacation but (and i think i may have said this before) since i don't really have a steady job, everyday seems like a vacation.  my parents arrived on the 12th of may for the USC graduation on the 14th.  it was the most boringest (i am aware that is not a word but i like to make up my own from time to time) graduation i had ever been to.  for such an expensive university it was really kind of tacky.  first of all there was two ceremonies the second being the college you are majoring in.  my sister majored in psychology and is part of the college with anthropology (i think) and sociology (and a few others)...  but psychology got called up last and all the other people graduating whose names had already been called just got their diplomas and walked to meet their families and friends!  i would say 90% of the people did not return to their chairs and they didn't have one of those things where everyone stands and moves their tassel to the other side...  the psychology majors really got the crappy end of the stick being called last because the names could barely be heard...  blah, anyways after the graduation and some milling around campus we headed off to goldilocks for vinegar chicharones(sp?)...  dinner was at max's of manila and i didn't see what all the hype was about their chicken.  it wasn't even that good to me.  i probably won't return there, plus i think they favor people who speak the native filipino tongue...  :/  saturday was universal studios with everyone...  all 12 of us, only 2 kids.  they enjoyed it more than disneyland.  but no one wanted to listen to me about how boring that tram ride was...  all 45 minutes of it...  karen, my sister, made a new friend whose name is captain america.  monday, me, my sister, mom and dad, and cousin ellen were off to napa valley.  it took about 6 hours to get there because we stopped to eat sandwiches for lunch off of interstate 5 near where those stinky cows are.  we checked into travis air force base lodging and got to stay in a 2 bedroom (with living room and kitchen) for $32 a night!  score!  monday was all day at napa and i've found a new appreciation for wine.  i think we visited 6 wineries.  i enjoyed the neimbaum-coppola one (thanks ziggy for the suggestion) and also thoroughly enjoyed their wines...  i didn't purchase any because the guy said it was cheaper at like albertsons and even costco.  it's the coppola diamond series...  artesa's wine didn't really appeal to me but they had stunning views.  my cousin said it looked just like when she visited italy!  lunch was at v. sattui where they have tons of meat and cheeses and fruits and wines and you can get food and wine and picnic on the grounds.    tuesday was all day in san francisco.  saw the golden gate bridge, rode a real cable car.  i think there were two highlights...  no, wait, three...  first was when we saw this homeless man.  he had put himself into a trashcan and made a sign that said 'white trash'...  funny stuff but i still didn't give him any money.  the second was the sundaes we ate at ghirdelli(sp?).  then the third was when our cousin (the adventrous traveler that she is) convinced us to take the city bus to have dinner in little italy...  never would i have taken the bus anywhere!  i loathe public transportation!  the cool thing was eating in a real italian restaurant not that fake wannabe stuff like olive garden (i still like that place.  in fact we ate there a few days after this) or the spagetti factory...    anyway it's now sunday and we've returned from dropping off my mom and dad and cousin at the airport.  how lonley and quiet my house is!  i miss my family already.  i know i've blogged a lot so...  till next time.               \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
