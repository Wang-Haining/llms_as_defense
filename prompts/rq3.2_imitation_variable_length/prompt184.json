Tuesday me and drew stayed on the phone from 3:00am to 7:15. Then we went to the church at 8 and worked at the food pantry. After that Drew went home and me and Lauren and Rusty stayed at the church all day. I hung out with the day camp and watched 'The Ring'. That is one of the scariest movies I have ever seen. But it was good, tho. Then i was in the nursery for the meeting. It was sooooo hecktic. Today I just chilled out and went swimming. Tomorrow night we are going to see the Awkward Romance play. I have been thinking alot about everything going on. I miss being friends with Kayla. She is the person I could come to about tampons, boy problems, anything. I miss not having her there. I dont know what else to do. I sent&nbsp;her an e-mail apologizing. So, whatever happens... happens. Im so happy for Amanda and Terry. They are finally together, well they have been together for a while and im just posting about it. They are sooo cute. *lol* Im in love with Drew. He makes me soo happy, but then he makes me sooo mad sometimes. But, thats just him. *lol* My grandparents are making me go to this stupid driving thing next week. That sucks. Well, thats about it. &nbsp; HEY MARK!!! There, you're in here. *lol, honeybee*                  Geeze... not too much is going on, but im so worn out. *hence the title, lol* Lets see... Thursday I dont remember what I did. Friday I went to my moms and to Wanda's house. I got to chill with Chris and hang out over there for a while. Then I spent time with Denise and talked to her about my problems. *will talk about them at a later date* Saturday I drove with Ted. WOW, that was an experience. I drove on the expressway, downtown atlanta, and I have never done that. Today I drove with him again and parallel parked and backed into a parking space. That may not sound like much, but i broke down in the car. He was yelling at me. But, I passed. Which is sooo good. So then I went to my mom's house. And then to Wanda's house. Me and Chris hung out for a couple of hours and did crossword puzzles. *haha, brother!* Dont ask, inside jokes. But yeah, he is really cool and fun to hang out with. Tomorrow I have a counseling appointment and then I'm going to get my hair highlighted and trimmed up beofre school starts. So yeah, thats about it. It's about 15 minutes until midnight. I think I might shut it down for the night and read the books I have. It's about astrology and its awesome. *thanks karane* So yeah, ttyl.                  Wow... so much is going on. Driving school is goin ok. Molly isnt talkin to me... Like, she's hanging out with Sara, so whatever. I am hangin out with Jessica and they guys. So that is kinda fun. Drew and Kayla are going out now. Yeah, did anyone tell me? No, I had to find out by joking around with him.&nbsp;*dont ask* So yeah, my 'best friend' couldnt even call and tell me. So, whatever. Im happy for Kayla and Drew. They deserve to be happy. But what about me? I deserve to be happy, too. Dont I? I like a guy, but he is 2 years younger than me. I dont know if it would work or not. Plus, I know I would get made fun of by someone. Dont know who, but someone would. But, maybe it's worth it. Maybe not. He doesnt feel that way about me...&nbsp;I dont think. I got to drive alot today, thats a woohoo!!! Tomorrow is another day of driving school. Im kinda lookin forward to it. But that means its almost over. I'll have to get numbers from people so we can all chill. Yeah, thats it for now. But, whatever...                  I LOVE THE AWKWARD ROMANCE!!! k, thats out of my system. The concert was sooo awesome. They are so cool. It was totally awesome. Im still hyped up and deaf from it. Stu gave me a drumstick and he and Andrew signed it. Hey Michelle-> 'ELI DRANK OUT OF MY WATER... OH MY GOSH *shrieks and gets all happy, then faints*' It was fun. We were jumping around and head banging like idiots. It was great. On a more drama front- Drew is bein totally mean. I dont know what his problem is. I told him I love him and he said he doesnt believe me. What the hell is up with that? Ya know, whatever. Im going to have to get over him, at least for now. I cant constantly be down because of him. Martina McBride sings a song called how far and it says 'How far do I have to go to make you understand; I wanna make this work so much it hurts, but I just can't Keep on giving, go on living with the way things are. So I'm gonna walk away And it's up to you to say how far' and thats how I feel... Im here if he wants me, but im not going to waste my summer feeling sorry for myself. And maybe I'll go out with another guy and have fun. He'll get mad, but oh well. *man, that sounds bad* But, I deserve to have fun...            \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
