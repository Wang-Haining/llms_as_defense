NO.  cant move my soft pallet, cant say my 'r''s.  cant do anything right involving speech...after 5 years of speech therapy u think i could but i cant.  cuz im a failure at the just like everything else i try.  i dont even know why i act anymore.  im the worst one on the stage for comp, but everyone else is too nice to say it.  im making everyone else worse. ugh...    well im done bitching                 i just hafta get this off my back.  so i was waiting for my sis after school today...and this friken kid starts badmouthing gays and stuff and he thinks hes kool.  im like shut up seriously i hate you please die.  thats all i hafta say about him.  BUT BUT...this excuse for a human being today in gym was (as usual) being a dickyou probably know him...short fat little jerk wad.  anyway i just beaten this person with a time up the rock wall (15 seconds go me!!!) and he was being a jerk as usual. so i says to him i says 'listen kid i dont know what i ever did to you but i dont appreciate it and it needs to stop now'.he just looked at me, tried to be kool (but fialed) and walked away.  i was so proud of myself.  i finally stood up for myself and for everyone else he was making fun of in the class (being everyone). so i was happy and my friends congradualted me.  that was the highlight of my day.  but i have a concert tonight and i really need to do my hw...now go away for now and come back later.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
