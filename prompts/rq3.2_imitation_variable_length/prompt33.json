It has been a great way for me to stay creative, and also pay the bills. I do projects that range from postcards to billboards, and  EVERYTHING  in between.   The majority of my projects are comfortable. They fit within the way I like to view the world. However, I'm currently working on a project that doesn't fit between a postcard and billboard. In fact, it doesn't fit anywhere.  Where would you put a project that tells the story of a man with the following:  a beautiful wife     4 great kids (college to middle school)     good career...         brain tumor   You can't peg that kind of project, and it sure doesn't fit within the way I like to view the world! This project requires more than just a creative mind. It requires something deeper. It requires a piece of me that I can't get back. A piece of my heart that I don't easily give away. Why? Because it hurts for crying-out-loud!  I don't  want  to do this sort of project. What I want infinitely less is for my uncle to have a brain tumor.  I love you uncle Ben.                                 The design industry can be frustrating sometimes. Anyone with a computer and a pirated version of Photoshop calls themselves a designer these days. The industry has been flooded with mediocre work at rock bottom prices. As a result, many clients don't want to pay for design (good or bad).  That's why I don't consider myself a designer. That's also why I went back to school and finished a business degree.   Yeah, you heard me; I have a business degree. Yes, I know, creatives generally stay far away from the business end of things (that's one of the reasons I went for it).   Here's the PO!NT  I believe that if OPMG is to stay competitive we have to partner with our clients to deliver a comprehensive experience. That means more than a brochure or Web site. That means understanding their business from the ground up and helping them communicate their PO!NT from every angle. Good marketing penetrates the entire business process.   Designers don't cut the mustard.               \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
