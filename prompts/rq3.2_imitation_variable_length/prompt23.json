But no, they get no link here.  So why have I used them repeatedly to publish my books?  Long story, but I'll try to keep it short.  I didn't find out about their lack of attention to detail until the end of  urlLink  Torn Apart's   publishing process, when the publication of  urlLink  Sanguine Fluid   was already in progress.  Now that I have two books with them, I may use them for  urlLink  The Duality of His Life   simply because they do have a slick web-based tracking system for keeping on top of the production process, sales and royalties.  That's one of the things they do well.  But the flip side is you have to triple-check everything with them.  Here are 3 of the biggest sources of frustration I experienced publishing Torn apart:  1) During the interior design process, after the editing process is complete, you always find one thing or another that still needs changing.  Well, you are charged an additional fee for edits at this point.  I've had things that I had edited out of my book show up in later drafts, more than once.  And you know that saying 'You get what you pay for?'  Well, not always with Xlibris.  You have to keep an accurate record of all changes paid for and look for them when they send the corrected copy back to you because they always miss something.  2) I've had them email me a PDF cover galley (digital mockup of my book cover) that was correct, then print me an author copy that was a little off, promise to fix it before the book goes on sale and end up shipping copies of the book with the uncorrected cover nevertheless.  Yeah, in the end they did 'fix' the cover, but they did nothing to make my customer's who received bad covers whole.  I proposed a number of ways for them to do the right thing, including a discounted purchase price for Sanguine Fluid and all were rejected.  They never actually said no, they just ignored my request and did nothing.  3) Just today I received my first royalty check from them.  Not only did I fill out the proper paperwork to have my checks issued in my company name  urlLink SerialThriller.com , but I also double-checked with the royalty department twice by email, and each time they confirmed my request.  So, did they follow through with my instructions.  Of course not.  The check was issued in my name and my Social Security number instead of my company name and its Employer Identification Number.  So I have to waste more time next Monday trying to get them to redo the royalty so that the IRS will get the correct 1099 information next year.  How nice it would have been to have seen my production company's name on that check.  I just opened my first business account two weeks ago to be ready for it.  To be fair, the publication of Sanguine Fluid  was  flawless.  But, for months after it went on sale, the link to the chapter excerpt on its purchase page kept going down.  One day it would work fine, but the next you'd find nothing but a white page.  What new potential customer is going to buy a book when they can't even view the chapter excerpt they were promised?  Would you?  But anyone aspiring to self-publish should judge for themselves.  For all I know, every other print-on-demand publisher may be just as bad.  Not all bad, but not all good either.  I made my decision because of how Xlibris presented itself in print and on the web, so I don't have any other point of reference.  I guess the most important thing is to know what to expect beforehand so you can effectively manage your publishers shortcomings.  That's exactly why I plan to take you through the entire publishing process as I go through it with The Duality of His Life later this year.  I never said self-publishing was easy, but it is damn rewarding to hold your own book in your hand.
