Maybe it’s the rain that puts me in this mood.  The dark sky makes me think about all the scary movies I watched when I was younger…Dracula and Noferatu.  I have mentioned two wonderful authors already…Christine Feehan and Maggie Shayne, but I didn’t mention my first bite of the proverbial vampire books.  My mother-in-law, who is always sending books my way, lent me When Darkness Falls by Shannon Drake.  It was the first romance I have ever read all the way through.  Why you ask?  Well, it was about a Scottish vampire…two of my favorite things.  I’ve read all of her vampire series so far and thought others would enjoy too.  I’ve got a link to her site as well in the title bar.  I will try to make it a habit if my favorite authors have a web page to post their link when I write something wonderful about their books.  By the way, if any one has read any of the three authors’ series, leave me a comment on how you like then or didn’t.                           This is my very own recipe for chili, but be warned! It will burn a hole through you stomach and make your nose drip while you desperately stuff your face. 'It's better than good, it's grrreat!'  1 pound of your choice style hamburger meat 1/2 pound of your choice: shrimp, chicken, deer meat, or steak 2 cans of red kidney beans 2 cans of diced tomatoes 2/3 cup of chili powder 2 tbs of cayenne pepper 1 tbs of minced garlic 1 tsp of salt 1 tsp of black pepper 1/2 cup of Masa flower 1 onion 1 bell pepper 2 (or 3) big chili peppers 4 jalapino peppers 4 cayenne peppers  Brown all of your meat. Poor kidney beans and diced tomatoes into crock pot (juices and all). Chop up all of your peppers and your onion. Add the peppers to the crock pot. Add browned meat. Add all of your seasonings. And cook for at least 4-5 hours starting on high and readjusting it to low as the peppers start to soften. Stir occasionally and add more Masa flower to desired consistency. I like mine thick. Serve in a sturdy bowl...this chili ain't made for Styrofoam bowls! Add cheese and salsa if desired and eat with chips and crackers. Just one more thing...you should take some pepcid about an hour before you eat! Enjoy!  \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
