She had felt herself in each character, yet had felt as if she were them, and not herself. Slowly she rolled over still dazed from the realistic dream. Once she had rolled over, her nephew’s golden curls tickled her nose. He had golden curls, so different from her black hair, so like Chloe’s hair. Sitting up a little she leaned over Mickey to see his face. She was startled to see resemblance’s to Chloe in his face, she had never noticed before. Yet he resembled the Chloe of her dreams not the pampered one in the picture frame on top of the mantle down stairs. Marie tried to picture the dream-like Chloe’s face again but the dream had faded. Marie lay back, and closed her eyes. Tears began to fall from the poor little orphans eyes, and sobs from her throat, but soon the sobs turned to a yawn, yet the tears never stopped their down pour from the sleeping eyes.    ( hey this will be put in the next chapter but just so you know Chloe was killed in a fire five years before this date, Marie is ten, now and Mickey ( Chloe’s son) is almost six, they are living with Joseph but he is very busy and doesn’t see them much.)                          hey its the 16th and i have been away on holiday! so i have to pick winners before i go to work let me think hmm i think frist place should go to....
