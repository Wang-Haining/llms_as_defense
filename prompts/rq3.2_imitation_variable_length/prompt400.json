Hitler and me are two man quite similiar and alike in many ways but the difference between us lies in a decision.   How small can a decision be but how great an impact it will have eventually. The difference between Hitler and me is that I chose Jesus and he did not. I chose to be a follower of Christ, releasing forgiveness to people around me and he did not.   That bitterness welled up in Hitler would eventually led to him being insonmia and eventually caused him to lose the war and everything he have, including his mind and his right to lead. Sad story but powerful lesson.  'What you decide on today will determine what you become tomorrow.'   This is my paraphrase of one of my all time favourite movie quotes. It is taken from Gladiator, spoken by Maximus when he was still the General of the Army of the North before he led his calvary into battle... 'What you do in life echo in eternity'  As for me, i decide not to let the Sun set on my anger. What about you?                     There is much rejoicing in Singapore today over the reduction in National Service period for all males. Everyone is now required to serve a maximum of mandatory 2 years of military service. Indeed, it's a joy to many! Parents are relieved! Half a year less of fearing that at the next doorbell, they will see an Officer standing at their doorsteps with a letter in hand and the headdress in the other.  Personally, I do not think it calls for much rejoicing. It just reflect the sad state and disillusion our country have of National Service as a whole. In what could be interpreted as a move to gain more votes in upcoming elections, the ruling PAP once again won over the hearts of anxious parents, what more after all the recent 'training accidents'. A brillant move in my opinion! It serves to let the nation knows that they are still being cared for and it also serves to correct a little bit of that disillusion people have about National Service, that hostility feeling. I must appluade our Government for this! A brillant political move indeed.  Coming back to my point, National Service is all about protecting your country, your loved ones. Since ages of old, the only reason man volunteerily go to war is because they are seeking survival for themselves, their love ones and their purposes. This is the most ancient form of National Service. And I'm sad at the state and the hostility people viewed National Service as waste of time, hindering them to progress in life. These people are whom I called the 'traitors'  of our values! For without a strong unified Army, there will be no Singapore. When there's no Singapore, there will be no home and thus, no you and me.   National Service should be view with respect and dignity. For if it's treated with disdain, we will quickly erroded to be a lawless society, just like some neighboring countries I know.   What joy and previlege it is to lay down your life for your love ones, your country!   Vive La Singapore!                          Kidnapping     It seemed like the latest fab in town is not stripes but hoods and ropes. Every day we heard of someone being kidnapped in Iraq. I wished I had a shop in Iraq now selling hoods, ropes and videotapes.     &nbsp;   People from all walks of life and various social positions and nationalities are being kidnapped. I wondered if all the kidnappers are trying to see who can 'go around the world'. Let's just pray that this 'quest' will be for 80days!     &nbsp;   Why are they kidnapping people? What are their motives? To stop 'invaders' from coming into their country? Who knows? No one knows. All I know from this is that it is an opportunity to make money. Imagine a 'Premiun Package for Kidnappers' featuring unbreakable ropes or various lengths, padded nylon hoods with chin support, short length 15 minute video tapes and free professional video-editing. Let me throw in a 'free vctim' of a nationality of your choice.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Well, all these kidnappers are here to stay as long as they want to because they knew Arroyo... ops... I mean SOMEONE... will always give in to their demands. Much as I detest their acts, there will be Arroyo... ops again... I mean ANOTHER ONE... who are scared by their acts. (Talk about women leading countries, the last tough one I knew was Margaret Thatcher. All who follows are just barbie dolls.)     &nbsp;    Bombings     This is another terrible trend that occurs in recent months. Again, I wished I'm in Iraq. This time, I will set up a Casket Company. Boy, I'm beginning to think I'm beginning to think like PM Goh. Take risk, go overseas, be innovative.     &nbsp;   I will offer funderal services to the dead, offer to clean up the scenes and sell coffin. Imagine how much I would have made in Bali or Madrid? these are the one-off bigtime income. There's also the regulars in Iraq, Israel and the Middle East. Seem like this is a good bunsiness.     &nbsp;   Again, as long as someone like OSAMA or Arafat is around, we will sing this new version of a Rhyme I learnt while young.    'Every day a bomb here, a bomb there, a bomb everywhere. Old Macdonald had a bomb..E Ya E Ya O!'     &nbsp;   (Incidentally, the Old Macdonald house in Singapore was bombed in the insurrgent in the 70s.)               DPM Lee's unofficial visit to Taiwan had caused a strain in Singapore-China relationship. Being in the upper echlon of Singapore Government, China warned that DPM Lee or any of our Ministers against such ill-advised trips.   I must first applause DPM Lee for making this trip! He is bold. He knew this would invite some sting from China but as DPM now, he still can be excused for such 'ignorance' trips. when he become the PM, no matter if it's official or unofficial, all of his trips and visits would be very significant as compared to now. As head of a nation, this is the responsbility he carries with him. Still, I feel he did not want Taiwan to feel left out. This is the only reason why I think he made that trip. It may draw sting from China but it bridge a gap between him and Taiwan and 'formally' introduce him as the next Singapore PM.   Indeed, nation to nation relationship is comparable to people-people relationship. We try not to stumble the other guy. However, in nation to nation relationship, the stakes are higher and the responsibility is greater. Hence, it must handle with much care.   In all, the visit to Taiwan by DPM Lee goes to show too to China and any other nations... 'you do not bother who I make friends with.' And it will teach all these big nations to respect smaller nations and their sovereignty. And it still shows that Singapore have a mind of our own. No one can push us around.  A well calculated risk ,DPM Lee! Grade A.                      EURO 2004 will go down as the one that we saw the shattering of 'myths' in European football scene. Truth had prevailed and come forth.   Myth #1 : Spain Spain was also considered a force to be reckoned with but Euro 2004 showed it is just another participating country. Such was the sorry state of Spanish football that they can't make it past the first round.  Myth #2 : England What do Erikson and loud hailers have in common? They amplify. England is just an average team with a few celebrity footballers. The only reason why England have such a huge following worldwide was because Britain or England colonised almost half of the known world during the glorious days of the Great Britain Empire. Imperialism and colonial brainwash. I'm sorry for all who still live in 1966, time to move on. It's 2004.  Myth #3 : Germany Let's face the fact. The 'Golden Era' of German football had passed by. It's time for some restructuring and reconstruction. Will we see a 'Third Reich' ?  Myth #4 : France Who says they are invincible? Talents alone does not subsitute hardwork and teamwork. Like I had always said, they peaked too fast and too soon.   Myth #5 : Italy I hate to say this but I have to say it. If Italy continue the way it is, it is going to be another England. loudmouth. What's lacking is a real quality striker and a coach who's not afraid to bench some reputable stars.   Myth #6 : Czech Who says you can't do it with old men? Czech does it. They made it to the semis. They may have a few old men in the team but the cohesion and teamwork tells.   Myth #7 : Greece How appropriate that Greece chose EURO 2004 to make a statement in the football arena. 2004 is the year they are hosting the Olympics Games. Once again, they shown underdogs do WIN! All the best, Greece!                      It was a cool afternoon and our Vice Principal is supposed to be teaching us remedial lessons. As any good director would have it, this is the best chance for a drama to happen. That's right! Mr Hyde took over me....   Rebellion  I still remember that I fought with Wenliang in class that afternoon but I can't remember the reason or the cause of it. I would consider myself to be insane by this time. An insane man needs no reason to blow up at people. I would not go into the details...  Hearing the commotion, the Vice Principal came in the classroom and broke up the fight. I was furious and attempted to hit her and a long string of 'Hokkien' vulgar expletives was released from my arsenal of angry words! Moments later, I was called to her office and the Principal was there too. I could still remember the Principal saying he wants to see my parents.   'I'm not going to call them but I trust you to tell them about this and come here tomorrow.'  These are his exact words to me. I remembered very clearly because it was one of those moments in my life that I would never forget!                      Have you ever wondered how the Ancient Egpytians managed to build the pyramids? Have you ever wondered how the Ancient Chinese managed to build the Great Wall? Have you ever wondered how World War II was won? &nbsp; If you have, you would have reached the same conclusion as me. Focused efforts. The entire nation was mobilized in the case of the pyramids and the Great Wall. The entire Allied nations were mobilized in the case of World War II. All efforts were directed at Normandy, making it successfully and the Allied forces able to launch an invasion from there.  &nbsp; Such is the power of focused efforts. And it just reminds me of the Early Church days when the people were in one accord praying in the upper room, the Holy Spirit fell on them. Again, we see a common focus here. When Paul goes on his missionary journeys, the Church stood behind him supporting him in whichever means possible. The result is most parts of Europe been reached. Once again, we have focused efforts here.  &nbsp; This power of focused efforts is seen much evident even in today's world. For a team who always make up the number of teams in any tournament they took part, Greece showed what focused efforts can do and transform a sub-average team into Champions. Sun focused a few years of her life in the Crossover project and it changed the face of music forever. It opened up China and all chinese speaking people all over the World for the Gospel!  &nbsp; A lot of people spend a lot of time and money on self-help books and seminars. They spend lots of money to walk over fire or listen to someone babbling something that they themselves had been taught in school.  &nbsp; Everyone of one knows that Work done = Force X Distance. More work is done if more force is applied over longer distance. Similiarly, this means that we will be more productive if we put in more resources and efforts (force) into what we are doing for a prolonged period (distance). In other words, we will achieve more if our efforts are focused!  &nbsp; If only people bother to think and read the Word and understand what Jesus says, they wold understand! This is why Jesus said 'He who have ears let him hears'. He's telling us to be focused in what we are DOING! 'If you're supposed to be listening, you LISTEN! Don't do other things.' That's the essence of Jesus' message when He said those Words.  &nbsp; &nbsp; (There's a reason why God made known to us the wonders of science.&nbsp;On the Word hungs all the laws of the prophets. On the Word, Jesus, the whole World is founded.&nbsp;Upon Jesus, God establish the laws of nature and science.&nbsp; &nbsp; This is why science can never &nbsp;go against God's Word. It will only complement. But unrenewed human minds can cause science to go against God's Word. ) &nbsp; &nbsp;          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
