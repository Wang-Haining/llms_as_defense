To celebrate we played a trivia game with a pictionary board, monopoly pieces, and questions on little trivia pursuit type cards covering all we have done so far. It was fun. I got to move 1 square. :) Lecture was on microscopes. After class most of us went to a bar downtown to celebrate the end of the week. I got a pinacalada, not too strong and yummy.  At one point we ended up in a political discussion that most of us could have done without. Anyway, shortly into it, I realized that CNN was playing on the TV over the other end of the table. It was showing the ceremony removing President Reagan's casket from the plane that just flew it from Washington. It was a very strange moment when I realized what I was watching. It is amazing how detached from news and current events I am. I don't even know what the weather report is in the morning before heading off to school. After awhile we headed home. Meg, Bryan and I got some dinner at the Musmanni and then headed to the internet cafe. They then went out and I headed back to the house to study and get some sleep.                       Today we were a bit late for class again. We're really trying to stick to the bus, but the timing isn't always the best.  Spanish class was really great today. We went over new verb conjugations. Pretty easy stuff since German does the same thing.  Lunch was a quick trip to the bank to get more colones, and then off to Chaplins for more beans (frijoles) and rice.  Unfortunately, Dr. Malkin did remember the quiz today. Bill was kind enough to remind him on the bus Saturday.  Lecture was on ventilators. A very simple, yet complex piece of equipment that I don't plan on messing with very much.  In lab we made little portable flashlights with a couple batteries, a switch, and an LED. I worked with Lauren because we will be at the hospital in Managua together. We finished early and I hung out waiting for Brian and Meg to finish. Barnard was teaching a class at 5 on myths from all over the world, so I flipped through a book on fairies. The drawings were spectacular. He stopped by and was telling me about how many myths are repeated throughout the world in different cultures. His example was the variations of the Rip Van Winkle myth. He mentioned similar myths from Japan and Ireland. Hmm, interesting. Then Meg and Brian finished. Meg and I headed to the grocery store to get food for lunch tomorrow and then I headed home and went to the internet cafe for many hours trying to catch this blog up.  Dr. Malkin was at the cafe setting up the website hosting various pictures from the past week. I mentioned using Photoshop to do it, and now I think next week will be my job.  Anyway, my host brother works at the internet cafe and my host mom had to call and tell him to tell me dinner was ready, oops. After dinner I came back to the cafe and continued with my blog writing. I ended up being here until after 9 when they technically close, though they don't throw people out.  Then came Spanish homework which I fell asleep in the middle of doing.                        We met the bus at 6:30 or so and headed out. The first stop was breakfast. Yummy as usual, and it was a buffet so I could get more eggs. The view from the restaurant was spectacular. (Pictures coming soon) After breakfast it was off to the rapids. We were broken up into groups - my boat had Lauren, Bill, Mike, Zach, Darcee, and myself. The river we were on - the Pacuare, has class III and class IV rapids. To get an idea I believe class V is the highest and hardest level. Only Mike fell in. I almost fell in, but Juan our guide caught me. Three or four times during the trip, Juan let us jump out of the boat and swim for a bit. It was interesting trying to swim in sneakers, but fun. The pictures below are from a CD I bought from a photographer that travels down river with the group. We headed for lunch and got changed out of our wet clothes. At this point I noticed that my skin was quickly changing from pink to red in certain areas. So much for waterproof sunscreen.  We ended up getting back to the school at 5 or 5:30 and five of us packed into a cab back to our houses.  Dinner was at the church down the street. I had two fried queso things. I think they were enchiladas, but I'm not sure. Then it was time to get cleaned up and go out dancing. We headed to the Pueblo which is supposed to be the place to go. I had fun for awhile, but the music was so loud and there wasn't much room to dance so Dr. Moratore (sp?) and I caught a cab and headed home.   urlLink    Entering the Rapids of the Pacuare River    urlLink    Left to right Lauren, Mike, Bill, Darcee, me, Zach, and Juan our guide   urlLink    Mike almost falling out   urlLink    More rapids   urlLink    Getting a bit wet   urlLink    Relaxing in a calm section of the river                       Just a note - I'm not going to be able to get online everyday (too much homework!!!), so depending on the time I have available I'll either backfill the dates or do a quick summary.   Today we had to be at the school by 7:30 am. Breakfast was a delicious slice of fresh pineapple and some bread. Then it was off to catch the bus for school. The traffic wasn't too bad and the trip is about 30 minutes. We got to school early and started filling out the registration form. Then came the oral exam to see what level of Spanish we were at. Mine was the shortest. I walked in Barnard started talking to me, I had no idea what he was saying, test over. Then came a brief intro to Costa Rica and the EWH program. I had forgotten that we were taking real courses and that there would be homework. Doh! My roommate (Meg) arrived she was in Guatemala and couldn't get here any earlier. Classes also started today and Spanish was first. There are two students (including myself) that had no Spanish experience. However, they put us in with five other students that have some experience, but need to cover some of the basics again. Needless to say it's going to be a lot of work to catch up and stay with the class. I did ok today because we went over basic verb conjugation and the process is similar to that of German. My biggest disadvantage is lack of vocabulary. I'm going to make flash cards and get a Spanish English dictionary, hopefully they'll help. The lunch break was just enough time to change some cash to colones and grab a quick bite. We ate at a cafe - I had some rice with chicken and vegies. It kinda reminded me of fried rice. The instrumentation class was interesting. We talked about pulse oximeters. It's been so long since I've been in a classroom setting with tests, etc. I'm half terrified that I won't get into the swing of things and half excited to be back. After school, we headed to the local grocery store to get supplies for lunch the next day. It took us forever to decide what to get. In the end we ended up with deli turkey, mozzarella cheese, bread, a munchy, and bananas. By then it was after dark, and since we aren't supposed to ride the bus after dark we caught a cab. Cabs here are plentiful and cheap. A nice combination.  Dinner was good, a beef soup/stew of some sort. I wasn't able to clean my plate, I'm really hoping that isn't insulting to Nora. After dinner we headed to the internet cafe until after it closed at 9. Then homework. We had to write sentences and a paragraph on various things. Hard to do when you have no vocabulary to work with.                        This morning before classes started Gladys and Barnard invited us to their house for dinner Friday night. Barnard was telling us about his house yesterday in class, so I can't wait to see it. Today in class we had a little fun with tongue twisters. For example: En un plato de trigo tres tristes tigres trigo comieron and Compadre, Â¿compra coco? -No, compadre, porque como poco coco como poco coco compro  The lunch discussion today was on what a biomedical engineers role is in relation to the developing world. It was very interesting. After school today we had another dance lesson. This time there were only four couples. It was a lot of fun because the people there were there because they really want to learn how to dance. Then after the first class the instructor invited us to the second class she teaches on Thursday nights. Three of us went along with Gladys and Barnard. It was a lot of fun, and boy was I tired afterward. Silvia, the instructor, was very impressed with our ability to do the harder steps she taught in the second class. :)                        Breakfast was papaya and bananas with bread today. It's good, but come 9:30 or 10 I'm pretty hungry.  We ended up taking a cab again today because again, the bus didn't come in time. We're going to have to work on that.  We went to Spanish class, Chaplins for lunch, and then onto Instrumentation where we covered Blood Pressure Machines. The highlight was Dr. Malkin forgetting to give us our Friday quiz. Of course I had studied and was completely prepared.  The low point was when I heard about someone stealing Barnard's laptop from the school. The school is locked and has a guard/watchman, but unfortunately the thief got in. The laptop was worth over $2,000. This was a reminder that even though most Costa Ricans are very helpful and friendly, there are still the few out there that aren't. Tonight everyone (well all but 2) went out to the street by U. Latina and just hung out. It was a lot of fun. I got to talk to Dr. Malkin. He was really encouraging and I'm looking forward to working with EWH after the summer ends. At one point we went to a pool club and as we walked in a Maroon 5 song started playing. It was pretty cool. The pool kinda peterd out, and the air hockey was broken so we started to move on. Then we realized how tired we were, and the 5:30 meeting time for tomorrow loomed so we all headed to our respective homes.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
