Rachel,  do you rememebr when you all used to call me that. and when i spent all my outside lunches with dougie and carson l. we would all sit outside ms. shelhorns door and we would then go to the tralier, i miss the tralier. i think we should have a day when you all call me rachel not sporko. thatd be odd.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
