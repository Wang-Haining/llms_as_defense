  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic:\n\n       here is part 2, if you haven't read the first part scroll down.  although nothing in this post will directly relate to the post below, so i guess read it however the heck you want!  ok my friend eric is really stressing me out.  eric likes to make little comments to confirm his assumptions of me and another friend nick.  so all the time i have to put eric in his place when he makes smart ass remarks to dig in the fact that something is going on between me and nick, although sadly nothing is and i have to reiterate it to eric each time, which in turn puts me in a worse mood than what his remark initiated.  not only that, eric gets more mad and i know it's not me he's mad at, but more himself for 'going there' again, as we've discussed in length before.  i'm sure ya'll know what it's like to have behaviors you despise yet they still slip out.  i used to have that problem, not so much now.  not since... last thursday, lol :)  a whole week, but hey i'm getting better.  so.  that's eric.  nick, well nick's been discussed previously, but i'm coming to satisfaction at just being friends because, well.. ok yea, i must be lying cuz i can't think of anything to justify that comment :P  let's go on.  so hey there's also lance.  lance's been discussed previously as well, we've started emailing again but yea it's like an instant return to empty emails and conversation.  and all the while we were trying this email thing to start it up again, the word replacement kept coming to mind, i have to get over all that mess first before i can get anywhere else, isn't that strange?  used to be i could switch personalities and get around it.  not so much anymore.  wondering what kind of replacement?  well if it looks like n and smells like n and acts like n, doesn't mean it IS n.  and he sure as hell didn't kiss like n!  there was a huge study done one time about people and change, people would actually resort to whatever tactics they had to in order to recreate their life the same as when a big variable changed.  we'll use the dating sense since it's so applicable here, they would find someone sickeningly similar to whomever they were with previously.  i thought it was ridiculous till i realized i was in a pattern with lance where he would come over every tuesday and friday and watch a movie.  weird!  the rest came abundantly clear and that was that, then just as i was breaking away he told me he'd sorta kinda met someone and was starting to see them and wouldn't you know right at that time me and nick started talking again, which i never thought would happen. ok well that could go down lots of roads but it can't right now, my boss is coming.. look for pt 3 soon :)             someone once asked how a married couple of 52 years stayed so long together.  her answer was they just never fell out of love at the same time.  sometimes you sway in towards each other, sometimes you sway together, sometimes one or the other sways the other way (and typically sways back), but when you both sway apart at the same time, that's when it falls apart.  it makes sense to me in my mind, like 2 pendulums swinging side by side.  i totally agree with that, although for completely different reasons than just a few months ago.  there for awhile i was completely guided by emotions and feelings, up/down yo yo of a life.  and some days i would feel the extreme opposite toward a person than i had been, and pray that they didn't encounter the same thing at the same time, because we'd both (falsely) realize that we didn't want this thing anymore.  NOW, i know that it's a mess to be directed completely by emotions, that you make a decision and just do it, but you still encounter that type of pattern in life.  you just don't let it impact you as much as it could if you were directed by emotions only.  now i KNOW this whole paragraph makes no sense, but it does to me and that's about all that matters at this point :)  that said, me and e are having issues and i don't know what to do.  our pendulums have swung apart for a long time now.  and i also don't know why we're grasping so hard to continue what we both have issues with in the first place, especially now.  i'm working on getting the answers.  i am absolutely falling for nick... *sigh*      \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
