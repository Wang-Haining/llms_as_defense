The fact is that I just write at very early and late hours so it can look like 2-3 days went by when they really didn’t. I’m just making an observation...  Well, things are ok right now, I am up late with stomach problems though. Other than that, I am well and feeling quite good actually. I guess in reality this time could better be described as bittersweet. I’ve been quite solemn since hearing of the death of Ronald Reagan. It didn’t hit me as hard as I thought it would, but I figure it will become harder as it sinks in. He was a great man, one that I have the highest of respect for.  Sometimes we just have urges. Mine as of late have just been to pray. Sometimes I don’t know how to pray. Perhaps it was times like this that Jesus Christ gave us the Lord’s prayer.   Our Father, which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done On earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, And forgive us our debts, As we forgive our debtors. And lead us not into temptation But deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory forever. Amen.    Mr. Reagan said in 1988:  “...When I saddle up and ride into the sunset it will be with the knowledge that we’ve done great things. We kept faith with a promise as old as this land we love and as big as the sky. A brilliant vision of American as a shining city on a hill. Thanks to all of you, and with God’s help, America’s greatest chapter is still to be written, for the best is yet to come.”   God Bless You, Mr. President.            Of course it is to be expected that there were hypocrites in the days of Christ, seeing as this is where Christians get the term, ‘Pharisee‘. But you would think that after the passage of so much time, we would begin to grasp the message, the meat of what Christ was saying, yet many people still miss the point entirely.  Matthew 23 is a very interesting chapter that many just can’t seem to grasp. The fact is, if you aren’t ever offended by it, I’d think you were in denial or just plain dense. At times, every person has shown a bit of the old hypocrite in themselves, but only a few realize it and seek to eliminate it from their lives.   The danger of the Christian life is that there are some things that can be taken as such that over time it loses its meaning and becomes nothing but a ritual, something done only through habit. We must be careful that our worship does not proceed down this path. People take comfort in rituals; this is nothing new. We get up every day at the same time, do the same things to some degree, and when that rhythm is upset, we are thrown for a loop.   Pharisees took comfort in their ritual. In fact, this comfort went unto the point that their salvation depended upon it rather than the condition of their heart. They were careful to obey the smallest letter of the law, yet missing the message that it was trying to convey.   I suggest that you read Matthew chapter 23 in light of this. You may find it very interesting. I know I did, particularly this verse:   “Ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel.”    Matthew 23:24              The final episode of M*A*S*H* was rerun tonight on television. Still one of my favorite shows, the final episode can still bring somber feelings. Compounding this feeling is the conclusion of  Call For Help , a great show that said its final goodbyes this Friday. Here is what I published on my website, which of course is now gone itself:    I’m a frequent viewer of the channel TechTV. The station is currently in the process of merging with G4TV to produce G4/TechTv. Well in the past I’d hoped to see what G4 was all about, with all the gaming shows (not game shows), so I admit that I was curious and a little optimistic about this merger.   Knowing the details, it’s a little hard to swallow now. In fact, people from all around are choking (and choking up). If you don't want to take my word for that, read the TechTV message boards.  G4/TechTV is focusing on a specific demographic: Gamers. Not tech buffs and gamers, gamers only. Though TechTV wasn’t a major network (a lot of people probably haven’t even heard of it), it was aimed at technology in general. Shows for newbies, gamers, tech news, etc. It seems that G4 is the senior partner in this merger, because some of TechTV’s very lifeblood is being drawn out, namely Call For Help, one of my favorite shows.  Needless to say, I am bummed about this decision.  I know you'll never read this, but thanks for some great memories, Leo.
