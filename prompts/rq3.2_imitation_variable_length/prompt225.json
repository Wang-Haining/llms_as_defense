It wasn't half as cold as I thought it would be, but I'm still more into summer camping.  My class went up to Marriot Basin for the weekend and built an igloo, snow caves and even summited a small peak!  I was a great weekend but I'm feeling a bit exhausted from all the activity.  Colin and I are doing well.  I saw him a couple of hours after I got back from my trip when he got back from surfing in the states.  We have a really good relationship, we see each other quite a bit but I don't get sick of him.  This week I get to meet his mother, she is coming out from Ontario for a week.  We are all going to have dinner together on Wednesday; I'm excited and nervous all at the same time.  Colin thinks that his mother is going to like me, I certainly hope so, but I'm still a bit jittery about the whole thing.  Colin and I have spent so many nights together it is driving my parents nuts.  My mum is concerned, but really, it isn't too much of her business.  I really enjoy spending time with Colin, but it will be much easier during the summer when I don't have to worry that it'll impact my grades.  So far, my grades are still straight As, but I have a gigantic midterm tomorrow that I am pretty nervous about.  I guess the main thing that I am nervous about is being in love.  I can find things about Colin to complain about, but I don't want to break up with him.  I love him and I know that no one is perfect.  He is the best guy for me and he is sure about me.  I guess I have trouble accepting the fact that things are fine and that as long as we both communicate and don't let other people get in the way that things will only get better.  I'm just going to do my best and concentrate on enjoying the time I spend with him and if we are meant to be we will end up together.  *sitting at work stressing about tomorrow's midterm*                 One day until Halloween and I still don't know what I'm going to dress up as!  Eek!  I can't really worry about it until this afternoon; I have a midterm today at 1pm so I've been studying for the past few weeks.    Stephen and I have been fighting a lot lately and we almost broke up on Tuesday night.  We've decided to try to work out our differences.  I've been taking out my stress about school on him, it’s not fair, but I'm working on it.  Outdoor Rec shouldn't be stressful one would think, however, we have a lot of silly little assignments that pile up and some profs aren't very professional.  I mostly like the course but my computer prof is about the most annoying guy I have ever had to deal with in terms of classes.  Argh.  This weekend I have a Halloween party with my class on Friday, on Saturday I'm getting my belly button pierced and maybe dyeing my hair auburn, and on Sunday I'm kayaking in the morning with Stephen and hanging out with my long time family friend Melissa in the afternoon.  So, as long as I do well on the midterm today, I will be having a stellar weekend!  *hoping that I've studied the right stuff for my exam*                  What a psycho!!!  Colin's roommate has done it again! Yesterday we got back to Colin's about 5:45pm after we had both finished work, the boy was sweet and gave me a ride home from downtown!  I went into Colin's kitchen to get a drink and noticed that my bottle of wine was empty and sitting on the counter.  I went into Colin's room and asked him if he had drunk any wine, giving his roommates the benefit of the doubt.  Colin replied that he hadn't and I said that it was strange that the bottle was empty.  Colin came into the kitchen with me and not only was the bottle empty but Colin's crystal cupboard was wide open and there was a dirty glass on the counter and the cork was laying out on the dining room table.  It was fairly obvious that the wine had been drunk in an effort to provoke an argument.  I told Colin that I felt she needed to explain why she had drank my wine and why she was pissed off with me.  She wasn't home and I had a class to go to so I asked Colin to speak with her when she got home.  I went off to my class and met up with Kimi and we went to the Keg.  During dinner, my phone rang and Colin told me that he and his roommate had just had a gigantic fight.  Apparently, she came home and went into the kitchen, Colin hearing her come in wandered into the kitchen and asked her 'what's up?”  She replied, 'What are you angry about?'    He stated that he wasn't really angry but he wanted to know what happened to the wine.  She claimed that she thought they shared things in the house and that she had only drank a bit and didn't know what had happened to the rest of the wine.  Basically, it sounds as if she was trying to frame Colin's other roommate, who would never touch anyone else's stuff.  Colin told her it was my wine and that he wanted her to replace it before tomorrow.  He then also told her that she wasn't to use his crystal or any of his dishes or cutlery.  They argued for a while and she yelled at his, 'your girlfriend is a bitch,' and slammed her door shut.  Colin yelled back that she was a psycho bitch.  The continued yelling at each other down the hall and she started claiming that all of his roommates hated him and that his other female roommate was moving out the next month and that she hoped the next person who moved in hated his girlfriend.  Colin yelled back that the next person moving in was his girlfriend.  They shouted at each other and swore back and forth and she stormed out of the house.  A few minutes later, she called his cell and left a message stating, 'Colin, this is Crystal.  If you touch any of my crap I will call the police, I have them on speed dial!'  Colin let me listen to the message and I started laughing, I said 'you mean she can't remember 9-1-1, she has to have the number on speed dial she's that stupid?'    Realistically she could call a non-emergency number, but what a retard.  We've never touched her stuff before and she was the one who took something of mine so it was pretty funny.  Luckily, she never came home last night so I haven't run into her yet.  I figure I'll just pretend that Colin didn't tell me what she said about me and I will be super nice to her and make her look like the world's biggest jerk.  Kimi and I figure that she insulted me because she knew it would make Colin angrier than if she had called him a name.  Whatever, only 11 more days and she is out of our lives forever!  Seven if you subtract the days we will be away for during the long weekend.  What drama!  At least in only a few more hours we'll be off on another surf trip... Unfortunately, she may be in Tofino this weekend too, but if we see her, we're going to avoid her.  *listening to the sounds of traffic through the office windows*                  Yay Stephen and I have been together for 4 months now!  We're gonna have dinner together and go for a walk in the park tonight, should be fun.    I'm very frustrated with my work outs.  My weight got way higher than usual this year and no matter what I do none of it seems to want to budge.  I spend a minimum of an hour a day doing cardio and I weight train every few days as well.  Argh!  The only thing that seems to be happening is that my thighs are getting bigger, definately not what I want.  Grrr, I know most people will think I'm being silly, I'm not fat, but I'm not in the shape I want to be in.  Perhaps some of the weight is muscle now, but I wanna fit into my khakis!!!! Oh and whoever decided we need to drink 8 or more cups of water per day can kiss my butt, all that keeps happening is that I constantly have to use the washroom!  Grrr and several well chosen swear words!  Today is car fixing day, my dad and Stephen will be starting in under 30 mins, I just hope it goes smoothly.  As if though, nothing is ever straight forward with cars :P.  Stephen's friends are flying out here on Friday, so two more days until I find out if all Ontario guys are crazy.  On Saturday I will probably be going hiking and kayaking with Kimi and Wendy.  It should be fine, hopefully it won't be like some of my paddling adventures where I start to drift out to sea.   Then on Sunday I should be going out for coffee with Heidi and Kathryn.    Right now though, I should be getting back to work.    *Sitting in an air conditioned office listening to Def Leppard*                 Hmm, well I had a pretty good weekend.  On Friday I went swimming with the boy.  Saturday, I slept in, went shopping with my parents, and had dinner with Heidi.  We went to Milestones and then meandered along the seawall for a bit.  On Sunday I went hiking around Buntzen Lake, it was really pretty, but when we crossed the floating bridge I thought I was gonna fall into the lake for sure!  I saw Stephen later Sunday evening and we had a quiet dinner together, fun but it'll be nice when he has weekends off again.    The fixing of my car didn't happen on Thursday, it was raining so the guys left it until Wednesday of this week.  Hopefully if all goes well I'll have a car by the end of this week.    No really exciting plans for this week.  Stephen's friends might be flying out to visit him on Thursday but he doesn't know for sure yet.  It should be interesting to meet them, so far all I've heard are a lot of stories and Stephen has shown me some photos.  Hmm hope they're not all crazy :P.           \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
