  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic:\n\n       The now defunct archives of this blog used to carry something that I feel very strongly about. That is the whole same sex marriage argument ( urlLink Missouri, being the first in line, has banned this type of marriage ). Now most believe that the argument is for or against the banning of gay marriages across this nation. I believe that to be complete blasphemy. The third option on this should be for the government to deregulate marriage.  One of the fundamentalist qualities of this democracy is the separation of state and religion (now that is not what the republic was for, but that a whole other topic). Now can anyone please explain to me why the government regulates the holy sanctuary of marriage?  The only reason why a person should get married in this country is because of the tax benefits that belong with it.If this were the case, the majority of the people in this country would find marriage a waste of time. Now you could say that people want to adhere to their religion, but lets face it people, the majority do not follow their religion too wholeheartedly. Just take for example the percentage of people that have pre-marriage sex. That is not condoned by any major religion, but yet the overwhelming majority does it.  So again, I must ask why is marriage still regulated by the government? Please if anyone has an answer to this, post it in the comments section. I will be intrigued by the answers to this.            Check out  urlLink this pathetic site . In it is a 26-year old man who is still a virgin and is willing to take offers from women to take that honor away from him. Of course he leaves us with some great things about himself. Some of these masterful quotes include,   'I am a virgin for one simple reason: the dream of making a Web site just like this.'   Yep, sure you are.   ' Interests:  board games, roadtrips, gambling, naps, strength training, Seinfeld, politics, philosophy, SQL, Christmas lights, weather patterns, political maps, business and entrepreneurship, passionate love-making, romance, debates and discussions.'   Boy this guy is a keeper. One thing I know the women love are board games, a programming language, Christmas lights, weather patterns, and politcal maps. I still can't figure out why he is still a virgin.   ' Biggest 'Accomplishment':  finished second in the 2nd grade spelling bee.'   Do I even need to comment on this? I did not think so.   'I follow a very low-carb diet.'   Height:  6'0'  Weight:  237 lbs    Mr. Atkins must be rolling over in his grave. You, my man, are the poster child for this latest diet trend.  Ladies, are you still attracted to this male? Well go ahead and whore yourself to him.              urlLink Why waste originality when a truism will suffice   That was  urlLink this person's  response to the following quote,  urlLink 'One man's cliche is another man's....uh....cliche.' .  With that out of the way, I will tell everyone that is willing to listen my reasoning why this person would be regarded in public schooling as 'special'. First of all, he cannot even end a sentence with punctuation. Is that a question he is trying to pose? I don't know, there is no question mark. So I must assume that a series of idiotic statements that will form a SPED-like poem. But of course there is no way to tell.  Secondly, 'truism' and 'cliche' are basically the same word. But one of them sounds less harsh than the other. So just to make himself feel superior and lift his microscopic self esteem and ego, he uses the former.  Thirdly, he argues that using a cliche is a good thing. This in turn makes it fairly easy to believe that this imbecile has the following conversations:   Random person : How was your day?  'winner' : OK, I just have to take it one day at a time.  Random person : My day was fantastic.  'winner' : Well, every dog has its day.  Random person : Actually there was one thing that did not work out as expected. My dog broke her foot.  'winner' : Doggone.  Random person : But I did hook up with that girl across the street.  'winner' : Well, that takes the cake.  Random person : That wasn't all, then my dog did her dog on the porch all night long.  'winner' : Oy, vey!  I could go on and on, but you get the point. This person is a moron and this post is simply moronic.    \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
