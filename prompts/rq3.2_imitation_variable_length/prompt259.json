( I can't believe I was the one who actually made him promise to wear a shirt.......hopefully he was too out of it to remember(that it was me..not to not wear a shirt)....oh and he owes Maya $3) eheehee.  I'm actually going to do some homework......seeing as someone *glares* made me not get home till like 11:30.....hehehe Oh on the drive home from Maya's we saw a HUGE snail......like we nearly ran over it and Im like thinking 'that looked like a snail' and Jez (bad, now blue, hair...) goes 'did you see the snail??' And yeah IT WAS A HUGE SNAIL I never knew they could get so big.....cool or what (that's been the favourite story of the day). Oh and Maya the Scarey hippy gypsies should be gone soon, I think they were there for the whole Venus-going-over-sun thing (or the Durumbal Venus dance party last weekend), so you won't have to scream and lock all the car doors!! (crap!!! you didn't lock the boot after you got Grizzley out....we could have been killed by the stick killing hippies!!!).  Stupid Danyel wasnt here today, and lonerised me with the fuckwits in Senior Science. Patrick and Brad (i think thats what they're called) are annoying the hell outta me- keep going 'HI BENITA' so next time I'm gonna be like 'OH..MY....GOD........there's a MASSIVE spider on your head Patrick' (cos thats the dude who I've heard is arachnaphobic (sp??!) Mwhhahahahahah Colli is sooo gay *cough*.....we have to go to Hastings Point on thursday to look at a bunch of rocks or something with the Bio class FUN FUN FUN......I'm soooo dropping it ;)           \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
