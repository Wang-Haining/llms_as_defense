I'm playing with the Ibanez TS7 Tubescreamer now. It's the first pedal that I really got to try out and it belongs to Sean. (Thanks for lending it to me and Nicholas!) Since no one else is at home, I can safely unleash the awesome power of the overdrive pedal! Muahaha! I hope the noisy construction work downstairs is loud enough so the neighbours won't trace the origin of the generated noise pollution to me alone. Initially I thought it was just to amplify the sound or something to that effect since it's named  'Tubescreamer' . I couldn't tell that the grey pedal was for overdrive effect when I first saw it until I received Sean's SMS. No wonder there was the tiny knob on the top labelled  'Drive' . How silly of me. I've also managed to lay my hands on Dan Brown's  Da Vinci Code  (Finally!) and  Angels and Demons  (The two bestsellers on Life! bestsellers list for the past few months) when I passed by MPH the day before. You won't be hearing from me for the next couple of days.           It was my turn to go for the dialogue session with Mdm. Mak this morning. No sweat. I've been to her office before, about&nbsp;a few months back because I got caught skipping mass dance. Now I can look back at it and laugh at myself for being such a doofus brain. But thanks to that incident, she has agreed to make mass dance period a little slacker for Sec. 4s. After talking to her today, I realised that&nbsp;she is actually a rather friendly person to get along with, not at all like our stereotyped perception. She was sincerely putting in the effort to understand the problems we're facing. She even took time (half an hour into our Lit. lesson to be exact. --don't be mistaken, I'm thankful for that)&nbsp;explaining to us the rationale behind implementing things the way they are, and gave us the assurance that she'd rectify the problems that we've brought up, like&nbsp;Lizâ€™s cca issue. I think she now knows more about us in that short half an hour session than what Mrs. See knows about us in 2 years. Way to go, they should organise more of such 'talk shows'.                    There're a few CDs lying around on my table now. Steve Vai's The Ultra Zone, G3 Live In Concert, and Linkin Park Live In Texas. Thanks Sean and Andy respectively for lending them to me. I've listened and watched all three. The Ultra Zone shows a totally different side of Vai as compared to his previous songs that I've heard. Ultra Zone features a more melodious Vai, instead of his usual hyper-speed shredding style. But a few tracks in this album sound a little foreign. Vai has employed the use of some Pan-Arabian vocals and Indian-like tunes. I didn't like the singing, the female singer sounds all whinny and I don't understand Arab/Tamil or whatever the language she's singing in. Luckily most of the tracks are instrumentals.   G3 was a whole new experience for me. Satriani's anthems like Summer Song still sounds as refreshing as when I first heard it. Eric Johnson's fantastic use of chord voicings in his tunes never fails to leave me in awe. Although he looks and plays like anything, but a guitar rock idol. And Steve Vai's guitargod image in addition to his weird noises and the way he abuses his guitar totally rocked the stage off. I can't wait till his concert in three weeks' time.  I missed Linkin Park's Live In Texas Concert on Channel 5. Thank God for DVDs. Actually it was more or less the same as their MTVs. except for the frequent brawls among the audiences. Chester is still screaming his throat off. I could see his veins bulging out. I wonder how many lozenges he has to take just to get through one gig. Mr. Hahn was the only one who didn't sweat from all that jumping around because all he does is move his middle finger up and down the disc. Their second last song 'A Place In My Head' was the ultimatum when they smashed up that Ibanez. (They smashed up all the remaining gear after everything was over.) I think I'm going to watch everything all over again before returning them the CDs this Saturday. What to do, there's nothing else worth watching on TV nowadays.                   I went to check my cca results after school yesterday, I got an A1 (Yay!), but so did everyone else. It was quite surprising actually, I don't even know if I did anything right in band for the past four years. Darn, if only it were my 'O' level result slip.    Today was a good, happy and fruitful day because I missed school. Played with the pedal some more in the morning because I've to pass it on to Nicholas tomorrow. I'm going to miss the amount of gain I managed to get out of it this past week although it did eat up a whole 9V battery.  Went down to Isetan with my mum and brother, got ourselves a mogu cushion each (Mine is bright orange! =)) and some new towels. Paid a hefty $36 for the nicely packaged 0.5mm in diameter polystyrene beads, but it's okay because this is more solid and it doesn't go out of shape easily like the cheaper $9.90 ones do. Now I'll have an additional thing to hug when I go to bed. The nice people there gave us a discount for a tower fan to thank us for patronising them and offered to deliver it to us free of charge so we didn't need to lug our shopping bags home. I'm enjoying the cool wind from the fan now, a break from the recent span of hot and humid weather.  Next, to Takashimaya's Sushi Tei for lunch. Saw MediaCorp artiste Cassandra Lee and two other actresses, my mum said she smiled at us but I was too occupied with heap of sushi in front of me  to notice. Then, to the departmental store to get myself some new clothes. (Yes, I finally got down to it.)  No more time for anything else, we caught a train back to Jurong East so I won't be late for cell group. Took the opportunity to go scouting for books at Popular again. Sadly enough, Tuesdays with Morrie was still out of stock so I left for MacDonald's empty handed. Met Shaun and Joel on the way there. Louis and Tricia joined us halfway, Nathaniel and Trudy joined the group at the traffic light, and Barbara, Nicholas and Wei Siang met us in Jurong Entertainment Center itself. It was past 7.30. So much for meeting in church at 7.00pm. This should tell you a lot about the punctuality of Jurong youths. It's an unspoken rule that the meeting times are always stated half an hour earlier than the actual meeting time for reasons we all know why.  We took quite some time settling down and actually getting down to ordering our food. Barbara treated me to popcorn chicken from KFC and I treated her to McFlurry from Macs. All this happened while Sergeoh and James waited alone in church for us to return. Cell was out in the open tonight and without bibles too, we just used the hour to catch up with each other. The breeze was cool; the porch lights were warm and cozy. Everything was perfect until Tricia, Trudy and Barbara all screamed in unison with the appearance of a little brown cat, just when Shaun was at the climax of his horror story. (He was the victim of attempted assault in school this week. He has a psycho maniac for a classmate, who tried back stabbing him, literally, with a penknife. Thank goodness his friends pushed him aside in time, or we'd have to have cell in NUH for the second consecutive week, after Victor's case of food poisoning and infected capillaries.) That has got to be the most frightening 5 seconds of my life, as far as I can recall.  We were too lazy to move after cell ended so we set up a little booth with baskets lined up at one wall, and us, standing at the opposite wall with an entire box of balls, all geared up to shoot. We got bored after a while because none of us managed to score, the balls simply bounced off the wall and we had to pick up the mess. So we decided to aim at Louis instead, after all, there was a larger chance of us actually hitting the target. Sergeoh didn't like the idea of just using one ball at a time, so he simply hurled the entire contents of the box at him. They all missed though, so we had to start picking up the mess again. But well, whoever knew the immense pleasure little inflated plastic coloured spheres could bring us.  Wayne decided sit through the full loop of the 334 bus ride to accompany me after everyone alighted seeing that I was all alone, but I think it's because he's too tired to walk after playing soccer. Haha, nevertheless, it was very nice of him to do so. Because of the delay during dinnertime, cell ended late, explaining why I only got round to blogging about the day's events at this time of the night. Say no more, my new cushion lies invitingly on my bed as I type.  Peace.                      Totally forgot about the dance practice in school this morning. (Sorry! =S)    I made it to church just in time for Sabbath School. Learnt about the three angels' message versus the three frogs' message in Revelations (Woo, big chapter!) from Auntie Pik Yee.    Had my first bible study lesson with Bee Guang after lunch.    Managed to go for band BBQ at yasi's house. The honeyed sausages and satays were tasty!    Met Pinhao on my way there. Been a while since I last saw him but couldn't stay to chit-chat because he was in the middle of a basketball game.    Saw Xiefen and some of her HCJC friends in the study room beside us. Holy hell, I never imagined that I would actually meet someone who was a more intensive bridge player than me and my classmates. But there they were sitted around a square table holding poker cards for more than four solid hours. They ate alot too, helped us to finish Ms. Chong's large birthday cake!    Made friends with Yingxu's brother, Xiao xiao/Edward/Juju. (I still don't know his real name.) Cute little Pri. 6 boy. We played a little catch and soccer with Zhuo Jing and Joanna, since everyone else were just busy barbequeing or eating.    Reached home at 11, couldn't do any homework.            \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
