When I kept a diary as a teenager, I wrote in it every day (how gay is that?!)  It's been a week of unrest at work. In fact, last week my laptop hard drive went ka-boom, which was perhaps a small fore-warning of what was to come. The Bank published a list of the employee benefits that will and will not be transferring over to HP. For the stuff that can't go across, they offered a measly 400 (gross) per year per employee. Because this is the first cold-cash amount up fpr the grabs, the union balloted it's members for strike action, and got it.  The last few non-members of the union in my dept. quickly signed up, sans moi, naturellment. Gary tried to pressure me into joining up, the chump. So the chef and I went over and over it, but in the end it was my decision. Really, I agree with the union position, and I'd never cross a picket line anyway. My main problem with this was the support I've gotten from Colin over the last few years; I was afraid that if I signed up to the IBOA, somwhow it would be a slap in the face for him. However, having spoken with him in private, I discovered this would not be the case. So I signed up (really, the only thing to do given I don't care for the pressure from wither side, and I can't become a manager), but I did so in secret; let whoever finds out find out. The whole thing reminds me of the stuff that went on in Tara in 1996.   Also I was speaking with Conor, who's working on some of the stuff on the HP end. He's begining to find out what the Bank can be like, especially the attitude of ITS. I'm sure it'll all work out, things have a funny habit of doing so, but just not in the way that one thinks it will.  The skip arrived Thursday (after a mix-up earlier in the week), so Thursday evening P & I shifted all the heavy stuff from 31 (the cooker, washing machine, dryer, sofa, etc) and the same from 29 into the skip. Tomorrow (well, today really, as it's 0039 12.07.2003) I'll just dump all the garbage that's been hanging around the house here.  I noted that as a HP employee I'll have the right to work from home (if posible) and also P will be covered on my VHI; should be handy when we move to Clashwilliam.  That's it really; the tickets for New York arrived this week. I've been looking forward to this for so long I can't really focus on it any more. It seems to unrealy.  Did a little bit more work on 'Walking With Scott'. I got loads done on the ending; just need to fill out the middle, really.           \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
