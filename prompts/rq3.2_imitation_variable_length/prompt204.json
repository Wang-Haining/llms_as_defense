I'm floating... wahahaha *_*   &nbsp;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   &nbsp; a weird day ... filled with mixed feelings... beautiful windy weather...   Hehe~ had a mini and a little pathetic Racial Harmony carnival today. Was slightly late for the Racial Harmony&nbsp;talk in the audi... Oh my goodness! So paisei...&nbsp; my friends and I thought that we had to be seated by 10 instead of 9.45. Happily we marched in at 10 plus, by that time almost everyone was seated and the principal&nbsp;had just begun her presentation. Wow~ thousands of eyes watched us like hungery vulgers waiting to attack small little preys... However, luckily we managed to pull through this tiny 'ordeal'. hehe...   &nbsp;&nbsp;Then my friends and I proceeded to the foyer after the talk... I&nbsp;participated in the Indian decor activity.&nbsp;Each of us took some coloured rice grains and laid them out according to the authentic flowery template that was placed on the floor. Wow~ wonderful experience... although it's&nbsp;a rather tedious job.    &nbsp; Following that... hey hey~ we&nbsp;took a stroll around the running&nbsp;tracks in school. So romantic right?! haha...&nbsp;we chit chatted along the way as the wind blowed in our direction. Goodness~ as though&nbsp;we were having a vacation on Cameron Highlands. It's&nbsp;definitely an experience that one should&nbsp;never miss out... I believe that such precious moments will&nbsp;definitely make&nbsp;up part of the sweet memories I have with my friends. In fact, such a scenario reminds me of the&nbsp;tittle of the book '&nbsp; A walk to remember  ' ...&nbsp;I&nbsp;would encourage you guys out there to read it...&nbsp;   It's&nbsp;a sweet story about family,&nbsp;FRIENDS and the&nbsp;different characters you meet&nbsp;daily. How one gain acceptance by proving&nbsp;oneself... and to stay strong regardless of whatever&nbsp;setbacks you have faced. It's a simple yet&nbsp;complicated love story... Extremely touching~ &nbsp;  &nbsp;Yup yup... I'm getting a little worried now... My dad will have to go for another mini op. tomorrow. I cross my fingers and pray hard that there won't be any complications... Hopefully the surgeon of Changi Hospital will avoid medical negligence&nbsp;unlike the last time. I can't accpect another blow... it's too painful to watch your love one suffer for nothing... . Hopefully&nbsp;after this mini op... another round of check up and bi-opsy will&nbsp;carry through smoothly too. I pray that there won't be&nbsp;any undesirable outcome... although chances are low... but there's still a slight possibility. Anyway, what I can do now is to give him the moral support and to provide him with some advices... which may be of some use. yesh...   &nbsp; tata... [=^_^=]                    What a hectic day... tons of work awaiting me. Hai~ not easy being a student now adays. Who says that we just need to do our hw... get over and done with it? We still have our CCAs and pw... arrgh, this is getting on my nerves. I think lately I have been running into some bad luck or something. Lost 3 of my precious things... I lost $15 today. gosh... I spent the whole break frantically searching for it. However, what's gone is gone... I can't do anything now... =(  Yup... on the way home today. Something unexpected happen. Haha... I was nearly squashed in the packed bus that I boarded. GoodNEss... these passengers or rather lazy bums just refuse to be considerate enough to make way for me to alight the bus. Despite my many... and I mean MANY attempts to say 'Excuse Me!!!'... the only person which was kind enough was an ITE student who actually helped me to press the 'stop' button upon my request. So this comes to my point here... even if one is smart/intelligent... without the right character and positive attitude... that person = redundant. He really needs to do some self reflecton. ITE as some ppl may jokingly say that it stands for 'It's The End'. Not true... I definitely disagree to it. If you are willing to perservere, regardless of which ever institution you are in... with the great inner beauty... you will surely go far.  On a higher note... as I was walking home I passed by my neighbours house. Then I realised some giglings and some kind of mini 'concert' going on. I saw 4 cute little girls acutally trying to set up a small stage outside their house. Creative enough... they actually used 2 hanger post as barriers. ANd one of these sweetie pies started to sing aloud...' I'm Falling in Love... di da da da...' . haha~ but my sudden apearance caused that girl to blush immediately. I pretended not to take notice of them and continued my journey. Then I heard some giglings behind me... when her friends actually asked her why she stopped singing... she went like 'wait a while lah... there's someone....' Upon hearing this... I could not help it but to burst out in laughter. wahaha... these girls really remind me of my childhood days.  I was no different from them. There I wore my big fluffy 'keng keng' dress with huge agogo round dangling ear rings... slipped into my mum's high heels... borrowed her lipstick to touch up a little. And there I go... my little mini fashion show. hahaha... okay okay... I know it's pretty lame. But still it was really fun... amusing and 'self entertaining' ... hahhaa =P  Hmn... there's CO tomorrow! haha~ this CCA makes my day most of the time... unless when I'm not in the mood. Not forgetting my CO 'FamiLy'... they are the ones that really brighen up my day. There's this magnetic thing between us that can never pull us apart. Hopefully... we will always remain as united. Hmn... lately did not really have some time for a mini congregation... but I guess some things can be felt. It's felt in the heart and actions can't say it all. Yup...I guess we can understand each other...  Anyway... a super long day tomorrow. Up to 7 plus... goodness me... I think I'm going to fall asleep half way through the rehearsals. Hopefully everything will go on smoothly...  Through this cca... I can see my passion for music growing day by day. Really! I'm proud to be from co. Yesh~ so let's pray that it rains heavily tomorrow too... nice weather to escape from P.E. wahhahaa... that's all then. WIll blog again when I'm free. Really wanna make a chatbox and to load some music onto this blog. Guess I'll try to get it done asap... ciao~             \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
