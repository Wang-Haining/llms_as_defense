This is a GPLed C# app that appears to be under development (last activity May 2004) at Novell.  The project is closely associated with Mono.  I took a quick look at their code, and it seems well structured.  I did not see any unit tests though, and comments were sparse.  I suspect that they have gotten to a point where the code is hard to work with, and progress became harder.  Also, there is only one primary developer that works on it part time...sounds familiar :)  Their base-features are similar to  urlLink SteveDb , focused on typical database functionality.   They are open source, fully managed C#, and Mono compliant.  They support stored procedures, triggers, XML, Full Text Search, and all the usual database suspects.   I'd like SteveDb to take a more innovative approach than that.   Rather than just supporting those things because people are used to them, I'd rather look at each of them, and how and why they are used.  Then, I can make decisions on the best way to meet the goals of the users (developers).   For example, take stored procedures.  They are used to either place business logic on the server, or as a means to improve security.  I do not see the point of doing either of those things in SQL.  I'd rather let the users write .NET code that is accessed via SteveDb.  For security, I'd rather just provide a strong, capable security framework.  Similar thoughts apply to triggers.  Why do people use them?  I suspect mostly for audit trails and validation.  There are probably better ways of achieving either of these goals.  Full Text search is a good feature, but it will be very low on my list of priorities, because I do not expect SteveDb to be used with large databases.  Performance will be acceptable on a small database anyway, so why bother.      I read up on  urlLink Binary Search Trees , and eventually decided that I would implement indexes as  urlLink Red-Black trees . I could have tried to implement a B-Tree, but as I understand it, that is optimized for disk-based access. Since my first index implementations will be stored in memory, I thought I'd go with what works for that.  So, I found some decent C++ code at  urlLink this site , and modified it to work in C#.  There was no code for deleting nodes, so I still have to figure that out.  I don't think that my implementation will be anywhere near as fast as native C or C++, but it should be adequate. What's important is that  urlLink SteveDb  will be able access data in O(log  n ) time, instead of O( n ). Nothing spectacular -- all databases have some form of balanced tree, but it is a relief to be almost done with my first one. Complex stuff scares me a little....its been a long time since I was at university!  I did not do this in my normal  urlLink Test Driven Development  routine, because I was basically transcribing existing code. I did still write tests though, including a nifty set of functions that validates that a given tree is a valid red-black tree.  Tomorrow, I will get back to writing the code for table joins.  Once I have some experience using the indexes, I may write an article on  urlLink Codeproject  about red-black trees.  Probably nothing too deep, mostly just publishing the code so that people can see it and use it if they want.      When writing process logic it is best to avoid module level variables.  Rather pass parameters around.   Today, I reviewed a module that did invoice processing.  It had lots of loops and if statements, and was generally quite complex.  It had many functions, which shared a set of over 10 module level variables.  The code had a bug, that invoice numbers were being duplicated sometimes.  The bug occurred because the 'next' invoice number was being stored in one of the module level variables.  Some code paths would set that variable correctly, and others would not.  The bug was hard to reproduce, because it required that the specific problem code path be triggered.  This could easily have been prevented by avoiding the module level variables.  In addition, the code would be much easier to read.  I explained the overall cause of the problem to the programmer that is fixing the bug, and he is refactoring the module right now.   Even though he was not the programmer that created the code, he has been guilty of writing similar modules in the past.  I'm really hoping that this will be a good learning experience for him.      Somehow, I have it in my head that it should be easy to write a basic browser in C#.  I mean, parsing HTML is only moderately hard, and how hard can it be to render the HTML on the screen.  Of course, I am not saying it is not a challenge, but I think it is a very achievable goal.  Am I crazy?  Almost certainly, but I think I'll give it a try anyway.  Why would I want to?  For better control and embedding of browsers.  Right now, if I want to embed a browser in my app, I can use the IE webbrowser control, or the Mozilla activex control.  Neither of these is a 'managed' solution.  In addition, neither allows me to place code between the parsed HTML and the rendered page.    What I mean by that is that I would like to write a browser that renders non-HTML input in combination with HTML.  This opens up possibilities, although I'm not too sure yet what they are.    One possiblility is as a fast browser for dialup users.  Although HTML is an efficient user of bandwidth, it is not necessarily the fastest way to get a rendered page to a user.  Depending on the nature of the page, I imagine that it could be quicker to render it on a proxy server, and then to send a rendered image to the local browser.  That may be worth money to a dialup ISP, in terms of being able to offer the quickest browser on the market.  The above is oversimplified, because sending a rendered image is going to be slower in almost all cases.  But the point is that there are efficiencies that can be gained by creating a browser that can receive the rendered page in alternate ways.     In another of my ambitious mini-projects, I have decided to write a database engine. Of course, being somewhat pragmatic, I am willing to sacrifice some functionality over a full database engine. I won't support transactions, or any advanced forms of concurrency, or even the full ANSI SQL. I think I'll call it  urlLink StevesDB .NET.  But I should probably start at the beginning. In .NET, there is a gaping big whole in terms of an embeddable database that can be distributed with applications. We have this wonderful idea of XCOPY deployment, but as soon as we have a database, that goes out the window. In addition, web-based apps often need database functionality, but do not want to have to deal with SQL Server prices from the ISP. In short, there is a gap in the market for an embeddable database.  There are some contenders.   urlLink SQLite  for one, already has .NET providers, and a fair amount of sample .NET code. But I think I can do better than that. My planned database features are:      100% managed code - possibly with support for the Compact Framework. This will allow the greatest flexibility in terms of distributing       Support for storing the database in Isolated Storage - this will allow apps to run with minimal local priviledges, in terms of Code Access Security     ADO.NET Provider - probably the easiest part     SQL language support - I don't really want to get into writing a whole parser + tokenizer for SQL, so I will probably just hack something together that will handle 90% of queries. It will be enough to start with at least.     Dynamic indexes - users will not have to define indexes - they will be created as needed, and discarded when they are unused.     Fully typed data columns - SQLite has a different model of typing for columns, which would just confuse users.     Multi-threaded support     Fully embeddable or remote server modes of operation     Opportunity to plug-in .NET code anywhere in the engine - kindof my equivalent to Oracle's Java support, and Yukon's C# support.      The reason I think that this is a simple project, is that I will not be dealing with any of the difficult challenges, like transactions, complex SQL, b-tree indexes, permissions etc. All I have to really worry about is interpreting SQL, and storing and retrieving data in a structured way.  We'll see, I guess. I've completed coding the basic data file class, which allows basic CRUD operations on row data. It works fine in my NUnit tests, running in .NET Isolated Storage. Oh, I have also coded a  Compact  function, which reclaims wasted database space. Next, I will move on to table and row structures.      I have been thinking, that although I do not want to provide a security framework for  urlLink SteveDB , I do want to support data encryption. I do not want programmers to have to work hard to make their data secure. My idea is that a connection string can contain a private key, which is then used to encrypt data at the row level. To retrieve that row again, the connection string must contain the same private key.  If a user performs a SELECT statement that would return an encypted row, but the connection string does not contain the correct private key, then that row will be filtered out of the results. There will be no error -- just no data. Data is effectively secured at the row level.  This opens up some possibilities, because we can share a database between a bunch of different processes or users, and each would only be able to access their own data. If they share a common private key, then they could share data. The private key is effectively the username and password. In fact, I could just hash a username and password, and use that as the private key.  Of course, encrypting data has some performance impact, but performance is not a key driving factor behind SteveDB. Also, it would be optional, based on the connection string. I may also make it selective, i.e. the user can choose on a per-command basis whether they want to use the private key.  \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
