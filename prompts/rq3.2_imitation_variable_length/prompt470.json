I know people are saying they're similar to bands like Coldplay and Travis but really, I'm sorry to say it, they sound like a poppy British boyband to me.&nbsp; Well, maybe that's kind of harsh.&nbsp; The first song was catchy but meh... I don't know... it didn't blow me away or anything.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   There's this song, 'Teardrop' on  Mezzanine  that is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard in my life.&nbsp; Everytime I hear it, I picture Sean and I walking down a street, holding hands and just smiling at eachother every so often... that song brings that image to my head, I'm not sure why, it just does.&nbsp; Another absolutely beautiful song is 'Sweet Song' off of  Think Tank.&nbsp;  It's one of my favorite Blur songs.     &nbsp;   I was so hoping to go see a movie tonight but it turns out that out of all the movies playing:&nbsp;A) I've already seen it once or twice even,&nbsp;B) It looks like crap or C) I've seen it, it was crap, and I wouldn't see it again SO, no movie tonight.&nbsp; I might walk down to ABE's with Kate for dinner though.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   All right, so apparently, every person in this world has at least&nbsp;one other person who looks like them.&nbsp; Now, what if we all have somebody else who thinks just like us?&nbsp; There are bodies timed to give out at the very same second.&nbsp; Thousands.&nbsp; I don't see why there can't be minds also.&nbsp; But, when your body gives out, you die... and when your mind gives out, you die (they just call it  suicide.)      &nbsp;   Hm.&nbsp; Random thought brought to you by Sarah.&nbsp; Reading over that, it doesn't make much sense, and I'm not sure where I was going with it either.&nbsp; *shrug*     &nbsp;    urlLink  This band   &nbsp; is really awesome.&nbsp; Think happy-indie-pop that makes you feel all good and happy.&nbsp; Not to mention the percussion is a girl tap dancing!        &nbsp;   That's all for now I think.  &nbsp;                   What can I say?

Oook... what is that?   one person you could spend the rest of your life with:  Like you even need to ask.              Well, I'm sitting here on my lunchbreak at work.  *looks around* Well this is fun.  Friday is payday though so I'm looking forward to that.  Let's see... I had a pretty good long weekend.  Yesterday, went to Kelsey's for dinner.  The day before, I saw The Village.  That movie has such crazy reviews; the people I know who've seen it either love it or hate it really.  I love it.  I really do.  The overall message of the whole thing is beautiful.  And the character, Ivy, was wonderful.  She'd be the kind of person I'd want as a good friend in my life.  She was blind but the way she acted it was like she was a blind person who could see... but could see the world just in a different way than the rest of us.  Overall, there were some incredibly lame parts where I couldn't contain my laughter and really, at those points, I was thinking that the movie sucked.  Then the end comes and everything turned around and what I thought was lame actually wasn't lame at all.  That's all I can say really.  I don't want to ruin it for any of those who actually read this.     I'm going to edit this and write more when I get home.  Later.    \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
