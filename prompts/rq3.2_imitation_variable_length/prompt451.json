I mean, it started off with a rehearsal dinner on Friday, to which I enjoyed some beer at the elks club.  They were also serving rocky mountain oysters.  I passed.  Then we did the rehearsal, but everyone was late and the people at the church were ticked.  I walked goodly!  Friday night we went to Fat City.  We bowled, but it was all black light with huge TV screens.  Cool, but the computer for keeping track of the bowling sucked.  Who knows how we did.  Saturday we got up and hauled out to the church.  The church, by the way, was very nice.  About 15 miles out of Denver in a field.  We did the normal pre wedding stuff...decorating Spence's car, hiding him from the bride, pushing eachother around on the boards with wheels.  You know.  The wedding was cool I usppose.  I hate to outshine the groom, but there I was!  Oh, and if you just rub shaving cream into your pants for awhile it will go away.  Not wanting to bore everyone with details I am going to save the reception for tomorrow.  It was incredible!    Oh, and I would love to have pictures, but see Keith has his camerae and I have his cord.  Suck.                     Yup, so tonight I drove up to Ft. Collins to meet Meg and her friend for some dinner and chillin.  I walked further into a Victoria's Secrets than I ever have in my life.  And guess what?  They totally do look at ytou when you walk in as if to say 'Ummm, so do you like have a girlfriend or what?'    We went to this soup and salad bar place.  It was good, and they let you put pepperoni on your salad.  Ohhhh pepperoni!  Then they had other good stuff.  Nice conversation though.  Meg's friend was a newly graduated engineer, so I felt the need to let her in on all my secrets that I have come across since working.  Secrets like not lying about what you know, cuz then you have to do it anyway and you look like an ass.  Well anyway, quite busy on a project right now...so the week has been flying.  I hope it keeps up.  Sleep well (yeah, so most of you are awake and it is morning...but maybe a nap would be great for you right now.  Just think about it...a nap right there on your desk!)                      (It was Excellent)  I had a wonderful time on my date.  We ended up going to dinner because she didn't hook up with her parents.  She drove down to the tech center (she insisted) and we got a bite.  It was really early though...like about 4 that we got together.  Then we had dinner and came back to my place and hung out for a few hours.  A good time was had by all.   I also had a very nice time with Spence and Jenny.  We went to a wine tasting in downtown Ft. Collins.  It was really interesting.  You select what type of wine you want, then you buy the grapes to make it. 8 weeks later you come back and bottle it and label it...then take it home.  Very intersting, and a bit expensive!  We then just kind of hung out and enjoyed ourselves, talking about old drunk Spencer days.  The somersaults, the superman, the races against no one.    Today I am going to go see Fahrenheit 9/11...that new documentary by the guy who did Bowling for Columbine.  I have have heard some interesting things, so I will tell you how it goes.  Next weekend is a THREE DAY WEEKEND!!!  YAY!                     Well I am back on the blogging scene.&nbsp; Sorry, totally tired last night and nothing to talk about anyway.&nbsp; Tonight I hooked up with Spencer and Jenny, and they took me out to dinner at Magiano's...a very good italian restaurant.&nbsp; I am pretty sure it is a chain though, so not as special as it could be.&nbsp;&nbsp; The wine was very good though and it was one of the few times that I had bleu cheese and liked it.&nbsp; Very creamy and just happy, without the wrotten cheese feel that I normally get from it.  Work has been going well.&nbsp; My boss busted a contractor today trying to get a freebie out of the owner.&nbsp; It is stuff like that that really is the purpose of us being engineers...to not let the contractor screw over the owner.&nbsp; Anyway, it was pretty exciting to bust him on it...the contractor sunk his head low and walked away from it.&nbsp;   I just found out Pat is pregnant, well the wife anyway...I think.&nbsp; Big congrats on that.&nbsp; Sorry the phone died!&nbsp; Wow, I suppose after all these weddings that have been going on that is the next thing to start happening.  Wow, that's weirder than the weddings.&nbsp; Speaking of which, off to Casper for another one this weekend...so have a good weekend peeps!                       After my burning incidents yesterday with the grill, I thought it best to try something not cooked.  Welcome sushi!  I grew very fond of sushi while I was in California.  Once I got over the initial shock of raw fish, it truly was excellent stuff.  And Wasabi is of the gods!!!  I journeyed down to my local sushi place ( I have been trying to tell you I live in a stupid ritzy area.)  There, while being severely underdressed, I was seated at the bar.  The lady was very nice and gave me a menu of way overpriced raw fish, but I felt I should at least give it a try.  Then she gave me a dinner salad and some chopstiocks.  Intersting, never done that before, but it worked.  Sushi was good, but here was the interesting part.  There were 2 guys sitting next to me exchanging stories about parties and stuff.  One was telling this story about how he hooked up with this concierge of a hotel he was staying at in Paris.  They did the nasty and he woke up the next morning to find all his credit cards and cellphone stolen.  Apparently he chased her down all day long and eventually had her arrested.  I need stories like this!!!  This went on forver.  It was great, remind me to tellyou the full story sometime.                     So I finally got to see Monster starring Charlize Theron.  Wow, amazingly there is a way that Charlize can be unattractive.  All you have to do is give her an guly mask, make her gain some weight then start killing away.    A really interesting movie though.  I can really see why she won the acadamy award.  For once I really do think they made the right choice.  The movie just kind of keeps you hung tight.  I mean I put off eating some icecream cuz I didn't want to pause it and mess up the feel.  Some meeting we had at work this week kinda gave me the spooks (I really have nothing to worry about, but you know me) so I started to look at culinary schools in the area.  I got on one site and asked them to send me some information.  Wow, they really take you serious when you ask that.  I got calls, and they are sending me a book.  If nothing else it would be intersting just to see.  But I kind of doubt it.  A mere $351 per credit hour, and with only a measly 192 credit hours I am sure it would be nice and cheap for me.  hmm, if only...                      So I checked out my stats for my little, boring, nonsense site this evening...and apparently there are more people out there who read this than I thought.  Hi to whomever reads from New York most days, and I mustn't forget you out there in Huntington Beach, CA...or San Jose for that matter.  And the one in Albuquerque has been here since the first post.  Morning bro!  Howdy to all you cool readers in Laramie, and I personally know most of the Casper ones.  I really have no idea who is reading up in Wheatland, but you too deserve a special shoutout.  And I would give my left leg to know who read the blog from Bosler Wyoming.  Yeah, Bosler.    Maybe it is the guy who hid in the school out there with his son for months...or perhaps the bar that always has broken down trucks out front.  Heck, my hope is that whoever lives in that little white house with cars in front that look like they could actually move.  It's funny, you get in a zone where you think that you are the only one reading it.  Guess I should try to start writing something interesting before you all run off!                     The reception started out like most.  The ice sculpture was brimming with shrimp and cocktail sauce.  The cheesedip was covered in walnuts, and the little bubbles were set on the table.  Then I walked by the bar and low and behold the beer was sitting out.  After a couple of those I was feeling fine until a gentleman decided to buy me the biggest shot I had ever seen.  Like 4 shots in one...no longer a shot, but a cup of liquor.    Shot it anyway.  That is when the fun started.  We all drank and just got darn happy.  We danced...a lot, and with everyone.  We asked questions to the grooms parents that should not have been asked (seriously though, how do they feel knowing the deed will be done that night?)  We drank straight from the champagne bottles, we licked the ice sculpture, we danced to more Michael Jackson songs than I even knew had been written. We got older women to dance with us cuz we had danced with both of her daughters (and the trifecta needed to be completed!)   And in the end, we woke up on the couch with a raging headhache.  And it was awesome.  Thanks for a killer time Spence...my sore legs will not soon forget!         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
