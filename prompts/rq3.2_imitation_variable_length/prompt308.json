Fatherhood is the one subject I don't think I will ever truly understand.  In my entire life, I can think of but a handful of good examples what a father should be.  It's really quite sad the acts that come to mind when I think of fathers...  A young man turns his back on his daughter.  He boards a plane ultimately headed overseas on her first birthday, not to return until she is three.  He re-enters her life as if time has stopped while he was abroad.  It hasn't.  He marries and moves away not long after his return.  They never force the issue of visitation.  A step-father takes his anger out on the face of a defenseless 10 year old, leaving her to spend her summer vacation hiding indoors.  He is forced to leave his two sons behind, the only punishment for his crimes.  A 14 year old is sent to live with the father she never really knew.  She has problems that he does not want to understand.  She is angry at the world and takes it out an anyone who is near.  Reacting to her fit of rage, he throws her across the room to prove to her that he is in charge.  She lays there, a crying crumpled mess, her body bruised and batter.  A desperate 15 year old does everything she believes her father wants of her.  She works so hard at school receiving straight As but nearly putting herself in the hospital.  She becomes the ideal child but still he only sees her flaws.  Nothing she does is good enough.  A confused 16 year old, finally allowed to date, has questions and fears about relationships and sex.  Her father's only advice is 'you were a mistake, don't make one yourself.'  She comes home from her first date, terrified her parents will know what she has done.  A bitter 17 year old knows only half truths when it comes to the story of her parents.  She has in her possession the only two existing photographs of her true family.  In the photos, her parents are just barely older than she is that day.  She found out the truth that day, that her father was pushing for adoption, that his father had to force him to be an adult, that he chose to run away.  She had to face him two weeks later.  She has never spoken with him about the things she knows.  A strong and foolishly independent 18 year old wants more out of life than her father believes she can accomplish.  Two days after graduation she walks out of that house forever.  A 21 year old finally returns home, if only to say good-bye to her dying grandfather.  She is still not ready to mend the shredded relationship she has with her father.  She says her good-byes, thinking this would be it.  She does not return for the funeral.  An embarrassed 23 year old places a long distant phone call to give her father the 'good' news, he's going to be a grandfather in a few short months.  She's hurt by the lack of surprise in his voice, it would have been easier if this had been a disappointment.  A few months later a message is left on the father's answering machine... 'Your grandson was born last night.  There are some complications, I'll call you back when we know more.'  A 24 year old wife calls to tell her father about the wedding he was not invited to.  A 26 year old calls her father to tell him that she is all alone.  Her husband left her for another woman.  He turned his back on their young son.  The broken woman this girl has become wants only one thing from her father.  She wants to know that no matter what, he has always loved her, that he always will.  She wants to know that he has always been there, ready to wrap his arms around her, ready to protect her, ready to heal all the hurt she has faced in her harsh world.  A father and a daughter....                 Alright, so I had this amazing dream the other night.  It was romantic, well mostly, it was a touch erotic also.  Which only goes to prove how pathetic my love life truly has become.  But anyway, that's not the point, I was gonna tell ya about this dream.  Of course, I'm gonna have to save the 'good' parts for myself  (wink wink nudge nudge) .    I walk into this fabulously elegant ballroom.  I'm wearing this drop-dead gorgeous dress.  It had this leather corset and black velvet skirts, with lace accents.  Oh, did I mention it was a masquerade ball I was attending.  So I had this mask on, it was that iridescent purple-y black color with feathers, very sexy, very mysterious.  This man walks up and asks me to dance.  He's wearing this 'Phantom of the Opera' type mask so all I can see are his eyes and lips.  And he has this exquisitely tailored tuxedo on, the kind that accentuates the good parts on his impossibly built body.   (Mmm, there's just something about a man in a tux!!!) .  I'm speechless, so of course he takes my hand and leads me to the crowded dance floor.  As we are dancing, he's talking to me and I just can't seem to focus on anything but his lips.  And suddenly he leans in and kisses me.  When I open my eyes, I'm in this fabulous bedroom with a four-poster bed with silk sheets and rose petals scattered everywhere.  And the candles, there's nothing more romantic than candle light.  And then, well, I thinks this is where I'm gonna have to stop with the details.  Let's just say there was a nice hot bubble bath, a bottle of champagne and those lips.  Mmmm, yumm...                  Which Queer Eye Is Right for You?  My Results::: Ted - Food and Wine   Calm, cool, and collected. That's how Ted Allen, your Queer Eye match, handles the dirty dishes, skuzzy kitchens, and hopeless cooks that come his way. Whether he's rolling out phyllo dough or stirring the perfect martini, this gourmet guru never lets you see him sweat. And that tends to be your MO too, even if you'd have a hard time telling the difference between a tea- and a tablespoon.  You've got a meticulous nature and an eye for detail that makes it hard for you not to follow through on anything you set your mind to. And if that means you have to search from store to store to find the perfect purse, cutest shoes, or particular spice, you can bide your time til you find what's right. Ted would be proud.    What's Your Theme Song?  MyResults::: Walking On Sunshine - Katrina and the Waves   Your upbeat approach to life makes 'Walking on Sunshine' the perfect anthem for you. We can see you dancing down the vegetable isle with your grocery cart, smiling at all the checkout clerks. We sure hope you've had your Wheaties to keep up with your perky pace all day long. This happy, horn-driven tune carries you to work every day. And even in those brief lapses when you're not fully on your game, 'Walking On Sunshine' seems to put things in perspective and get you back to your super groove. 'And don't it feel good?' Who cares that this tune was a one-hit wonder for Katrina and the Waves? Even that quality matches your one-of-a-kindness. You're walkin' on sunshine and spreading it wherever you go.   What Kind of Monkey Are You?   My Results::: Chimpanzee   That's right, chimps are the Einsteins of the primate world (so long as you're not counting that species known as human). That's why you might find that you're known as the tinkerer and the 'smarty pants' amongst your friends and co-workers. Like most chimpanzees, you're probably an excellent problem-solver and can often find an answer for any conundrum that presents itself — whether you're trying to escape from your cage, making new tools out of twigs, or figuring out how to lure that cute chimp from the next tree over with your charm and affections.  But beyond your brains, you're also known as gregarious and empathetic — you'd help a little old baboon cross the street and then run off to your next venture.  If you're like your chimp cousins in the wild, you'll also have an interest in homeopathic meds and will believe firmly in being healthy through exercise and play. Many chimps steer toward vegetarianism, though the natural world won't begrudge you a meaty meal if that's more your style.  In an argument, you rarely speak without thinking about the emotional toll it might take on the other person, but because you are such a rational thinker, you rarely find yourself in arguments for very long. You tend to convince people of your thought process and resulting opinion with very little resistance. And for you, the best part of the argument is when you can make up — kissing is one of your favorite activities, and one for which you're known.                   I'm writing this as an adult daughter and I'm sure in 20 years or so, I'll understand the answers to all the questions that I am about to pose.  But for now, as a mother of a two year old I just don't get it.  I'm hoping that this never-ending conflict I have with my mother is only because of a lovely personality clash.  I'm hoping that that is the case and that I won't try to control my son's life when he becomes an adult.  I'm also hoping that my mother is just having a really difficult time letting go of her babies.  I can only imagine how hard it is to suddenly realize that all of your children are adults.  I don't look forward to that day, well, some days I do, but not today.  Today, he wants to cuddle and watch movies and sing and dance and hug and kiss.  Today, I just can't get enough of my little boy.  Well, back to my mother...  I'm 26 frickin years old.  I've been on my own for the last 5 years.  Granted the last 2 were spent with my husband and I sharing a house with my mother, but she wasn't making any decisions on how we lived our lives.  The estranged husband would, no doubt, disagree.  According to him, I still do whatever my mother tells me I should.  I have my own theories on that, but that is most definitely another post.  Now that he is gone, my mother insists that I handle it the way she says I should.  Did I mention she harbors a little bitterness towards men?  Why can't she realize that I am not her?    I guess that is just one of the facts of life.  I've dealt with this long, I'll continue to do so form here on out...  And I'm sure that my son will one day have these same thoughts in regards to me and my mothering.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
