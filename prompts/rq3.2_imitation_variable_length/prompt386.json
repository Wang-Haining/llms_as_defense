Sadly, the same lies and political swipes prevail in the otherwise heartfelt tributes.  The greatest of these lies revolve around the tax cuts of the 1980s: that his tax cuts led to massive deficits and public debt, and that the rich made out like bandits. These lies are easly debunked by anyone who cares to look beyond partisanship and see the facts.  During Reagan's two terms in office: ( urlLink source )   Federal tax revenues rose an inflation adjusted 24 percent.  Income tax revenues, those most directly affected by the Reagan tax cuts, rose more than 16 percent adjusted for inflation.  The top 5 percent of wage earners saw their share of the tax burden increase by 9 percentage points while the top 1 percent saw theirs climb 7 percentage points.  So if tax revenues rose so dramatically, and the rich paid more of it during Reagan's two terms, how then did deficits increase? One word: spending.  While tax revenues rose just over 19 percent, spending increased 22 percent. This increased spending was mostly Cold War defense related and was substantially responsible for the ultimate defeat of the Soviet Union. Moreover, the large-scale reductions in defense spending in the 1990s accounts for nearly all of that decade's deficit reductions.  As this great man passes from life to history, history will begin the judgement of his legacy. One hopes that the facts inform that judgement more than politics.            'A sharply divided Supreme Court upheld key features of the nation's new law intended to lessen the influence of money in politics, ruling Wednesday that the government may ban unlimited donations to political parties... Congress may regulate campaign money to prevent the real or perceived corruption of political candidates, the court ruled in a 5-4 decision. That goal and most of the rules Congress drafted to meet it outweigh limitations on the free speech of candidates and others in politics, the majority said.'  Make no mistake, this is an attack on  your  political freedom and voice, not just on the Big Bad Special interest group, for 'Special Interest Group' is simply a trite euphemism for the community and issue oriented groups we all are members of. Groups such as AARP, NAACP, professional associations, trade unions, and community and religious groups are all covered under this law. You join these groups because, among other reasons, your membership in them effectively magnifies your small voice by combining it with the voices of others who share your views. As individuals we vote and we donate relative pittances to political candidates or parties we believe in. This has little impact on the system. When we combine our voice with others of like mind, however, our voice has a far greater impact.  That 'perceived corruption' the Court is so afraid of is a perception created by the very people who sought this law's passage. The twisted irony of this law is that the very groups shackled by it and so despised by its supporters are the only real way the 'Average American' will ever have a voice equal to the 'Fat Cats'. The effect of this law will be less, not more, power in the hands of average Americans and a near monopoly of power for the politicians who created it. Did you really think they would have it any other way?             'Clark did not say who should try Saddam, but said the trial should be conducted with 'the highest legal standards. There can be absolutely no doubt about the rights of the accused.' '  Are you kidding me? Is this guy serious? This is the first thing that came to his mind when he found out we captured the worst tyrant the world has seen in 50 years? Saddam Hussein is responsible for the deaths of millions, the impoverishment of his own country, and the invasion of two neighboring countries and Clark is more concerned about 'the rights of the accused'? Would it kill him to stand up and applaud an American victory for once? Would it pain him the join the liberated Iraqis and most Americans in celebrating this moment? Of course the war crimes trial must conform to international legal standards, but give me a break. Maybe you could hold off on the legalisms for at least a few hours?  Today's Democrats are as one-track minded as any politicians in modern American politics when it comes to President George W. Bush. That's right Clark, I said PRESIDENT George W. Bush. Because, you see, your party  lost  the 2000 election. Get over it. For once, just once, be an American and stand up and cheer an important American victory. This pathetic bunch of Democrats is going down in a monstrously humiliating defeat next fall because they are so out of touch with what real Americans believe and feel. For that I will stand and cheer.             There is nothing quiet so useless as a Congressional investigative hearing. A dozen or more career politicians sit around asking questions that they already assume the answers to, and make a show of deliberating when their minds are already made up, all for the sake of the cameras sending the images back home to their constitituents who will like to see them 'doing something about it', whatever 'it' happens to be at the moment. What makes it more useless is that very often their only claim to expertise in the matter at hand is that they were elected to office by a few people back in Iowa or North Dakota.  There is no Constitutional mandate for Congress to hold hearings on the misdeeds of corporations or citizens. Our constitution's separation of powers places enforcement of the laws squarely in the hands of the President and the Executive Branch. Congress- the law-making body of the federal government should take a seat and mind its own affairs and let the President and the Executive branch engage in their law-enforcement role. This does not and should not prevent Congress from investigating the Executive branch when warranted, though these too are often no more than political grandstanding. Their investigative role ends at the halls of government and does not extend to the public.    \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
