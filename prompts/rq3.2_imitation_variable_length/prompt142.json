Means I've finally graduated from nerdhood. I've had glasses for ten years, was dependent on them. Now, I'm not. Don't get me wrong, not all people with glasses are nerds....I was, though. So...after a haircut, loosing twenty-five pounds, and getting contacts, I look completely different. I suppose those are the improvements I was talking about....there all on the outside. Funny thing about all this though (and this is for all you philosophers to chew on), is that the closer I get to what society dictates as 'cool', the more depressed I get. Maybe I used to be a nerd, but at least I was a happy nerd, completely oblivious to what others thought about me. Now, I seem to be more sensitive to that as I try to improve myself. It's not that 'peer pressure' is getting to me and will make me do stupid stuff, I just want to be accepted by people. My freshman year in high school, 'reject' was an appropriate term for me. I was completely alone. Now, going into my senior year, I'm no longer an outcast, I have friends, and no body dislikes me because they found that beneath my eccentricities and rather unattractive exterior, I'm a pretty nice guy. But I'm still rejected, mostly by the ladies. yeah, I'm sure some of you are laughing now. But some of you understand. I no longer get those looks of disgust, they'll talk to me and stuff (like I said, no one dislikes me now), but it goes no farther than that. You know, they say that girls aren't as superficial as guys are, and sometimes that's true. not in my case apparently. It's not my personality that stops them....it's what they see on the outside. That's the rejection that hurts the worst.  Wow, i feel really stupid for having written all that. Some of you are laughing at me, I don't care. Some of you are in my exact situation, and can sympathize. Some of you might feel sorry for me, and tell me that things will come out okay in the end, but I've heard all that before, and I don't believe it. I'm a cynical skeptic, and a hopeless romantic all in the same sandwich. I wanna see it happen in my life. I want it in my life. I just don't see it happening for a long time, if ever. Oi, I just need to shut up now.                  Internet's being crazy again. took me awhile to get to this site. I'm gonna eat lunch....get dressed first, then eat....de ja vu? anyway....it's really weird how I only get depressed at night....I've noticed that. I'm usually okay during the day, but at night, I'm just really bad off. Makes me wonder if I do have a medically treatable problem. Of course, there's no getting help with that anyway. My mom would want to know why I think there's something wrong with me, and then she would proceed to deny that there's anything wrong, that I'm making a big deal out of nothing. Of course, who am I to listen to what she says? she's in a constant state of denial about everything, because she's got her own problems. Which, of course, she won't acknowledge. My counselor doesn't know everything yet, may take him awhile to get the whole picture, you know how counselors are. When he does, not really sure if he'll acknowledge a problem or not, it's really hard for me to communicate everything I'm feeling. He might just blow it off, but I don't know. I gotta go eat, that's one thing I do know.                 I'm talking to Audrey again. learning more and more. She agrees with me, with what I said last time. talking about trust this time, I will not forget to save it. she said she trust me. One of the few people outside her family. I'm glad she does. If anyone reads this, please, pray for her. I want her to be able to live life without having to hide her heart behind an armor shell. I want her to know what being loved, and loving, is like, to know what it's like to be surrounded by friends that you trust completely. I was once like her, before Sept. 2003. Now, I know what all that is like, and I would NEVER go back. I want her to be able to see what life is like beyond the armor. I think I know now why she's not interested in getting into any relationships with guys....probably doesn't trust them, because her dad has broken so many promises. I hope she gets past that, and learns what it's like to have that love. heck, I wanna know what that love is like. DAMN!!!!! forgot to save it! it's a conspiracy! I guess my posts on here will have to serve as my notes on the conversations. I need to get Jen in on this....she's our only close mutual female friend. gotta get that perspective. You know, when I'm helping people, I feel better. I don't have to focus on my own problems. It was that way at the forensics camp. I was talking to Stephani about her probs with her boyfriend (now ex), and that was one of the few times when I was completely free of my depression. I'm going bowling tomorrow, hope I did as good as I did last week. 176, 189, 182, that's last week's scores. then I'm going pawnshopping with Jordan. Hopefully there's some good deals out there.                       You’ve beaten me down Bound me up A great chain around my neck You’re pulling me hard Not willing to let me go I pull, you yank I choke and stumble back You just sit and laugh My struggle is weak Your grip is strong This I will concede You’ve got a good hold on me I’m tired, weary I feel like giving up  But if you think you’ve won this fight, I gotta tell ya, you’re wrong  I’m not yours Not past, not present, not future, NOT EVER I belong to God I belong in the light You are the oppressive darkness You haunt my steps You fill my head with lies But I don’t have to listen Because I’m not yours  You’ve taken my friends Dragged them to the dark You’ve got them in your snares They don’t even know it And those you couldn’t trap You placed beyond my reach They cannot end my plight Nor break the chains in sight You want me alone Away from freeing hands Want me to feel abandoned Down falls my spirit But I hear God’s voice calling Gently it says to me, “Do not give up, my child.” And I know, I am His  Exalted God, empower me Break loose the chains, the slave run free Flees to where You are, in the light The chains are strong, and I’ve waited long, But you, O God, can set me free  written 4/21/04                  Decided not to ask her. yeah, I know some people are gonna be disappointed with me, but I realized that I shouldn't be doing what they want, in this case, it's about what I want. In other words, I should be doing it for me, not for them. She's not my type, end of discussion. It was remarkable how much easier it was to breathe once I made that decision. I can just move on. So what is my type, if not the girl I've liked for well over a year? Take note of something. The best relationships that I've seen, dating or marital, is where the couple are people who could just be friends with each other, even if there never was a relationship. Or, it could be said, that they relate like the best of friends, talk like the best of friends, but that there is something deeper between them: love. Let's go even further back. How does one describe a friendship? Well, I could say for you to look at me and any one of my good friends, but considering that the majority of you who read this don't even know me in person, much less have met my friends, that's not good enough. So, friends......friends are people with whom you are extremely comfortable. They are people for whom you do not have to put on a front, because they know you intimately, know most, if not all, of your secrets, your feelings, etc. They know your likes and dislikes. There's a lot more that I could say here. But I really don't need to. Do you remember how you met your best friend? Didn't it just sort of click between you two? That's a good sign in telling if someone might be your type.  So, it might follow logically like this: If I were to find a girl, we got along really well, and I liked her, that's a really good combination, and it suggests that that might be a good time to see if the interest is mutual. I mean, I'm not going to flat out ask that question, but at that point I'd ask her out. But that first part's the real trick: finding both in the same person. Because, if I think hard about that, there are few people who fit that bill....actually, none. Or, rather, there are some, but I don't have ask them to know that they won't go out with me. And it really has nothing to do with me. Either they're already hooked up with someone else, or they're just not interested in going out with anyone, period. A frustrating reality. But, new school year's coming, that means new people. so, we'll just have to see what these new people are like. you never know, this could be a good year for me..... Oh, yeah, before I forget, never try to sleep around overly sociable large dogs. Doesn't work, trust me.                  As in, last week before school starts. really bites. I went and registered yesterday. finally have a top locker. But what's really weird is my schedule. Listen to this. Before 1st period, I have band. 1st period is the college math class, then I have the college spanish class, then AP Calculus, then Honors English, then Bible, then the college english class, then chorus. So, two math classes and two english classes. I don't mind the math so much as I do the english. My psychiatrist increased my meds. The way he was talking, it sounded like he knew that what he had me on wasn't going to be enough, that it was just a trial run to test for side effects. Wish he'd have told me that instead of acting like I really didn't have a problem. Hey, I'm sitting here peeling skin off my shoulder. As if I didn't have anything better to do. Which I do. I have to write up a flyer for the spaghetti dinner fundraiser for my mission trip. Then, I have to go distribute these. what fun. I hate talking to strangers. Especially because it's awkward to go into a place of business, and tell them you're not looking to buy anything, but to sell them something. then there's the problem of collecting the money. Since I'm doing this by flyer, it will be a little trickier. I'll just have to manage.                 yeah, it's late, and I'm tired, but I'm doin this. Went to this place with Jennifer, a bunch of people playing bluegrass music. it was pretty cool, this one guy told me to bring my guitar next time, said he'd show me how to play some stuff. Then other guy, he smashed a stink bomb right next to me, it was only the size of a pill, but DUDE.....that was putrid. Jen nearly puked. We left right after that. She dropped me off here, and I showed her that new song that I wrote. Noticed how beautiful she is, depressed me a little. I mean, she's just a friend, a really good one at that, but I couldn't help envying Chris M. a little. oh well. I'm over it now. I'm lucky to have her as a friend, and I need to keep my outlook on life positive, I realize that. That outlook says that there is someone out there for me that is better for me than anyone else, and that it won't be too much longer before I find her. I really don't have the energy to say any thing else tonight, I'm tired, so I'm outta here.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
