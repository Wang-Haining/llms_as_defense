  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic:\n\n             Just finished reading  Toxin , a novel about a dangerous E. coli infection, by Robin Cook.&nbsp; I enjoyed it because it involves medical drama.&nbsp; You might want to read this together with a non-fiction 'exposé' about the fast food industry,  Fast Food Nation , by Eric Schlosser.&nbsp; Interesting to read the fictional account of slaughterhouse operations and then&nbsp;compare it&nbsp;to&nbsp;the non-fiction description.&nbsp; Scary.&nbsp; Yet, still, I happily eat meat.&nbsp; Go figure.   Another (related) book I just finished which was really intriguing was  The Medical Detectives , by Berton Roueché, kindly given to me by a colleague, after noting my interest in such things.&nbsp; It's a collection of accounts of investigations, from the 1940s thru the 1980s, of all sorts of mysterious ailments and their resolutions (or not...).&nbsp; VERY interesting.&nbsp; My question&nbsp;is:&nbsp; &nbsp;how have treatments, diagnoses, methodology, technology changed/improved the chances of resolution since then, and how?&nbsp;             \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
