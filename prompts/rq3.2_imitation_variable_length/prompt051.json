Oh, first, let me just give a little background here, for anyone who does not know me: I work in retail. A book store to be exact. We get all sorts of different people who come in the store from day to day. About 95% of them are annoying. And out of that 95%, about maybe 35% are the people who are annoying because they talk too much. Like the old man who came in today. He comes in every once in a while and buys porn magazines. Usually, he will talk to anyone and everyone about nothing...probably to direct our attention away from the fact he's buying Big Black Butt or something. Anyway, so he came in to the store twice today and talked our ears off. He was all, 'Blah blah blah, blah blah blah blah. Blah, blah blah blah!' That was the first time he came in. The second time he came in, he said, 'You know what you need to watch out for? The HIV. That is not a good thing. Liberace had a lover. He got HIV from him, and died. But before he died, he sued the guy who gave him HIV...even though he was a homo too.' And then he told me how John F. Kennedy Jr. died because his wife decided to call someone on her cell phone while they were flying in the plane. Eventually, he shut the hell up and bought porn.  Okay, so here is an update on the tetanus crisis: My jaw still hurts. And my neck hurts too. And occasionally my back. How long does it take for tetanus to kill you? And can I get tetanus, even though I don't recall having ever cut myself recently? And is there a way to cure my hypochondriac-ism?

Scary Shit 2: More Scary Shit     by Amanda   'I can't believe it has been a whole day since Candie was killed,' said Candie Barr's less-hot best friend Britney Smith. 'It feels like it was just a couple of hours ago.'  'I know,' said Dirk Kirkland, Britney's good-looking football player boyfriend. 'I can't believe she was brutally murdered by a man with a knife.'  'That must have sucked,' said Britney. They nodded in agreement.  'Would you like to have sex tonight?' asked Dirk.  Britney, a virgin, gasped. 'OMG!'  'What?' asked Dirk.  'I can't believe you would ask me if I wanted to have sex with you! I am a virgin!' Britney exclaimed.  'Yeah, so? You have to become a non-virgin sometime. Why not tonight?' asked hunky Dirk.  'Duh!' said Britney. 'There is a killer on the loose! Killers don't kill virgins!'  'Oh,' said Dirk. 'You're right. I guess we can wait until after this guy is caught to have sex.'   LATER THAT EVENING....     Dirk and Britney went to a party. 'Would you like something to drink?' Dirk asked Britney.  'Sure,' said Britney.  Dirk went over and got some fruit punch. He spiked it with alcohol. He then brought it back to Britney and she drank it. After about 3 cups of fruit punch, Britney got drunk, and Dirk led her up the stairs to a spare bedroom, where he proceeded to convince her to have sex with him.  They had sex.  Afterwards, they got dressed and went downstairs, where the party had started to break up. 'That was a lot of fun,' Britney admitted.  'I know,' agreed Dirk. 'Are you ready to leave?'  'Yes,' said Britney. 'But first I need to go outside in the secluded back yard all by myself.'  'Okay,' said Dirk.  Britney went out the back door, and into the backyard, where there was nobody around. All of a sudden, Man With The Knife jumped out from nowhere and stabbed Britney in the shoulder.  'Agghhh!' Britney screamed loudly. She fell to the ground.  Man With The Knife stabbed her again in the abdomen, just as Dirk came out the back door to see what was going on. 'OMG!' he yelled as he saw what had happened. Quickly, Man With The Knife ran away.  Dirk ran over to Britney, who was barely alive anymore. 'Honey! You've been stabbed!'  'This is all your fault,' Britney said in a weak voice. 'If you hadn't spiked my drink and made me have sex with you, he wouldn't have stabbed me. I told you: killers don't kill virgins.' Britney then died.  Realizing she was probably right, Dirk said, 'Oops.'    THE END   I'm not sure. I might make this a trilogy. It depends on how positive my feedback is.                         I have finally written the third installment of my immensley popular 'Scary Shit' series. I hope it was worth the wait!    Scary Shit 3: Twist Ending   by Amanda   One week ago today, the beautiful, fairly large-breasted woman of Dirk Kirkland's life (Britney Smith) was brutally murdered -  stabbed visciously by an unkown Man With The Knife, soon after Britney and Dirk had passionate mind-blowing sex.  Dirk was now dating Samantha Banger - the most popular girl in school. Well...the most popular now that the  other  two most popular girls in school had been hacked to death.  'I feel so sad for Britney and Candie,' said Samantha. Candie was Man With The Knife's first victim, and also Samantha's half cousin twice-removed. 'I truly believe they are in Heaven now, looking down upon us.'   Uh oh , thought Dirk. If Britney was looking down upon them, then she probably saw him and Samantha in the shower together last night. 'Yeah,' Dirk said, clearing his throat, 'Heaven.'  'Want to go out on a date tonight?' asked Samantha. 'We could head up to Lover's Lane and make out. You can touch my boobs. Again.'  'Uh...' said Dirk nervously. 'That sounds great. But is it such a good idea for us to be roaming around after dark, with a serial killer on the loose?'  Samantha shrugged. 'Sure, why not?'  'Okay then,' Dirk said.    LATER THAT EVENING...    Dirk drove up to Lover's Lane, where he would eventually make out with Samantha and touch her boobs. He parked the car. They were the only ones up there that evening.  'I'll be right back,' said Samantha flirtaciously.  'Okay!' said Dirk excitedly. He couldn't wait to touch her boobs.  Samantha got out of the car. Dirk realized afterwards that it was very stupid to let her go out into the dark, menacing, isolated world without him, but he had complete faith that nothing bad would happen to h-  'AGHHHHH!' somebody screamed.  Dirk recognized the scream as Samantha. 'Oh noes!' he cried. Quickly, he exited the car and followed the screams. As he ran, terrible thoughts ran through his head - what if something bad happened to Samantha? He wouldn't get to make out with her. He wouldn't get to touch her boobs. Well actually, he could still touch her boobs, even if she were murdered, which was cool.  'I'm coming sweetie!!!' he yelled bravely.  Finally, he found her...on the ground...completely still. 'Oh no,' he muttered. 'You've been murdered!' He  frowned. He  paused for a moment of silence, in memory of Samantha, and then reached out to touch her boob.  But before his hand could reach her bosom, a hand shot out and grabbed his arm.  Her  hand. Samantha's hand.  'WTF?!' said Dirk in a very confused voice.  Samantha smiled up at him, and then her other arm shot out. Her hand was holding a knife.  Dirk gasped frightenedly and jumped up  and backed away from her. 'OMG! Samantha! What are you doing with that knife?'  'I'm the killer,' said Samantha.  'Oh,' said Dirk. 'But why? Why did you do it?'  'Because,' said Samantha. 'I wanted to be the most popular girl in school. Candie was the most popular girl, so I killed her. However, I had no idea that her death would mean that  Britney  would then be considered the most popular girl. So...I killed her too. Now  I'm  the most popular girl in school! Yay!'  This all made sense to Dirk. 'Okay. So then why are you going to kill  me ?'  Samantha laughed. 'Oh, I'm not going to kill you, silly. Look! This knife isn't even real! It's one of those retractable rubber knives! LOL!' She stuck the retractable rubber knife into her abdomen and laughed.  'OH! Hahahahaha!' Dirk said in relieved voice. He and Samantha started walking back towards his fancy, really expensive car. 'So...wait a second. There is still something about this whole thing that is bothering me.'  'Yes, snookums?' Samantha said, giving Dirk a peck on the cheek.  'Well...the killer was always described as a male...you know...The  Man  With The Knife. Why is that, I wonder?' Dirk looked confused.  Samantha smiled. 'Oh. That. Right. Well...you see...I used to be Samuel Banger. I got a sex change two years ago. So technically...I am a man.'  ' Ohhhh ,' Dirk said, starting to understand it all. Suddenly, he felt very sick to his stomach.   The End.                          It's called  Star !   We just got it in today at the bookstore where I work. When you take off the book's jacket, on the other side of it there is a centerfold poster of Ms. Anderson herself, completely naked (with the exception of a few strategically placed star stickers).   Of course, when reading the About the Author note on the back of the jacket, it is pointed out to us that she had a ghostwriter. Big surprise.   But tell me something...does the fact that Pamela Anderson wrote a novel make you think that  you  could write one too? Cuz that's exactly what it made  me  think. In case anyone cares, I've always wanted to be a writer. I've been fooling around with it ever since I was a wee little girl. I used to write novels. Well...but I never finished any of them. I wrote them all in high school, when I was going through my embarassing teeny-bopper phase. So now when I take them out and read them, I cringe. I usually would stop writing around page 150, when it would occur to me that my dialogue sucked, my characters were annoying, and the plot was non-existent. Now, I can't even write a whole page. It's so sad, considering that becoming a published author is really my only goal in life.   But back to Pam. People...this is even worse than that time Britney Spears wrote a novel. At least&nbsp;  she  had the decency to admit that it belonged in the Young Readers' section. I'm sure the only thing keeping  Star  from being in the children's section is the sex and implants. Otherwise, I'm pretty sure it's easy enough for my friend's 3-week-old son to read. Not that he'd want to, mind you.                           So today is my doctor's appointment, and needless to say, I'm kind of nervous. Of course, I am afraid he is going to take one look in my throat and tell me that I have a tumor, and that I only have about 6 more months left to live. You see, it's not only the lump that has been concerning me. I've had things going on for the past few months - things that I have ignored because I hate going to see the doctor. Now I'm just afraid I am going to find out there is something terribly wrong with me, and that it is too late to have it reversed because I waited too long to have it checked out.... *Sigh*  I need to take my mind off of this. What is a good way to do that? Oh yeah - work! I have to leave in less than an hour, and work up until 45 minutes before my appointment. I guess work is a good way to take one's mind off of something like this. At least I will get to work with my boyfriend for a couple of hours beforehand. He helps to calm  my nerves a little bit. That poor boy puts up with A LOT when it comes to being my boyfriend. And he does it without whining or complaining. He really, truly is the best thing that has ever happened to me. *kiss kiss, babe*       \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
