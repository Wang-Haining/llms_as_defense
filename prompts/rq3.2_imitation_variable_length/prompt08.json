At work Mara came so we played Spit.. what a great time. Then I played Al in spit and lost..and then in checkers.. and i lost again. But whatever it was fun lol. After work I had an orthodontist apt. which was not cool. He said that i have a problem with the way I swallow? how dare he! Well anyway neither of my retainers fit and i'm not getting new ones which is gay.. my teeth are probally going to move and I'm gonna be pissed and if he thinks he's getting me to put braces on again he's joking himself.   After that I went for a run .. a long one. It was exactly 50 minutes. I dont know how far really but on my schedual I'm gonna write 5 cause I'm suposta do that one day this week. Then I did some things that I was suposta be doing all summer, like step-ups and the heel-raise series. So I'm probally gonna be sore tomorrow.   I beleive tonight I'm going to Hoop City for the Hannan Varsity games, both girls and boys. The only person that i think will be playing is Eileen and i'm not even sure but I'll finish when I get back.    Oasis- Breakfast At Tiffanys   'You say the world has come between us, our lives have come between us. Still I know you just dont care.'                      WOW I just realized I have like  3 days to pack for a week of 'cadet camp' (boot camp) which i'm not personally looking foreward to. I have to make sure i dont bring anything on the 'Do not bring' list .. like a watch god-forbid i know what time it is. But the second week is Seaside Park with eileen! So i have to pack&nbsp;practically all of my clothes for our hott nights up on the boardwalk meeting as many people as possible. Keeping the seperate suitcases will be diffucult cause i am deffinately not the most organized one. Now on to my day..  The park was insane today. Matt's still mad at me and since it rained the wholee day the kids were all under the pavilloin and by 12 they just we're crazy. The volume level was so loud. I think cassie just left for a while cause she couldnt take it. The consulers ordered food.. and mine was forgotten =\\&nbsp; So me and erin went up to Dino's and i had to pay for it again..grr. But after the crazy day i decided to go for a nice run. Of course it started pouring but whatever.. i like the rain so i kept going. I was actually went on Drakes Lane and on Bridge St then around pignatti so it was a lil different. Then since i was completly soaked i jumped in my pool and layed on a raft while it was raining haha. I got on the trampoline and bounced for like a minute and then i pulled my neck so I got off. I had to fight for the shower which i'm not used to. Steven won. Tonight i wanted to do something but i just started getting all my clothes together cause i realized i dont have much time for that. So here's to the rest of my week in Old Forge and a good Xmas in July (yea a little late) at the park tomorrow.    Led Zeppelin- Goin to California &nbsp; 'Someone told me there's a girl out there with love in her eyes and flowers in her hair. Took my chances on a big jet plane. Never let 'em tell you that they are the same'                       haha well today was deffinately a good one. Work was fine, last day is tomorrow so the pizza party is after but we're limited to like 6 trays cause last year we went crazy and i beleive the bill was like $206 and j. mac said he could have a banquet with that much.&nbsp;Whatever thoo. Bobby put ice down my shirt and no one did anything the whole day. He got really pissy and left like 7 times. Too bad he just drove around the block. Then he threw trail mix at me and i was like Bobby! i didn't do anything all day .. and he interrupted me and was like exactly! You havent done any thing all month except flirt with Al. So i yelled shut up and was a little embarrassed cause everyone knows it was true but i honestly dont care. Tomorrow will probally be the last day i see him for a year tho and i think i heard him mutter something about not dating sophmores so i was like .. whateverr.. After Salerno's i think Erin, Katie,and Xtina are comming over so that will be fun of course.     &nbsp;  I layed outside for a while today and painted my nails. Then i started packing and i'm deffinately not gonna have all my shit together by saturday morning omg. I cant wait for the beach tho. Me and eileen are gonna tear it up! I feel bad tho because carissa is going the same week or she was suposta and she was gonna bring me. But i'm going so she has nobody to bring. =\\&nbsp; We talked that over a little and came up with nothing.. So she said she's not going which makes me feel worse cause i could be taking her but idk. I'm gonna have a good time no matter what tho... Tonight i had Anna, Mackenzie, Leah, Tara, and Carissa over and we swam and went on the trampoline and that's always a good time. I'm glad i got to chill with all of them before i go away. I also got to talk to Timmy Washo on the phone and i just remembered how much i missed him! I think that was the first time i talked to him all summer and it was for like one miute. That's alrite tho. It's something to look foreward to with the school year even tho i cant beleive i just said that haha. Well i'm gonna go and i shall update later.     &nbsp;   Phantom Planet- California &nbsp; 'On the stereo listen as we go. Nothing's gonna stop me now. California, here we come, right back where we started from'                         haha well  today was quite an experience. In the afternoon&nbsp;my cousins came over and Angelina went online on the American Girl Doll website. While she was on that carissa called me from Atlantic City and i told her that. Then we started reminising on the dolls we used to play with. I asked my mom to get it outta the back-back closet and found that the cool thing to have when i was 10(ish?) was  Magic Attic  Dolls! So i started playing with mine. Her name is Rose and carissa has the same one. We decided that when she comes back we're gonna play with them together and buy clothes for them.. because they are sold on the streets of scranton haha. Then tonight I went to some festival/picnic i dont even know what it was haha. I think it was in pistton tho. I went with Mandie, Heath, and Matt who all some of my favorite people in the world! While we were there we called about every other person 'dirty' and that became the word of the day. I beleive that i started it haah but it was just an overall good time so it doesnt matter. When we were in Mandie's car planning on going home we had a little problem.. the car battery was dead! So she called her mom and they were going to come jump us. For the time being we tried to push the car... in the rain of course. It always rains at times like this haha. But that didn't work. I rang on the doorbell of the house we were in front of but nobody answered. A car was parked in front of ours so even if Mandie's mom came she would have had to go in the middle of the road for the jumper cables to reach. Then the lady who's car it was came (she was at the picnic) and she left and Mandie's mom came so it was all good. Her brother (who's 15) did all the hard work because Matt didn't know what he was doing. haha but Now i can say that i know how to jump a car so it was a good experience. But that's it for tonight. I have camp tomorrow so Ill update then =)&nbsp;   I got a country song that I'm rockin out too.. my love  Tim McGraw.  It's a new one by him so I give it my approval. 'I became a friend, a friend would like to have...Some day I hope you get the chance to  Live like you are Dying '&nbsp;&nbsp; .. amazing song that reminds me of my counrty lovin' days                      alrite well nobody came over tonight so i was ..lets say upset at first. But i didn't really talk to Mandie and Heath so whatever. I ended up going for a run at 9 and it was really good but then I started to feel sick so i walked some and then finished up. It was getting kind of scary tho because i felt like someone was following me and the srteets around me have very few street lights..and also things were making weird noises that i didn't like. Anyway on my XC schudual i'm writing that i did 3 even tho it was probally less because i was suposta to 5 one day this week and i didn't do that =\\  I think i'm gonna ask Carolyn if she wants to run with me when i have to do long ones like that. I feel bad not asking Krissie but i dont think I could keep up..I probally will ask tho.   I have work again .. 15 days left. just think it's all going towards my car which at the moment i want a white Jeep but we'll see how long that lasts and if i like it after i go for a test drive lol .. xoxo -Casey         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
