I've had some fruitful experiences to pull from so I hope you all enjoy!   1.  Kim Basinger's performance in 'The Door in the Floor'-i found the movie to be really enjoyable.  the tone is all over the place, but i kind of got why.  it was too messy to be done without purpose and i thought it excentuated the deconstruction of all the relationships within the story.  Jeff Bridges is fantastic  and the kid who plays his assistant is a good straight character.  But Kim Basinger gets props for her courageousness.  She allows herself to be bent over the end of a bed, completely naked, getting it from behind by this young kid.  What happened to the Kim Basinger that used a body double during '9 1/2' weeks?  I like this new one a whole lot better.  Round of applause to another fine older woman bearing it all.    2.  The first 5 minutes of 'She Hate Me' (after the credits)-while the movie drags on and spike takes on any topic that seemingly jumped in to his head while writing the picture, these first 5 minutes have 2 of the best shots in cinema so far this year that last together, maybe, 10 seconds.  Spike assaults the viewer for the rest of the movie with what is a modern family, who are the real criminals in the US, the malleability of sexual orientation, and of course, the black man's role in all of this.  Come for the first 5 minutes, stay for the girl on girl action.    3.  'The Throes' Two Gallants-I've probably mentioned them to almost everyone by now, but I'm going to write it on here just in case I missed a few of you.  http://www.twogallants.com  Yea, it is amazing stuff.  Please check out the two MP3s they have up on the page.  Well worth the time and the album is well worth your money.  Smart, beautiful storytelling.    4.  Greg Rucka- a great comic book writer ('Queen and Country', 'Gotham Central') who i had the pleasure to meet at Comic-Con 2004 this past saturday.  He was the first person who's booth i went up to and in all the excitement i forgot how to spell my name.  It took me a good minute or two to figure it out.  If i ever thought i wasn't a nerd, i was brought back to the harsh reality that i am indeed indubitably a nerd.  One that felt a kinship and belonging to all the people that donned costumes for the convetion.    5.  Kevin Connolly-plays Eric in HBO's continually underwhelming 'Entourage'.  I don't know why, but i think he does a great job with such a shitty part.  he seems the most at ease of all the cast (and maybe i end up liking him because of the situation he's in:  saddled next to truly awful actors plaing truly awful characters).  i'd like to see him given a good part.  he wasn't bad in 'John Q' (another awful mess).  I dunno.  I will continue  to watch the show to see if they can get a new writer or 2 in there and give  these characters something more to do.                     For anyone that actually read the paper, i must say that i missed a whole hell of a lot of subtext way back when i wrote the paper.  jean looking for a new father figure was one of them.  i could throw in freud now and play up the role switching a bit.  but i realized how un-me that paper is.  i didn't like the movie at all and i should have written why.  but i was always afraid in school of going against the professor and damning myself in to academic exile by doing so (tim understands whenever i bring up geller, and i still to this day should have pushed him in to an argument about several topics).  i guess i just noticed that i don't have any balls.  and continue not to have any in pretty much most aspects of what i do.  only unless i'm pushed to the edge do i stick up for what i believe in.  especially with women, writing, and making movies i have no confidence in any of it.  i go through things being a watcher and never really being able to articulate any of those experiences in to helping myself get better at them.  what difference does it make that i've seen all the coen bros. movies if i can't even begin to write a script myself?    i'm going to buy comic books and go to the flea market.    everyone have a rockin day,  pl                 Brewed and Bottled by the Huyghe Brewery Melle/Ghent, Belgium&nbsp; Family Owned Since 1654&nbsp; 1 Pint 9.1 Fl oz.

I'm sure it enlightened each and every one of you readers ('which literally means black film').  Secondly, I got a bit confused as to who was being 'glib, smug, and hermetically sealed', so if someone could help me out with that...   OF COURSE THE 400 BLOWS IS BETTER THAN BARBERSHOP 2.  Listen, if you want to get all silly and shit, fine, then i will stop the discussion right now.    How was 'o, Brother' an 'ominous sign of what's to come'?  You are telling me you had in mind their career trajectory after seeing that film?  I highly doubt that.    I've seen one (1) preston sturges movie and that is 'the lady eve'.  I don't think that the coens emulate any one director or source as i have seen.  I don't seen any resemblence of 'the lady eve' in raising arizona, barton fink, miller's crossing, or the big lebowski.  I do see tons of hardboiled writer's in the mix, from james m. cain to dashiell hammett (who they took the basic idea for miller's crossing from) to the one you keep mentioning ray chandler.  The 'aping' of the big sleep as you say isn't nearly as aggregious as QT's prison sodomy of 'city on fire'.  at least they made the characters different    Here's the thing with Labute and Smith, for better or worse, they come up with their own ideas in both plot and dialogue.  QT just comes up with the dialogue.  QT has more of an aesthetic than those other two combined and to the 10th exponent, but it still doesn't change the fact that he takes more than fair amounts from other sources.    OK, i grow weary of this.  I can't form any more thoughts other than this final subjective opinion: I look forward to every new coen bros. movie with anticipation and i look forward to every new QT movie with skepticism.    I saw Chronicles of Riddick today and it was not too bad.  the production design and art direction are really impressive.  Some of the dialogue was good, but it gave no backstory to the bad dudes at all, nor even the Riddick character really.  I'd like to see what Twohy would do with the 3rd Star Wars movie.  I leave that fun thought for everyone.                        \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
