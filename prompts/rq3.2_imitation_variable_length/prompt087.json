Chicken and beef fried rice and crab   Rangoon  ’s… good stuff.    I drive home and decide to stop and check on Harry potter(the toad) and he or rather she is doing fine…I didn’t think she was eating, but I put more crickets in there and    I actually saw her eat one… she gets really still then jumps on them and eats em.. I didn’t see any tongues whipping out or anything… if I hadn’t been staring at the cage I would have missed it…I got online and found out that she is a southern wood house toad. And apparently all toads are poisonous they have a gland behind their    eyes and behind where their ears should be…..so gotta was the hands after every encounter with the amphibian…and    the males I guess have darker throats, that’s how I know that it’s a girl.. Cause it’s pretty white… but enough about the female TOAD CALLED HARRY POTTER… I WENT HOME AFTER HANGING WITH GRANDMA and SEBASTIEN AND WATCHED NICHOLAS NICKELBY AND THAT GUY IN THE MOVIE IS HOT……that is all I have to say….and    of course by that time it was    like 2 o’clock in the morning…I know I shouldn’t stay up that late, but sometimes it happens.     So I get in to work this morning with a surprise, chiffon has put her two week notice in. I am moving up to processor and Deja is taking over all her files... I am so excited about this change... we have to find a receptionist pretty quick... I am excited for both me and chiffon, now she can be happy at her job and I can too, because I won’t be tired of doing the same thing over and over. Know what I mean? Well I am going to get back to work…. laters                           Dreadfully sorry I did not jot my thoughts yester. It has been like super busy at work, even now I am busy, but I feel like I am neglecting my thoughts, they just keep swirling around in my head….of course now it is a hour and a half later….I went to scholtskyies…I don’t know how to spell it…oh and now I just got some turkey in my key board great…ok I got it out…I am ready to get our new receptionist in here so I can train them.. Guess who it is going to be…Les Breedlove...Miranda’s husband... he is such a sweetie….i think he is going to be great… he is a very warm person… harrietta potter is doing good... she is getting a bigger appetite and I think she likes to watch tv.. it’s too funny she stays down at the end of her cage(the one closest to TV) and doesn’t leave from there…I find it immensely funny… and I got home after my ferry had dropped me my house, because of all the flippin rain. Our lake in the back yard is rather nice, you’ll have to come see it soon….there was so much water it was running over the back porch, it was up over my ankles…..      Tomorrow night we are supposed to be going to see m.night Shamalon’s (misp) the village, I am not so sure about it... I am skeerd…; I will get back to work now... because I have dallied enough…     But neways.                            \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
