I got a microphone in the mail. I spent the night at my sister's last night. My walk that I took yesterday caused me to become scratched and bitten. Rebekah's birthday was a couple days ago. I put some wildflowers on the table......  Ok, are you annoyed yet? I know I am, so enough of that. I'm so glad it's finally cooled off outside. I was practically dying there for awhile, but at least I had the lake to cool me off. There actually was a purpose of the first paragragh. It was a way to say what I did without having to take too long. I'm not feeling very motivated to blog right now I guess.  We were on the way home from the beach and I was like, 'What if your name was Sandy Globsky?' It was the first random thing I've said in awhile. I'm not really a random type of person. I'm really bad at that awkward silence so say random words game. By the time I think of something random it's too late. Oh well I guess it's ok to not be so random.  I had a sort of revelation yesterday. We watched a couple of movies that weren't the greatest. I was thinking that I shouldn't have watched them, but I think it's not just about preventing yourself from doing things it's about how you choose to respond to them. I don't know it was just a thought and I think I'm confusing myself even. My mood is really weird right now I guess.... Tomorrow we have bible study and I hope it's actually good and I hope no one acts stupid and I'll try not to. Yes, I know that I can be one of those that disturbs it and I'm going to concentrate this time. We also need to talk about having a youth rally or something and discuss Cedar Point plans.  Ok, I'm going to stop now.... this one post took me like 20 minutes... I think I'm in slow motion.                  So last night I got a call from Angie and she wanted me to babysit today so I said I would.&nbsp; I had to get up at 7 in order to be there on time, but I only had to stay til 2.&nbsp; It was ok... not bad but not exactly fun.&nbsp; I like Chad and Angie's kids.&nbsp; After that I went home.&nbsp; Pretty boring... but at least I made some money and helped Angie out.&nbsp; Wow at least I'm going shopping tomorrow and I'll actually have some money and do something fun.&nbsp; I forgot how&nbsp;unfun working actually was.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I've finally decided which senior pictures I'm getting... but I'm not telling... it's a suprise. &nbsp; Today I've been wondering... who all keeps beeping when they go by my house?&nbsp; Ok I know Ronnie does... and once I think it was Tom, but we get like 20 beeps a day... seriously.&nbsp; Sometimes I see the vehicle and it's like wow I don't know anyone with a truck like that or I've never seen that car in my life.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't understand.&nbsp; Is there this sign that says : Please Beep at Our House?&nbsp; One day my brother was like... I think people see my car here and beep and I was like don't flatter yourself, they beep just as much when you're not here.&nbsp; But anyway... If you have any idea who keeps beeping at our house let me know.                  So I decided to get a blog because I thought it would be cooler than just having a written journal.  I'm not sure how much I'll remember to post in it, but hopefully at least once a week.  In case you don't know me here's some background: I'm 17, I have curly blonde hair, and I'm a christian.  Well I guess that's enough background for now, so I'll start my actual post.  I just got back from being a counselor at Bible Memory Camp.  It was so awesome.  BethAnne and I had eight 4th grade girls.  At first I wasn't so sure how well it was gonna work, but it turned out awesome.  By the end of the week, everyone seemed so close to God.  Almost everyone made new commitments.  I became so close to the other campers and counselors that it was really hard to say goodbye.  I think I hugged the other girl counselors like 80 times each.  So much happened it's hard to write it all.  One thing that was cool was how 4 of the girl counselors dressed for banquet night.  Three of us have curly hair and BethAnne has really long hair so we decided to from our hair and wear mismatched clothes.  Let's just say we were definitely the center of attention.  We looked soo awesome.  I'm gonna miss them a lot.  At least I'll get to see most of them when I go to high school camp.  We're gonna try to meet at Holly's house the Saturday before it so that we can hang out before camp.  It was really great, but I am glad to be home and relax for awhile.  I'll write more about it later, but that's all for now.  Peace out.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
