On a very rainy Fourth of July, I saw  urlLink Spiderman 2  in the theater.  I had never since the first installment of this comic book adaptation, but my choices were very limited: Shrek 2 or The Stepford Wives.  I would like to think that I chose the best of three evils.  Anyway, it's a basic comic book story with the exception that Spiderman is conflicted.  Oh, he's so sad and mopey.  Totally emo, only he's a superhero type guy and doesn't want to love any one because then they'll be in danger.  (Say it with me: Awww.)  So he pushes away Mary Jane for her sake.  And gives up being Spiderman to be normal Peter Parker.  But then Doc Oc -- some freaked out Alfred Molina who has been taken over by four robotic arms.  And he wants to create some big energy source -- because his love has been taken away from him!  The best part of the movie has to be  urlLink J.K. Simmons  as J. Jonah Jameson, the crazy editor-in-chief of the Daily Bugel.  He manages to come across as the stereotypical 1940s editor -- chomping his cigar and everything.  His scenes were the funniest bits out of a very mopey movie.  Yes, Roger Ebert gave it  urlLink four stars , but I honestly think he steered me wrong.  Or perhaps I will never appreciate the superhero genre of movies.            I finally watched  urlLink Saving Private Ryan  today.  What a powerful movie.  I’m actually kind of glad that I didn’t see it in the theater – it was very moving to see, but I think it would have been even more overwhelming if I had seen it ten feet high in the dark with no distractions.  I almost had the opportunity to see it when it came out – my dad picked me up one weekend when I came home from school in Milwaukee, and it was playing at a second run theater.  I was the only person in the family who would go see it with him, but when we got to theater, it had stopped showing, despite what the sign outside said.  So, six years later, I finally saw it.  I had heard about the first twenty minutes and the graphic carnage it showed of the D-Day landing at Omaha Beach.  It lived up to its reputation.  The senselessness of war became obvious as I watched the men try to get on the beach and just die, creating piles of bodies.  I had heard about the beaches being washed with blood, but the movie made it real.  The moments of silence – as I later learned were supposed to be Tom Hank’s character’s moments of deafness – seemed poignant and almost worse than hearing the whiz of bullets and explosions.  What I imagined was going on was almost worse – and it seemed to point out the hopelessness of war, how it doesn’t make any sense.  The second act – when Hanks and company go off in search of Private Ryan – proved to be the typical narrative of a WWII movie.  Although, I might say, it was rather refreshing to have average, normal, what I would think are representative soldiers, instead of a cast of characters like many of my other favorite WWII movies (The Dirty Dozen, The Great Escape, etc.).  I read  urlLink Ebert’s review  of the movie afterwards, and I thought his observation that the translator (who I totally thought was  urlLink Henry Thomas  – he and  urlLink Jeremy Davies  could be twins!) was the point of entry for him into the movie.  I agreed – I felt that if I were in a war, I would be the civilian unprepared for the realities of actual fighting.  His confusion with the war – and especially his expectations for the company to accept him – gave me a way to understand how to come to terms with the rest of the film.  The third act – after Ryan is found and the company defends the bridge was probably the most interesting.  After recently seen The Bridge of the River Kwai, I found this part of protecting a bridge fairly interesting.  And I began to identify the characters more strongly – they had actually bonded before the Germans came.  I understood the fighting in vague terms – what they were trying to defend and how their movements affected one another.  Although I was slightly disturbed by my reaction to the translator’s inability to fight with the Germans – I kept urging him to go upstairs and save his comrades.  Well, this wasn’t a Hollywood movie, and he couldn’t manage to pull himself together until it was too late.  Saving Private Ryan was a great movie – one that I don’t think I will soon forget.  It makes me think about war differently, although I still believe that WWII is the main touchstone of the 20th century for Americans.  It is hard to watch a movie about a war right now and not think about the differences between back then and the war we are fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Things seemed so much clearer back then – the enemies were more black and white – you were either Axis or Allies, German or American.  WWII seems to be a war that we as Americans keep going back to, perhaps because it has an ending that is easily understood.  Good triumphed over evil.  WWII was also so well documented, even as the war was  going on, Hollywood made films to inspire those on the homefront.  I’m always a fan of watching the Memorial Day marathons on various cable channels, and the amount of WWII movies always outnumbers WWI and all the other various wars or conflicts that the US has fought in.  Perhaps going back to WWII and creating fiction out of the facts makes us hope that we can create some understanding out of the wars fought afterwards – that understanding reasons for a war that is clearer can help us understand why the more confusing wars were fought afterwards.  But enough philosophy for now -- I loved the use of color in the movie.  It was washed out and felt real.  The use of handheld cameras for the beach scenes and most of the combat scenes made it feel less like a Hollywood movie made in the 1990s harkening back to 1944, but as if it could have been a documentary, that a camera crew followed the search for Private Ryan.  The opening and closing shots of the transluscent American flag was just right.  Seeing Saving Private Ryan makes me question how  urlLink Shakespeare in Love  managed to win the Best Picture Oscar over this film.  I have no doubt which one will be more talked about fifty years in the future -- and it will not have Ben Affleck in it.            More old Hollywood gossip -- I've been busy reading biographies this week.   urlLink Golden Boy: The Untold Story of William Holden  is the only biography of William Holden and it is an incredibly crappy book.  The author writes the biography as if he was there, transcribing the conversations from a variety of Hollywood stars.  After I finished the first chapter, I wanted to return the book to the library, but I decided to carry on to get a quasi-real story about Holden.  And what a sordid story I got.  Basically, he was an alcoholic.  Holden had to drink before he was able to act in movies, and much is made of the couple belts he would take before a scene.  The drinking eventually lead to his downfall -- and actually caused his death.  Holden died from a laceration to his forehead which was caused by hitting his head during a bout of heavy drinking. He apparently remained conscious for half an hour or so after the injury but never realized he should phone for help and died.  The author coyly refers to his reputation as a lady's man, and the affairs he apparently had with his co-stars, but I didn't get many details on many of them.  The most interesting is that he was going to leave his wife for Audrey Hepburn after starring in  urlLink Sabrina .  But she wanted to have kids, and he no longer could have them, thanks to surgery.  (Snip-snip!)    I think I may be a little harsh on the bio -- but seriously, the writing style was awful.  Leonard Maltin sums it up in his  urlLink mini-bio  by saying, 'Bob Thomas' melancholy biography, 'Golden Boy,' revealed that the handsome, self-assured actor so admired by men and women alike onscreen was in fact a man fraught with insecurity who essentially drank himself to an early grave.'              Day one of summer of the stars features  urlLink John Wayne , an actor who I am usually not too impressed by.  I'm definitely more of an anti-Western fan, and I'd take  urlLink Clint Eastwood  over John Wayne any day.  But in order to fully experience thirty-one movies this month, I decided to give John Wayne a try.  And I ended up with the least stereotypical John Wayne movie ever --  urlLink The Quiet Man .  Wayne plays Sean Thorne, an Irish-born American boxer who moves back to his birthplace in Ireland.  He meets Mary Kate (played by  urlLink Maureen O'Hara ) and immediately begins courting her, despite the fact that her bachelor older brother does not want to lose her as his cook and housekeeper.  The movie would be a great one to see on the big screen -- it's got such great Technicolor scenery!  The Quiet Man is also very typically Irish -- lush green scenery, lovely accents, horse racing, and excellent music.  The story proceeds with some of the villagers -- including the matchmaker -- conning Mary Kate's brother into giving her a dowry (she calls it a fortune) so the two of them can start the courtship.  They also hint that if he gets rid of his sister, the brother will be able to convince the local widow that he's been courting for ten years to marry him.  While courting Mary Kate, Sean manages to get away from the matchmaker and chases her into a graveyard.  They have their first kiss there, not only in the graveyard but also during a rainstorm.  How romantic!  But apparently the kissing came a little to early in their courtship, because in the next scene Sean and Mary Kate are getting married -- perhaps he compromised her so thoroughly that the marriage had to be immediate.  After the wedding, the brother announces his imminent marriages -- but it turns out that he hasn't asked the widow yet!  She turns him down, as any woman should, and the brother realizes that he's been duped.  And he's not happy about being duped, and takes back his sister's dowry and manages to punch Sean.  Sean flashes back to the ring, where he has just knocked out an opponent -- a fatal knockout (just like  urlLink Killer McCoy !).  Mary Kate lives up to her feisty Irish reputation, and refuses to be a real wife to Sean until she gets her things and fortune back.  They have a total  urlLink Gone With the Wind  moment, as Mary Kate locks herself in their bedroom.  Sean breaks down the door and says, 'There'll be no locks or bolts between us, Mary Kate...except those in your own mercenary little heart!'  He then gives her a passionate kiss and throws her down on the bed.  Mary Kate gets her things back in the morning -- the villagers were going to bring them back in the previous evening, but they thought the couple would be busy (making little Sean and Mary Kates).    I got distracted by the end of the movie, but it ends up with the brother challenging Sean to a fight.  He, of course, does not want to fight after killing a man and he ends up speaking to the vicar about it.  Mary Kate feels embarassed by her husband and ends up speaking to the priest about it.  I don't really understand why she ends up leaving, but Mary Kate gets on a train headed to Dublin to avoid the problems with her husband and brother.  Sean rides his horse to her rescue and drags her back to the town and confronts her brother.  He gives Sean the dowry money, and they burn it afterwards.  A big fight starts and eventually the movie ends happily, with the brother courting the widow and Sean and Mary Kate happy together again.  I was pleasantly surprised by The Quiet Man.  I don't really understand where the title comes from, other than the fact that Sean wanted to keep his previous life as a boxer quiet.  I found John Wayne to be fairly attractive, and less John Wayne-ish than usual.  His voice is so soothing and just very familar and comfortable.  There aren't any actors like him any more.    \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
