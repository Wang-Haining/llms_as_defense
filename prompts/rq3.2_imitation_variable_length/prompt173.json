I email Knapman/Wyld productions regularly about getting WCB released on DVD ... please email them for me - just say you're a huge fan of WCB and that you really want them to release a best-of DVD or something. I think the only people who email them are me & Cathy ... and that's kind pathetic.   urlLink CLICK HERE  to email Knapman/Wyld.  For more info on Knapman/Wyld Productions (shameless plug, I know),  urlLink CLICK HERE  to visit their official website.  And if you want to join the WCB Yahoo group - we're a great lot of people ... then you may as well  urlLink CLICK HERE !!!  Yeah ... well the last email I sent to Knapmay/Wyld, which I admit was quite a while ago, generated this response:  Dear Brittany.   We have sought DVD production interest and as yet no-one has been interested.  We have done a limited 'inhouse' run of the best episodes but these are not available for commercial release at this time. So I am afraid we can't help you, although I will make enquiries regarding the cost of a limited edition although this would prove quite expensive.   Best regards,   Steve Knapman     So please join our campaign!!! I would do ANYTHING to see that first ever episode ...                         I don't think I've really got the hang of the whole blog thing quite yet ... but I'll get there.  Aiaiaiaia!!! I'm  so  busy today!!! I had a piano lesson this morning, and in an hour, I start work at Safeway. I'm there until 6:30, and then I'm babysitting for the rest of the evening. And tomorrow morning I have to be up early to drop my French exchange student to the airport, and say goodbye...  Listening to Mathbox Twenty - their first album. I still reckon their 3rd album ( More Than You Think You Are ) is the best, but this one ( Yourself Or Someone Like You ) definitely comes in at second.  So, here is a song ... I'll pick one at random:   It's sitting by the overcoat   The second shelf, the note she wrote   That I can't bring myself to throw away   And also   Reach she said for no one else but you,   Cuz you won't turn away   When someone else is gone   I'm sorry 'bout the attitude   I need to give when I'm with you   But no one else would take this shit from me   And I'm soTerrified of no one else but me   I'm here all the timeI won't go away   Yeah it's me, yeah I can't get myself to go away   Hey it's me and I can't get myself to go away   Oh God I shouldn't feel this way        Reach down your hand in your pocket   Pull out some hope for me   It's been a long day, always ain't that right   And no Lord your hand won't stop it   Just keep you trembling   It's been a long day, always ain't that right   Well I'm surprised that you'd believe   In anything that comes from me   I didn't hear from you or from someone else   And you're so   Set in life man, a pisser they're waiting   Too damn bad you get so far so fast   So what, so long      (Chorus)      Oh ain't that right?   It's me, yeah well I can't get myself to go away   Hey it's me, yeah well I can't get myself to go away   Oh God I shouldn't feel this way now      (Chorus)      Yeah reach down your hand in your pocket now   Reach down your hand right now It's been a long day, always   Ain't that right?   Reach down your hand in your pocket now   Reach down your hand right now   It's been a long day, always   Ain't that right?   Oh ain't that right?   Ain't that right right right on child?   Right right right on child right right on child   (Copied directly from  urlLink http://www.lyrics007.com/Matchbox%2020%20Lyrics/Long%20Day%20Lyrics.html , because I can't be bothered typing them up myself)  Anyway ... I'll be back tomorrow, with another insightful post!!! And I'll have a bit more time to think of what to write.
