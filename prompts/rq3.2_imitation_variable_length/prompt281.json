But here's what I told her (in case some day I'm old and senile and don't remember how I do this):  My stew changes every time I make it, depending on what we have --   But here's what I did Sunday night.   Sauteed a chopped onion in some olive oil, added some sliced carrots and diced potato, let them saute for a bit.  Added a big can of stewed tomatoes (I would normally add diced tomatoes, but didn't have any) and their juice, added some veggie bouillon cubes, and some water.  A can of corn, a can of blackeyed peas.  Let that simmer for a while, added some thyme, oregano, celery seed, and a bay leaf.   Once everything is all stew-y, I added about two tablespoons of flour to thicken it.  Then I mixed up a package of pre-packaged biscuit mix (the one I used was cheddar and garlic), added a little extra cheddar, and spooned it on top of the stew.  Let those cook for a bit, and ate it.   Nothing major, nothing complicated.  If I were adding chicken or something, I'd do it right after the onions.   So there, for posterity's sake.                     2 C all-purpose flour  1/4 C packed brown sugar  1 T baking powder  1/4 t ground nutmeg  1/4 t salt  1/4 C butter, chilled and diced  1 C fresh cranberries, roughly chopped  1/3 C white sugar  grated zest of one orange  1/2 C chopped walnuts (optional) 3/4 C half-and-half cream  1 egg  Heat oven to 375F.  In a large bowl, stir together flour, brown sugar, baking powder, nutmeg and salt. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Toss cranberries with sugar; add to flour mixture along with orange peel and nuts. Mix lightly.  Beat together cream and egg; slowly pour into dry ingredients, mixing with rubber scraper until dough forms. Knead dough 4 or 5 times, being careful not to over handle. Divide dough in half, and shape each half into a 6 inch circle. Cut each circle into 6 wedges. Place scones on lightly greased baking sheets.  Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes.  These were hella tasty, even without the nuts.  The dough was lighter and wetter than the  urlLink Cherry Walnut Scones  I made the other week, but they were still tasty and not as dry when baked.                 I had to put this as a post cause it was too long and they wouldn't let me post it as comments:  Yeah, I'm totally not offended by any of this. There are many things I like about the lab: the space it affords me (it's big, with big windows, and I can work on a board or with a screen or at tables, etc.) I can also teach web design, and if I want my students to do this, they have to learn, and can't do that at home. But I certainly don't think computers make my class more democratic or solve any problems. They bring up new ones. I decided to teach in the lab cause it was available, and I really like it. But I'm certain it constrains me in ways that are invisible, that I might see more in another space. They certainly can be distracting, but I have the conference table space, although it is small. Well, on and on from here. I don't think either way is right or wrong. I don't think you and Jody have to do it a particular way to be right. I think it depends on what works for you. I like it that Jody thinks you can teach this stuff in many different ways. I think I can teach work and choices in the lab, and I want to try it next year. But it might constrain my students to only work in computer mediums. I guess we'll see... Wow, this was too long.
