I ask this because I've been thinking a lot about how things happen, when they happen and why. More specifically, I've been wondering how much destiny is playing a hand into my finding my true love.  Is it a sign when you run into someone on the street, or just coincidence?  All the movies talk about it... being in that right place, at the right time.  Sliding Doors, Only You,  and  Serendipity  all show how fate plays a part in the magic of true love. It happens in real life every day, people fall in love in subway cars, honkeytonk bars and next to office water coolers.  And so I wonder what my destiny is. Will I find my true love in Lexington's public library? Will he crash into the rear of my car on Alumni Drive? Will he walk into my bible study?  One of my favorite songs is from the musical  South Pacific.  The words are totally relevant:     Some enchanted evening   You may see a stranger,you may see a stranger   Across a crowded room   And somehow you know,   You know even then   That somewhere you'll see her   Again and again.        Sometimes I think destiny has a way of teasing people. You might have a person on the brain, they keep sprinting through your thoughts until you smack right into them in real life. And you end up wondering if your thought was a premonition, or if you manipulated the circumstances of time and space (I'm starting to creep into Einstein's General Theory of Relativity here) to make that chance meeting actually happen intentionally.           There are some interesting Catholic traditions and prayers for single women.  An old German tradition says that single women who wish to marry should ask for   urlLink  Saint Andrew's     help on the Eve of his feast (November 30th,) then sleep naked that night; they will see their future husbands in their dreams.  Another says that young women should note the location of barking dogs on Saint Andrew's Eve: their future husbands will come from that direction.     So what? Man's best friend is going to lead me to my own?    Oh brother.            \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
