Two-If I do attain an adminstrator position through the other candidate, I will have to clear all policy changes and additions through her.&nbsp;   Three-If I do attain administrator position with full site access, then I will require&nbsp;a temporary, but quite possibly permanent, a volunteer web coder/master (Sorry, but I'm a little low on cash at the moment.).&nbsp;   Four-Sending messages to me will require a stricter abidement when composing in sending (Again, I apologize, but I'm one of those people who get's frustrated and explodes if I get overwhelmed from being unorganized.).   Five-My time will be very limited to each site I manage, including this one.&nbsp; I will do my best to keep you all up to date with the anime/gaming world.&nbsp; Any volunteer help will be appreciated (Perhaps once I get some more cash, I can begin paying people that help, but at this point it doesn't look likely.).   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, let's get back to what I'm here for.&nbsp; Sorry guys, but nothing outstanding in the gaming world.&nbsp; As for the anime world, check this out:        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A new television station is coming soon to Cable & Satellite!

As of 7:00 tomorrow night, I will be a owner of a Techlive Baseball cap. I have been the lead bidder for a few days on eBay, and I expect to win. If I don't, I've been eyeing a ZDTV cap as well. I'm just trying my best to get one piece of old TechTV memorabilia before it all goes away and is replaced by cheap G4TechTV stuff. I also saw a TechTV promotional packet given to cable and satellite networks to persuade them to carry TTV. I thaught about bidding on that but I decided I would get something I could wear and take everywhere with me. Ah, I can imagine it now.  My first year in high school will start on the 11th, and I may not post as often as I do now. During the school year, please excuse me if I do not post for a day or two in a row during the weekend. I will post every weekend.  When Labor Day weekend comes along, I will be gone to a family reunion . The reunion is in the middle of nowwhere in west Texas and cell coverage may be scant, so don't be suprised if I don't leave an audio post.   I am trying to get two new contributors to  The Main Server , but Blogger has a problem with their invite, which I hope they get fixed in the near future.                 Hello one and all!  As previously stated, I am Jace.  I'll be your guy for all your video gaming needs, keeping you up-to-date with systems, games, and anything else you can think of.  So, to start off, let's go to this year's E3(Electronic Entertainment Expo) convention to tell you off the latest systems, or should I say, systEM.  Yes, this is it ladies and gentlemen:  The Nintendo DS!  Check it out!  This thing has 2 LCD screens which allows you to view your game from 2 prospectives at once!  For example, you could be playing a racing game.  The lower screen would have your racing view and the top would have a map and position listing.  Not only that, but they can reproduce a 3-D view and, like SP, are backlit.      Next we have the new Touch-Screen capability.  This thing will allow you to operate your games like a PDA!  Now you don't just have to rely on buttons!      That's not it!  This thing now has a Microphone port!  This means that you can use voice-commands to hand-clapping to perform basic operations!      Guess what!  Wireless networking!!!  You can now perform multiplayer tasks on a local wireless network with up to 16 players!  Quadruple the fun!  You have a range of up to 30 feet, but later you'll be able to go far beyond that, possibly by nationwide hub connections.  Also, there will be a LAN connection on which you could allow, theoretically, an infinite amount of players to connect at a hot spot and compete.  The protocol by which the wireless communication operates allows high response rates for real-time play and low battery consumption.      Messenger capabilities!  You can use a touch-screen keyboard or microphone to chat, send drawings, and more!      Wireless Game Sharing!  Certain games will be able to compete on wireless networks, even if only one person has the game!  Some will even allow you to test-play games!      As stated earlier, the system will have 3-D capabilities, which can surpass images similar to the N-64!  The 60 fps rate will allow details like fog effects and cel shading!      Speakers are now 16-channel and allows for a wider variety of voices, music, and enriched SFX.  A headphones jack is included for stereo sound.      Power management is excellent, using a rechargeable battery with low-energy consumption design.  It has Sleep mode functions as with SP, but also a new Standby mode!  The Standby mode is used mostly for multiplayer if the other is sends an IM.      The processing will be two processors: 1 ARM9 and 1 ARM7      The media format is new also!  They are now making compact cards with a semi-conductor memory, allowing lower cost, shorter manufacturing time, and more than 1 Gigabit of mem!      Finally, we have dual slots!  It will be able to read GBA games and developers are working on a way to connect between DS and GBA games!      Tell me this is not awesome for a portable sys!  But if you want to check it out yourself, you can learn just about everything I've listed here and more at http://www.nintendo.com/e3_2004/ds/index.jsp  Tomorrow: More about games displayed at the E3 convention!                 Wal-Mart's test of their new RFID tage in merchandise has been quite successful. The RFID tags were used in stores and warehouses in the Dallas area. They say that the electronic tags will lower the amount of thefts, and keep their stores better stocked.  Apple is a clever group! They are attempting to get a patent on the translucent widow effect that is planned in the new version of Windows, (code named  Longhorn .) This is a big punch in the face for Microsoft.  This is a great move for Apple. Apple is planning to slow the intervals of releases of new versions of OS X. They are going to show off their new version of OS X, 'Tiger', at the Worldwide Developers Conference next month.  Nasal rap singer Eminem sued Apple for copyright infringement, but the judge overruled it, so Apple is back to their spotless record.  We may even have ANOTHER contributor soon, Heather Cheney will be providing us with Mac facts and tips. Expect her to make her debut this weekend.  This has been a Mac filled day!                    President Bush has made a statement that he wants to make all internet tax free and slackoff on regulations in order to make high-speed internet availabe to everyone by thge year 2007.  CNET has done it again! They have released a FREE music download service that contains music from independent artists.  AT&T, the phone company from that really hot place downstairs, is being sued from SBC, the angel of the phone companies. AT&T is in trouble because they have falsely shown long distance calls as local calls and didn't charge the local phone companies enough to cover the bill. I'm on SBC's side on this.   FUN & GAMES:  urlLink Internet Scrabble Club    This site was a lot of fun. I really suck at Scrabble but it really does drive you to increase your vocabulary. You can access the game by a java applet on the site of downloading a program. But it's not a very graphical interface. You have to use commands to access most features. I give it a 3 out of 5. Try it, you'll probably like it.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
