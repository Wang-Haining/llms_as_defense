I'm back as you see, I have not been gone for long, a few days at most, but not to fear, I am back again with my boring life.  Or so I think it is, because by the time I get to thinking about it, all the excitement is gone.  So maybe it really isn't that boring, but oh well, now for the recap on yesterday and today.  Yesterday, I got The Matrix: Reloaded, Terminator 3, and Legally Blonde 2, in GREAT quality.  I'm talking VHS quality off the internet.  Very, very good, they were SVCD's that's why : )  I watched T3 and TMR until about 5 AM.  I then went to sleep and awoke to today.  Nothing much at all happened today.  I slept until about 3 again.  Woke up, got online, did much of nothing.  Later on in the evening I saw Mona online, that was a bit of a surprise.  I was going through one of my little psychotic fits, I was all hyped up, I was shaking, my fingers and toes were cold, and I had a cold sweat.  Pretty weird.  I asked Mona to call, but as usual she didn't.  I called her, and left a message saying all this shit, it's over and everything, it was because of my little psychotic fit that made me say this.  And midway throught the message I broke down crying saying I don't know why I said all those things.  I have to admit it was very weird.  Although, I don't think she'll hear that message for a good long while.  She never fucking checks them.  Oh well, then I got online.  Spoke on IRC and AIM.  I also Uploaded 3 new pictures on my photo album, showed Anahi and Josie.  Played SoF, owned as usual.  Then around 5 my dad caught me online.  He's taken the power cord for the past 2 weeks or so.  And well he didn't say much of anything, it was already 5, so why bother, you know?  And now here I am, writing and talking on IRC.  My God, my fingers hurt.  Bye now.            I don't, that's for damn sure.  Or do I?  Will a title make me feel warm, fuzzy, and secure in knowing that people will realize I took a minute to find a suitable title to summarize this entry?  Oh well, enough of that.  What have I done in these past days?!  You're soo curious aren't you.  Well I can assure you, my answer is 0.  I have nothing, and I have done nothing of nothing all the time.  I am in a complete state of nothing nothingness.  If you can fathom that.  Heh, all though I've really done worth any mention is speak to Roxanne for an unimaginable amount of time almost every morning.  But besides that, the only word that comes to mind is sleep.  I did go to the library yesterday, I checked out:  Zero, the biography of a dangerous idea The culture of fear, why Americans are afraid of the wrong things Strange brains and genuis, The secret lives of eccentric scientists and madmen   A good choice indeed.  Now to read them.  I want to read them horribly, I wish I could just upload all the information to my brain instead having to take ample amounts of time to read them.  I read faster than most people, still, it's a process.  Oh well, not everything can be instantaneous.  So yes, life is boring right now, I'm still in the process of paying that $108 dollars I owe my parents.  Hopefully I get a fucking job so I can pay them off, buy stuff I want, and stop keeping a clean system, if you know what I mean ;)  Other than that it's all just here.  Oh, I can't believe I forgot, heh.  Chantal called me two days ago, and I sounded mad at her for the first 5 minutes or so because I thought she was another former friend of mine, but then I realized it was her.  I felt mean:(  Heh.   Random conversation:  Sweetpea: I hear a clicking sound in my room Sweetpea: I think it's my clock Sweetpea: Wait I don't have a clock, OH, it's my fan.  LoL!            Yes, it's 5:10 AM here, and as usual I'm sitting here bored talking to my good friend GeneralSpecific on IRC and convinving some newbie that I'm an FBI agent after he admitted to making counterfeit bills on Photoshop and using them.  Nothing much at all happened today, even less than yesterday, heh.  I talked to Crystal from 9 to 11, and that's about it.  She's suuuper cute, heh.  It's crazy.  You crazy cat!  Yup, I got online, talked to Anahi, she's doing better, so that's good.  Pr0to and Ironz are getting kicked out of their houses:(  We'll see what happens, I hope they're ok.  I'm more worried about Ironz, he has nowhere to stay and he doesn't know what to do.  Pr0to has a job, someone to stay with and a car soon, so he's doing well.  Oh well, I'll see what Ironz's situation was tommorow on Spurious, he was too tired to explain.  Besides all that, all I did was OWN in Soldier of Fortune again:)  As usual.  And here I am typing away, but I shall go now, nothing much left to say,  Bye now.            Today as it has been soo far this summer was another completly uneventful day.  Nothing really occured of any value at all.  I believe I woke up around 2 or 3 due to talking to Roxanne 'til about 5:40 or so.  I still don't usually wake up that late, but oh well.  From then on, I did nothing, until about 6 when my parent's almost made me go to my little sister's dance recital.  I ended up being stubborn, and didn't try to get dressed, and by the time they were leaving I was still not dressed.  So, they left without me.  So it was an ok day I suppose, it could be worse.  I could be sitting watch a boring dance recital.  Oh, I almost forgot, my phone call to Stormy cost me $104.  My dad was pissed about that.  He said I have to do things around the house to pay it back.  Hopefully I'll get a job VERY soon so I can pay that off without having to do random things around the house.  But other than that, nothing at all happened today.  Oh well, I'm off, I hope you're glad you can now comment Rox, I didn't like that Xanga, too 'busy' so to speak.  I like this one, nice and simple:)            I can't sleep, but this time I have school tommorow, so I have to try I guess.  My parents got all pissed at me today because I forgot how to do the homework that was assigned to me on Thursday.  Really mad, I ended it pissing off my mom and she just told me to take a bath and go to sleep.  She said it was the computer's fault, that I'm obssessed by it.  That's not true, what else is there to do in my house?  NOTHING!  Damn, when I'm at my cousin's I have no urge to use the computer like I do here, because there are actually things to do there.  It's fucking crazy, and I hate it when she calls people online that I know, imaginary.  They aren't imaginary, they are as fucking real as you and me.  What would you rather do, watch TV, or talk to people online, learn about things, play games that interact with you, I mean fuck, it's the obvious answer.  But she doesn't see that, oh well.  It rained a lot today, and then after there was a cool breeze, that was awesome.  I love it when it's dark and rain outside, one of the best times of the year, besides when it's cold.  I got a little Yahoo pictures account setup, so I don't have to keep sending people my pictures with my slow ass connection.  Oh you want to see it?  Here you go.  http://photos.yahoo.com/bc/osiris6411/lst?&.dir=/Boredom&.src=ph&.begin=9999&.view=t&.order=&.done=http%3a//photos.yahoo.com/bc/osiris6411/lst%3f%26.dir=/Boredom%26.src=ph%26.view=t   Quite long URL, I know.  I'll post the pictures I took with my 'nice' camera later.  Damn, my shoulders are soo sore from all the working out I've been doing, it kinda sucks, but I'll live, and lift weights tommorow as planned.  I just need to start a schedule for running.  Hmm...July 28, BAM, I'm going to be built as hell.....heh:)  I got a new door...WOO.  LoL.  Awesome boots I'm going to buy http://www.coveshoe.com/mt_hh_10tanker.html  Until next time,        adieu mon ami :)            Yup, it's been a hella long time since I've posted, well it's all relative.  But, yes, I'm sure you're eager to know what's been happening with me.  Ha!  Well either way, you're lucky because I'm going to tell you anyways.  I mean that's why you're reading this right?  Hmm..let's see the first thing I can remember that I wanted to post was pretty fucking hilarious.  Roxanne had a lucid dream, and for some reason, she's not sure why, she wanted me there.  So she willed it, nothing happened for a little bit.  And then finally she says a little pencil drawn face of a black cat appeared.  Her mind could not find my image, how sad:(  I'm a pencil drawn cat.  I feel kinda special too, she said for some reason, I haven't asked that she is going to stop talking to all her guy friends, except me:)  Yup, that's good to know.  Hmm..I went to DCI in San Antonio, that was pretty fucking awesome.  I watched The Santa Clara Vanguard in the Lot, damn, they were fucking Godly!  I felt drained after I left.  That lot performance convinced me to try out for them when I'm about 19 or 20.  Damn, soo amazing.  That bus ride was hell, fucking cramped and shit.  Nice bus though.  I finally got my new Whitemax head, fucking beautiful sound coming out of my drum, now all I need is the Falam II on the bottom and I'm set.  The Drum key ended up being fucking small, and I'm not sure why?  Oh well, I'm going to return that.  Hmm..not much else happened that I can remember.  I went to Cindy's house for her little birthday thingaling and found out that she is extremely cute.  Being the idiot I am, I didn't think of getting her something.  But, oh, I will.  Which brings me to now, sitting here alone.  My family went to go watch a movie and well I didn't feel like going.  My mom says I'm not normal for obvious reasons, she says I should go out and enjoy life, I think I'm doing damn fine, but oh well.  That's about all, I downloaded three fucking awesome Tech house, and Goa songs today:)  Bye now.      \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
