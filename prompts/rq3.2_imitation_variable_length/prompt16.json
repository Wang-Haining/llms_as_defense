I rather miss witty editorials and news magazine articles (who can afford to buy news magazines regularly in Asia at US$10 a pop?)complete with forecasts for the future and maybe even some posed solutions.  Looking for such kind of information, I came across the  urlLink World Press Review Directory of Think-Tanks and NGOs . It has a number of sites with interesting articles on current international topics of interest. You can read about the same issues on different country's think tanks' pages and see the problem from a variety of different viewpoints.  Feeling somewhat removed from Canada these days, I will likely start with the commentary section of the  urlLink Canadian Institute of Strategic Studies .

Did  you know that the woman who appears to have developed the&nbsp;Oracle&nbsp;also  has a personal weblog? You may also remember that all of the possible outcomes  of drinking ANYTHING at Starbucks is BAD! The sad thing is the Oracle of  Starbucks states that I drink sparkling water and shop in designer grocery  stores... and&nbsp;both of these are true! However, as I don't always drink the  same thing at Starbucks, in addition to&nbsp;my heinous habits,&nbsp;I am also  lame and&nbsp;an asshat (whatever that means). Well,&nbsp;you have to be all  those things&nbsp;to waste $90+ (local currency) every time you drink coffee.  For only $50, you can purchase coffee AND breakfast at the other places.  Luckily, I can drink things not recognized by the Oracle to avoid  categorization: tall double low-fat no-foam half-sweet caramel ice latte;  shaken, no ice!   An accountant I know adviced me  that rather than DRINK Starbucks, I should purchase it! Her stock has doubled!  If only I knew how to do that! Anyway, the point of this blog was not to remind  you of the shame you felt the first time you visited the Oracle, but to point  out that the developer's (if I have miscredited... please correct me)  personal&nbsp;weblog  is as interesting as  the website. The&nbsp;entry&nbsp; a guide to understanding  writers  sounds like me the first time I tried writing something here in  current place of employment!            \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
