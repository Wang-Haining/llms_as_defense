I keep asking myself, wondering how I keep closing my eyes but I can't block you out Wanna fly to a place where it's just you and me Nobody else so we can be free   All the things she said All the things she said Running through my head All the things she said All the things she said Running through my head  This is not enough This is not enough  All the things she said All the things she said  And I'm all mixed up, feeling cornered and rushed They say it's my fault but I want her so much Wanna fly her away where the sun and rain Come in over my face, wash away all the shame When they stop and stare - don't worry me 'Cause I'm feeling for her what she's feeling for me I can try to pretend, I can try to forget But it's driving me mad, going out of my head  Mother looking at me Tell me what do you see? Yes, I've lost my mind  Daddy looking at me Will I ever be free? Have I crossed the line?              ~ EMOTIONS ~    On Friday evening, I went to see  urlLink  The Passion of Christ  .  What can I say...  What a movie... Yes it is very graphic but what a movie... Mel Gibson did good with this and He is in the movie.  He hold the nail because he says   He died because of me for me so I feel that it is important to do it  .  As most of you know, I became a Christian 4 years ago.  I never knew that I could have a relationship with God.  He has Blessed me in lots of way and sometimes I forget.  But watching this touching and moving story, refreshed and re-confirmes my faith.  The emotions that His Mother must of went thru was so well depicted, it tore us up.  Mom came with me to see and both her and I came out of there shaken.  It is incredible that a movie about a book that had been around forever, would make such an impact with ALL religious groups.  IT LOOKS LIKE A REVIVAL....  And I am ready.  On this Sunday morning, off to church so ............Be Good and God Bless \\o/                 It is Sunday night and I am feeling loved....  I want to start by thanking a very special yound lady who not only showed me her true colors but also that you should never loose faith in people. urlLink   Mollie   , thank you for this beautiful place for me to write.  I told  urlLink   Sandee   last week that I was considering closing my blog.  I didn't feel that anyone would actually care.  I was wrong. I love my look...  it is me...it is Lakeshoregirl...  The girls started school this week.  Only 2 half days, but still, schools back....   They even took the bus this year and like a new School Bus Mom,  I drove to school to check that they got there in one piece and not crying for me... Like As If...  My oldest was not impressed with my surprise visit..   Mom, you can't do that...It is not cool....    At least my baby was happy to see me...  I will get HER a nice car when she turns 21....  hi hi hi....   Anyways,  I will turn in now and catch you on the flip side so I am sending you big virtual hugs and kisses.......Be Good  p.s.  Love I have my favorites back...                   My Best Friend, Breda is moving back to Singapore in 2 months, im so upset im crying! She just moved here this year and she is such an awesome girl and we have so many memorys together!    Here is the song to Friends are friends forever by Michael W. Smith, this is me and breda's song!  urlLink Click Here To Listen     ~ As we go on We remember All the times we Had together And as our lives change Come whatever We will still be Friends Forever~  ~And friends are friends forever  If the Lord's the Lord of them  And a friend will not say 'Never'  'Cause the welcome will not end  Though it's hard to let you go  In the Father's hands we know  That a lifetime's not too long  To live as friends   With the faith and love God's given  Springing from the hope we know  We will pray the joy you'll live in  Is the strength that now you show  But we'll keep you close as always  It won't even seem you've gone  'Cause our hearts in big and small ways  Will keep the love that keeps us strong ~                BREDA=BFF!!            UPDATE....UPDATE....UPDATE  Ok first of all, my friend   ~ Lori ~  gave birth to her 3rd child on Monday by C-section, to a 9 pound 9 once baby boy...  ~ Shane ~  ,  he is soooooo cute...  I spent some alone time with him today after meeting the gastric surgeon.  I did visit my friend but had him in my arms for 3 hours.. Gosh, she is so brave...  her son   ~ Trevor ~   is 7 (8 in sept) and   ~ Jessica ~   is 6 (7 in nov).  They are coming home tomorrow and the girls and I, will decorate the front lawn with blue balloons....  OK first appointment was on Tuesday with a general surgeon.  He is absolutly charming and direct to the point. He also suggested that I keep and see the gastric surgeon to see what my option are about weight loss surgery. Wednesday, the ortho for my broken foot.  It is healing very well, I can't run yet but I can walk a bit better, no crutchs or cane. And today, I met the Gastric Surgeon.  He is the top surgeon for Gastric Bypass in Quebec.  And it ususally take 12 to 20 months to see him.  Well I saw him and he was totally honest.  It is official, I WILL NOT HAVE A GASTRIC BYPASS...  It is to risky for me to have this kind of surgery.  The chances of me have many complicaitons are so much higher than anyone.  Do I want to chance loosing my life...  not.    I now have requested to have the hernias repaired as soon as possible so I can get my life back.  On this my dears, have a great night and...........Be Good                    ST-JEAN BAPTISTE DAY     Did you know that way back when, this holiday had nothing to do with politics.....and it really had to do with JOHN THE BAPTIST... Well I just found out myself.   Today had to be in my book, one of my most incredible day ever...Today was my Christian Baptism and I feel incredible. I was surrounded by my family. My mom, my husband and my 2 daughters. My brother Dan and his wife Janice , who is an incredible person, mother and also help me go thru very hard times and showed me the way to God, without pushing. They also brought their son and daughter. It was most unfortunate that my oldest brother Mike and his family were not there.   I found the Lord when I was at my lowest of everything. It is too bad, that only then, we think of Him. Because when things are going great, you feel you do not need Him.  He has been part of our lives now for a while and I have never been happier since then. People who know me and have not seen me in a year or so, cannot believe the changes in me and my family. Before I found the Lord, anytime anyone talked about Him, I got angry because it seemed that He was not there for me. Little that I know that He was there but I didn't listen.   Before you judge religion, always take a good look inside your soul and see what your true beliefs are and then ask yourself if you believe in the Bible and what it says.   I did that and found that I had completely lost the values of the Lord and what He preached. I have found comfort in reading His word and praising Him. So for me today,  St-Jean Baptiste is more then an occasion to celebrate our National Day.....It is my Baptism...   We finished this amazing night with fireworks in the parks with our friends and neighbors, who are the same.   I want to thank all the good wishes I've received today by my church family and from friends and family that couldn't be there. Thank you to My Pastor and the Youth Pastor that got into the water with me and to God in giving me salvation and re-birth.   Have a great Sunday and Holiday Monday and......

Yes I sat at my oldest daughter's small (very small) desk and learned about 'New Math' so that I can actually stop fighting with Valerie when she does her homework.  One question to all the teachers out there..... WHY....  Yes I know, you read from the left to the right and you should calculate the same way...  It is so stupid and longer..  I know, it shows the kids the WHY of calculating.  It is just longer.  Anyways, tomorrow, my girls have no school.  So in the morning, they will do their homework  and I will do my stuff for  urlLink   ~Sandee's, A Breast Cancer Walk to Remember 2003 , this Sunday ~    I am so happy to help her this year.
