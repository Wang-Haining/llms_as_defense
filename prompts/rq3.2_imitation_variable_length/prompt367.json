Among other things, my boss needs to have knee surgery in 10 days. They want her to have it sooner, but her boss is off all week and she told them they couldn't put her out of commission for a week with him gone. *sighs with relief*  Anyway, I invested in a new pair of running shoes yesterday, then christened them with three loops around the park (mostly walking). That's just a hair under four miles, and I ran about a mile of it in two spurts. My goal is to be able to run two full loops (2.6 miles) by Marathon Monday (two weeks from tomorrow). The new sneakers are wonderful - like running on air. I hadn't realized just how broken down the old ones were until I headed out in the new ones. Fortunately, my legs held up pretty well - my wind was the problem. I'm hoping warmer weather and some regular training will solve that problem pretty quickly.  I'm been doing not so great with the eating - 14-hour days at work tend to have that effect - but I started to get back on track with dinner tonight and I'm hoping it will carry over through the week. I have three meals already packed in the fridge and freeezer, and I'll pick up a few cans of soup tomorrow. I've also started drinking more water, mostly because the almost-full bottle of lemon juice in the fridge was nearing the end of its useful life. So I've been making water with a twist all week in my 32-oz water bottle.   This week's goals:  Run MWF, working up to running two miles out of 5.2 (four loops) by Friday.  Walk 3.9 (three loops) miles on the days I don't run Bring my dinner to work this week and avoid the snack machine. Eat at least half the veggies in my freezer.                        Something that I have been thinking is that we should try to have actual challenges. So this is my idea:   The Rules: This week I will introduce a challenge. Those who are going to do it will post (either in a post or comment stating that they will participate) The first person to post after 7pm CST on Monday the 29th, who has accomplished his/her goal for the week, gets to assign the next challenge.  The same person can't assign a challenge more than once a month. When you make a challenge, it can be anything that is _sane_....such as everyone works out at least 5 times that week....or everyone drinks at least 64 oz of water a day that week....or everyone stays away from chocolate. I hope you get the idea.  You can offer a reward if you so wish, however each person that accomplishes his/her goal for the week will get a nifty icon next to his/her name (if I can figure out how to do it) I reserve the right to deem a challenge as unhealthy or unreasonable :) You do not have to participate in these challenges.    Make sense?   So this week, I say 'goals' (Mine would be to drink at least 20 oz of water a day, and excerise 3 times in the next week).  Whatever your goal is, it should be  attainable  but one that you will still need to stretch yourself to accomplish--and not something that you are already doing on a regular basis.  My reward to you: Its not much, but for those who reach their goals for this week can have a character named after them (or choose a character's name-nothing crude!-)in one of my 3 universes. (Note: this is not a promise that the story(ies) will be written really quickly though! ;)         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
