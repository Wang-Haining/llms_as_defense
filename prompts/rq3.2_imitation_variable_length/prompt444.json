Uptown Memphis now owns the old Lauderdale Courts housing project and has undertaken a major renovation to create 347 apartments renting from $515 to $1,430 a month.  The work includes restoration of the 689-square-foot apartment that was home to Presley and his parents, Vernon and Gladys, from 1949 to 1953. It opened for the first time to public tours for the 27th anniversary of Presley's death at Graceland on Aug. 16, 1977.  Uptown Memphis plans to offer the apartment tours on the anniversary of his death each year and on his birthday in January. For the rest of the year, the apartment will be available for private, short-term rentals. Prices have not yet been set.  The complex, built in 1938, is on the National Register of Historic Places as an example of public housing provided by the Works Progress Administration. Closed in 2000, Lauderdale Courts faced demolition.

The April unemployment rate in Mississippi was 4.6%, compared to the national rate of 5.4% and Mississippi's rate a year ago was 6.3%.  According to the  urlLink Mississippi Development Authority (MDA) , new facilities and expansions of existing business from January through May of 2004 in Mississippi are expected to create 4,627 new jobs. MDA said there has been 73 new facilities announced, which are expected to create an estimated 1,917 new jobs and bring in an estimated capital investment of approximately $544.16 million.  The largest new facilities unveiled were Textron Fastening Systems in Greenville (500 jobs), Faurecia in Cleveland (250 jobs), D&G Foods in Gallman (200 jobs) and Lowe's Home Improvement Warehouse in Starkville (175 jobs).

A gorilla sex video is getting regular play at the New Orleans Zoo. Casey, 21, came to New Orleans two years ago on permanent loan from the  Como Zoo  in St. Paul, Minn. The hope was that he might impregnate one or all of the  Audobon Zoo's  three female land gorillas. But he's not cooperating.  The zoo curator, Dan Maloney, said how animals choose each other is still poorly understood but they are hoping Casey gets the hang of it. He sees part of the problem as Casey coming from an all-bachelor group.  To give him some sex education, Maloney got a tape of copulating gorillas from a camera used to monitor another zoo's gorilla area. It's played in the indoor cage where Casey spends his nights. He's watching it but has not seemed very interested yet.  Chinese veterinarians used a similar strategy to teach a panda born in captivity in the United States what she might expect from suitors. The Beijing Post reported recently that Hua Mei, whose name means 'China-America,' is pregnant by natural means and is due in September.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
