Nature is hard sometimes...  I saw a traffic accident friday, a motorbike had hit a car and the motorbike's rider was lieing down on the road near the fire-engine (in France it's the firemen who carry injured people to hospital). I think about this guy very often when I ride my motorbike now, life is so fragile...  I spend a lot of time to playing on the computer at home, and I had a lot of work to do before the end of the week at my office.  Yesterday, I had went to the motorbike trials with my best friends. I was very cautious, but my technique was not good enough and I fell again :s. It wasn't like last time, but I hit one of my fingers and I have some problems clicking my mouse today.  It will be my wife's birthday on wednesday, I had looked for an original present, but it wasn't that easy to find. I finally bought a parachute jump, with a tandem jump at 4.000 meters with 50 seconds of free fall before opening the parachute. I think we'll go on august 2.  I'll be on holliday all of August, I think we will visit Marseille and we shall go on a soccer match with the new Marseille team. I'm looking for a one week holliday in tunisia with thallassotherapie hostel.  And That's all ;)      Corrected by Mike da hat;)                         It's the film I had watch yesterday on TV 'You've Got Mail'. With two very good actors (tom hawks & Meg Ryan Mmmmm)I had watch this film one more time... It was verry funny, pleasant, romantic... The feeling show on this film was so near of the feeling we could have here... It's strange how in so few time we can be so close friend, there is no limit, we can say all the things we haven't never said to someone in the real life. And it's not so superficial than the non introduce people thinks.  It was so strange, so special, I like this !!!!!! For my dear wife, this film show how people are stupid. She is angry about all this place where I go sometimes. In this part of me where she can't reach me, here... My so british secret garden was my second life!  In my secret dream, I'm an artist, living in London (speaking a perfect english lol)with a nice and intelligent girl and two funny children. Yep !!! I'll do this in my next life Sure !!!  Don't be afraid, I'm today verry happy in th south of France, with a verry nice and sportive girl and I speak a perfect french ! Isn't it ????                       I had talked a lot about my private problems in the last post and it help me to feel better now. But I would like to talk about differents things now, like my way of life, the 'French' point of view on other country, etc... Today, I would talk about.... Religion. I just want to express my point of view, so be cool, I judge no one, I just talk for me.  So I'm an atheistic catholic (funny no ?) It's a fact, If you want that a religion grow quickly, the simple things to do is to automatic convert baby, they never said 'No ! I want to choose my religion later!'  So I'm catholic by obligation and I found that the way of life of catholic is a good things. I said 'Way of life' because for me, people who had invented our religions are good people who just want to try to give a good way of life to our nation.  Catholic have tried to give some good advice like 'don't hurt other people, love them' or 'choose a wife and only one ;), for the better and the worse', and I'm ok so I try to do things like that.  But why they try to promise me the heaven ???  Is not enough to said 'Do this and the life of everybody will be better ?' It seems that no. But how I could believe to heaven, a place that no one can talk, and where all is good. For me Heaven is here and now. After, there is nothing, and it's why things you do in your life was so important.  How I can believe that a man had walked on water an had rose from the dead (word is ressuscitate I think)??? If someone on TV news said that a man had rose from the dead, who could believe it ??? Not me it's sure ! In France, how many people pray on Sunday ? 2, 3 or 5 % ???? In a world where science could explain so many things, how do you want that I believe in a god who made the earth in 7 day ? Sorry, it will be possible 200 years ago, but now... Reincarnation is a better idea than heaven, I found it's a nice idea, I think it was in Buddhism religion, and a lot of people in France like this religion, another good advice is to protect all things on earth (insect, animal, plants, human, etc.). I had too many things to said about religion, but not enough time. My conclusion is that religion had helped us to build our society with good advice but there is limit to this concept that it seems we have reached. My own religion is very simple, I can do what I want to be happy if it hurt no one else.  I don't lie (if I can :s).  I help people who need me.  And the more important things is to protect all the other nature creation because it's the only real heaven that I could leave to my children (or children of my friends ;)).  Hope no one was insulted by my point of view, and in the other case, read again your religion advice, I'm sure there is something written that you need to be tolerant with people who doesn't think like you ;)                        So strange since few time... Who can understand, she's so pretty, since 17 year soon. 17 year to dream about the perfect life... And one day, 4 years ago, the end of the dream begin. Waiting a baby... Waiting again... Obsession of my wife... To make love only to have a baby...Why we havn't try soon... Doctor, after doctor, Hospital, In-Vitro process, and finally, the reason is... A rare disease inside my wife .... Very funny no ???? You ask Why ??? Simply cause I'm président of an association who help people who have rare disease, like my mother, and now, My wife as a rare disease ! If I trust in God, I will explain him one or two things.Stupid guy... So no baby, Ok... Try adoption ? 4 years of problem and you wand I insist ??? Why you don't try to adopt? Only because our life is not so perfect now... My wife have had a period where making love have no sense. Why making love if we couldn't make baby ??? And me ? Afraid by the disease, I forgot I had a wife, and I looking for a new life. A virtual life with only good things... we have had a verry hard moment. Separation, appartment, and finally after so many discussions, I come back. So ok, no baby, the disease sleep, well... Trying to made a lot of things, it's so good. Our life is not perfect, but we are happy, the only thing, is ... Nothing will change in the futur, tomorow will be like today, no surprise, no adventure, no children to learn him the name of the the star in the night. Nothing at all, just trying to think it will be more hard. But sometimes, I dream about another live, with another woman who don't know me so well, I would like surprise in my life, I would like the sun, the beach, a lot of smile, and two children runing around me...  Ok life is life, I'm not perfect, And I'm the only personn who can judge me. Like hippo has wrote 'Buy you a mirror befor judge me'.                       Beginning of summer was a great time for me, It's the BBQ season ! I could do BBQ every day if my wife doesn't stop me, and she is right to do this. First you can't do a BBQ alone, you must be at least two, and if you have many friends, it's better ( for BBQ ). You must have all the good ingredient (meat, salad & vegetable, wine, sauce). And you must really want to do a BBQ (really important). When I know that I'll made a BBQ on evening, I think to this all the day. I prepare the sauce for the meal the morning, I put the wine on fridge, and I cook tsatziki sauce 3 hours before BBQ. When time has come, WE made BBQ, I light on the fire and she cook the salad (man on fire, woman on salad, a real cliché) And when all is alright, we put the table on the garden, and we eat this marvelous meal while mosquitoes suck our blood  Grr . For those who know I'm French you can now said French BBQ was the most romantic. :D The greater pleasure for us, is that we had wait this moment for long time. Some stupid guy who lived in great town in France do BBQ all the day on an electric system with a cheap meat & cheap beer. Let them this stupid guy alone. BBQ was not like Mc Donald ! As all the pleasure we could found on our life, more rare it is, better it is. Do this only with the real desire to do it.  For those who have finish to read this post, you could read again it and replace all the 'BBQ' word by something like 'Making love' and you will have my real thought. But it works with BBQ too ;)           \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
