  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic:\n\n       This is not a diary.  A diary is my innermost thoughts.  A diary is a daily routine.  This is something entirely different.  Why would anyone want to have a fucking online journal?  I've come up with a lot of reasons since becoming a dedicated blogger.  A blog serves as a method of organization.  I can read through old posts and figure out what I've been feeling.  Not only that, it's a way to tell people who you are and how you're feeling without a lot of unnecesarily awkward conversations.  Not only that, but I feel a lot more comfortable talking about myself and who I am now.  My blog allowed me to come out publicly.  I like that.  My blog has allowed me to bitch without getting on the nerves of my friends.  But what I've learned from this is an entirely different question.  I think that I've realized how fucked up my life, and everyone else's really are.  We really are unique.  We all have fucked up problems.  I've also realized that I am a troubled person, as much as I'd like to think that I am satisfied.  There is so much shit I want to accomplish.  This is kind of a log of that, but also a mark of my failures.  I want to amount to something.  I don't want to just make money.  I want to give something back.  I think this post exemplifies my blog.  insightful (I hope,) but most of all rambling and incoherent.  -Mike                 Where do I begin to describe what happened to me between 3 and 4 am?  Gareth and Ja decided to amicably separate.  I think it's probably the right decision.  With Ja going to college and Gareth being a junior and all, both of them are going to be having very fully years.  I hope things work out for them.  Gareth started reading this thing, and now knows a lot more about my life than he did at this time yesterday.  Which is good.  I'd wanted to tell him so much of this stuff, but I just couldn't.  Sarah caved.  I'm happy because of it.  I'm really glad that she chose to start bitching to me again.  I think it was a bad idea to not tell anyone anything.  It could only lead to badness.  Also, Sarah revealed some shit in her journal last night that's pretty shocktastic.  I'm oh so happy for her though, because she finally declared her public joining of the vast conspiracy.  Well, after finally going to sleep around 4, I sat in bed for several hours.  Around 5, the damn birds started chirping, and around 5:30 it was fully light outside.  That fucking sucked.  So I wound up with maybe 4 hours of sleep tonight.  I guess I'll just drink lots of Caffiene.  But I'm going to try to go back to sleep.  Wish me luck. -Mike  Shalala, shalala, shalala, the end is growing near                 Today was interesting.  Not interesting in that 'I hate everything and everyone way.'  More interesting in a 'pretty good' sorta way.  Woke up this morning.  Spent the night on my floor.  Very comfortable, surprisingly.  I'll probably do it again.  I think Louis has the right idea there.  Thanks kid.  Lunch with Gareth, home.  Left at 4 for the Center.  Got there around 5:10.  I was dissapointed.  I knew no one, and I felt really out of place there.  I enjoyed the discussion later, but for the most part I just felt awkward for a while.  I wanted to see Alex, but he didn't show.  Damn.  Got back to Linden, called sarah, and we drove around and ended up at the beach, which is always nice.  I'm glad we 'made up' or whatever.  And we talked about a lot of shit, so I think we're fine.  This is good.  I worry about Sarah a lot.  She's my best friend, but I feel like I'm so helpless when she tells me shit.  I find it so hard to empathize.  And that just sucks.  The only thing worse than feeling really shitty is feeling really shitty and not being able to do anything about it.  My parents are acting eerily normal.  Is reconciliation in the cards?  I doubt it.  I hope it is.  But I doubt it.  -Mike  'I've got to admit it's getting better, it's getting better, all the time.'                   My day was interesting.  I rolled out of bed, I finished   Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs,   By the illustrious Chuck Klosterman.  It's a fascinating book for the VH1 Junkie.  If you know your pop culture shit, you will enjoy this.  If you don't, you will think it is utter and complete garbage.  Later on, after a shower, I did nothing.  Well, not entirely.  I played bass and listened to Franz Ferdinand (who are awesome... by there album.)  I watched Jeopardy, on which this guy has now won over $440,000.  He is unstoppable.  Anyway, later Sarah called.  'It gon rain.' she said.  and thus, my search for a new recipient of a ravinia ticket began.  After a few failed attempts, I called James Noyes.  And wound up with a bit of an upgrade.  I ended up inside the pavilion.  Ben folds was awesome.  James's family were nice people.  although his brother was really annoying.  He asked a lot of irritating questions.  Not that I'm bitching about free tickets and dinner.  His parents tried to get me to come to an Obama fundraiser.  It was quite amusing.  After the show, we swapped some musical interests, and I went home.  Forgot to watch new Degrassi (grr... tomorrow I suppose).  and since then I've done nothing.  And that's my life as of now.  -Mike  'I pushed you 'cuz I loved you guys, I didn't realize, you weren't having fun.'                 I am Mike's asshole friend.  &nbsp;  In my mind right now, my friends are having the times of their life.&nbsp; Sarah is drunk and making out with Simon.&nbsp; Katie is laughing hysterically at the events unfolding.  &nbsp;  This is the party in Sarah's basement.&nbsp; This is the party that's occuring in my mind.  &nbsp;  Another screwdriver down the hatch.&nbsp; Another chuckle at the happiness that Mike couldn't join them.  &nbsp;  I am Mike's Pariah.  &nbsp;  I sit at home, by myself watching crappy television.&nbsp; This is my life.&nbsp; I type on my laptop.&nbsp; I self-indulgently think about the people who read this.&nbsp; I wish I were famous.&nbsp; I wish I had lots of money.&nbsp; I want to be a hollywood celebrity.&nbsp; I want to be worshipped.  &nbsp;  I pat myself on the back for immitating chuck palahniuk.  &nbsp;  I am Jack's stolen mind.  _____________________________________________________ &nbsp;  For the record, most of what I just wrote is entirely sarcastic.&nbsp; I just had that thought in the car today, 'My friends are having the time of their life.&nbsp; This is all occuring in my head.'&nbsp; Or some such nonsense... decided to write.  &nbsp;  I am Mike's failed attempt at writing something meaningful.  &nbsp;  -Mike  &nbsp;  The time is right,  but I feel all wrong.            \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
