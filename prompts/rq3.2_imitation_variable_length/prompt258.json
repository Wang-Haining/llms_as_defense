Ok, halfway through reading some of the reply posts, I started making noises. Not the 'happy, retard noises' the 'Havoc's pissed, get the fuck outta the way before you get shoved through the wall, and then raped up the butt' kinda noises. The first cock sniffing fucktard to dis Frankie, really pissed me off. First of all, I don't know why Frankie even posted at penny arcade. That place is full of fuckers who love their ps2's and queer cubes. Then they started ripping on 12 year olds. Ok prick riders, that's enough right there. Some of my friends happen to be 12, and they don't post retarded shit like those morons over at the penny arcade forums. Then they started being mean to Frankie, after he apologized for the test thread. He didn't have to apologize. He's Frankie! He can do whatever the fuck he wants! And the shit about cortana--low. Really low. I had to stop reading after about the 5th page of that bullshit. Oh, then they called the bungie.net forum users stupid, and made fun of retards, and said that the bungie forums were terrible. They didn't deserve the honor of having the bungie weekly update posted there! FUCK PENNY ARCADE! I HOPE ALL OF THE FUCKTARDED DICKSNIFFING COCKBITING PRICK SUCKING DONKEY HUMPING MOTHERFUCKING BASTARDS WHO TAKE IT UP THE ASS, AND RIP ON BUNGIE JUST BECAUSE THEIR PS2 CAN'T HANDLE THE XBOX'S L33T GRAPHICS CHOKE ON A DICK, ROT IN HELL, AND GET THEIR TESTICLES EATEN BY SMALL WOODLAND CREATURES WHO WOULD PROBABLY APPRECIATE THE BEST GAME IN THE WHOLE FUCKING WORLD, MORE THAN THOSE QUEER CUBE LOVERS! FUCK THEM, AND  FUCK YOU PS2!   Well...I feel better now.             Hello all of you who come here to read stuff about my life!   Everything is going well here.   Recently, I bought NFL 2k5. It's a great game. It took me from knowing nothing about football, and not caring, to loving football and knowing...some stuff.      Another game I got today was Rainbow Six 3 : Black Arrow. I wasn't so pleased with this game.   Anyways, to keep this post ending on a high note, I'll have reviews for both games sometime later.      I've been shopping a lot for my games and gear lately, and I've noticed that urlLink  Red vs Blue  has made a promo dvd to run in the demo xbox's at stores.   It's funny.  If you can ever hear it!  All of the stores have the volume turned wayy down on the xbox demos. But of course the pseww and gaycube demos are turned up more than loud enough to hear. 'Ref, I'd like to challenge that play!'    So of course they want the psew and queercube to sell. Sure folks, complain about not having jobs and all the jobs being overseas. THE PROBLEM ARE THE ONES WHO ARE COMPLAINING! BUY AMERICAN BITCHES! XBOX IS AN AMERICAN BRAND! NOT PS2! Who cares if Bill Gates is a prick, his products are great! And you're probably already using some of his stuff, no matter how much you hate him.    How can you keep the jobs in America, if no one wants anything to do with them?   And if you are a ps2, or gamecube fan, and think my politics talk is going no where, just wait a second, shits commin your way too.   Just because Xbox is newer, and has better graphics, doesn't mean that yall have to be haters.    I don't hate gamecube because it has shitty games.   I hate it because it has shitty graphics and no internal memory.    And ps2 is just old.    Don't buy something and love it when you know you can go better.    The choice is simple.    Buy an xbox. Not a ps2. Not a gamecube.   Why stand the crappy graphics, or low memory?   And if you think the xbox has bad graphics, don't blame the xbox! Blame the developers!    In the gaming business, it's all about the money. And supposedly, whoever gets their games out the fastest will make the most money. WRONG! Crappy graphics on mediocre games don't rake in the cash.    Blockbuster hits with innovative gameplay and graphics keep the money train riding along for a good long time.   Look at Halo, it's sold over 1 million copies, and people are still buying it!   Either way you look at it, when Halo 2 comes out, it will own you all.    November 9th, 2004.   Are you in?              I feel free. I feel like there's nothing left for me here. I want to go on some random pointless conquest/journey and do crap. But I've got no reason to leave. There's also no reason to stay. I wonder if I left, if anyone would care besides my parents. And I wonder if anyone would want to come with me...  Anyways...I feel so free. I want to just leave, take my stuff, and go. And unpack in the first really kick ass town that I find myself in. Like some place at the beach. With hot girls. And a really big video gaming community. A place where fireworks are legal. And even the cops find themselves breaking the law. A place where you can do what you want and no one would care. Sounds like a 3rd world country, doesn't it? Heh, right now, I wouldn't care where the hell I had to go to find a beach, hot girls, fireworks, and a place where I could do what I want. But of course, I'd have to pick up a few friends before I went there. I'd have to pick up eek, and Grimes. And we'd all bring our xboxes, and we'd be happy. Once we got there, we'd find some really hot girls. And become street performers and put on shows for tourists. And they'd be rich tourists and they would throw like huge stacks of money to us after our show was over. Then we'd all go buy fireworks, and play xbox all night. And drink Bawls. Ahh...Sounds like the life eh? And as for our shows, we could be like, pirates (since were at the beach, it sounds appropriate, eh?) and sword fight and one of us could always die (like Kenny in south park) and be dragged off and eaten by a monkey (that could be eek) and we would be sword fighting for a chest of something. And the one guy left could open it, and it could be full of...bananas...So then eek comes back as a monkey and knocks out the dude with the chest, and steals the chest away. Then our performance would be over. Funny, huh?             I was mowing the lawn a few minutes ago, and I was thinking about all the people that I need to thank. I'd like to give a thank you/shout out to grimes (Jake), for showing me how stupid I can be and not supporting me when I was bitching about stuff. I'd like to thank eek (Erik) for being there and playing yr and having fun and stuff with me...      Then I was thinking about the people who hate me, or maybe don't, but those of you who are wondering :'What keeps him going?' Well...She knows who she is. She's great. She supports me. Helps me see things in more than one spectrum. Backs me up. And talks to me when I really need someone. No this ain't my mom I'm talkin about you assholes. Anyways, she knows who she is, and I hope she reads this.      Then there are those of you that are kinda there. There when it's important.   There when I have no one else to turn to. Thank you to you guys also.      You might be thinking: 'Why all the thankyou's? Is he planning to kill himself?'    Well, no. I'm just thinking : say what you've got to say today, because tomorrow might not come.              Ok. So why the hell is it that everyone loves to fuck with me? Am I fun to fuck with? Easy to fuck with? Well fuck you all who fuck with me! I've had enough! I try to live my life for me, but obviously what I do isn't enough for everyone else. Everyone else finds faults in the way I am. Well you know what!? FUCK YOU! If you've got a fucking problem with me, then too fucking bad. I live my life for  ME  and only  ME!  Need some examples of who fucks with me? Well lets see... there's Grimes and his cousin. Well, that didn't really get me going, but it just added fuel to this lil rant here. There's Sylvie, my Ex...She acts like everything I fucking do is her business. Well I've got news for ya, BITCH, IT'S NOT! Can't you understand that you have nothing to do with me now!? One more thing about the fuckers who think that they can come into my life, and be a part, tell me to do things, and fuck with my heart, guess what, YOU CAN'T! You always try to alter my moods, or stop me from doing things you don't want me to do, bitch. I keep to myself, what the hell did I ever do to get your attention? Do something that's going to keep your life from being 'perfect'? Well you go and peruse your little slice of 'perfect' and I'll sit, and wait for you to find it. And once you do, I'm sure as hell, going to fuck things up ten times worse then anything you ever did to fuck with me!    \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
