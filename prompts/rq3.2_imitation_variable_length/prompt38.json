  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic:\n\n       &nbsp;  i want to write like the guys at the slam.  there is some need to practice,  just to get used to the keys and the mind to finger effectually on that which is the keyboard.  i have never understood the people who can type without watching where their fingers were.  then again, I never was much of a typist.  &nbsp;  im insanely jealous of the poets on slam night.  they are theatrical and intelligent and sensible and beautiful  in giving me the right of audience to their emotions  though they know me not,  i hear their pain, their memories, their embarrassing dates, and their first loves.  poetry is the rawest of all the freedoms of expression.  art can give you the disguise of metaphor or color.  novels and movies give the illusion of candor, hidden in wit..  the hoarse voice of&nbsp; reality  is the poet’s domain.  &nbsp;  but for that reason-I shouldn’t care.  i am no poet.  i report the realities.  reality lacks style.  there is no finesse to reality.  or it wouldn’t be reality-it would be fox news.          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
