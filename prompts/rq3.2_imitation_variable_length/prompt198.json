LA's got a lot of great things to do and see,  but no cohesive downtown like New York or San Francisco. We have freeways connecting everything, so from one attraction to the other there's a lot of driving to be done.  This fosters a kind of love/hate relationship with the one's car and streets of the city.  I thought I'd look a little bit more on the love side of the scale since I'm trapped up in silicon valley where it's just plain different (I suppose it's like  the  valley with less burger joints, less sushi, less porn, and a lot more tech) The great thing about LA driving is the scenery, it's tough to beat the LA variation from city to beach to oilfields to canyons, while never being more than 10 minutes from an in-n-out or a fatburger. A driving date is something you can really only do with someone who gets it.  But for those who do understand, there just something compelling about cruising around on a sunny day,windows down, roof open and good music blasting.   I've always liked it because it's pretty cheap, and all you need to make it work is a date that's up for it and decent loop.  I personally like the trip from mulholland to malibu canyon, to piuma (the overlook is a good place to stop and picnic), back out to PCH, grab drinks and dinner in santa monica and close off the loop in west LA, but the city's full of good ones.  So for any angelinos reading this, throw your favorite drive loop into the comments      Mellow Ride playlist coming soon                         urlLink manybooks.net - Free eBooks for your PDA    Lately  I've taken to downloading ebooks for my palm, and carying my palm with me whenever I know I might be waiting somewhere for a while.  Project Gutenberg is a great way of getting tons of free texts that I should have read by now.  What I really need is a good epaper (for the reduced eyestrain), ebook reader with a digital pen that lets me annotate books and save my annotations in a seperate file that can be loaded over the ebook text.  If the big publishers came together with a few platform companies and got a general standard ebook format decided on, the rest of the software vendors would follow.  Granted the standard would end up being strongarmed by microsoft and palm most likely, but at least then there'd be one general standard.  It would have to allow for freeform pagination because of different display sizes and preferences, but it would be really easy to have some xml based format, or just require that ebooks follow one specific xml schema and then let vendors parse them however the hell they like.  I can envision myself in 5 years going to a kiosk at an airport bookstore, slotting an sd card in and picking up the newest clancey type junkfood bestseller.  I'd never carry a paperback again                  Good Day- Sunshine     Beautifull Weather Playlist   Fatboy Slim- Right here right now Looper- Mondo 77 groove armada- I see you baby M/A/R/R/s- pump up the volume wiseguys- start the commotion fatboy slim- gangsta trippin propellerheads- velvet pants Moby -Bodyrock Ocean's 11-deep end Fatboy Slim -satisfaction skank Dub Pistols- Cyclone Fatboy Slim- Magic Carpet Ride Daft Punk- Da funk Beverly Hills cop theme- Axel F Bob Marley vs. Funkstar Delux- Sunday Shining Basement Jaxx- Red Alert Darude- Sandstorm Finley Quaye- Sunday Shining Beck- Tropicalia Cibo Matto- Flowers Caviar- Tangerine Speedo Beck-Deadweight   So it is a beautifull day out here in Palo Alto, 75 degrees, crystal clear air, gorgeous sun.  The kind of day that makes one want to play hookie and throw around the frisbee, or hit the beach.  Man am I glad my office has a window.  In honor of this first truly gorgeous day this year I've tossed together a little summery playlist to groove to.  There were many more songs I wanted to add, but well, the playlist takes up a lot of real estate.  So here's a flash animation from the past come back to haunt us  urlLink Gonads and Strife  when flash animations were crude, choppy and hilarious.  If you don't already do so regularly, hit up strongbad emails at  urlLink homestar runner  it's worth it to go back a while and get to know the characters but beware, it can eat up lots of time                     My buddy Ali's family lives in Sydney, so he offered me the guestroom for the weekend and his services as tour guide, how could I refuse.  Friday night we got in from the airport and went directly to an upscale bar filled with well dressed good looking people, think NYC with nicer people.  After a couple hours at the bar we hit drove through the extremely seedy kings cross (crackheads and prostitutes lining the sidewalks) to Harry's Cafe de Wheels for a bite.  Harry's has been around in Sydney for ages, it's a little trailer in a seedy part of town that's open late and serves tasty food to defile the temple of the body.  I had a chicken pie toppped with mashed potatoes and cheese sauce, and what they called a chilli cheese dog.  A harry's chilli cheese dog is bizzare, it's a hot dog with mashed peas (yes, mashed peas), onions,  chili, hot sauce, and this bechamel looking 'cheese sauce'.  Lemme tell ya, after a bunch of drinks it was delicious.  The next day I took the ferry to Manly, got a great view of the city from the harbor and walked around.  Went to the gym, then went out again.  Sydney has this casino that looks great on the outside, and looks like the stardust on the inside.  Ali's friend was celebrating her 29th, so we celebrated by going to this club in the casino with a bar that overlooked the casino floor.  80's music, and neat 'fiddich's for $6US, suffice to say, a good time was had by all.  The next day was a little more sight seeing and recovery, then back to the office.                  photos blogs and better living through technology      Offbeat music   Johnny Cash- Ring of Fire Wall of Voodoo- Mexican Radio Beck- Deadweight Cibo Matto-Sci Fi Wasabi Nails- 88 Lines about 44 women Cake- The Distance Poe- A rose is a rose Violent Femmes-American Music Propellerheads-Take California (and party)    So I've decided to write my blog posts a little slower, and try to reduce the errors in them.  I have received enough email, from a sibling who shall remain nameless, that it behooves me to clean up my act.  On a completely separate note I have recently acquired a camera phone and begun  urlLink moblogging .  It occurred to me that this would make an awesome medium for playing assassins with cameras using a weblog, so if you are interested email me.  Photo scavenger hunts with this thing could also be pretty cool.

So it has come to the point where nearly all of my links are coming from my aunt.  I no longer have to scour the web for unusual sites or little tools because she aggregates them for me, and unlike fark they are delivered to my mailbox every morning.  So I have decided to find a couple good ones of my own so I feel less like an aggregator and more like a collector.  I'd just like to give a shout-out to an acquaintance from school, Anthony Levandowski, who has entered in the Barstow to Las Vegas robot race with, get this, a  urlLink  robotic motorcycle (scroll down to get to levandowski), trying to solve a problem much tougher than a segway.

There is but one answer, and it came to George Clinton straight out of the pyramids: 'Funk is its own reward.' Every once in a while I feel that it is important to take a step back from the drudgery of our lives and embrace the funk.  Many of my good friends have also taken this to heart like former disco vigilante Tom Berman a.k.a the impresario of Funk, Ryan Salcedo the Funky Fish(founder of the Earth, Wind, & Fire tribute band 'Water'), or Nick Hinkell who eats, sleeps, breathes, and skates the funk every day.  So the next time today someone asks you to acknowledge something respond in your best baritone with an 'I dig', or a 'Damn straight,' unless they be jive'n in which case you can tell 'em what the five fingers said to the face            \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
