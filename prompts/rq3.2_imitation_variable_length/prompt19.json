Kristine picked me up @ 10 a.m. and we went to TVHS to turn in our UC essays to Ms. Cutler. Well, we go there and Ms.Culter replies---'You didn't double-space?' At that point, I think my face blanched. I swear (and I doubled checked) that this lil bit of info was NOT in the instructions. So Kris and I rushed to my house, where we promptly had to retype her essay and print mine out with the correct spacing. When she was done typing it was 15 minutes to 11 a.m., our deadline. As I was finishing my corrections, I told her to warm up the car. It felt like we were doing a heist. lol. I then rushed out of my house like a mad woman into her car that was ready to go and we sped off (hmmm... I wonder how fast we were driving?). Kris pulled up to the front office and I  ran  out of the car to deliver the essay on time (last I checked we still had 5 minutes at the stoplight). lol I didn't even shut the car door. What an adventure! We're always doing crazy things like that. lol.  Anywayz, afterwards we treated ourselves to some Ben and Jerry's, which is surprisingly cheaper than B&amp;R. We were in the Town Plaza, so Kristine wanted to look at the pottery store, Painted Earth. We ended up staying there for about 3 1/2 hrs painting little star shaped ceremic boxes---she had also decided to do a ceramic car for her boyfriend. It was a ton of fun and way relaxing. teehee I got to get in touch w/ my creative, artsy side!                           I went to Maji's 1st b-day today. The first thing she did when I saw her was cry. I didn't think she liked me that much...(and who wants to be known as making babies cry??) but she actually warmed up to me later. I also saw a bunch of other aunts, uncles, and cousins. But I was mobbed by my grandma (from my dad's side) who then proceed to grope my ass while hugging me. I've noticed that my other grandma, and occassionally my mom, do that sometimes.  What is with the butt thing?  Leave me alone!! ::sigh:: It was still great to see them all again.       How kawaii!  It's s/t my aunt gave me from the cake.   I saw another lil cousin, Anica (she's 3 yrs old), which is always amusing since she's used to having her way and does that most hilarious things. She started to strip her clothes off because she had wanted to swim but Sophie (another baby cousin) had her suit. LOL. Geez, she's bold. Then again, I guess all three-yrs-olds are typically carefree.       Here's the b-day girl!  Eating my kitty...no!! Well, maybe she's attracted to the frosting still on it...            \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
