'In addition to 'NARC' and 'Length of Love,' songs that have been recorded and are being considered for the new album include 'Not Even Jail,' 'Evil' and one that has the working title 'Rod Laver.' some geezer tennis player i dunno. is it me or did paul banks gain a few pounds?    if you're somewhat savvy with film you should enter the  urlLink interpol short film contest . i would except the only video i ever tried to put together was a movie about cyborg ninjas and our costumes included nintendo power gloves with the wires cut off. so um yah.   ALSO GO WATCH  urlLink THE ASOBI SEKSU VIDEO!!! . just scroll down a bit. sondre lerches two way monologue is on there as well but i cant stand watching him cause he looks too much like  urlLink clay aiken ? anyway the video is awesome cause it has a couch for the centerpiece and interpol sings about couches so woohoo.   urlLink franz ferdinand , alongside  urlLink the dandy warhols  and  urlLink super furry animals  are featured on a soundtrack for a  urlLink PORNO FLICK !  nine songs  directed by michael winterbottom premiered at the cannes film festival a few weeks ago. its supposed to be a love story told through the act of blowjobs and vagina licking and cumshots and etc etc. yes im sure when it comes to video everyones going to be renting it for its sentimental value and totally NOT  pulling their goalie  to it.                                urlLink new pornographers ' carl newman is coming out with a solo project on  urlLink matador records . its just some nice catchy indiepop. i love the slight lisp in his voice.  urlLink download here   bands to check out: fans of  urlLink my bloody valentine  definitely head over to  urlLink pluramon . the  dreams top rock  album seriously rivals  loveless .   i've been obsessed with finding quiet, lulling tunes as of late. the only criteria being they still must be ENGAGING. my playlist has just been riddled with  urlLink stina nordenstam ,  urlLink devics , and  urlLink the innocence mission .   pitchfork has been on the ball lately as they've finally slapped on  urlLink hot reviews  of comatose keyboard rockers  urlLink on! air! library!  and they're definitely all over  urlLink ratatat  as most die-hard  urlLink interpol  fans have heard of already.  HERES MY SLEEP PLAYLIST AS OF A FEW NIGHTS AGO:  > doves _ m62 song > sondre lerche _ it's over > mice parade _ two, three, fall > ellen allien _ abstract pictures > little wings _ i saw reflections > parsley sound _ yoyo > air _ alone in kyoto > innocence mission _ tomorrow on the runway > figurine _ time (his mix) > broadcast _ winter now > the delgados _ coming in from the cold > pluramon _ noise academy > jesus & mary chain _ just like honey > the arcade fire _ my heart is an apple > elbow _ grace under pressure > asobi seksu _ walk on the moon > broken social scene _ anthem for a seventeen year old girl > devics _ the end and the beginning > on! air! library! _ five > my bloody valentine _ loomer > stina nordenstam _ stations  and the final alarm clock snooz'ish song: > +/- _ no one sees you like i do  this track is going to make wake me up, let me fall back asleep for three seconds, wake my fat ass up again, lull me back to sleep for another three seconds, and repeat.                                  nice PHOTOSHOP LENS FLARE?! respect for  urlLink moving units  plummetting.   march 9th is going to be an AWESOME DAY. alongside  urlLink deerhoofs  new lp ( milk man ),  urlLink blonde redhead  recently signed to  urlLink 4ad  alongside total pothead neil halstead and have a new album entitled  misery is a butterfly . the site reads a release date of feb 23rd BUT I KNOW IM RIGHT ON THIS ONE. MARCH 9TH DAMNIT.   tracklist:  01 Elephant Woman 02 Messenger 03 Melody 04 Doll Is Mine 05 Misery Is A Butterfly 06 Falling Man 07 Anticipation 08 Maddening Cloud 09 Magic Mountain 10 Pink Love 11 Equus  if you havent heard already,  urlLink ladytron  is going to be remixing interpols  untitled . i've no idea when this is supposed to be out and im sure it wont be too good anyway.  this is largely based on arthur bakers remix of obstacle 1 which is just a series of awful cut and pasting  in cool edit or something. SUCK! at least interpol made  blue jeans  way better.  anyway due to my SCRATCHED CORNEA, my ability to update this site has been largely hindered, mostly due to any  BOLD FONTS  that definitely cause severe pain upon viewing. no. joke.                               whenever i cant find something new to like, i cycle through some of the phases of my past musical lexicon. there would be weeks on end when i'd only listen to 90's britpop ala shed seven, kula shaker, rialto etc etc. seven of the twenty eight or so days would've been solely dedicated to going through  urlLink jarvis cockers discography . on a sidenote: i reckon the only fools to have picked up pulps greatest hits disc were also the ones who went out and bought nirvana's best of. seriously if you dont already own nevermind and friends then you really need to work on not being a sack of dumbass.   my early high school days were basically all about elastica, the rentals, and of course nirvana. throw in weezer to further ruin any credibility. track back further and you have me listening to bel biv devoe and brian adams in grade 4-5. everyone is a big fat liar if they tell you they never listened to new kids on the block.   moving out of my parents house involved lots of mogwai, refused, tristeza and blonde redhead. i remember my electronic/dnb phase immediately following watching the movie groove. sprinkle on some chinese/j-pop/early 90's emo bands/the cure and you have the basic map of steve lams jingles. flash forward to now and if you're reading this, im probably listening to whatever hip/pretentious/cool bands you're listening to.   i've no idea why i bothered to articulate all of the above. i actually did find new albums to dig:   urlLink clearlake - cedars    urlLink the coral - magic & medicine    urlLink devics - stars at st. andrea.  this came out a while ago but i dont think it received the attention it should have. clearly mentioning it on here will make up for it! portishead'ish if you didnt know.  miscellaneous blabbery:  urlLink the watchers  just finished up their tour with  urlLink james chance ! RIDICULOUS. this definitely makes them hotter than the  urlLink liars  right now.   im not sure how i feel about jarvis cockers  urlLink relaxed muscle  project yet. if noel gallagher says attempts at avant garde'ness are needless, then THEY ARE NEEDLESS. either way, we need the sexy jc back, not the idiotic deranged misfits costume bullshit.                                i cant shut up about marcus schmickler aka  urlLink pluramon . all i can think about when listening to  dreams top rock  (his other albums are all over the place in terms of genre ranging from IDM (yah yah thats like saying 'emo' whatevs blahbablh) and electronica) is MY BLOODY VALENTINE!!! if  loveless  was responsible for inspiring a wazillion shoddy shoegaze bands (the more i listen to  urlLink my vitriol  the more grossed out i get? i dont know i used to love them!) then it should also be noted that at least one sweet follow-up (AKA THE ALBUM IM TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW) came out in the aftermath.     julie cruises vocals (aka the roadhouse singer from TWIN PEAKS) remind me of a cleaned up  urlLink stina nordenstam , and although not nearly as eery and threatening as belinda butcher, her vocals are just so PERFECT. meanwhile pluramon has the whole kevin shields guitar sound down pat. i am writing like a giddy schoolgirl right now.   DOWNLOAD THIS PLURAMON TRACK NOW. its totally mbv's 'touch my breath' & 'loomer' combined.   urlLink pluramon - hello shadow                                JUST GOT BACK FROM MACROCK WEEKEND. despite the four million bands playing i think i only bothered to watch two or three? there was a point in the evening where i thought i was just going to give up watching live bands altogether until  urlLink plus/minus  and  urlLink mates of state  got on stage. both were phenomenal. can you believe the two members of mates of state are married and preggers AND still touring? its like  urlLink julie doiron  but waaaay cooler and less french.   lots of hang outs with some awesome kids sewn throughout the plethora of post-macrock afterparties! my new best friend forevs DANA and i were discussing nyc bands and i was reminded of  urlLink prosaics !!! i remember checking out their page a while ago listening to their short ass sound clips of joy division/new order'esque  urlLink failure  and instantly fell in love. its seriously ian curtis reincarnated. heres a full track of TEETH even though i dont think its their best track...NONETHELESS CLICK CLICK HERE ->  urlLink prosaics - teeth   i think im off to see the  urlLink JEWKNEECORNS  tonight. though im tired and may just stay in to celebrate/jack off to UNICORNS  urlLink UNI-PORN .                                    as if there werent enough breasts sporadically bursting out lately. GODAMNIT   urlLink COURTNEY LOVE KILLS HER POSSIBLY FICTIONAL BABY    urlLink further proof that john mayer is the biggest loser in the world   nyc's  urlLink dfa records  have legally forced toronto's  urlLink death from above  to change their name. they're now known as FIRST TO FIGHT.   heres the word from the FIRST TO FIGHT boys:  quote: 'hello due to legal issues we want nothing to do with we have had to change our name the people at DFA records apparently trademarked DEATH FROM ABOVE in america and so our label in america (vice/atlantic) wont release our record as long as they have taken legal action. we tried for the last 3 weeks to make this go away, we had the best lawyers working on it non stop, we tried everything. but now, rather than fooling around with this anymore we have had to change our name to FIRST TO FIGHT. we went through about 100000000 names and they all sucked in thier own special way.  so nothing will change on here for awhile cause im not at home and the all important logo is still the same. its a downer but it had to happen. a rose by any other name, right?  so in closing FUCK DFA RECORDS FUCK JAMES MURPHY WE DECLARE JIHAD ON THEM HOLY WAR ENDING IN THIER DEATH AND DISMEMBERMENT  -j f k'  oh jesse. 'THIER THIER' it'll be ok.              \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
