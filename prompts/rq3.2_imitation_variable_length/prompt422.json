  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic:\n\n           The word is peloton! the group of cyclists who are in the pack behind the leader. Yes, I'm up and watching the Olympics again. This time I woke a half hour into the fun. But I'm just happy I remembered the word. Especially since its the womens cycling today.  Today is my youngests counsins Christening. I was in Ireland at the last Christening to take place in this family. And the one before that was Katie, the girl I'm 'babysitting'. I remember the party after Katies Christening very clearly, which I find surprising because I was only 9 at the time. However, I won't be attending Isabellas Christening today. I knew about it, yes, but I'm house bound, with my parents with my car and Katies parents with her car. I received a call at 9:30am from my cousin to ask if we were still going. Appearently plans had been made without me to have me and Katie picked up for this little shindig. But its 9:30am! the Christening is at 11am. I'm just waking up, Katies still in REM sleep. Two girls, somewhat concerned with their appearence will take longer than one hour to get ready, its a law of nature........especially since I have NO appropriate clothing to attend. People should really fill me in on things that concern me.                      I've said goodbye to my folks for 10 days.  Yes, they deciede to take a little vacation a mere 3 weeks before I go.  But thats ok, I need a little 'alone in St. John's' time myself.  However, I woke up sick.  And I'm a sucker for being taken care of when I'm sick.  And theres no one to take care of me.  Although my best friend did offer to take me to the emergency room.  Ahh...no.  Sitting in a noisy hospital room waiting to be told I have the flu is not my kind of way to spend a Saturday.  I'll veg and reminse about all the times I've been sick while living alone before.  And survived.  Although I'd almost give my leg arm to have my exboyfriend here now to take care of me.  He diligently woke me every 4 hours while I was living in Dublin to make me drink water and to make sure I hadn't developed some rare Irish sickness.  I had never been so sick in my whole life.  And I am eternally grateful to him for helping me.  I'm sure I would have accepted a marriage proposal after that.  But I digress...  I busted out and bought the dvd to the 46664 concert I went to in Cape Town last Nov.  I've never spent so much on a single dvd.  And the worst part, i can't find myself!  Not that we had the greatest view.  But somewhere in the back of my mind I was sure that I was on it...somewhere and Bono would see it and hunt me down...wait....I'm getting carried away...nonethelsss, I didn't see myself or the other 6 Canadians I went with.  And I must mention my deep unhappiness with the new commerical for the prequeal to the Exorcist.  I probably don't need to explain what an absolutly frightening movie the original is.  And this new one, although seems much less on the scarey side, is conjuring up a bunch of unpleasant images that I must deal with....here...alone.  I saw one at 10am!  Who puts that commerical on at 10am?  Little children are watching that!  Are we trying to push the next generation over the edge and into oblivion?  Or maybe the rest of the world doesn't find it as frightening as I do.  So I sit here on this oddly sunny Saturday afternoon awaiting a promising thunder and lightening storm.  I get cheated by mother nature everytime we have a storm.  I'm usually asleep and I miss it.  However, I'm determined to sit alone and watch it this time.  I find storms an oddly spiritual event (being so very non spiritual myself).  The electricity in the air clears me and recharges my batteries.                       I've managed to become somewhat involved in a research oppertunity without having any knowledge of what the research would entail. That would be my 'look before you leap' quality shining through. However, I've managed to submit a resume to be a lead researcher for the upcoming SSCR conferance on the proposed restructuring of the Native reserves. Have I any interest in native issues? Not really. But i applied thinking that this might be a good way to get my foot in the door and introduce myself to the NRC as a competent researcher. However, I think back to my entire knowledge base of native issues and all I can think of is Five-Wing Goose Bay. I somewho doubt that will be a leading research topic. But I digress...money is money and experience is worth a million bucks.  However, what prompted me to post again today was a story just recently on The National. Darfur, Sudan. Yes, we all can picture the starving children, left motherless by the Sudanese rebels fight the Islamic government. Yes, we cringe at the staggering amount of women who are being raped during this 'genocide'. But sadly, what interests me is the hesitation of the labelling of this situation as a 'genocide'. I fully understand the reprecussions of the UN announcing the offical term genocide in Darfur. Chapter 7 (?) peace keeping missions and all that bull. But do we have to remain blind to the horrific acts of violence and horrid rape of humanity that occured just 10 years ago in Rwanda? Will we let Kofi Annan follow in the footsteps of the incompetent leaders that have come before him? Or will we 'outsource' the policing of the Darfur, only to make the area a protectorate of some other country? We should take a page out of R. Dallaire's book (not literally, having not read it yet) and shout at the top of our lungs, go crazy with the maddness of it all until the UN is faced with the reality of the situation. It will come to a chapter whatever peace keeping mission. Whether is comes to that now or in two months or in a year should not be a concern. What should be OUR concern is that we make it happen now.  What struck me as most humourous in this report this evening was the interview of a very clever academic with the Kennedy Center for Government at Harvard. She suggested that we call in those most emotionally equipped to deal with the 'problem' being created in Darfur, those unlikely Rwandians, who are truly the only people who can imagine such acts. Who better to fight the growing genocide than those who have experienced it first hand? Was it not the Congolise who were called in as a front line in Rwanda to help our dear R. Dallaire in Rwanda. The same Congolise who has suffered similar, yet different fates in thier own country? And as backup? This woman suggested that 'uncontroversial' countries such as Canada (a known powerhouse in peacekeeping...[Somalia anyone?]), Australia, South Africa (I shutter to consider who would have been in their place 10 years ago) should be the ones to clean up the mess made. At least shes honest about her own countries dangerous laisons. Do we really see a future in Darfur without the U.S.? I can only hope so. But I continue to digress...  Maybe we should 'outsource' the peacekeeping before we demand that the UN do what they were created for. Would Woodrow Wilson be turning in his grave? I doubt, but he probably didn't foresee a UN that would hide behind legal and linguistical technicalities either. But alas here we are, attempting to force the hand of the organization that was created to protect it.  But I should not have to digress again.          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
