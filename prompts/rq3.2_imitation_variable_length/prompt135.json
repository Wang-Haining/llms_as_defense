Aaron, Regis, Mark, Pat, Sean, and I watched tv and played chess all night.  Today was even better!! NOT! I had to get up at 7 to take ACTs...some girl in Eric's room had a seizure! that's nuts, I wasn't THAT stressed about the tests. Anyways, after getting over the fact that I had to take the tests at Marshall, unfamiliar territory, I made my way to room 302 to check out how smart I really was. I'm predicting a 26...we'll see.  Aaron is sick today :(, poor thing...he sounds like he's got what I had... I think it's going around...being sick to your stomach and that stuff, but I have a feeling it's those noodles he ate last night! like 20 packages!!  Mom, Dad, and Sean are out of town til tomorrow at 10:30...PARTY AT JEN'S...j/k. I have to spend the night at my Aunt's house tonight, but it's cool because Laura and I will stay up all night talking about random guy things, hehe -- Girls' night. yey.  I jumped a whopping 4'8' at the Midland meet today...considering the weather and stress from ACTs, I think I did alright.  This research paper in English is killing me! Anyone with suggestions on how to express my understanding of owning a Bed-n-Breakfast....hmmmm...I'm stressed, oh well....deep breath.  Well, it's about time to head up to my Aunt's house so I'll catch ya'll on the flip side, hehe...ly Joey muah                     'A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush' Shit! I have no bird. I have no bush. God has taken my bird and my bush. I am left with a high mound of unorganized paper that is waiting for me to shuffle through and magically produce an 'A' grade AP paper. *sigh* Why does it seem like everything happens at once?  While everyone else has cute little quotes or quoted songs on their profiles, I refuse to mask the truth. Relationships are hard! And sometimes they suck, sometimes they are great. But mostly we just spend our time trying to fathom some unreal bonding experience between two people. I don't see any point in trying to hide it. We all know that our significant other isn't perfect, despite the multiple 'I love you's and the random 'I was just thinking about you' gifts. We push aside their imperfections, trying, hoping, praying that our relatioship will look better than the other person's. Or maybe we don't think we can do better, bullcrap, there is always someone better out there for you! If you have a feeling, then follow it. But don't try to be someone you aren't or turn someone else into something they aren't. Please, if anything, be true to yourself. I know it sounds cliche but really now, why put so much effort into a relationship that you KNOW is doomed from the start. All I'm saying is to see things for what they really are. Look deeper into someone's heart, look below the skin.   I need more caffine or compansion...one of the two...I'll be up all night working on this research paper.   Current Mood : I'm lost, I haven't a bird nor a bush  Currently Playing : Hopelessly Devoted to You - Olivia Newton John (for old times sake)                     Today Aaron and I watched the Real World/ Road Rules challenge, the Inferno. I guess they were having a marathon because we watched like 4 hours of it. So that's 8 shows, and that means 8 people got voted off. Wow. By the time we got tired of watching TV, I felt as if I personally knew every one of the cast members - CT, the Miz, Tim, or Coral. Pick one, and I could tell you their favorite color. Haha, not really.  We left my house around 8 and met Christian at Gabes. I bought a shirt there, and no, that doesn't mean I'm a skank just because I bought clothing from a discount store. There is no reason I should pay $20 for a Weathervane shirt, when it's only $4.99 somewhere else, in perfectly good condition. So to all you haters out there - shove it, because Gabe's (and Goodwill and Marshalls) rocks! :P I'm worn out from the Relay for Life last night that lasted until 7am this morning. Emily and I couldn't make it all night so we left the school around 1:30...oh yea, did I mention is was basically down-pouring the WHOLE time?! yea, fun stuff... Anyway I'm tired and I have to work tomorrow - come see me :) night!                     Hey guys!! Joey is here!!! yey! The first day was a bit rocky but after that things went smoothly...sometimes I don't know about him cuz he gets weird and all like 'i'm hanging out w/ my friends' but then when he sees me he's all like 'i'm never letting you go...' lol strange. anyways, track practice at 10 this morning wasn't so bad, only 6 of us showed up though. John Kerry comes to WVa tomorrow guys! get excited! just kidding, my mom hates that man, lol, don't kno why...she says he lies a lot. Daniella and I did a presentation on him and he didn't seem too bad. I washed my car because it was so pretty outside. I had a pleasantly surprising visit from Eric while drying the car and I was elated. We never hang out anymore, maybe because everytime we do, we always try to make everyone around us aware about the fact that we hate each other more than the other one hates us. Its a strange relationship. I'd hang out with him alone more often if it weren't for Micaela and Joey. Oh well, I don't think we should be trying to out-do the other so much and maybe we could start rebuilding our friendship...w/e. Dinner's ready...laaatterrrr                      Hey its my first day writing on this so just some background about me...  Jennifer Nicole Lucas is my name :) I am completely in love with my boyfriend of about 1 year, Joey and I go to Huntington High  I really only got this thing so I could vent all my stresses and traumas i experience thru-out the summer and stuff like that... I dont really care about spelling or grammatical errors. I dont kno who will read this but i'm sure someone will find it amusing. I dont really have any friends cuz they all seem to stab me in the back. but i refuse to right about stupid shit like the damn war thats 'going on'.   although i will talk about the student council elections that are on May 15th...anyone from HHS...vote for me Junior Class Secretary...  so anyways, I have this huge MG(multi-genre) shit due in 2 different classes and is totally stressing me out...and a science project that the parents will not leave the freak ALONE! thats it for 2nite, just wanted to test this new stuff out...  oh yea, gotta get up at 6 tomorrow for an awesomely fun track meet!           \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
