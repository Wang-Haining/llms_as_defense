Oh , my god. This morning i found the beginning of a stretch mark. ON MY THIGH. What the frick. *scared* that wasnt there before!!! lol enough of that. actually there is a good reason for it.. my knees are taped into place at physio, and donc the skin up my thigh stretches... righto *sighs of relief* So, today there was a perfectly pointless english exam. really really crap, but i did well i think (hope). Unfortunatley there is a g√©ographie examen tomorrow. im prepared to fail... lol.. ok maybe not fail but do BAD, mostly cause i cant make myself study. wonder why... ok, probably because its geography is why. Heather and Sharon came over this afternoon. we 'studied' well not really at all. Says Heather : 'my brazilian waxer has gone farther with me than anyone!' great... except she has never had a brazilian. YET. lol this summer is the summer for ... fun?!  yea, thats the one... righto. lol sharon waxed one part of her leg. she then screamed in pain... we wont mention that i waxed my upper thigh... PAIN is the word im looking for.  All i have to say is, the other party im NOT invited to had better not be the party of choice tomorrow night. if it is i may cry. :( whatever. bye!         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
