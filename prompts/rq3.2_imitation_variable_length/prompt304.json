You know, the one that always said, “Dude, you’re getting a Dell” in a ton of commercials?  Well, I don’t know how many of you listen to Stern in the morning, but this kid was on his show today.  Howard was asking about his contract with Dell, and what happened to it.  Basically, this is it:  The audition was his second audition ever, and he landed the Dell commercial (which was also their first national campaign).  The commercial was a big success, so they did more.  Eventually, Dell offered this kid a half million dollar contract to do about 4 more commercials and some guest appearances.  But then he screwed it all up by getting busted for buying pot.  Dell pulled the plug on the ½ mill deal, and dropped the kid from the campaign.  He lost $500,000 because he bought $50 worth of drugs.     urlLink     He talks positive about it, like it was actually a good thing, but I'm not so sure.  He wanted that cash, and he deserved it.  He was the Dell Guy, and everyone in the country knows him as that.  Now he walks around with the brand, but nothing to show for it.  He wants to try and make it as a real actor now (not commercial actor), but personally I don’t think it’ll ever fly.  He’s the Dell kid.  It’s hard to see him as anything else.    That’s the problem (one of the few) with the huge commercial campaigns.  If you’re lucky enough to get one, you’d better get used to being known as that for the rest of your career.  Doing too well at selling one thing can really pigeon hole you in this town.  If that’s the road you take, don’t screw it up before the big payout.  That half million could have set him for life.  If you’re about to sign a big contract, stay away from anything remotely illegal until the ink is dry.  Now I wonder whatever happened to those kids playing Dell Interns in the follow-up campaign...          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
