The Summit County coroner�s office identifies the woman as Mary Wiper. Wiper had reportedly just recently moved to Albuquerque and was working with the New Mexico chapter of the Sierra Club. According to the Summit County Sheriff�s Office, officers were called at about 3:20 Sunday afternoon after wiper was hit by lightning while hiking. Bystanders had unsuccessfully attempted cardiopulmonary resuscitation on her when paramedics arrived. Paramedics were also unable to revive her. The incident happened in an area known as Little French Gulch, approximately seven miles from downtown Breckenridge. Wiper was hiking with a group of approximately five other people when the strike occurred. She was hit directly and several other members of the group were knocked down by the bolt.

Scottsdale, Ariz., -based Taser International and retailer The Sharper Image are negotiating to make the store the only national retailer to carry Tasers.   The store would sell a variation of the Taser used by 5,400 law enforcement agencies nationwide. The consumer version is designed for personal security, and the cycle of electricity from the gun lasts up to 30 seconds.   'It's nonlethal, yet it's extremely effective,' said Steve Tuttle, a spokesman for Taser International. 'People can feel confident that they can knock down the most difficult of targets.'   Although Tasers have been publicly available through phone sales and the company Web site for more than eight years, some police officers worry that wider availability might open the door to criminal use.'                       urlLink Yahoo! News - Putting the Bite on Mailman-Shaped Dog Treats    Fri Jul 23, 9:05 AM    TORONTO (Reuters) - Dogs chomping on mail carrier-shaped treats is no laughing matter for Canada Post.    The unamused Canadian postal service -- whose carriers endure more than their share of real dog bites -- convinced Pet Valu Inc. stores to stop carrying Bark Bars, dog biscuits that come shaped like cats and letter carriers.  'This is not in any way, shape, or form funny for us, and to make light of that ... I don't see that as funny at all, not even in the least,' said John Caines, Canada Post's national media relations manager.  The pet store chain, which has 292 outlets in Canada, agreed to withdraw the treats after it received a letter from Canada Post saying that employees were concerned about the risks mail carriers face from dogs and unhappy with having dog biscuits shaped in their likeness.  Earlier this summer, a letter carrier from Chatham in southwestern Ontario broke both her wrists and had part of her ear ripped off when she was attacked by two pitbull-like dogs.  Caines said that in the first six months of 2004 there were 160 dog attacks on mail carriers across Canada.

An agent confiscated the items Tuesday and gave Black Hole Store and Museum owner Ed Grothus an itemized receipt listing the things taken, Grothus said.      Grothus said Friday the items have been a big joke in his store for years.      'I had for years been jesting' that they were missing tapes from the federal nuclear weapons lab, and said he added the printed tape labels reading 'secret.'      The store's assistant manager, Frank Holmquist, said a man first came into the store to say he wanted to buy the props marked 'secret' displayed on the front counter.      Grothus, who worked at the lab as a machinist for 20 years before retiring in 1969, said he refused to sell them because they're conversation pieces for tourists.

Tom and Becky Furlong of Letts, which is in Muscatine County, hosted a John Kerry picnic on their farm last summer. Kerry invited the couple to sit with his family last night in the convention hall. Furlong, like Kerry, is a Vietnam veteran, and endorsed Kerry early in the campaign. Furlong says he was impressed with Kerry becuase he's 'a serious person of substance.' Furlong was on stage, briefly, too, part of a group of farmers who stood as another farmer from Kentucky gave a testimonial on Kerry. Furlong was elected an alternate delegate to the convention, and was sitting in the balcony earlier this week, and didn�t find out �til yesterday that he�d be on stage. He says the seat upgrade was �thrilling' especially since he wasn't sure his wife would even be able to be in the hall for last night's speech.'                      And that is one heck of a compliment. Hehe...    urlLink The Onion Movie Praised For Not Being As Bad As It Could Have Been    'BURBANK, CA�Moviegoers coast to coast hailed Catwoman, the new action film starring Halle Berry, as not as much of an unforgivably awful piece of formulaic commercial pabulum as it could have been.   'You know, I have to hand it to Warner Bros.,' Miami resident Tom Peebles said Monday.   'Catwoman was terrible, but it actually had one or two decent parts. I really have to say: It could have been a lot worse!'   Catwoman, loosely based on the DC Comics character, has similarly shattered other viewers' bottom-of-the-barrel expectations, offering a small number of redeeming features instead of the expected none. 'That one part where the woman pushes Catwoman off a balcony to demonstrate that she can land on her feet was sort of cool, I guess,' said Bangor, ME's Sally Burrows. 'And it was kind of funny when she ate, like, 10 cans of tuna in a row. Oh, and when she drank that glass of cream at the bar�that was, though not exactly funny, at least funny-ish. My kids seemed to like it. Well, Mindy, at least.' 'Mindy just turned 7,' Burrows added.                        The Democratic Presidential nominee is making history! Not since 1972 has the Democratic Party and nominee experienced a post-convention bounce like Kerry experienced coming out of Boston.      urlLink ABCNEWS.com : Kerry Foresees No More U.S. Troops for Iraq   ...Kerry made the rounds of the Sunday talk shows with his running mate, Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina, while on a two-week, 3,500-mile trip through battleground states.              He was seeking to capitalize on momentum generated by last week's Democratic convention as a new CNN-USA Today Gallup poll showed he had gained only 1 percentage point over Bush.              The poll of registered voters showed Kerry leading 50 percent to 47 percent for Bush, compared to a larger lead last month, 49 percent to 45 percent. A Newsweek poll on Saturday gave Kerry a four-point jump, or 'bounce,' from the convention among registered voters.      The Bush campaign pounced on the Gallup poll to point out that Kerry was the first nominee of either party to receive no bounce from his convention since Democrat George McGovern in 1972.     A senior Kerry adviser dismissed the survey as an aberration.
