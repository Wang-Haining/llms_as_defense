Drank beer at a local bar with some of my cronies, shared some laughs...I'm sure something got broken along the way...lost a cell phone...got followed home by a car full of hoodlums who wanted to kick our ass...a typical Friday night.  Let me start of by saying, driving around at 2:30 in the morning on a Friday or Saturday night is an adventure unto itself...whether you're drunk or sober. But, if you're the fightin' type, try changing lanes on westbound 6th street at 2:30 in the morning on a Friday night. Yes folk, this apparently will bring a fight right to your doorstep! And look, all you had to do was drive...isn't that neat?  It was actually kinda fun. I wasn't the driver, but my friend who was driving wisely choose to go to the Quix rather than back to her apartment. I went into the store to get some smokes, only to come back out and find this chick from the other car trying to start a fight with my scrappy yet drunk ex-girlfriend and my other pacifist never-had-an-argument in her life friend.  This girl from the other car was certainly in a fightin' mood. But, it just wasn't working. She even made some pointy nose comment to my ex while grabbing her nose in that 'Got your nose!' kind of way. That didn't work either...the fighting girl had to fend off a hug attempt. My pacifist friend, on the other hand, was trying to work things out. She explained herself and her driving techniques while basically inviting these people out for tea and cookies.  I was a mere observer...along with the other two cars full of people who were hanging out until the shit went down. Thanks guys! Glad to know you've got our back...I think.  You gotta love Austin. In any other city I might have feared that we'd be knifed with our happy-go-lucky attitude towards her fightin' words. But eventually she gave up. I think we confused her. We should be a superfriend team. I'll have to think of a name for this team. And then...watch out! We'll be out in full force...doing nothing to villains across the land.           \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
