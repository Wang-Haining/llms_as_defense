Each person, expressing so many interesting viewpoints from diverse contexts, contributed to a look at the fascinating paradoxes in education.  Can we connect some of the themes?  Go to the  urlLink  on-line textbook   to view the first link called “Context.”  You can surf the four topics,   gender, age, multicultural, language,   to uncover what language theorists are saying about literacy.     Here is what I wonder.  If spoken word is such a vital part of our linguistic heritage and given that we are such social beings (Vygotsky), why does our teaching in the 21st Century continue to be so didactic – so 19th Century?   According to statistics, the ratio between teacher and pupil talk shows that teachers are relentless in doing most of the talking!  That does not sound very sociable (would we expect a party host to do   all   the talking?) neither does it seem opportune since communication appears to be unidirectional! How droll is that?     A few of the following themes that arose from our introductions may lead us to unraveling the paradoxes:  (1) cultural attitudes and values (including parental, teen, administrative, teacher, government), (2) the teacher identity and sense of belonging crisis that ensues from questions like, “Why am I not taken seriously or valued?” – “What am I/they doing here?” – “What am I doing this for?” – “Do I make any difference?” – “Why is the system so slow to change?” – 'What is the meaning of life?'     Okay…so that last question is a bit too unwieldy. Still it holds a peculiar significance in the world of literacy insofar as what we value and the language we use are inexorably linked.  You most likely empathized, as I did, with a number of concerns that were voiced – and found some to be even more personally relevant than others.  Yet, despite the numerous subject areas, patterns were evident.  And there was an interesting undercurrent – a “ground” as it were – that may recede from our immediate view but that somehow connects all of these issues (i.e., “figures”). What are your thoughts?                          Gail Said:   Ok…Just like last time, I can't post the message. It keeps telling me either I'm not a member or my password isn't valid, and it won't let me go to the page where I can retrieve my password. Clearly, I am technologically challenged.    Anyway, I'm enclosing my comments.    The Power of Your Words  What power do words possess? Do they aggrandize or suppress? I considered this recently after reading Lewis Jacobs (1970)‚ chapter, 'The Raw Material,' about motion pictures as a form of creative expression. A filmmaker is a kind of artist, he asserts, like the painter, the composer, and the artist himself. He seeks to control and utilize his medium by harnessing the particular raw material of his medium in order to express his world. Regardless of the music, painting, artistic, or filmmaking medium, a man undertakes such creative endeavours in order to reveal 'man’s concern with being alive.' For what indeed is a man if he cannot examine his life and consider his worth and use his creative genius to express his deliberations. His deliberations and expressions are believed to be common, and the rest of us therefore can relate to him.   As a creative person who writes considerably, I could indeed connect with the concept of the vision behind expression. I have often recognized my own ability to write with a 'camera’s eye.' But in reading Jacobs, I also recognized that I did not see myself represented in his words. When he speaks of the artist, the painter, and the composer, the picture that comes to mind is that of Rembrandt, Leonardo, or Beethoven. When he speaks of the visionary filmmaker, I see Coppola, Hitchcock, or Spielberg, one of whom is in fact a dead white guy. I could, of course, alter the image to ... well, some woman, Penny Marshall perhaps or Barbara Streisand, because I will assume that they, that we, are in fact included in 'man.'   Yet, why do I consciously need to alter the image that comes to mind when these words are read? Why must I make the effort? There were and are women artists, painters, and composers. Do I know of any? I cannot say that I do. Do I know of any women directors? I’ve named but two. No more. But I purposefully bring them to mind now because I could not see myself in the language that he uses. Where was I?   Descartes asserted, 'I think therefore I am.' But we cannot form a thought without language; George Orwell showed us that. If language represents but only half the population, do I think therefore I am not?  Jacobs, L. (1970).   The Movies as Medium.  Toronto: Double Day, Ltd.                          'I guess I still haven’t been able to shake off the anesthetic of suburbia.  And real life.  Because the anesthetic of suburbia also involves having three parents—a mother, a father and a TV set.  Two of them are equilibriums, but one of them is more powerful because it’s always new and fresh and entertaining.  It doesn’t reach out and tell you what to do' (Steven Spielberg in Rolling Stone Magazine, July 1982).    Some of you may know the story of Steven Spielberg’s start in the film industry before  Jaws  made him a name.  At the age of 17, on a tour of Universal Studios, sneaking away to a sound stage, he eventually talked his way into obtaining a visitor’s pass that turned into a summer of “squatting” in an abandoned office and hobnobbing with producers and writers. His small filmmaking trials (with 8mm film)  and his abundant knowledge of the medium propelled his imagination and audacity.  In the end, that “chutzpah” led to his eventual success.  Here then is a “self-taught” filmmaker – yet to what degree was he taught through the medium itself?  Through a watchful eye and an amateur lens, he gained knowledge as he journeyed with media “mentors” (both machine and human). Quentin Tarantino, as the story goes, never learned the language of film production, and continues to invent words on a regular basis.  His film crews have learned to figure out his intent whenever he defies the use of conventional terms.  His accomplishments (like him or not) display another “self-taught” filmmaker.  Like Spielberg, his media literacy began while watching TV and countless movies (from martial arts to Westerns).    Over the past two days, we watched the opening of  Altered States  and  2001: A Space Odyssey   as well as a 30 second short with sci-fi overtones made by a third grader.  Perhaps science fictions may begin scientific discourse or perhaps they are merely precursors to movie making.  Either way, one cannot help to notice the inevitable debate that ensues from such starting points – from medium (Is the book/text or the movie/visuals/sound better?) to message (What does it mean? Is it truth or fiction?).     More questions…  Can we deepen discourse in science, social studies, math, art…etc…through stories found in movies, music, poetry, art   and   books? Do movies or TV have a place in our classrooms? Should we teach the skills of the medium by  analyzing  films or   making   films or both?  Did your iMovie experience demystify the medium of movies?  What of Shaun’s powerful thought under “New Economy” post?  Does any of this matter?                       Brilliant! I love the comments that are beginning to surface...if you haven't read everything on the blog yet, go ahead and surf...be sure to read the comments under each post...  I just had an 'aha' moment! Deductive logic (“It’s elementary my dear Watson”) brings fruitful ends! Science as a “way of knowing and doing” is a powerful method for discovery.  Whenever one is puzzled by a phenomenon, careful observation will often reveal a pattern, which then leads one to further investigate.  The result may yield uncompromising truths!  There is a reason for the 'time delay' between the second you hit 'publish post' and the time it is published!     It turns out that Blogger offers a special feature for the administrator.  Comments that are published are first sent to me to review via email.  Once I have downloaded your comment from the server, which I may want to delete if it is “inappropriate,” Blogger then publishes the posting.  That feature is an excellent one for teachers using Blogs with their class, as they may wish to censor or delete comments before they are published.      I recommend saving your comments in a word document in the event your posting is inadvertently erased.                       There is an ancient maxim that states, “Teach them correct principles and they will govern themselves.”  While this adage is devoted primarily to moral and ethical principles, it may be applied beyond.  Another similar axiom states, “Feed a man a fish, and he will eat for a day, teach him to fish and he will feed for a lifetime.”  Both adages are rooted in the notion of the existence of “universal” truths that intersect all knowledge (e.g., the scientific process as means to solve problems). Individuals who acquire skills and knowledge (i.e., become literate) begin to “see the whole schema” and “know how to navigate its system.” In the end, those individuals are “set free” or rather released from “external governance” exercising “free will” within the confines of culture and society. Anyone who labors to instruct seeks to help individuals locate the “inner locus of control,” i.e., the will to learn.  Thus, teaching is as much a matter of tapping into the interest and  natural  ability of a learner and deepening their knowledge as a means to engage their  will  to learn as it is a matter of broadening their horizons.    According to  urlLink  John Taylor Gatto (go to article),  schooling merely “dumbs down” human potential by keeping individuals from “growing up.”  Hmmm…Critics of education find it easier to disparage schooling practices than to find solutions…    First, though, we must wake up to what our schools really are: laboratories of experimentation on young minds, drill centers for the habits and attitudes that corporate society demands. Mandatory education serves children only incidentally; its real purpose is to turn them into servants. Don't let your own have their childhoods extended, not even for a day. If David Farragut could take command of a captured British warship as a pre-teen, if Thomas Edison could publish a broadsheet at the age of twelve, if Ben Franklin could apprentice himself to a printer at the same age (then put himself through a course of study that would choke a Yale senior today), there's no telling what your own kids could do. After a long life, and thirty years in the public school trenches, I've concluded that genius is as common as dirt. We suppress our genius only because we haven't yet figured out how to manage a population of educated men and women.  The solution, I think, is simple and glorious. Let them manage themselves.
