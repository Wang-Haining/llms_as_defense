  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic:\n\n             Spent a lot of time today at Shoprite sans iPod. In that time period, I read:    US Weekly (cover to cover)  People Magazine (cover to cover)  Marie Claire (cover stories)  Cosmopolitan (half)  TV Guide (the color pages)   I've learned all about Lindsay Lohan and Wilmer Valderrama's romance (and how they were previously 'friends with benefits'... TMI), Britney's smoking and tons of PDA with her fiance at the hotel in Marina del Rey (ugh), the Prada party and Mischa Barton wearing a $4000 dress to Taco Bell and having a fight with her rich boyfriend, Orlando and Kate (so cute! and so's the dog), Keira and her model guy, Paris Hilton's skirt blowing up in the wind, SATC fights, Angie Harmon's daughter, Sarah Jessica Parker's pretty dress, the Coach charity party... I have celebrity gossip coming out of my ears. I also read 3 issues of old People Magazines in the past 2 days, combined with the People crosswords and two New York magazine crosswords. Lots and lots of heavy reading - don't you agree? :)                            I didn't recap my thoughts on the first 3 episodes, but I figure the St. Petersburg leg is as good a time as any to start. :) I just watched the encore presentation of the episode tonight and it was quite fun. (I LOVE THIS SHOW! :) ) Since I've got to sleep soon, here's just some quick thoughts and how I feel about each of the teams at the end of episode 4:   Thoughts :   A lot of teams seem to have learned more Spanish words while at the pit stop in Bariloche. Could they not do this in Uruguay?  I would go berserk on a 20 hour bus ride to Buenos Aires. And those long flights from Buenos Aires to St. Petersburg.  Russia looks freezing. I hope no one forgot winter coats.  I want to take one of those vodka shots! They looked like so much fun.  Having to eat 2 lbs of caviar is frightening. I would never have been able to do the Roadblock and we would have lost.  The palace in Pushkin is pretty. :)    Teams :   Chip/Kim: + (I didn't like them in the cab 'fiasco' but I do now.)  Colin/Christie: + (I don't like it when he yells at her, but I generally like them.)  Brandon/Nicole: + (He was really sweet to her when she looked like she would pass out.)  Marshall/Lance: ~ (That's the symbol for neutral... They can be obnoxious sometimes, but I don't hate them as much as some other people seem to.)  Kami/Karli: + (I actually like them, unlike a lot of others it seems. They are very competitive and intense, but I don't see how that can be terrible in a race..)  Linda/Karen: + (They seem like so much fun.)  Charla/Mirna: - - - - - - (I saved the worst for last. My goodness, I can't stand listening to her whine.. and the editors are doing a great job of showing how she glares at other people and is generally obnoxious. That article saying people don't like Mirna because she's a strong woman? [Oh no, this sounds like Omarosa again..] Puh-leeze... people don't like her because they wouldn't want to be cooped up in a room with her!)   Poor Bob and Joyce... They, along with Brandon and Nicole, were probably my favorites going into this episode and they got eliminated. (And stupid CBS ruined the ending because it could have been a non-elimination leg and I wouldn't have known otherwise had they not said they would talk to the losers on the Early Show!) Last week, Jim and Marsha were my favorites and they got eliminated. (Having nice teams getting eliminated with really sweet last lines makes me cry every week.) Maybe I should stop having favorites. I think right now I just have a strong NON-favorite. They annoy me so much. But don't let this ringing endorsement of that one team keep you from watching the best show on television this summer. :) It really is fantastic and it deserves the Reality Show Emmy - you should be watching! :)                         I learned the phrase 'blackberry winter' last night from my AWADmail email, and I think it's really pretty. (Supposedly, it means a time during spring where it gets as cold as winter again.)  I don't want to write my IP paper. I don't even have a topic yet. But I am back to work at my Continental letter. Whee. I took yesterday off, and instead went through lots of files, threw out lots of paper (such a cleansing feeling!), and watched the Olympics. Poor Chinese man who messed up on the horse - I felt so bad for him. Didn't do much else yesterday besides drown my sorrows by shopping at Filene's Basement and dining on enchiladas. (I've agonized over this sentence: can someone grammar check it for me? And not using Word...)  Back to the letter... you can tell I wanted to post even though I had nothing to say, and my entire crafting ability is going toward the letter (so this doesn't sound like such a well-written post... not that the rest were either, but ... you know what I mean).  urlLink Best Buy  has a  hot  2 for $15 sale - I'm excited. It was 3 for $20 last week, but these movies are better choices. Yay! I am  such  a DVD addict. :)                        I used to check out the  urlLink Apple Trailers site  on a regular basis during the school year, maybe even every week. But I've spent so little time on my home computer over the summer that I'm so behind! I was at the movies today and watching trailers, and with the exception of  Sky Captain , I didn't have a clue what the trailers were when they first started out! (Compare that with when I went to see LOTR or Harry Potter, and was trying to name off the trailers within the first few seconds after the studio logos.) I used to be so up-to-date with the trailers. Now I'm catching up for lost time.  Here are my first impressions on some movies based on the trailers I saw today (I'm including the trailers I saw in the theater)... I've starred the ones I want to see (** for really want to see, * for would be interested in seeing - not sure if in theaters or on DVD) ... it seems like a shorter list than the 'want to see' list I had before the spring and summer movie seasons:     * Team America: World Police : Comes out in October, from the South Park guys. It looks interesting.. I'd be curious to see later trailers of it before deciding whether I would pay to see this in the theaters. It looks different though which can be refreshing. And if it's from the South Park guys... maybe it'll be good. :)   Superbabies Baby Genuises 2 : Was there a 1 of this movie? I don't remember it. Anyway, it looks like it would be really entertaining and fun, and I would enjoy it, but I'm not sure I'd pay to go see it. (Maybe rent it?)   Wicker Park : With Josh Hartnett, I think I'd be too scared to see this one.   ** First Daughter : Comes out in September, with Katie Holmes. SO CUTE. It looks like a chick flick, and I love Katie Holmes, and the movie looks so incredibly sweet.   Suspect Zero : Looks frighteningly suspenseful, not sure I would see it.   Paparazzi : Chilling in a different way, a little too Princess Diana-ish, and cuts a little too close to reality with the fact that the paparazzi really IS like that and it's scary.   Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow : Saw an earlier trailer for it, but I don't get it now. I thought it was going to be like Superman, but it doesn't look quite like that anymore.   * Collateral : I might be interested in seeing this one - even though it's suspenseful, it's a different kind of suspense than the other ones I'm too scared to see.   Kinsey : Want to see more trailers... looks interesting.   * Meet the Fockers : Watched the trailer for the title, realized it was a follow-up on  Meet the Parents , it looks amusing.   A Dirty Shame : Looks interesting, still need to learn more about it to figure out whether I want to see this NC-17 (!) rated movie.   * Christmas with the Kranks : This looks really amusing, and I love Christmas-themed comedies for whatever reason. How many times have I seen  Santa Clause ?   ** Shark Tale : DreamWorks animated movie, there's been lots of trailers and publicity for it, definitely want to see this -  Finding Nemo  but not.   Little Black Book : I'm up for most romantic comedies. :)   * Friday Night Lights : Also a sucker for sports movies.   * Wimbledon : Could be cute.
