Which probably means that no one reads it...thats sad. Oh well..I guess Im not interesting enough. There are things I need to do but I just can't seem to get the energy to do them.      &nbsp;      &nbsp;&nbsp;List of Things to Do:      &nbsp; 1. Paint nails Black      &nbsp;&nbsp;2. Take a shower      &nbsp; 3. Fill out my job apps and turn them in.      &nbsp; 4. Get haircut      &nbsp; 5. Get eyebrows waxed      &nbsp; 6. Charge cell phone      &nbsp; 7. Diet      &nbsp; 8. Confront this person who is driving me nuts      &nbsp; 9. Take pictures of Brian and I      &nbsp;10. Work on my scrapbook      &nbsp;11. Paint my Room      &nbsp;12. Get my bed from Grandys      &nbsp;13. Get new sheets and pillows      &nbsp;14. Return movie      &nbsp;15. Go on a picnic with Brian      &nbsp;16. Buy some neccessites      &nbsp;17. Go to Woodlands mall today        &nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Im sure there is more things, but for now thats all I can handle, and I know half of those things won't get done before school. Im sure that numbers:4, 7, 9,&nbsp;10, 11, 12, 13, and 15 won't get done anytime soon. *sigh* Need energy booster. Maybe go to Starbucks today? Coffee helps. Wow. The total boredom I have, yet I have so many things I need to do. Thats pretty bad. I can get number: 1 crossed off the list if Im just sitting here. Although I hate waiting for them to dry. Then that prolongs me taking a shower, which then means longer until I see Brian, which means even longer until we go to the mall, which closes at 6 and is 30 minutes away and that gives us very little time and Aghhh. To much to do so little time. I would say go to the mall tomorrow, but I am sure that Brian won't be happy about it since I put it off yesterday. I wish it was Saturday that way the mall would be open until 9pm. You know its rather stupid that the mall doesn't stay open until midnight. What bullshit. But what can you do? I know itd make my life so much easier. Especially today.                                         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Yawn* I am rather bored right now. Tonight was okay. Brian and I didn't do much, but towards the end of the evening it was good, but then a little later I got depressed and started crying. I felt like Brian was getting sick of me and didn't want to be with me anymore. I've just been under a lot of stress and then the pressure of Brian and my doubting his love for me...I just kind of let loose. I feel horrible, lately I've been really bitchey and taking it out on Brian and Im just so sorry for it and I wish that I hadn't been. He doesn't deserve that. Not one bit, he's too good to me. Agh, I better stop talking about this or Im going to get depressed again. Anyways, Brian and I found a good pizza place, Jackpot Pizza. It sounds gay, but its really good. Although we only got one piece of it today because his siser and her 2 friends ate it all. His sister I know didn't eat much, but the other 2...man they woolfed that down, 2 Medium pizzas and we only got one piece. What shit. And we got no soda either, they drank the whole 2 lieter of Mr. Pibb. Which again wasn't Amy's fault. Pizza just isn't good without soda. Oh well.                                       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing really exciting to talk about, however I felt like writing. My dog is burying herself in my blanket...she's a very weird little fat dog, but cute! So, my dad isn't going to my grandma's for a week, which I was looking forward to. I don't mean that in a mean way...it's just whenever both are your parents are home all the time you really wish that you could get a break. See, my dad got hurt on the job and has A lot of physical problems and is unable to work anymore and is on social security. My mom was okay, but then one day she slipped and now she has a bulging disk in her back which causes her a lot of pain. She works for H.P. and now works from home, so both of them are home 24/7 and it drives me Crazy! I love my parents, but I wish that they would just like leave every now in then. I can't even remember the last time I was home alone. That really starts a lot of fights because we are always around each other, especially since it's summer.*sigh* I love going to my aunts in the Summer because shes so cool and Stef and I can do practically anything. We can sneak out at night, stay up late, and sleep in all day if we want, and just do whatever we feel like. Its so fun, but now that I have Brian I don't want to leave him. I was so miserable in Colorado without him, I know that I'd be just as miserable in Clearlake without him. Sometimes I just am overwhelmed, I cant seem to make everyone happy at anytime. Things just become rather stressful. Anyways! Brian and I were talking and the next time we make psghetti (speghetti) we are going to make our own special sauce! I really cant wait! It sounds so good. Ive never had&nbsp;a homemade sauce&nbsp;before. It would give us a chance to cook together! How cute is that! I wonder what we will do tomorrow! hmm.                    \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
