(5 minutes later) &nbsp;mary t, wake up.&nbsp; (10 minutes later)  mary,&nbsp;get up.  (15 minutes later, as the covers are ripped off)  right now, mary theresa.   that last one seems especially pertinent, considering&nbsp;its 6 am. oh yeah, and i havent slept yet.                   so its 2am and im sitting here thinking about my job. well, technically speaking, my ex-job...probably the shortest employment of my life. im not gonna lie, i rather enjoyed it. what other job lets you pretend youre hangin out at a club with your best friend and other high school acquaintances? i now find myself listening to the radio and stopping on songs i would normally have avoided, simply because i want to jump out of my car and dance. i think thats a good thing...except that my outlet for dancing is nonexistent. for the record (jim), i did not work as an 'entertainer', but rather as a waitress. that notwithstanding, it did afford me the opportunity to stand around and dance  with myself  on any given night. i think it did a lot to lighten my mood. i dont know that  all  of those around me lately would agree, but whatever. i notice it, even in its smallest measurement.  and from that high, i come crashing down: just checked ventre's countdown...realizing how close i am to departure. wondering if anyone will come to say goodbye. i hope so.  14 days. still no place to live.  im pretty sure ive cried every day since my mum came home. and not likely to stop from here to the 22nd. shit. i hate second guessing. i can do this. i swear to god, i know i can do this. and i know i want to. its so damn exciting and scary all in the same breath. BREATH, mary. sometimes i forget how...just keep reminding me, please...          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
