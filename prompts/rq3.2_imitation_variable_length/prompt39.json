I hated being a child when my mom would complain about not having enough things of luxury like a bigger house, nice new cars, clothing that is ridiculously expensive, and a bunch of oversized flatscreen TV's. I don't understand the human tendencies to spend money on things they don't need and really cant afford and just dig a big hole for themselves in the long run. I know this from experience after watching my parents complain about money troubles all the times yet they were still making impulse buys even tho they were thousands of dollars in debt and had some serious problems which needed to be dealt with first.     When my family was considered middle class or rich we kept on running up bills for things we could not afford, I was really not a very happy child because we were constantly moving into 'nicer houses' which made it hard for me to make friends and my parents were always working to make more and more money which made for a very unhappy child since I was always neglected and a loner (thank god for my computer) and unhappy parents since their lives revolved around work and the only happiness they found was through alcohol (at least for my father).     I just think that too many people try too hard to be someone that their not and really try their best to impress others while never taking the time to make sure they are feeling good about themselves.      One thing that I learn time and time again in my life is everything has got to be balanced or your going to tip over. People need to learn how to balance relationships, finances, fitness, nutrition, work, education, fun, and all those other things that are essential to a persons life.  Anyways I got some things to do (play starcraft and review for finals) so I'm going to get to it. LAAAATE!                       Just great! Its exam time, for students that tend to leave everything on the backburner like me are now making sure we know our stuff and handing in all our missing assignments in the last two weeks of school. This is the most stressful time of the school year where you miss a lot of sleep and study all night and wake up really early just to refresh your memory because these exams pretty much make you or break you in your future education and career.     I myself have to do quite well in my final exams because I consider myself a average student in everything except technology sciences such as computer science so I have to do well on my other finals or else I may be lying at a 'c-' or possibly even a 'I'(fail) if I do really bad on either my math or socials exam. Ontop of my final exams I also have my provincial exams which are completely new to me but I know they are used to compare schools all across British Columbia which will most likely be quite hard.      Last but not least I also have to take a extra class during the summer to graduate on time such as physics(cause I plan to get my electricians ticket) or math since I was taking a easier version of math when I was younger since I was so lazy.  ****Anyways this whole week is going to be extremely busy for me because I have to make flyers for a new store in surrey, Help a friend put up a neon sign at the mall, work out, do door to door sales, and study and do homework like crazy. So as you can see this week is going to be pretty insane with expectations coming from all over the place.**                          Dreams are a weird thing, some nights I wont have any or remember any dreams at all but others I will have a series and they are sometimes so dramatic and get my heart pumping so fast that I even wake up in a night sweat. One example is of last nite I had dreamt what it would be like to have not had my parents around, another dream I had was of my mother checking my wallet to see if there was any money inside there and my last dream was that I had to pay a scary visit to the dentist. All these dreams I found very peculiar since my parents have been getting themselves into a lot of trouble lately, my mother constantly checks my wallet and my room to find any money or anything incriminating, and that same night I fell asleep forgetting to brush my teeth.     They say our dreams have a superior intelligence in them: a wisdom and cleverness that guides us. They convey to us illuminating insights. They warn us about danger. They predict future events. They hint at the deeper meaning of life. Dreams steer us to an adapted, wise attitude toward life. I have had my fair share of interesting dreams but I cant wait until the ultimate deep sleep to find out what really happens when the brain is no longer spoon fed oxygen from the heart. Is there really a spiritual greater power who plotted us here on the earth? Or do we just stop thinking and are no longer active in the physical world? All these questions and more answered in the next episode of 'My Life'.     **Ok, well enough of that. I'm going to the gym and I'm going to go walk around Granville island now since I got my unlimited monthly skytrain pass on me. Bye, and sweet dreams!**                      Man, the last few months have been awesome because I used to always whine, grobble, and make excuses for why I was so short and skinny(because I was on the computer too much) but lately I have been noticing that I have been growing rapidly and I am finally able to gain weight(cause I been eating more protein/carbs and exercising). It is just such a relief to know that I did grow into a normal sized man which I believe is around 6 feet tall.The reason I was worried about not being a normal size because I noticed that all the other Asian men that I see in my community are quite a lot shorter than the European and black men in my area and especially since my father is 5'11' and my mom is 5'3', and I am half Asian and half Caucasian at 6'0'.      The best part about finally hitting my growth spurt is the reaction I get from old friends or even old school bullies who used to always pick on me because of my size and made me so size conscious and nervous since I'm bigger than a few of them now. But I don't think I've finished growing because my shoulders are still kind of narrow, and I am yet to have facial hair but everything is where it should be and appears to be operating healthy so I'm not too worried anymore, just glad to have it off my shoulders.  **even tho I'm getting bigger and really starting to feel like a man I'm still a computer geek/fanatic at heart and I'm sure always will be!**         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
