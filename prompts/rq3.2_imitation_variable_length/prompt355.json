Vodka    urlLink   ?? Which Alcoholic Drink Are You ??      by the way, i enjoyed michael moore's new documentary on the bush administration, i definitely would watch again. i am suprisingly not as apathetic to political issues as i have been in the past, i have been following this election year.   another argh! VARSITY so annoys me. STOP IT!                  another one of those damned online test has cast me to hell. i love dante's inferno and always thought what level i would end up in when i finally die. i guess its LEVEL SEVEN.

Posted by  urlLink Hello                    today's personal fact: i love to eat avacados.  two of my friends have made their own blogs now. vent ladies vent!  i woke up at 5 am today and couldn't go back to sleep so i went to the gym. i tried to do my ab workout after my cardio and it didn't work, i still need some time to heal.   i would also like to annouce that i think i am officially one of the last people to watch Shrek 2 today. it was cute. i love the kitty.  i want a kitty. i actually want lots of kitties so i can roll around in kitties. i will be cat lady one day. i can dream since i have pretty much lost most hope on everything else i ever wanted.  i also trapped myself in Target for a while, i couldn't decide if whether i wanted to start collecting Sex in the City or Curb Your Enthusiasm, they also released the first season of Kids in the Hall and Reno911. so many more dvd's to buy, not open, and never watch.  i am still working on my x-files marathon, i am on season 5 now, only a couple more to go.    just had my dinner, an endless bowl of salad and steamed broccoli. i want to go to the gym later tonight but not sure if i should. i need to call someone now before i forget, still not quite used to the eastern/pacific time difference, i usually forget until its too late.           \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
