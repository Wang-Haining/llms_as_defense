She's battleship grey and looking a bit down on her luck.  What to do with it?  A brief history: Originally a steam yacht owned by the Guinness family (no, really) she was used during the war (second, I think) as a minesweeper round the coast of Blighty. Then she was laid up on the canal linking Loch Ness with the west coast for a long time before arriving in Sunny Leith  under her own power  in 1986. Since then a restaurant business has seen many incarnations, some good, some awful. Laterally, under the guidance of the Fat Controller, there was some considerable success as a party venue, as there is a lot of space inside. During the Tall Ships visit, two youthful pissheads jumped off the Boat to cool off - or somesuch - and of course all on board (and there were several hundred) rushed to the rail to enjoy the spectacle, throw beercans and stuff. This caused the Boat to shift on it's bed of Vauxhall Vivas, shopping trolleys and empties to the point that water arrived through the open porthole (OK, broken porthole) in the Gents, no doubt spoiling one of those perfect moments one has in the Gents for anybody there at the time. A shout from deck - 'God Save The Queens!' Not sure who that refered to.  So, the Boat is indeed afloat, if only just. However, large pumps are constantly pumping the Water of Leith back into itself.  From a quite pleasing black hull, white superstructure, a repaint gave us violent canary yellow. This displeased the local residents, some of whom were on tranquillisers after looking out the window each morning. The fat Controller, possessed of a wry sense of humour, painted it again - battleship grey. (Â£1.89 a tiny tin from good model shops)  Closed for a few years now, something must be done. Problem: The hull is in very poor condition. Solutions: Fill it with concrete, or repair the hull. Aggro: Repairing the hull requires drydock - not possible (bridge in the way) - or lift the Boat out of the water - not possible as it weighs 400 tons. Aggro 2: Filling it with concrete would require setting the boat on the bottom permanently. This would then attract the council, looking for rates. Yes, at the moment the Boat does not pay rates or harbour dues (the bridge again, which was constructed after the Boat arrived - very inconvenient.)  Little known fact: There is a perfect triple expansion steam engine, Scotch boiler and all the gubbins still installed below decks.  Any ideas?             As our Beloved Editor quite rightly states, Leith is beset with flying insects, which get right up yer nose. These little Bastards are actually Flying Ants, which congregate in Mid-Air Swarms, for the principal reason of Shagging, purely and simply because they can.  OK, they're a bloody pest when you're minding your own business and quietly getting on with eating a Pierinos Potato.But try to remember, these beasties only get one chance of a decent shag in their lives!   Not only that, the Males, once replete, merely fly off to oblivion and die quietly and happily, which pleases the Females enormously, as they get a year of peace to themselves, to have babies, sleep late and nae doot go to the bingo!   Next year, assuming the Sun is splittin' the trees, the bairns are kickin' their height, and one of them spot Peter havin' a scran, or sittin' outside the Malt and Hops, then the whole process begins all over again, thereby giving our much-loved Lord and Master something to write about in his Blog.  So there! Now ye know! Let them get on wi' it in peace!            'They're certainly ruining all of this,' my friend Stuart said yesterday. He's here on a short holiday from Auchtermuchtie. 'Soon ye'll no be able tae see Fife at all!'   We were sitting on the balcony of the Ocean Bar, looking out over the building site that has replaced what once was a lovely view of the river and the hills.   'That's nothing though, Stuart,' I said to him. 'You should see the monstrosity they've built outside Malmaison Hotel... totally blocks the sea view from the entire Shore area.'  We sipped our Guinnesses. 'And of course where now there's Rennie's Isle there once was a great view also,' he reminisced. 'And what the hell's that farce they've thrown up in Coburg Street?'  'You mean the white, blue and yellow abortion behind the church?' I asked. 'That's the one they're calling Benidorm already.'  And then our conversation moved on. But it's true. I blame Morrison Homes, Gregor Shore, Forth Ports Authority and Edinburgh City Council. They and others have  ruined  our town. And they're not finished yet. Oh no. Still lots of dosh in the puggies. Time for a few in-depth audits, if you ask me.
