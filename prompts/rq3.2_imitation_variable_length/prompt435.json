I went to go enjoy the non-airconditioned environment of our back deck just before my nightly date with Peter Jennings on ABC news, and before I knew it, I sat up dizzily, my contacts were dry and sticky, and my parents were snickering. I was really confused about why 'Entertainment Tonight' was on during the news hour, then I realized that I had completely slept through it (sniffle--Peter--sniffle). My sister knows how I feel about sleeping outside. It gives me the heebie-jeebies. Just ask any of my friends I've ever gone 'camping' with.  I'm not sure why I've been so wiped out. Perhaps its the extra load at work. I've been covering for the assistant to the President and CFO while she is out with pneumonia (yikes). Maybe its the new regiment of stomach medicine I am FINALLY taking, after years of John pleading with me. It could also be the lack of physical activity in my life right now. They say exercise give you more energy...I guess that only applies if you actually  use  the expensive gym membership you purchased. It could also be the late nights I've been pulling. I still find myself trying to deny my 8 to 5 lifestyle, and continue plodding along on college standard time (wake at 10:00, eat at 1:00, nap at 4:00, bed at 2:00am). I miss the good ole' days.  In any case, I'm sapped for energy this week. Maybe I just need another vacation?                        Ah, the Fourth of July. A time for gathering, grilling, and Whitney Houston's version of the Star-Spangled Banner.  What? You  mean your family doesn't solemnly listen to the first track on Whitney's patriotic CD, then hold hands in a circle, sing 'God Bless America,' and make each person talk about what being an American means to them? Well I guess your family's just weird then.  I'm really not kidding about any of this. It's really touching and sweet, if only slightly humiliating. My parents are so proud to be in this country and to have raised their kids here, and they certainly enjoy spreading this joy, especially my Dad (even though I find it a bit ironic that he's been here since 1967 but never gotten around to applying for citizenship). We ended the evening with a resounding, out-of-tune version of the Indian National Anthem, Jonna Ghonna Monna. It was oddly reminiscent of Thanksgiving, where we have a similar ritual, during which my sister unfailingly chokes up when its her turn to talk about what she's thankful for. She usually gets as far as 'I'm thankful for...for my family...sniffle...' She's adorable.   Afterwards, I headed out to Billy's for 80's night with my friend and former housemate Libby and crew (see picture above). It was fun. It was the first year I skipped fireworks for Duran, Duran.   This Fourth was also thought-provoking for me. My friend and supervisor at work is extremely socially-conscious, and very much an activist. She taught me about 'Juneteenth,' a celebration of African American freedom. In lieu of celebrating the traditional 4th-of-July festivities, she and her husband celebrate June 19th, the day of freedom from slavery for Black Americans in the south. It wasn't until well over 100 years after the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Learning about that was a really enlightening experience. Few of us ever stop to think who's independence we're celebrating as the fireworks burst in the sky, and the French's mustard is piped over plump and sweaty hotdogs. Maybe next year I'll be celebrating on 6/19/05 instead...                        present ankle color : blackish-bluish-green   present ankle girth : comparable to an average coffee mug   current temperature : 60 degrees Fahrenheit (I'm sorry did you say  August  or  October ?)   dinner tonight : tofu and napa cabbage stir fry with extra chili oil. burns all the way down.   best parental quote of the week : Mom scorning a truck driver that wouldn't let her over into the left lane-- 'That guy is a Republican!'   surprise of the week : phone call from mr. electric juice himself...the one and only EJ. nothing like 1-hour conversations with old friends. picked up again without missin' a beat. check out his thoughts on life in New Orleans at  urlLink www.hodesh.com  (click on the 'daily update' section).   non-vegan desserts since sunday : four Mrs. Field's cookies, two bags of Famous Amos cookies, one slice of marble choco-vanilla coffee cake. i am a miserable human being.   act of appreciation for nature this week : obliterating the hornet's nest above our doorway (the nest which, by the way, my Mom and Dad repeatedly referred to as a 'honeycomb,' even after i insisted that it was an insidious hornet fortress, not a cute buzzy-bee house).   plans for the evening:  two words--Carrie Bradshaw.  later haters.                         I've just returned from Washington D.C. after an invigorating week at the Fulbright Orientation for scholars traveling to North Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. It was truly awesome, and now I'm even more pumped for my trip to Bangladesh. I'll try not to yap about it too much, but a few thoughts on the program:  1. My 'cohort' is truly fantastico (if I do say so myself--wink wink). Among the group there were Rhodes scholars, Harvard grads, activists, world-travelers, and generally bright people. The best part was that every single person in that room had serious leadership qualities. It wasn't a roomful of nerdy geniuses who were work-horses but socially inept. Everyone there was the kind of person that would come up to you, introduce themselves, shake your hand, and ask about you, and maybe even crack a few jokes in Arabic. I felt honored to be among them (though I'm still convinced that I may have been selected due to some administrative error during the application process or something).  2. The orientation really stressed cultural exchange and mutual understanding more than the research. One program officer said that it wasn't as important to 'have perfect data' as it was to interact with people, volunteer, and generally be a personal diplomat. They explicitly told us that we were not to be mouthpieces for the U.S. government or its foreign policy (praise Allah), but rather human bridges between people here and people abroad. The most important part of our Fulbright experience, we were told, was when we returned home to educate Americans about other countries and cultures...especially crucial for the region of the world we're all going to. In the past, war has been the only way most Americans learn their world geography.  3. I met the two other students traveling to Bangladesh. Katie, who comes from a small town in Wisconsin and is married to a Bangladeshi man, is really cool. I got a chance to meet her Mom (hilarious) and sister as well. She has a really unique perspective on Bangladeshi culture through the eyes of an American Bangladeshi 'bo'(wife). She also has some mad Bengali language skills. Keisuke, a Cornell grad from L.A., is a true-go getter, but he knows how to have a good time. It was totally his idea to take a picture with the three of us in front of the NPR building in Washington, spelling out the letters N-P-R with our arms. I have a feeling we're going to have a lot of fun traveling the world all together.  4. I got to spend some time with friends from the past as well. I met up with Austin and Jillian two nights in a row, and as a surprise bonus, got to meet up with Freddy Blavin as well. It was a treat. Fredo, as usual, tried to bite my 'sausage fingers,' as I simulated dunking him into a large tub of BBQ sauce (I always joked that he resembled a chicken McNugget in high school).   Saturday night I got to hang out with Beth and her buddies from High School. They are so funny that my sides hurt today from laughing all night. They remind me of Christie, Peggy, Meghan and myself (tear). I love having friend clicks, I ain't gonna lie.  That's enough for now. Don't worry...plenty of gushing about my fellow Fulbrighters to come. Tah-tah.                       As my departure date (which I still haven't been able to solidify because my Fulbright documents  still  haven't arrived) draws nearer, I am getting more and more anxious about my trip. I've been following the stories about the devastating floods in Bangladesh and East India over the past few weeks. True, Bangladesh is essentially a giant river delta and it floods every year as the Himalayan snows melt into the country's 1000 rivers, but this flooding is the worst in recent history. Thankfully the water is beginning to recede, so the millions of people marooned and left homeless can begin their long trek home--that is,  if there is any 'home' to return to. The more impending fear now is of an epidemic of water-bourne illnesses, such as cholera and dysentery, not to mention the wave of malaria that is likely in the coming months. With uncontaminated food and water in short supply, you could imagine the humanitarian crisis that's on the horizon.  It's heart breaking because the people who suffer the most during these times are the poorest and most desparate. I remember driving through the countryside last year packed in a 'minibus' and seeing half-sawed off canoes dotting barren jute fields every twenty yards or so. I wondered what they were for a while, and then it occurred to me that these were people's homes. It pained me to think that in a few months, those lands would be completely submerged by water, and the families of 5 or 10 or 15 would have nowhere to go.  I'm glad there are so many organizations doing relief work, including BRAC. I hope I can be a part of the effort while I'm there.
