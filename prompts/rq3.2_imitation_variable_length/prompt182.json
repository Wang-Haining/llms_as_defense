Last year, the popcorn was the best part of most of my movie-going excursions.  This time, however, was different. We used up our first two tickets to see Troy. I have to say, if I had seen this movie before reading the Iliad in high school, I probably wouldn't have found it so hard to struggle through. I would have been too busy picturing Brad Pitt as Achilles (although I don't really remember Achilles having that big a role in Homer's version). The movie was too long and had too many battle scenes for my liking (I have a short attention span), but the battle scenes (and random almost nude scenes) were what Brad did best in this film... I found him unconvincing wherever dialog was involved.  Seeing as mostly only the biggest most mainstream of movies come to Taiwan, I don't feel my critiquing ability to be all that sharp... I will watch anything that's in English (or has English subtitles). However, I thought Troy was completely watchable. Orlando Bloom and Eric Bana  brought plenty of personality to their characters and if the kids in the row behind us hadn't gotten up ever 10 minutes to go to the bathroom, I might have cried when Hector (Bana), and later Priam (Peter O'Toole), died. Somehow, I wasn't quite as moved by Diane Kruger's performance... but WOW! What a wardrobe!  Wasn't Helen supposed to die too? High school was too long ago for me to remember. Anyway, what will really stick with me is the imagery... I guess is that this is what all that big budget was spent on; creating huge armies, ships, etc. etc. The Trojan Horse was more formidable and impressive than I could have imagined. I always pictured a friendlier horse as I thought it was given as a gift... Anyway, click on the pictures above/below (no permission to reproduce these here) for a better view... or rent it when it comes out on DVD. Our next Warner trip takes place tomorrow: Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.                                          Wednesday Nite, May 12 - Salsa Party at Patio -  9:00pm!    &nbsp;    A friend and I arranged to meet at  Patio   (in the Neo 19 building near  Warner  Village )&nbsp;at 8:00 for dinner followed by a night of dancing.&nbsp;Patio  is across&nbsp;the city from my office, so I&nbsp;left 30 minutes&nbsp;before  the meeting time...&nbsp;One&nbsp;taxi ride later, I&nbsp;arrived to&nbsp;find  out that I had caught my shirt on something and unravelled the bottom hem.  Having come straight from work, I was already looking considerably less than  salsa-sexy!&nbsp; I ran to the nearest shop ( Mango ) to find a quick replacement. As Taiwan  stocks only smaller sizes... and being as a few years in Taiwan (everything  tastes better with a little pork fat, you know?)&nbsp;has increased my dress  size, my options are limited.&nbsp;5 minutes later and with my wallet  considerably lighter, I run to Patio to see if G is there yet. She isn't. The  host leads me to my table. We descend into a sunken retro pit! She shows me to  my circular gray fuzzy chair with a view of the geometric white balastrades and  the light patterns being projected on the ceiling. She also informs me that the  live salsa band won't start until 10:00- an hour later than advertised! (On weeknights, every hour is precious)       &nbsp;    G arrives and we order. The food was only mediocre, the prices were what I have come to expect in Taipei, but the  service... Well I would really like to know what the service charge was for! Not  only did the waiter repeatedly give the wrong dish to the wrong person and  forget to bring us various necessary items, he dropped food in my friend's lap  when clearing the table. Hmmm...      &nbsp;    Anyway, 10:00 arrived (as did many of our 'salsa  friends') and we moved into the red lounge area to hear the 'live salsa band'.  Hmmm... (again). In the first set, the band did not play a single salsa song!  They started with&nbsp;a love balad, then&nbsp;a cumbia number, followed by cha  cha cha and a Ricky Martin cover! We were actually looking forward to the band  taking a break so we could have some salsa.... but it turns out the DJ didn't  have even 1 salsa CD! Salsa Party indeed! We moved the party to  Barrio   before the second set started! And for all you Barrio fans, Barrio has started  charging cover on Wednesday nights! ($300 NT)      &nbsp;    Next Wednesday, I think I'll stay home and dance in  front of the mirror to my iTunes collection.      &nbsp;     &nbsp;     &nbsp;                                      Always in search of new sites to get ideas for  work... I LOVE books, sites with quizzes. Ok... so I may use them for a boring  purpose... to make teaching materials, but some are fun in their own right. A  few years ago, I started using  E-mode &nbsp;to get ideas... I think everyone  REALLY needs to know which breed of dog they are (Can it really be possible that  I am a chihuahua?) And as for me, I am glad to know that if I were an umbrella  drink, I would be a daquairi! I also found out that I am right brained, my true  color is green (but the color of my aura is orange). My strongest Chakra is the  5th one (that&nbsp;governing truth and honesty).&nbsp;In my past life, I was a  dog named Scooter living in Iowa.My best quality is my independence...&nbsp;and  the INKBLOT test reveals my subconscious mind is driven by  curiosity.      &nbsp;    However, E-mode has CHANGED! This is very sad  because now it's focus appears not to be&nbsp;on providing quizzes for  the&nbsp;Egoist looking for ways to waste time, but&nbsp;on running an on-line  match-making service and on making money. A couple years ago, all these tests  were free... even the&nbsp;more rigorous ones (like the Briggs Myers inspired  ones etc). Now you only get the initial result free and have to pay for the  details... Paying for the results&nbsp;might seem to&nbsp;indicate that one  takes the results a little too seriously! So&nbsp; now I am on the lookout for  new quiz sites.       &nbsp;    Quizilla is the one I checked out today! I tried a  test to find out which movie I belong in... The surprise is that it is a movie I have  never even seen. But glad to know Jack's creative world fits my curiosity and imagination.       &nbsp;       Nightmare Before Christmas!    urlLink   What movie Do you Belong in?(many different outcomes!)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla   This site is okay, but I am going to keep looking  as I would like to find one that is a little slicker and has fewer typos. I  realize this&nbsp;reveals insidious things&nbsp;about my personality, but I  don't care. Anyway, if anyone can reccommend a god quiz site, please post a  comment. Thanks.            \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
