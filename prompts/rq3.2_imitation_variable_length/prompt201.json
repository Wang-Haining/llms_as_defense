I'll keep living life, and I'll be fine in the end. I always am. But it's another layer to break through later. Another piece of protection from getting hurt yet again sometime down the road. Thing is, it's my own fault. I let myself get into a situation that was risky. We're friends, and maybe one day we'll be good friends again. Only time will tell.  Select lyrics from 'Don't Stay' Linkin Park, Meteora  Sometimes I need to remember just to breathe Sometimes I need you to stay away from me Sometimes I’m in disbelief I didn’t know Somehow I need you to go  [Chorus:] Don’t stay Forget our memories Forget our possibilities What you were changing me into Just give me myself back and Don’t stay Forget our memories Forget our possibilities Take all your faithlessness with you Just give me myself back and Don’t stay  Sometimes I feel like I trusted you too well Sometimes I just feel like screaming at myself Sometimes I’m in disbelief I didn’t know Somehow I need to be alone                       And this time I think I might try to keep it that way for a bit...  It was actually a pretty tricky problem, due to the fact the IE has a terrible rendering engine. It just goes to show that Microsoft thinks it's too good to be standards compliant. As a matter of fact, you should try using a different browser. In my opinion,  urlLink Mozilla Firefox  is the best browser out there, and it is much more standards compliant than IE is. Not only that, but it has built-in popup blocking, tabbed browsing, and oh so much more. So get it. Now.  Enough of one rant, time for another. Thanks to our IT department here at Taylor, I had to reinstall everything (including windows) on my computer last night. They thought it would be good to do a forcible install of their corporate anti-virus software (Symantec) on all computers joined to the domain, over the network. Well, I was running Norton Anti-Virus at the time, and Symantec makes it clear on their website that the two products can have devastating results if run together. Such was the position IT put me in. I couldn't even boot Windows into Safe Mode because my computer was so screwed up. Well, now I've disabled all Administrative shares that they took advantage of to accomplish this, so I should be safe now.  Woohoo for IT doing stupid things.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
