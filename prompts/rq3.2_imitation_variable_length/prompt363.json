I’m actually kind of glad that I didn’t see it in the theater – it was very moving to see, but I think it would have been even more overwhelming if I had seen it ten feet high in the dark with no distractions.  I almost had the opportunity to see it when it came out – my dad picked me up one weekend when I came home from school in Milwaukee, and it was playing at a second run theater.  I was the only person in the family who would go see it with him, but when we got to theater, it had stopped showing, despite what the sign outside said.  So, six years later, I finally saw it.  I had heard about the first twenty minutes and the graphic carnage it showed of the D-Day landing at Omaha Beach.  It lived up to its reputation.  The senselessness of war became obvious as I watched the men try to get on the beach and just die, creating piles of bodies.  I had heard about the beaches being washed with blood, but the movie made it real.  The moments of silence – as I later learned were supposed to be Tom Hank’s character’s moments of deafness – seemed poignant and almost worse than hearing the whiz of bullets and explosions.  What I imagined was going on was almost worse – and it seemed to point out the hopelessness of war, how it doesn’t make any sense.  The second act – when Hanks and company go off in search of Private Ryan – proved to be the typical narrative of a WWII movie.  Although, I might say, it was rather refreshing to have average, normal, what I would think are representative soldiers, instead of a cast of characters like many of my other favorite WWII movies (The Dirty Dozen, The Great Escape, etc.).  I read  urlLink Ebert’s review  of the movie afterwards, and I thought his observation that the translator (who I totally thought was  urlLink Henry Thomas  – he and  urlLink Jeremy Davies  could be twins!) was the point of entry for him into the movie.  I agreed – I felt that if I were in a war, I would be the civilian unprepared for the realities of actual fighting.  His confusion with the war – and especially his expectations for the company to accept him – gave me a way to understand how to come to terms with the rest of the film.  The third act – after Ryan is found and the company defends the bridge was probably the most interesting.  After recently seen The Bridge of the River Kwai, I found this part of protecting a bridge fairly interesting.  And I began to identify the characters more strongly – they had actually bonded before the Germans came.  I understood the fighting in vague terms – what they were trying to defend and how their movements affected one another.  Although I was slightly disturbed by my reaction to the translator’s inability to fight with the Germans – I kept urging him to go upstairs and save his comrades.  Well, this wasn’t a Hollywood movie, and he couldn’t manage to pull himself together until it was too late.  Saving Private Ryan was a great movie – one that I don’t think I will soon forget.  It makes me think about war differently, although I still believe that WWII is the main touchstone of the 20th century for Americans.  It is hard to watch a movie about a war right now and not think about the differences between back then and the war we are fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Things seemed so much clearer back then – the enemies were more black and white – you were either Axis or Allies, German or American.  WWII seems to be a war that we as Americans keep going back to, perhaps because it has an ending that is easily understood.  Good triumphed over evil.  WWII was also so well documented, even as the war was  going on, Hollywood made films to inspire those on the homefront.  I’m always a fan of watching the Memorial Day marathons on various cable channels, and the amount of WWII movies always outnumbers WWI and all the other various wars or conflicts that the US has fought in.  Perhaps going back to WWII and creating fiction out of the facts makes us hope that we can create some understanding out of the wars fought afterwards – that understanding reasons for a war that is clearer can help us understand why the more confusing wars were fought afterwards.  But enough philosophy for now -- I loved the use of color in the movie.  It was washed out and felt real.  The use of handheld cameras for the beach scenes and most of the combat scenes made it feel less like a Hollywood movie made in the 1990s harkening back to 1944, but as if it could have been a documentary, that a camera crew followed the search for Private Ryan.  The opening and closing shots of the transluscent American flag was just right.  Seeing Saving Private Ryan makes me question how  urlLink Shakespeare in Love  managed to win the Best Picture Oscar over this film.  I have no doubt which one will be more talked about fifty years in the future -- and it will not have Ben Affleck in it.            Summer is the best time to watch old movies.  There isn’t really anything on TV, except reruns.  Since I saw the shows I like the first time, I really only watch reruns of crime shows like Law and Order or Without a Trace.  But honestly, I don’t need an excuse to watch old movies.  It’s just a good reasoning -- especially since I don’t have cable.  And tonight I got to watch another Van Johnson movie.  Yes, my curiosity in this popular 1940s/1950s movie star has spread, and I’ve got a couple people supplying me with his movies.   urlLink Two Girls and a Sailor  was actually Johnson’s first top billing movie -- as well as Gloria DeHaven and June Allyson’s first big parts.  It’s a pretty fluffy story about two female musicians.  The Deyo Sisters – Patsy (Allyson) and Jean (DeHaven) – have an act at a club in what I am going to assume is California during WWII.  So the rather thin plot is stretched out by a lot of performances by other musicians and singers, including Lena Horne, Jimmy Durante (who is surprisingly funny!), Gracie Allen, and several orchestras.    The story – albeit thin – is pretty good, but standard.  Jean and Patsy have their nightclub act, but after hours, they run a canteen for servicemen in their home.  How they manage to afford to supply all the sailors and soldiers with sandwiches and pop is never quite clear, but taking into consideration the size of their apartment, they must be making pretty good money at the club.  Jean is the cuter sister and has an admirer who keeps sending her orchids.  One night they are inviting young men to their canteen and Jean gets to invite a sailor (Johnson) to the canteen.  He isn’t known by his name -- he's mostly just “Hey Sailor.”  The girls sing and get to know the sailor and another soldier, Frank (Tom Drake).  These are the two rivals for Jean’s affections, but Patsy seems to like the sailor too.  What will happen?  The girls mention that they wished they had the warehouse across the street from their apartment, and the next day someone shows up at their door with the keys and the deed.  'Someone' has decided that the Deyo Sisters deserve to get what they wish for -- but who is this 'someone?'  The sisters explore the warehouse, which turns out not to be haunted by ghosts, but rather by Billy Kidd (Durante) who they used to tour with as children.  And this isn’t an ordinary warehouse -- it's a theatrical warehouse which makes it so much easier to clean up and transform into a spectacular nightclub/canteen.  (It’s an MGM musical, so I didn’t expect any realism.)  Jean continues to get on well with the sailor, much to the dismay of Patsy.  She even ends up having a dream about it.  It’s a pretty standard dream sequence, although the sailor shows up in an admiral’s uniform, complete with enormous epaulets.  The most memorable part of the dream is the catfight between sisters over the sailor.  Seriously girls, is he really worth fighting over?  The next morning Billy manages to overhear one of the assistants with the club’s overhauling mention that 'someone' can afford to pay extra -- it's J. Dykeman Brown who is paying for this!  He tells Patsy, who manages to track down J. Dykeman Brown, who is old enough to be Jean’s grandfather!  It turns out that he’s J. Dukeman Brown, and there’s a J. Dykeman Brown II, and finally, J. Dykeman Brown the Third -- the sailor!  Johnny has been hiding a secret -- he's worth sixty million dollars!  Patsy, of course, is heartbroken, so the oldest J. Dykeman Brown comforts her by saying 'At your age I wouldn’t have fallen in love with your sister.'  The nightclub opens again, complete with a plethora of musical numbers.  Patsy reveals to Jean 'someone’s' real identity, and she is more happy with his cash than with him.  Jean decides to leave to do a single act in Buffalo, but before leaving, the Deyo Sisters need to do one last act together.  Jean realizes that she really doesn’t love Johnny -- she's in love with the Texan soldier Frank who calls her ma’am.  (It really is adorable.)  She’s going to move to Texas and raise onions with him.  Yay.  So Johnny is left for Jean to have -- and he’s realized that he’s in love with her, not Jean.  All the couples are complete, so all that’s left is for the final big number.  Two Girls and a Sailor is pretty chintzy and predictable, but I enjoyed it.  They don’t make movies like this anymore -- musicals like this have gone out of vogue, and nightclubs like the one portrayed in the movie don’t seem to exist any more.  It’s a nice look at an era gone by.    \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
