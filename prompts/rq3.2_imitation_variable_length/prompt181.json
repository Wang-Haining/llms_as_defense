What the film got right, as far as I'm concerned, comes down to setting and sets.&nbsp; I liked the sets, liked the scenes at the Roman villa where they find Guinevere, liked the look of Hadrian's Wall and the castle (nice Round Table).&nbsp; I generally liked how the film was shot, too.&nbsp; What I liked about the setting mostly has to do with personal taste -- I'm not too keen on the sanitization of the medieval world.&nbsp; As my Old English professor would have said,  lif es sceort .&nbsp; And apparently dirty, too.  The casting was simply okay.&nbsp; Keira Knightley was kind of awkward as Guinevere, a&nbsp;bit wooden and not exactly a believable revolutionary in my opinion; aesthetically, she's par for the course for a Bruckheimer film -- she looks pretty good for a Celtic warrior, although I found her quasi-S&M warrior woman outfit at the end of the film to be a bit much.&nbsp; Mind you, I know the Celts fought in the nude (or damn close to it), and I'm not saying I want to see that (even with attractive people, war in the buff falls under bad naked as far as I'm concerned), it's just that this was a little too modern looking (possibly) for my taste.&nbsp; Owen makes a fine Arthur, but he's given damn little room to do much.&nbsp;&nbsp; This makes sense, as Arthur rarely does anything in any of the stories anyhow.&nbsp; I could have done without his tortured cry as he kneels over the corpse of Lancelot.&nbsp; It rang really false to me.&nbsp; As for the rest of the cast, meh.&nbsp; Nothing good, nothing bad, nothing notable I can think of right now.  I'll continue this tomorrow (with what I really didn't like and what type of Arthur movie I think people would want), but for now, it's bedtime.                \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
