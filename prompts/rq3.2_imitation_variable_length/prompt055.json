A pet treated as though it were one's child. Also: fur-kid, fur kid.        &nbsp;         Example Citation:         My name is Brenda Mejia and I'm owned by two Australian cattle dogs. I don't have kids, so I call my dogs my 'furkids.' They keep me as busy as a soccer mom.        &#8212;Brenda Mejia, &quot;Pet stories,&quot; The Desert Sun (    Palm Springs    ,     CA    ),     April 30, 2004             &nbsp;        &nbsp;         Notes:         The code of politically correct speech has come down against the word pet, which at first blush seems about as inoffensive a term as there is in the language. It has referred to a domesticated or tamed animal since the 16th century, and has even branched out to mean a favorite person, or one who is treated with special kindness. What's wrong with that? Plenty, say the animal-rights activists. Pet implies the human ownership of an animal, and that just won't do. The preferred term now is companion animal (1977).         &nbsp;        The term furkid, of course, takes us beyond the treatment of the animal as a mere companion and into the realm of surrogate kid-hood. Now we animal guardians (1997) can apply our hyper-parenting skills to our dogs, cats, and other four-legged members of the family.         &nbsp;        That some of us are doing this is further evidenced by the fact that a number of synonyms for furkid exist, including furbaby (1993; also: fur baby) and furchild (2000; also: fur child).         &nbsp;        Example Citation #2:         Most everything I ever needed to learn about babies I learned from my dogs.         &nbsp;        Although I never went as far as calling them my &quot;fur kids,&quot; dogs long predated babies in my life. Indeed, in other pages of this newspaper, I am a pets columnist, writing about everything from bearded dragons to border collies. But as I begin to compose the occasional mothering column as well, I've discovered that there's plenty of crossover wisdom between species.        &#8212;Denise Flaim, &quot;Triplet Chronicles; Dogged lessons in baby care,&quot; Newsday,     May 17,  2004             &nbsp;        The ch    allen    ge for all of you is to use &#8220;furkid&#8221;&nbsp; in a sentence as many times as you possible can.&nbsp;        &nbsp;        My extension on furkid is &#8220;furniece&#8221;.&nbsp; That is my sister has a furkid, therefore I have a furniece.        &nbsp;        End of Rant      \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
