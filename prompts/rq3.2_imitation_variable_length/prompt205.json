So my friend decided she knew exactly how to fix it. She took one of my smelly candles, like the ones you buy at a store and light to make your room smell nice. Yeah, so we had 15 regualr candles and then big fatty in the corner. It was nice, My party was so much fun! You only turn sixteen once, and let me say THAT is exactly how I would want to do it. I mean it wasn't antything extravagent, but all my friends were there, and we just had fun. Atleast I did, I hope everyone else did! There were a few people who couldn't make it and that really bummed me out, but it's all good. I went out for my birthday lunch today, we would have done it yesterday but there was so much going on. We went to Olive Garden, God I love that place. But I always get full after the salad and breadsticks and end up taking more than half of my main meal home. Oh jees, So yesterday at my party, two of my friends disappear, okay you'd think I would have been suspicious because these two particular people don't really like each other all that much, and all they had to do was run home real quick and then come back, but they were gone for like and hour if not longer. They get back, and I don't remember why but I went to my room   for something and I open my door and there is something sticking to my feet. I turn on my light and my room is COVERED in rice, jelly beans, garbanzo beans and candy corn. I mean it's EVERYWHERE. All over the floor, in my bed, in my pillow cases, in my drawers, all in my furniture, not one place in my room where there was not rice. Rice is not fun to clean up, really it's not. AND they hid two open cans of sardines in my room. I wasn't to thrilled about that on account of I have two cats. WOW, what a pain. Funny, but not fun. So I'm going to go see King Arthur with some friends today for ym birthday and then sunday I am going to go see Collateral with my brother for my birthday. My birthday so far has lasted 3 days, I love it! I got 75 bucks for my birthday from friends, and then 200 from my parents, I'm going to get my tattoo within the next week, so Michelle, you have convince your mom that I need you there! Tell her I'm scared or something and I need my best friend there! Right so I have to call Hoops to see what I need to do in order to get my tattoo and how much it'll cost, and all that, if I have enough money I think I'm going to get me nose pierced...no, just kidding I'll get my job first and then we'll see what their thoughts are on a nose ring...Right, phone, gotta go.                 Dear Fellow Bloggers,    I had a CRAZY night. I was at a friends birthday party, and my best friend was tackled by another friend of mine, and we had to take her to the hospital because she hurt her knee, it turns out she was just being a weeny, they did x-rays and all that and it turned out it was just bruised, they gave her pain killers and told her to ice it for the next few days. She's fine though she's even going out to Denny's in a few minutes. I was going to go to the hospital with her, I called my mom to tell her, and my mom said no, and then I got pissed and left mt friends birthday party and went home, only to get in a huge fight with my mom. Not fun. But things are okay now. So I called the kid who tackled my best friend to let him know that she was okay and to not feel to bad. Well he knew because they went back to the party (yeah, I know weeny). And I think he tried to ask me out on a date. My best guy friend in the world, just tried to ask me on a date. It's okay that I'm weirded out yeah? He asked me what I was doing tomorrow, I told him nothing, then he asked me what I was doing tomorrow night, and I said nothing (curious as to where he was going with this) and then he asked if there were any movies out that I haven't seen. I told him i didn't know (completely freaked out by this point in time) and then he asked if I wanted to go see Alien vs. Pretator with him tomorrow. I asked who all would be going and he said just you and me...That's not normal for me and him, yeah we hang out one on one, but we never just call each other up and then go see a movie with each other...A question for all the guys out there,   did I just get asked out on a date by my best guy friend?     -Confused in Washington              I'm still trying to dectide if I liked it. It was a weird movie. And NOT AT ALL what you think. Seriously, you will think you have the movie figured out...but ya won't. Out of all 4 of M. Night's movies, I'd say it was his 4th best. I can't say anything about the movie because I will give things away, but I do encourage you to see the movie because it's one of those movies that you have to see just so you know what happens. ..  Last night we played another game of Communist Church. It was great fun. I got thrown against a wall, I ran into a row of chairs, I got 14 ppl out of jail and then ran past 3 communists (all waiting by the 'church') and made it to the 'church' safely (The 'church' is the safezone for the christians). I have a HUGE bruise on shin (from the chairs) and another on my foot (from getting thrown against the wall). Yes...great fun.  One more thing, you have to check out  urlLink this site  and watch the video. It's really pretty funny no matter what party you're associated with.               tonight i'm getting together with my youth group for freaky fridays (its a highschool group, all the highschoolers get together and just hang out and have fun and be dumb...its good stuff) and we're gunna play a game called 'Communist Church' yeah i've never played before but i guess you play in the complete dark and you have to find this tiny flashlight before the 'communists' take you to jail. It's basically a mix between sardines and jailbreak (I'm going to assume you know how to plays those two games). It should be fun because we're playing it at our church and our church is fairly large and has many things you could run into and get hurt by. I dunno what it is but I enjoy getting bruises and scars from random events. Then after that my friend is gunna come over and stay the night and we're gunna watch  The Butterfly Effect, yay for that, then tomorrow I'm going to go see a movie with another friend, not sure which movie, prolly Anchorman, then sunday I am going to go see King Arthur with my brother, my friend and my friends sister. So there is my weekend. Right so I'm gunna go, in the words of Michelle...'Have Fun, Make Good Choices.'...bye      \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
