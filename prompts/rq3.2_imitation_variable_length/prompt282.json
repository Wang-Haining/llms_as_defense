I'm not sure if I'm ready for the kind of relationship he wants. He wants to tell his parents and his numerous brothers and sisters that he's in love with me and he doesn't want to go ahead with his marriage to Gloria (his parents' preferred choice of partner). It's terrible because I'm not that bothered. I mean, yeah, it's nice and all, having a big latino hunk beside me, but sometimes he doesn't use deoderant and that really bothers me. Also, I found out that he doesn't have medicare, he's one of that forty percent we're always hearing about. That would worry me too much if we formed a lifelong partnership, I'd always be stopping him from crossing the road in case he got run down and we couldn't afford to have him fixed. Also, I don't really understand everything he says. The other day he said 'You're so impotant; Too wee!' and I was like, hello, Mr Hulio Englasias, your dick ain't exactly anything to write home about. And then I realised he was actually saying 'You're so important to me.' I was really embarassed for like a second and then I realised it was all part of our sexual socio-cultural exchange. But I don't like it. I'm worried one day I'm going to split up with him over something really nice he said about me. That would look totally stupid. No. I think it's time to call it a day. I'm gonna' tell him...after dance (we're doing the Rio-Rhumba and I don't want him to mess up). Bye. Love you. Bye then. M xx                 Monday. (Seventh Day Adventist Current Bun Bake-off) School in ten minutes. Just had to get back on my computer after my mom checked it out for pornographic downloads. It was really quite embarassing. I thought I'd wiped everything, but then she found this picture of Jamie and I was like 'Oh, it's just a guy at school. God! I don't even know how it got there' I think she might suspect something. Yesterday she asked me if I had a girlfriend. I just said all the usual stuff like how I was working too hard. I hate lying to her. I'm thinking of making her believe Janice to be my girlfriend. You know. I could let her come into my bedroom and scrabble up off the bed adjusting my pants and stuff. Janice could just get one of her breasts out I reckon. That would probably draw my mom's eye plenty and, hey presto! She'll quit bugging me. Gotta' go. I said I'd meet Deborah and Cerise before class and style their hair. I hate Cerise so I'm thinking of a French plait, but Deborah's nice, kind of quiet a geeky, she only hangs around with Cerise to be used as a kind of verbal ash-tray for that spiteful girls ramlings. I'll do something nice for her.  Bye. Oh, this is a big wheel I found:   It's got two boats on it. Interesting huh?                 Friday. Friday. Friday. (Christmas. Taiwan) I'm tired. So tired. Like my feet are chained to the floor. Broke up with Jamie. Well, in my head anyway. I'm not sure he was so upset, or that he even realised what a great relationship we've been having. I'm mean with the touch and the 'Hey! Wassup?' we'd been getting along better than any two people I know. It was like dreamy for me, but that's all gone now. I finally said Enough is Enough is Enough. I can't go on, I can't go on no more yeah. I've been avoiding him ever since, but hopefully we can still be friends. JANICE! She is so annoying. You just can't stay mad with her for long. When she found out that I had been psychologically in a long-term relationship with Jamie (like, three weeks!) she said no to going out with him. I tried to change her mind. Said it didn't matter, but I think she picked up on my real feelings and told him to shove it! He was quite shocked I think, to have Janice refuse a date. It must've really hurt him, but NO! I don't care, I must stay strong and be filled with hatred for him. That way me and Janice can stay best friends, hopefully forever, and never let a man get in the way.  Besides I've met someone else. His name's Richard. He's so sweet. I saw him in the supermarked the other day. He totally stared at my ass in dairy. Then, when I was looking for some organic sunflower seeds I saw him again, looking at bags of wheat, but he wasn't really because as soon as I left he followed. It was really exciting because he is HOT! I managed to get a picture of someone who looks a bit like him. Hang on...   There. He looks just like this, but with clothes on and standing up. God, my posts are so long. I'm verbose beyond my years. I should be cute and young and brief.
