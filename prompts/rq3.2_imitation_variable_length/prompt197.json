With all that has been going on this year... My good friend's wedding is this Saturday and she would have put a hurtin' on me if I got pregnant before then since she paid for our bridesmaid dresses. You gotta love her for that (paying for the dresses I mean).  Then we have to pay $700+ for our trip to Indiana for DH's family reunion. Then we get a 2 month break before we go to my dad's wedding in October. The dress my dad's fiancee picked out is beautiful too. It's strapless but has enough elastic to stay on even with me not having any boobs to hold it up. But anyway, I could try to squeeze in ttc but I really don't want to. I want to be able to go out with my best friend and have a couple of drinks with her, maybe go dancing or something. Smoke a couple of forbidden cigarettes. I need to get this stuff out of my system once and for all before I really start ttc. DH thinks we can sign up with the sperm bank at the beginning of next year. It will cost $150 to set up our account with the bank. If we decide to use an Identity Release donor, it will cost $210 for a standard ICI vial and $245 for a prepared IUI vial. If we use an anonymous donor it will cost $185 for ICI and $215 for IUI. If we want to use their photo matching service, that will cost $45. I really don't know how important the photo matching service is. I guess that's one of the things I'll have to talk to them about when we do sign up. I found a donor that in my opinion is quite ideal. But the problem is the ethnic background of this donor is German and Irish. My husband really doesn't know if he has those ethnicities in his ancestry but he does know he is part Serbian and part Italian so he wants me to look for people with those ethnic backgrounds. My problem is that the ones I have found like that usually have the wrong height, weight, hair texture (it HAS to be straight as both mine and DH's is very straight)or bloodtype. I learned that (especially if you're an O blood type) if the baby you're carrying has a different blood type than yours you'll more likely miscarry because your baby's blood is attacking your blood. That's why you can't get blood transfusions from the wrong type. I'd be willing to bet that IF doctors most of the time don't even think to consider blood type as a factor. If you have AB blood it would matter so much because you can take blood from any type. A types and B types are not as much at risk but still are. Weird, huh? But I digress...I wish this could be a spontaneous surprise. Or at least I wish this could be as easy as it was for my Bro and SIL. You know, have a few tumbles in the hay, complain about being tired all the time and end up with a healthy baby at the end of 9 months. My brother complained about having to deal with his MIL for 3 weeks after the baby was born. I thought to myself 'Count your blessings big brother, you'd be glad for it if you'd been trying for years rather than um, no effort at all. Oh hell, I sound so bitter. I'm really not though. Jealous, though, very much so. But why should I be? They were much more ready for kids. They certainly have the money for it. My brother writes computer programs for the Navy. They got a letter from good ole President Georgey congratulating them on their baby. Not that DH and I don't have the money because we do. And we pay more in rent than Bro and SIL do. I'm just tired of waiting! I want to be able to hop in the sack and come out a month later saying I'm pregnant. Surprise! But no. I'm not going to tell my family when we're officially trying though. It would drive me crazy if they kept asking me 'Any luck yet?'                        Most Fridays are. This one most certainly isn't. Today I was laid off from work. &nbsp;I was told that they need someone with more experience and who can get more work done.&nbsp; I'm not going to make excuses for myself. I'm defintiely not the world's best employee. But I gotta say, I didn't see this coming.&nbsp; Man I feel like such a fucking loser. The last job I had I was fired after only 2 months because I couldn't work fast enough. This job I was only at for 7 months.&nbsp; The job before that I had for almost 2.5 years but quit because I was being asked to take on more responsibility than I had experience for and when I asked for help I was given none. Then I found out a few months after quitting that they were going to fire me anyway.&nbsp; Even though I don't have a perfect work ethic, I think I have a pretty good one.&nbsp; Thank GOD we are finally not in the red financially. Otherwise I'd be having a nervous breakdown.&nbsp; I think I have to come to terms with the fact that I'm good as a receptionist, but not at much else. I need to go back to school so I can learn how to do tech support, but until then... The lady who hired me at this last place really liked me, I could tell. She said if their new receptionist doesn't work out, she'd love to have me in that position. She also said she would talk to her friend who runs a temp/employment agency to see if she can help me out. I really appreciate it but it still hurts, ya know? My husband came over to my work when he got off so he could help me pack my shit up.&nbsp; So now, here I am unemployed again. Fuck I'm depressed.&nbsp; Seriously, why is it that everytime life seems to be getting back on track something happens to fuck it up?                         I just sent a questionnaire to a man who is offering to donate sperm for free. I was skeptical at first, I mean why would someone want to accept   all   of the costs (shipping and everything). I looked over this guy's  urlLink website  and he seems to have been very thorough. He has given a lot of information about himself. It would be such a Godsend to be able to get the sperm free of cost.  It also helps that the donor posted pictures of himself as a baby and kid. He doesn't look a lot like my husband, but he kind of looks like a mix between us. Besides, he has the important characteristics. I am really excited but nervous to hear back from this guy. His questionnaire was pretty detailed. I almost felt like I was applying for college again. I did like the fact that he is willing to be an open donor and meet with the kid once their 18 if they so desire. But he otherwise wants no contact and that's how I'd prefer it. He has provided sperm to several other women, so there is a small concern of half-siblings inbreeding without knowing it, but the donor suggests being open about the origins of the child so when the time comes, they can be sure their future partner isn't of the same genes. He is keeping confidential files of whom he has donated to (I guess) so this info can be found later if necessary.  I am so jealous of all the women who are in the process of ttc right now. I sooo want to start! Even my husband is baby dreaming now. He gets a goofy smile on his face when he sees a kid do something cute. My tummy is full of butterflies at the thought of having a baby!   Now, I'm not so sure I want a car after all. Gas prices are soaring right now in California, and San Francisco (my home town) has the highest in the state! It's amazing that Californians have to pay more for gas when we're closer to the refineries than the people of Utah or Colorado.  I'd like to look into getting a gas/electric hybrid car, but I'd need a good loan and payment plan. I'm not sure if I'll be able to do that having filed bankruptcy last year. Thank God we're back on track financially. It helps that hubby and I both have jobs we like. I'm hoping that since I work in such a small office when I do have a baby, I'll be able to bring it with me. I plan to breast feed for at least a year. I have plenty of motivation: I want bigger boobs without surgery! ;o) Not that that's my primary reason, but it's sure a nice side-benefit.                              I've been reading  urlLink Operation Terra  Book 2. I finished Book 1 about 3 weeks ago. They aren't long books, just a lot to absorb. I placed the link to the website for this book because I want other people's opinions (not that anyone will read this but if they do...) because I have mixed feelings about it.   A lot of what the book says resonates with me but some of it I'm afraid to believe. There will always be a skeptic side of me no matter how much I'm into metaphysical stuff.    According to the book our current reality is going through the process of splitting. The book separates the human population into two groups, Service to Others (STO) and Service to Self (STS). This makes quite a bit of sense to me. I see it all the time. The book also says that the change is starting to accelerate and we might notice extremes of both polarities (positive and negative). The united States is a prime example of that. I consider the Gay Marriage movement to be a very positive thing (more on this in another post) but it has created some very negative response. San Jose just voted to give the same rights to gay city workers who have been married in San Francisco as straight married couples.  Now there is a small group that wants to recall everyone who supported this. Our president wants to amend the constitution to ban gay marriage. We have large groups of people getting more and more into spirituality and choosing peace, but it seems there are just as many people who are choosing the opposite path.   The thing I like most about this book is that it says to respond to the chaos around us by finding comfort within. Don't identify with all of this chaos because soon (relatively) we will be separated from it. Apparently we will be increasing our vibration, but it seems to me they have hinted that we might have to leave our bodies. I don't how this will work. There's a lot they talk about that is quite outside my realm of experience.   Anyway, please check out some of the messages on the website for Operation Terra and tell me what you think!                             I have a dear friend I met through an e-mail group. She lives about 2.5 hours north of me. After years of mental and physical abuse this woman's husband has filed for divorce at the promptings of his daughter. He has told my friend (JA) that if she gets a lawyer he will make her life hell. She had tried to get a lawyer anyway because she needs the alimony as she is disabled and has no job right now. She has not been able to find a shelter to take her in because she has no children and she is on medication which they will not distribute to her and will not allow her to keep it to take it herself. So she has been forced to stay at the house where her soon to be ex can come and go as he pleases. A week from last Friday he returned home and raped her. He tied her ankles and wrists to the bed posts spread-eagle. He used nail clippers on her genitals and when she was screaming too loud he switched to a razor blade. She spent that weekend in the hospital and has been trying to find out if she can leave town before the court date. I'm trying to get her to come down here to San Francisco where she'll be far enough away from that bastard and safe. She'll be able to start her life over. The police have told her they can't protect her from this man, so what is she supposed to do? I know this post isn't very coherent, but it makes me so incredibly mad that there are such sickos out there. JA has been beaten down so much that she can barely fight back anymore. All she has to eat is peanut butter and crackers. Ugh, I hope she'll be able to come down this weekend or next week. The sooner the better.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
