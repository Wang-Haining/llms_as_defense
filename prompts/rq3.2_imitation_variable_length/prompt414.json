My parents called  just before 4:30 am  to sing Happy Birthday to me...they were too funny.  Then my sister Lisa called & had the kids sing with her to me.  Fat baby refused to say a word.  My grandmother left me a message after I'd left for work.  I called her when I got to work & as soon as she said 'hello' I said 'where is my song' and she immediately started singing.  I laughed so hard.  My grandmother's been singing to me (in her special way) every birthday since I was in elementary school.  It's tradition & I love it (so does she).  My co-worker had her daughter bake me a strawberry & whipped cream cake.  It was soooo good!  I had no intention of doing a whole lot at work today, but that thought backfired on me.  I wound up working myself to state of exhaustion (why am I still up?).  All of my friends (including back east) called with good wishes.  That felt good.  Wes came over...his gift was to take me out to dinner (next week), so he gave me a 'little' gift for today.  I opened the gift bag & there was this little, cute, purple bear inside.  I pulled it out & went to hug it & there was a 'little green bag' clipped to the bear's ear.  It's called 'knockout.'  And it did just that to me for a little while...     Rob:  Wes invited you to go to the Cannabis Fest with him this weekend.     I feel good...but very sleepy...                 I can't believe we're already into the month of August. This year is flying by and I've accomplished and learned a lot. Now, if I can only find a better job...  My 'friend' decided not to respond to the letter I e-mailed on Thursday. So I guess I got my answer. A very strange calmness came over me yesterday. I've accepted his decision to not be a part of my life. It feels weird to acknowledge that....to have gotten to the point of being okay with letting go. I truly have nothing but love for him & if I caused him any pain, I hope he knows that I'm sorry and wish him well.  Saturday, Danielle &amp; I took the kids to  urlLink Six Flag's Marine World  to celebrate her son's birthday. It wasn't as warm as I thought it was going to be (that's a good thing), so it turned out to be a great day. We were all worn out by the time we left.  Sunday, Wes & I went to  urlLink church  (awesome as usual). I'm hoping to get up the nerve to join the choir soon (we'll see). They're soooo good!! He &amp; I were drawing attention, due to him banging away on his Barbara Mandrell tambourine. He informed me that I was drawing the attention of the saxophone player. I don't know what the hell he's talking about...it would be nice to find a nice church man :-)                    People come into your life for a reason, a season, or a lifetime. When you figure out which it is, you know exactly what to do.   When someone is in your life for a  REASON , it is usually to meet a need you have expressed outwardly or inwardly.  They have come to assist you through a difficulty, to provide you with guidance and support, to aid you physically, emotionally or spiritually....   They may seem like a Godsend, and they are. They are there for the reason you need them to be. Then, without any wrong doing on your part or an inconvenient time, this person will say or do something to bring the relationship to an end. Sometimes they die. Sometimes they walk away.... Sometimes they act up or out and force you to take a stand.   What we must realize is that our need has been met, our desire fulfilled; their work is done. The prayer you sent up has been answered and it is now time to move on.   When people come into your life for a  SEASON , it is because your turn has come to share, grow, or learn. They may bring you an experience of peace or make you laugh. They may teach you something you have never done. They usually give you an unbelievable amount of joy.  It is real, but...only for a season.    LIFETIME  relationships teach you lifetime lessons; those things you must build upon in order to have a solid emotional foundation. Your job is to accept the lesson, love the person/people (anyway); and put what you have learned to use in all other relationships and areas of your life.                    This week I've been stuck.  This 'issue' with my friend just won't go away.  I've been going back and forth all week second guessing my decision to end things & losing a lot of sleep over it.      Tuesday morning, I purchased Iyanla Vanzant's,  urlLink Yesterday I Cried .  As I was reading it, I came to a part on closure... When you discover that something is broken, you must determine the cause of the break.  In order to do that, you must open the thing, examine it, and find the origin  of the break or malfunction.  Once that is done, you must make a determination as to whether or not the thing is worth fixing.  If you determine that the fixing is worth your effort, it must be done carefully.  If, on the other hand, you decide that the thing is not worth fixing, you must get rid of it.  You must throw it away, clean the place it once occupied, and when you are ready, find a suitable replacement.  This is called 'closure.'       I'm not ready to let go, even though I said goodbye (but that's because I thought he wanted nothing to do with me).  I truly believe our friendship is worth fixing.  I emailed him this afternoon asking him if he wanted me to leave him alone or if he wanted us to 'fix it.'    I haven't heard from him...yet....                   This past weekend was the annual celebration of  gay pride in San Francisco,  urlLink  which has been celebrated since 1970 .   Sunday, Wes and I went to church first (of course). In the afternoon, we went down to meet friends & to get ready for the 5:00 performance of the headliner... urlLink CHAKA KHAN.   Of course she didn't start on time....but she was only 30 minutes late.  We were several hundred people deep, so I got to see a few glimpses of Chaka's hair!  Picture this:  surrounded by thousands of people...the music starts...in unison, the audience screams...'I'm Every Woman.'  I start singing along with everybody else only to stop & listen to hundreds of gay men singing 'I'm Every Woman.'  It was one of the funniest things I've ever seen.  Of course, there was the typical 'naked men & women' walking around showing their wares.  Now, I have no problem with that, as long as what your showing off is worth my paying attention.  But when your shit is old & wrinkled (or worse than that), you know damn well you should have either just stayed in the house, or gotten dressed.  I was thrown into shock when I walked past this 60+ year old butt-naked man (wearing nothing but pride beads and glasses).  He had balls the size of a softball and a penis no more than an inch long.    WHY?????     Needless to say, I had a good time, but next year, I'll be wearing more comfortable shoes.                 I posted the following over a month ago.&nbsp; I painfully ended a 3+ year friendship two days ago.&nbsp; It's one of the hardest things I've&nbsp;ever had to do, as I care for & love this person deeply.&nbsp; I keep re-reading this to remind myself it's okay to let go...

I was definitely glad to be out of the house as I think I would've just sat around and moped, feeling sorry for myself. My friends really took care of me this weekend, which is just what I needed. It's very hard to turn off my feelings and pretend nothing's wrong. The last time I talked to my friend was a week ago today. I sent him an email last Monday that he won't even respond too...which has made it hurt worse. I don't understand how someone can tell you they care about and appreciate you, but then treat you like the crap stuck on the bottom of their shoe. I'll be glad when I get to the point where I stop asking why...    The garlic festival was fun! Lot's of good food, but too hot (got really dehydrated)!! I still reek of garlic...tasted a lot of good stuff...I will NEVER try garlic ice cream. There is something so wrong about the fact that it even exists. I'm going to make a point to go next year, but I'm definitely getting there when the doors open (soooo many people).    Church was awesome (& packed) today. I tried to keep it together but my emotions were on over drive &amp; every song the choir sang spoke to the issues going on in my life. So glad I was seeing Shrek afterwards (finally). I definitely needed something to make me laugh. It was a funny movie, but I think I liked the first one more. I don't get why people kept saying that Antonio Banderas' character (Puss-n-Boots) stole the show. The character was funny, but Donkey was much funnier. Can't wait until SpongBob comes out...then I can see it with my nieces when I go to Grand Rapids for Thanksgiving. That's going to be sooo much fun.    Well....I know in time, things will get easier to deal with...I'm hoping this week goes by fast.          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
