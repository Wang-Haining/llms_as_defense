As mentioned in my last blog, Suraiya died on the 31st of January 2004, at Kishendas Hospital in South Mumbai, at 9.25 AM of diabetes mellitus, low blood pressure and, to put the lid on things, a heart that decided to stop beating. Evidently. the only people from the film industry to come for her funeral were Dilip Kumar, who as far as I know dd not act with her in any film, and Dharmendra. who went to see her Dillagi 40 times from his Pind in Punjab. Dev Anand did not bother to go for her funeral, which shows major bastardpanti, since it was on account of him that she never got married. According to sundry stories about her on the net, it was after their break-up that her career started plumetting. I couldn't go for her funeral, and she's a Muslim, so there is no question of a chautha or an uthala, which I would certainly have attended.  Anyway, I have decided to resume my normal life, which basically means that it is not only Suraiya's songs I shall hear, but shall go back to my Shamshad Begum and Noorjehan. I am not feeling rather well today, sohave bunked the economics monday test. Buh Bye then                  The conch shells have been blown, along with the bugles. We are at war.  On this day, the 29th of January 2004, it is declared that Of Life and Lurrrve... is at war with The Journal of the Bloodfist Klan. Oft have we borne stoically the Insults and Calumnies of the leader of the (snigger) Klan. No longer shall we submit to this. There is a time for fun, and a time for peace. A day may come when we submit to this, when we forsake our self-respect, and lose all our aatmasammaan, but it is not this. THIS DAY WE FIGHT!  Our will is set. The infidel leader of the Klan, who hath abused our tribe for long, shall be driven in the dust.   The Lord above knows we have never been the aggressors. Indeed, we have often extended the warm hand of friendship. No longer. No longer shall we allow our friendship to be mistaken for weakness. We may be peaceful, but we care about our honour. We shall assuage our dignity.  Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties and so bear ourselves that, should This Blog and its allies last for a thousand years, men will still say 'THIS was their finest hour.  I call upon those who have courage, those who are honourable, and those who have Internet space support us. To the others-  'Tremble, tyrants and traitors  The shame of all good men'  Manav  PS - With profound apologies to Winston Churchill, Tolkien, La Marseillaise and indirectly,  Shakespeare                 I'm no longer depressed now. My chhala has disappeared. According to Nisheeth I am the most obnoxious person on the Planet. Well, obnoxious I may (may. mind you, and I think Dhruv Dahiya is worse) be, but Nisheeth takes the cake in noxiosity (Is that the word?). Known for his trouser-tearing farts in Class 9, as well as eating Kheer with tomato sauce (which might have been the reason for the farts!), year he seems to have become ickier still. Az Gays has proudly informed the world about the fact that 'I have basically stopped bathing, having last done so on boxing day (26th). It is therefore advised that anyone living in or around the city of New Delhi invest in gas masks'  He has personally confessed to me that he did not have a bath for at least 20 day in the height of summer. What beats me is how his family live with it.  As Gays also brings a putrid-smelling tiffin to school. What could be more noxious and obnoxious than that?  And he calls ME Obnoxious. (demented laughter ensues)  Baah Manav                  It's not what you know, it's who you know that matters!   I'm very disappointed and sickened with the way the school functions.  Today was the  de facto   decision of who is what. The heads are as follows- 1- PC (Prateek)- No surprises here. With his marks in the boards, and hiis extensive extracurriculars, it was almost confirmed that he'll be headboy. I'm very pleased for him. Lord knows, he deserves it. 2- Vrinda Marwah- I have no idea whether she's head boy or head girl, all I know is that she's one of the heds. Vrinda is a female, or so her birth certificate says. With her lion(ess) looks, and deep manly voice, its hard to say. Anyway, we now move on to  3- Damini Bansal- Lord knows she's worked for this, and has managed to come out tops in a close competition between her, Sonali Punhani and Shefali Chadha. I'm happy for her too. Now is the 'surprise' This batch of class XII has Zafar Khursheed in school. Despite a less than stellar board record, and a not-quite-full extracurricular resume, he's become head boy. To be fair to him, he's a very nice guy, and doesn't ram his family down one's throat. As a student, he's sober, well-behaved and an overall decent boy. However, he's nothing exceptional.  As an appointment, I have no objection to him. His behaviour, as well as he fact that he's a good basketball player(I've not seen it, but he's captain, so it does count) should ensure he'd be an appointment. Preferably in the Sports section, or the students council. Hell. even the Post of Prezzzie, student council, chalta hai.  But head boy? I don't think so.  Everyone is very upsetwith him, and with Chona ma'am, I m, oddly enough, feeling sorry for him, He tries his hardest to act like a normal student, and its scarcely his fault that he knows ma'am in a non-official capacity,  Unfortunately, he's become one. And that is going to deeply affect the credibility of the school, as well as of some other people. Though, like every instituition, the school has already had a lot of politics, its never been so unsubtle as this.  Khair, que sera sera...                  SONIA GANDHI IS INCOMPREHENSIBLE AND REPREHENSIBLE   I cannot believe the woman says she does not want to be Prime Minister. I mean, woman, you were the Prime Ministerial Candidate. Hell, you joined Politics to prevent the Grand Old Party's death. How then do you justify backing away. just went the party was to come in power?  Mrs. Gandhi, the country, barring a few so-called intellectuals in urban areas support you. The Muslim vote was totally for the congress. They know of your 'foreign origin', and it doesn't make any difference to them. What are you trying to prove by going on about How ManMohan Singh will be a good PM? If the party had Manmohan Singh as its wannabe PM, the INC Would have reached double digits?  Are you scared? If you are, I am disgusted. You didn't join politics to back out. Why don't you bother to learn from your Mother-in-Law, of whom you are but a grotesque replica? It matter to HER that her security guards, who ended up shooting her, were Sikhs. Remember her speech the night before her death at Bhubhaneshwar. Your MIL was promoted only because she was a 'goongi gudiya', and how wrong she proved her detractors.  Woman, show some courage and have the decency to take what you publically proclaimed you needed!  W                 Well Well Well, Look who's the new blogger?! Tis true, sires. I too have decided to jump on the bandwagon and start a blog of my own. After Aadisht, Bhavya and Nisheeth, now, it's my turn First, a few words about myself Manav Kapur (for such is my name) is an extremely smart, handsome and dashing young gentleman who has a gaggle of girls constantly around him. Known as 'The Brain' to all those who know him, he is constantly asked by his friends how he manages to be so hot, chaahming and intelligent at the same time.  Yeah right, Manav, you wish. In your dreams, hon  Now, the truth Manav Kapur (for such IS my name) is a boy whose looks have been charitably described as 'Er...weird' by some and 'Manav? ewablackk!' by sundry others(Most of whom includes my friends, for whom charity does not seem to be an essential virtue). A gaggle of girls has been with moi at times, but well, not, certainly for my looks, nor for my personality which falls short of being winning. Perversion, thy name is Manav. The 'the brain' bit? Well, history maybe. In all other matters, Iam referred to as 'Da Lunatic', for obvious reasons, as you will find after you get to know me. So follow me, gentle reader, through a day-by-day view of the viscissitudes of my life.             \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
