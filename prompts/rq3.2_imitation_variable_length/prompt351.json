Anthony 2 1/2 and Julia 7 mons. but they are really really good kids.. they listen good.  Not gonna do cross country... witch makes me sad... my knee has been really bothering me latly and i dont know why and i have brusies coming out all over the place and i dont really think and i want to fuck it up really bad again and make my dad pay to go to theripy for it to do nothing at all.....but i know that alot of people are going to be made at me for not doing it.. i have already been called a quiter tons of times.. but in order for me to be and quiter i would have had to have joined and i didnt join i just went to a couple open runs but that isnt joinging...  Cholesteral test coming on wednesday.. nervous about that too.. the taking of the blood prosses and the getting the results... i will be about to figure out if working out does anything for me....  been sleeping pretty shittaly latly also... might be because i have been a little stressed... the 16th is coming.. and all of you should know what that means... a good old aniversary. 8 days away!...little nervous.. dont know how that that day is going to turn out.. dont want it to be bad.... we will have to wait and see.  to be continued...  The Ataris..... The Night The Lights Went Out In NYC             Had fun. Hung out with the friends last night. Went to Jerrys house and kinda played capture the flag but after a while everyone quit, because it was impossible. The other team didn't even know where there flag was, Ken hid it and just told them that it was under a bush... Cool cool. I got bit by something and I have no idea what it was but it hurts bad, and it itches, but if I itch it it hurts REAL bad. And a walked threw a poison ivy patch. Just hope that I don't get more Poison Ivy.   Today we were supposed to go to the beach with the friends but I didn't want to because they were just going to 'hang out' at the beach. Why go all the way to the beach to hang out why cant we hang out closer. Why use gas to hang out at the beach when I don't have to use any at all. So I just said no.   They are going to Ceder Point tomorrow. I want to go but I can't. Because my Dad didn't buy me a pass to Geauga Lake to go to Ceder Point. And plus Ceder Point it to far away. It would take like 2 1/2 hours to drive there. No thank you.    Kinda had a bad day today. At first it was fine thought. Me and Stephan went back over to Ryan's house. Played computer, and best of all we played action figures, lol, not really I watched, Stephan and Ryan played. Then Me and Stephan came here and played XBox all night long. Sounds fun,.. kinda, but I did have fun. Until I was losing and then getting pissed off, because I am a poor sport. And then I come up to go on my computer and it is freaking out, over loading and shit. I JUST FIXED IT THE OTHER DAY! I JUST DELETED EVERY SINGLE THING OFF OF IT! And it is having errors already. I HATE IT!  From then on I have been in a bad mood. When I was taking Stephan home, one thing that he said to me scard me. This is what he said: 'How can you go from playing xbox and being happy and laughing and then so pissed off that everything is pissing you off, in less then 20 minutes?' ....My mom was a huge manic depressant, being happy as ever, laughing with everyone and then so pissed off that she would be trying to kill herself. What if that is me in the future.. How do I know that that is not how I'm gonna turn out? How do I know that 20 years down the road that I'm not gonna be this drug addict, alcoholic, pycho path trying to kill my self, if I haven't yet? I don't know, I don't know at all. I could be the opposite. But it still scare me. How would you feel if one of the choices that you make in life could lead to that, dead on the side of a fucking river, just one tiny thing and that is how I would end up? How would you deal with that?  Its a fucking scary ass thought if you ask me.    Song of the night:  Bone Thugs n Harmony: E. 1999 Eternal Tha Crossroads            For those of you that did not know, I recently just got back from Paris.  And it was great fun and I would go back in a heartbeat.. But only for a short amount of time, not for a long time.  I was there for 8 days and we saw everything that we could possible see in 8 days and still have days to ourselves to shop.  I spent at least 300 dollars on clothes for myself and 200 on other people.  The people are nice there!  They are not mean like people say that they are.  They are really nice and most of them know English, so you don't have to slaughter your French =) The food is good too.  Exceptionally the crepes!  They were excellent!  The funny part was the illegal people there selling stuff.  They would be selling stuff everywhere, like by the Eiffel Tower and then cops would come and they would run and hide where ever they could as fast as they could... Just so that they would not get caught.  Quite amusing watching them run around really fast.  But other then Paris everything is goooood, not doing to much. Cross Country open runs have started.  They started yesterday.  Official practice doesn't start till Aug 9th but that is okay it will get me into shape.  IM a little bit soar today but I will have to get used to it and suck it up.    I want to hang out with all the 'old' group again.  Just something little the.  Not hang out allll day long with each other just do something little and that's it.  So that I don't get sick of someone or anything.  Like 2 weeks ago when we played volleyball together.  That was fun.  I would like to do that more often.  So if  any of you read this then call me up and we can plan something to do.  Because I carry my cell phone with me now.  I don't leave it at home all of the time because I have a purse now and I can put it in there! Yah for me! I have a purse aren't you proud! Well I am!   Song of the day : New Found Glory: Catalys    'Who Am I'                  I didn't do much today. So I don't have much to talk about. Just to  let you know this computer is a piece of shit never use it. It  doesn't go to the next line I have to push enter and when I want  something bold I have to do it myself or it will all delete. This  computer is a piece I want to throw it out the window!!  Me and Stephan went to Ryan's house last night and Chas was there. Didn't do much at first I watched them do what ever they were doing  on the computer.  Then we went to Giant Eagle and got Butterfly  Effect. I have already seen it, but it was still good. And now Steve  if burning it for me.  I wanted to go to see Incubus at Tower City Amp. On monday but no one  can or wants to go with me. Although I only did ask Tomi and Stephan.  And of course Tomi couldn't go. So I am kinda bummed about that.  But I didn't get my computer working. I gave up on waiting for my  bro and me and Stephan kinda got it, with a little help from Steve.
