We originally intended to go to  urlLink Haw Creek Falls  which is where we went last year, but ended up going to  urlLink Richland Creek  instead. In a previous post I mentioned that we were worried about running out of gas and that was the reason we actually ended up going to Haw Creek Falls last year. Well, apparently we took a different route this year because gas stations were abundant. This year, we took Arkansas 16 all the way from Fayetteville to a town called (argh, I don't remember... I'll have to ask Ang) where we stopped to ask for directions to the campground, which was about 2 miles back the way we came, and then about 9 miles down a gravel county road. The county road was almost exactly 121 miles from the Fayetteville city limits. The trip down was very scenic. Lots of Ozark mountains and valleys to see. The roads were  urlLink canopied  in  urlLink trees  for most of the way, periodically breaking for towns and  urlLink farms .  When we got there, the campgrounds were mostly deserted. There were about 3 groups there, and we had no trouble finding a partially secluded  urlLink site . After setting up camp, we started collecting wood for our dinner fire. I foolishly went traipsing around the surrounding woods, collecting dead branches. Meanwhile, Ang was checking out the empty campsites and found a big stack of logs someone had kindly left behind. They were still kinda green, so it took a lot to get them started and it was a real smokey fire once it did get going. But it served it's purpose. After a light dinner of mushrooms and grapes, we settled around the fire and enjoyed the evening.  Sleep did not come to me that night. I was alternately freezing and sweating. It was only about 55 degrees, and we were not prepared for this with only 2 blankets. Ang somehow managed to ignore the elements and slept for most of the night. At one point, she woke up and I took her to the little outhouse toilets. When we exited our tent we found out that the rustling sounds we'd been hearing was a skunk. We were both relieved when it ran away without spraying. I finally started to doze off about the time the sun was coming up.  That morning, I started the fire again, and we ate roasted sausage and pineapple shish kabob. Mmmmm that's my favorite camping treat. After breakfast, we started breaking down the camp so that we wouldn't have to do it later in the day when we were tired from hiking. After breaking camp, and dousing the fire we donned our hiking gear and headed down to the creek. We hiked upstream for about 2 hours, turned around and hiked back and then went skinny dipping in a  urlLink beautiful blue pool . Richland Creek is absolutely gorgeous. The camera does it no justice at all. The pictures look nice, but the reality was breathtaking. We saw lots of interesting  urlLink rock formations  and natural springs. We also saw lots of creek wildlife, including several different kinds of fish, some  urlLink tadpoles , crawdads, and even a wicked looking  urlLink snake . Some of the tadpoles were in the process of becoming frogs. They had fat little frog bodies, little stumpy legs, and long, wide tails. They were also quite easy to catch. The snake was very interesting to me. It was in a crevice of a rock with about 20 minnows. I'm not really sure how the minnows got there though. Did the snake catch them and bring them to the crevice to eat them, or were they stranded somehow? It doesn't seem likely that they were stranded since the crevice was nearly dry, and about 4 feet from water in every direction. That leads me to believe that the snake brought them there. But how? And why? The only way I can think of that it could catch them is in its' mouth. But if that's the case, why didn't the snake just swallow them then instead of bringing them to a rock and trying to catch them again?  After our hike, we went back to camp, cleaned up a bit, and headed back to Fayetteville. I know my writing doesn't convey it very well, but we had an excellent time, and will probably do something like this again if not this summer, definitely next. The entire collection of pictures is  urlLink here . Enjoy them.             urlLink Muzzling Begins in Iraq  Yep, we're bringing them freedom allright. Freedom to be detained without reason. Freedom to be tortured. And now coming to a news outlet near you, freedom to shut the hell up already. London's Financial Times, that bastion of left-wing rhetoric, reported 10 days ago that Iyad Allawi, the 'prime minister' appointed and approved by Iraq's American management, didn't wait even a month after the 'handover' to establish a 'Higher Media Commission' to red line the press.  Among the restrictions? Any 'unwarranted criticism'' of the aforementioned 'prime minister.'   [...]  And to think that one of the much-ballyhooed acts by U.S. proconsul L. Paul Bremer III, the guy who handed over Iraq's 'sovereignty' to the prime minister June 28 before sneaking out of Baghdad, was to shut down Saddam Hussein's dreaded information ministry.  [...]  Last Saturday, the Baghdad office of Al-Jazeera, the Arabic-language news service often denounced by both Arab dictators and the American administration, was shut down for 30 days so that its journalists have 'a chance to readjust their policy against Iraq,' according to Allawi.  Oh, when will the irony end?            No, not the sun, although that's what I always think of when I see the words Death Star.  urlLink Astrobio.net  has a neat story about one of Saturns moons.    urlLink   Soon after orbital insertion, Cassini returned its best look yet at the heavily cratered moon Mimas (398 kilometers, 247 miles across). The enormous crater at the top of this banner image, named Herschel, is about 130 kilometers (80 miles) wide and 10 kilometers (6 miles) deep. Deeper than the Grand Canyon, Herschel stretches across nearly a third of the tiny moon's diameter. The central mountain shown at the center of Hershel is the height of Mount Everest on Earth.  This impact probably came close to disintegrating the moon. Traces of fracture marks can be seen on the opposite side of Mimas, suggesting that the destruction nearly split the satellite into two pieces. Although the icy moon bears a striking resemblance to the fictional 1977 'Death Star' from the Star Wars film by George Lucas, this low-density satellite probably had a more likely past not as a weapon or space station, but instead as a victim of one catastrophic day in its ancient history. That day Mimas came closer to dying rather than committing any planet-scale homicide.      \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
