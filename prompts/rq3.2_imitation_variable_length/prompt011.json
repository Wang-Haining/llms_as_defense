Police on foot chased down the suspect in the first robbery, which occurred just about when Bush was stepping off his plane. The second and third robberies at different banks took place while the two candidates were addressing their respective crowds -- which was almost certainly factored into the thieves' thinking, police Lt. Don Gano said. 'Without actually talking to the bad guys, that's probably what happened,' Gano said of the robbers' timing. When police answered the first call, it further thinned their ranks, Gano said. Police were hunting for the other two suspects, who were both armed. They did not believe any of the suspects were aware of the others' plans.'                       urlLink Radio Iowa: Eastern Iowa Couple Gets Seat Upgrade in Boston   by O.Kay Henderson  An eastern Iowa couple got singled out for special treatment last night at the Democratic National Convention. Tom and Becky Furlong of Letts, which is in Muscatine County, hosted a John Kerry picnic on their farm last summer. Kerry invited the couple to sit with his family last night in the convention hall. Furlong, like Kerry, is a Vietnam veteran, and endorsed Kerry early in the campaign. Furlong says he was impressed with Kerry becuase he's 'a serious person of substance.' Furlong was on stage, briefly, too, part of a group of farmers who stood as another farmer from Kentucky gave a testimonial on Kerry. Furlong was elected an alternate delegate to the convention, and was sitting in the balcony earlier this week, and didn�t find out �til yesterday that he�d be on stage. He says the seat upgrade was �thrilling' especially since he wasn't sure his wife would even be able to be in the hall for last night's speech.'                       urlLink Yahoo! News - Putting the Bite on Mailman-Shaped Dog Treats    Fri Jul 23, 9:05 AM    TORONTO (Reuters) - Dogs chomping on mail carrier-shaped treats is no laughing matter for Canada Post.    The unamused Canadian postal service -- whose carriers endure more than their share of real dog bites -- convinced Pet Valu Inc. stores to stop carrying Bark Bars, dog biscuits that come shaped like cats and letter carriers.  'This is not in any way, shape, or form funny for us, and to make light of that ... I don't see that as funny at all, not even in the least,' said John Caines, Canada Post's national media relations manager.  The pet store chain, which has 292 outlets in Canada, agreed to withdraw the treats after it received a letter from Canada Post saying that employees were concerned about the risks mail carriers face from dogs and unhappy with having dog biscuits shaped in their likeness.  Earlier this summer, a letter carrier from Chatham in southwestern Ontario broke both her wrists and had part of her ear ripped off when she was attacked by two pitbull-like dogs.  Caines said that in the first six months of 2004 there were 160 dog attacks on mail carriers across Canada.
