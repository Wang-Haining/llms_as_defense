Theoretically, if global warming is indeed happening, the troposphere should be heating up at least as fast as the earth's surface is. Yet temperature data obtained with devices called a  urlLink microwave sounding units (MSUs)  over the past 25 years have consistently suggested little if any tropospheric warming. Some climate scientists have therefore argued that global warming models are flawed. New research suggests that the error lies not in the models but rather in the temperature readings themselves.  Different MSU channels measure radiation emitted in distinct frequency ranges that correspond to different levels of the earth's atmosphere. Researchers knew that channel 2, which provides data on the troposphere, is strongly influenced by the cooling effects of the overlying stratosphere, but they had not succeeded in developing an accurate adjustment for this interference. University of Washington atmospheric scientist Qiang Fu and his colleagues used a second channel, sensitive almost exclusively to the stratosphere, to quantify this layerÂs exact contribution to channel 2 readings. After reanalyzing data collected between 1979 and 2001, the team found that the troposphere's temperature has risen by about two tenths of a degree Celsius (almost one third of a degree Fahrenheit) each decade, bringing it in line with the surface trend.     urlLink  Scientific American                   Scientists working at the Russian Academy of Sciences and  urlLink  Los Alamos National Laboratory  announced today the discovery of superconductivity at ultracold temperatures in cubic diamond. The discovery offers the potential for a new generation of diamond-based device applications and even suggests that superconductivity in silicon or germanium, which also forms in the diamond structure, may be possible.   In findings published in today's issue of the scientific journal  urlLink  Nature  , the Russian - American team of scientists report their discovery of superconductivity in a boron-doped diamond-structured carbon material that had been synthesized at very high pressures and temperatures. The diamond material was fabricated in Russia by scientists working at the  urlLink Institute for High Pressure Physics (IHPP)  at the  urlLink  Russian Academy of Sciences  and brought to Los Alamos where superconductivity in diamond was discovered.    According to Vladimir Sidorov, a scientist who works at both IHPP and Los Alamos, 'gem diamonds are desired for their sparkling brilliance and extreme hardness. This discovery of a totally unexpected new facet of diamond enhances its desirability, not to the well-attired, but to science and technology.'   Diamonds conduct heat more effectively than copper and can withstand very high electric fields. These properties are the result of the ways in which electrons arrange themselves in the atomic structure of diamond. This same electron arrangement makes it impossible for diamond to conduct electricity. However, by subjecting a graphite and boron carbide mixture to pressures of nearly 100,000 atmospheres and temperatures of roughly 4,000 to 4,600 degrees Fahrenheit, scientists were able to transform diamonds from a 'supergem' to a superconductor that carries electricity with no resistance at a temperature of minus 450 degrees Fahrenheit.     urlLink  News Release of LANL                Off late the US department of defense is trying to lower the export limit on computers. Currently the limit limits the export of computer above Pentium 3 with 650MHz or equivalent - still in 1999, come-on guys get real. Oh I forgot, I am talking to 'The US'.  The dramatic tightening of export regulations is included in the National Defense Authorization Act, an annual military funding bill that has already passed the U.S. House of Representatives. Though the proposed rules are only a tiny portion of the 630-page bill, they could have a devastating impact on the computer industry. Today, computer sellers are required to get a license to export any computer with performance equal to or greater than a system with 32 Intel Itanium processors. The current version of the defense authorization act would lower that limit to systems deemed 'militarily critical' by the Department of Defense. That level is currently set to the equivalent of a computer using a Pentium 3 processor running at 650MHz, state of the art in 1999 but considered feeble today.  ---------------------------------------------------- Calculated threat  Even modest systems have use in researching weapons of mass destruction; experts estimate that the current export limit of 190,000 million theoretical operations per second (MTOPS) satisfies almost all of the Department of Defense's computing needs.

George Monbiot article on  urlLink The Guardian ,  urlLink  also at     US Christian fundamentalists are driving Bush's Middle East policy      In the 19th century, two immigrant preachers cobbled together a series of unrelated passages from the Bible to create what appears to be a consistent narrative: Jesus will return to Earth when certain preconditions have been met. The first of these was the establishment of a state of Israel. The next involves Israel's occupation of the rest of its 'biblical lands' (most of the Middle East), and the rebuilding of the Third Temple on the site now occupied by the Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa mosques.   Wait a minute, are they talking about construction of a temple in place of a mosque    The legions of the antichrist will then be deployed against Israel, and their war will lead to a final showdown in the valley of Armageddon. The Jews will either burn or convert to Christianity, and the Messiah will return to Earth.      The true believers are now seeking to bring all this about. This means staging confrontations at the old temple site (in 2000, three US Christians were deported for trying to blow up the mosques there), sponsoring Jewish settlements in the occupied territories, demanding ever more US support for Israel, and seeking to provoke a final battle with the Muslim world/Axis of Evil/United Nations/ European Union/France or whoever the legions of the antichrist turn out to be.          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
