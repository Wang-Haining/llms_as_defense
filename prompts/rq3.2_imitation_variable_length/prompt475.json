Liz? I can play guitar too? BAH HUMBUG. Anyway I'm trying to be a more quiet and less mean person. Although that may be quite impossible...ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE.  Number One on To-Do List: Get a tagboard up.   I think the band idea is good. Only if everyone is willing to commit. Then we gotta find a place and a time too. I think it will be fun...as long as everyone contributes. Wheehoo.   I take mardi to mean monday and mercredi to mean tuesday? what language is that, greek? (hahaha)  yes, friday! i shall take the liberty to post details! well we end school at 2 PM earliest...hoping nothing goes wrong with our progress reports AGAIN...we'll go to Suntec or Great World City (as they are more ulu places and we'll have more of the place to ourselves) to watch Shrek2, The Day After Tomorrow, Troy (again) or whatever movie that looks favourable. Okay? Can't wait.  And...I love that pic of us!! It's, wow, RECENT!! Hahahaha. Now everyone can see why we're the rectangular table of ladies. Plus I love the cups and the one ton of mee bowl there. HEEHEE.                 mood: terrible listening to: the silence in my room. for once without feeling any akwardness &nbsp; People, this is gonna be a hurtful post but theses are the things and feelings I've kept pent up inside myself for long enough. I cant put this at my blog because it is under CONSTANT scrutiny for posts like this. Finally I've found someone who's more in love with my computer than me! WOW! And what more who LOVES my email account more than me! Maybe it was an accident or maybe it was intentional. For all of you who don't know, I have this thing on my com where all you have to do to sign in on msn is to click on my add. So after her ROYAL HIGHNESS finished with her daily hogging of my computer, I found the msn signed in to MY account. Like ok... Some of you may think I'm being childish some of you may think I'm being immature but Im really tired. For 2 days I've been trying very hard but no, all I get is SILENCE. That's IT! I can't tell you all this in school nor do i think I can keep this in till next week without going mad. So here's it. all you guys have been seeing for the past few days is just a facade. Anyway I cant blame her for using my com so often coz maybe thats the only way for her to stay in touch with hong kong but yeah. She's extreamly homesick so someone give me some solutions. God, help me.&nbsp; Sorry guys if this looks like a private blog post but as i said, my blog is being visited EVERY other hour... Even when Im in the room. Like freaky. For more info on why i said that, go read my tag board. I'm too freaked to reply....                  mood:perfect 10 listening to:stewed beef haha.. i just a great inspiration to write an article abt the most happening stuff going on.. guess.. oh anw.. its the hunk array.. EURO2004!!!!  here goes: crazy abt euro2004 but the irony of me having the inability to catch any of the soccer mania. How frustrating!!! oh ofcourse i have to admit part of the desire of watching it is to fulfill every girl's satisfaction.  the HUNK APPETITE! hahaha... i mean, face it. a girl will always be a girl at heart. you see a suave-looking guy, u get a bit a tipsy. isn't true?? uless you're abnormal swooning over the wrong gender. oh don't u fid euro200 a reality show for choosing the most all rounded perfect model guy for choices of husband. awesome looks! deeeeep pockets for you enjoy the exqusite treasures and pleasures of the world (pls be reminded these articles are to taken lightly. Christian value: store our treasures in heaven not earth hor...) and lastly a stable income. if you're jobless, no fear. you have a huge bank acct behind you. and with your hubby's excellent soccer skills (i.e ronaldino), you don't have to further frown over your boy's future.  Just ask him to hone the skills from his father and wa-la u've produced a line a of superb soccer players. this applies for any marriage between you and a famous sport personnel hor... but euro2004 isn't only abt the hotties. it is also abt enjoying the thilling action and the intense anticipation of the heart-pounding football matches.  Once a striker is on fire, you start to slowly lift your butt of the couch and cheer and chant'goal goal goal' but usually 85% of the time its a false alarm.  Then let's say that Owen scores for England, the crowd automatically makes a joyful din. you'll hear things like' YES!' 'GOAL Ah!! or the most annoying ' YAY!! Money Come...' hahahaha.. don't you quite agree with me? especially the ah jeks, always say ' ai seh! sui sui sia!' 'hao qiu! da de hao! lai he jiu he jiu!' i have then termed euro2004 a hypertension-giver, heart-atacker-starter and a world of fantasies.  euro2004 makes people go boloney!! However i have to strongly reccomend euro2004. if u're looking for some good clean action-packed enjoyment, switch on the tv late at night tune to channel 5 and pumpthe adreline.  and a word of unholy advice, place your bets on any england germany and france and germany matches, they play well.  soak into the fever of euro2004 dears!!!  editor, cowwie         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
