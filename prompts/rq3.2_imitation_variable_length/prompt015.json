God I love the spanish/mexican one. &nbsp; It's interesting when you kindof already know something and when someone tells you something that others would see as crazy or immoral, you just accept it. It took a bit for me to actually have the opportunity to think about (ie; spin it around in my head a few times, exercise the idea etc etc). What only really annoyed me then was something different. &nbsp; It's cold, so I might go lie down for a while till I warm up or something. An early night more than likely. &nbsp; Mmmm, Thursday mum is working all day, but I have an appointment so god knows what I'll be doing. I want to rearange but alot of places have like, set times for people (ie; if you go thursday morning at 9:15, then you go every week at the same time, same day, for the rest of your relationship with said institution). &nbsp; Been listening to more of my sister's music. She took my laptop by mistake back to Melbourne. But it's really funny because she's using some of my pictures for avatars on msn. But some of them are completely out of context and look innocent :P &nbsp; So I guess, I shall end my post here.             Got to pick up my sister tmr, which means more driving practice. Brother's back at school.  I hate how queenslanders get it so easy when it comes to driving. They just need some practice then they can get their P's?  CRAZY  In Vic, we have to have 120 hours of driving practice, with an experienced driver always by our side. We then need to sit 3 tests. A written test, a virtual driving test and a real driving around test. If we pass, we get our P's. After 3 years on out P's (when we turn 21) we can have a full license. Before you say 'sooo simple', it's not. You can't drink any alcohol at all while on L's or P's. So that means no alcoholic trifles and what not. They're very strict too. You do anything wrong, you're off your L's/P's for at least 3 months and then have to resit the test.  It was really funny though, when I first got my L's, my dad pulled over and I got in the front and started going vroom vroom. I drove past a booze bus, and a few seconds later, dad piped up. 'Why have you got your parking lights on?' I'm just glad I didn't get pulled over :|            Actually.... forgettaboutit.  W0rd  I woke up at 2pm today. Everyone's already gone. Bro's at camp, Sister is in Brisbane, dad works full time, mum works half days. Actually, it's kinda cool, because it means I get 'easy' half days - no bullshit from anyone.  Just me and my computer, and mohaa and ts and I'm set.  Trin wants me to go check our Habbo Hotel again, I guess I will. It's kinda fun.  'Hey, you seem really nice.' 'Thx' 'Do you care to chat?' 'Ok, sure :)' etc etc  10 mins later  'Oh, geez, my friends are calling. It was good to meet you.' 'u 2'  /walks halfway across room and chats up another chick.  I kinda suck at chatting up chicks. I'm too polite and formal. It's been a long time since I've tried chatting up females, so I've kinda lost the skill. I guess I was in a hurry to, to try and show Will I could pick up more chicks than him :P I've noticed though that in Habbo Hotel, the chicks don't wait for you - they walk up and make convo. You just have to be there. Because females vastly outnumber males, I guess that's just the case.  Anywho  Me out.            I'm becoming something I hate, something I despise. I've always disliked the idea of being strict in the way of sexuality and personality.  However, I have discovered a side of people I hate. The side of not lying, however... not informing.  I have learnt from experience, that talking in a flirtatuous way is, for lack of a better word, wrong, if one of you is in a relationship. And I have also enlightened myself as to the ways of how I feel, and why. I hate the way I was. And yet around me I see reflections of the person I hate, the me of the past, in everyone else.  And I hate.  I grow to hate these people because they are me in a way. They are undoubtedly the forms of me I loathe with desperation.  I want to be free, to not feel jealous, to not feel angry and such over any form of relationship. I am not saying that I am jealous, I am saying I am angry.  I would know what I would do, for I have indeed done it, if another girl was standing over my partner (I dislike the word boyfriend) in a way that she was not welcome to. I did it to Sarah, just not in a physical way. And I'm glad I did it. I feel much better not knowing the people I was once intertwined with, are now with people I know. It's better to not know your previous partners' new partner.    \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
