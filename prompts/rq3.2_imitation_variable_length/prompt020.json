For the price of dignity, respect and again devouring each day with questions yet to be answered.Sometimes, things never change and it cannot be change because it is not meant to be change. Hmm...just realised that my relationship with him cannot work. Both of us are different, he is sarcastic,hot-tempered and an egoistic freak... which at times... i feel unbearable.He thinks that the world rotates around him. Respect has to be earned and my respect for him is lingering on the tip of my toe. I hate him...hate...hate just hate him... I used to think that I was the cause for the earlier break-uo, which I initiate by just emailing my thoughts and feelings. This time around, I sms him, which was short,sweet and rude I don't care. I don't really care what people feel or say about me. I do what I think is right. People who makes you feel that you're not special,aren't worth your time. These breed of people just pull you down flat to the ground...                   this week had been a busy week,then again its how you take it. Life is not a game...we are not in a race track whereby we have to take that kinda risk,its not a competition,its more of a soul searching journey...a long one. A decision making tingy.The right choice would make you feel right all the way...whereby, wrong choices are meant to learnt. Not to be repeated again...well I do repeat them especially if its due to the aching heart.Hmm...my brain cell would automatically shut down,and my heart takes control.eheheh....

Bet you ain't got much to say? But your gonna miss me when I'm not there You know I dont care, You know I dont care   As we beg and steal and borrow Life is hit and miss and this I Hope, I Think, I Know And if I hear the names you call If I stumble catch me when I fall Cos baby after all, You'll never forget my name          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
