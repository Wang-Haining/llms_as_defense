She lowered her altitude and spotted a man in a boat below. She shouted to him, “Excuse me, can you help me? I promised a friend I would meet him an hour ago, but I don’t know where I am.”  The man consulted his portable GPS and replied, “You’re in a hot air balloon approximately 30 feet above a ground elevation of 2346 feet above sea level. You are at 31 degrees, 14.97 minutes north latitude and 100 degrees, 49.09 minutes west longitude.”  She rolled her eyes and said, “You must be a Democrat.”  “I am,” replied the man. “How did you know?”  “Well,” answered the balloonist, “everything you told me is technically correct, but I have no idea what to do with your information, and I’m still lost. Frankly, you’ve not been much help to me.”  The man smiled and responded, “You must be a Republican.”  “I am,” replied the balloonist. “How did you know?”  “Well,” said the man, “you don’t know where you are or where you’re going. You’ve risen to where you are, due to a large quantity of hot air. You made a promise that you have no idea how to keep, and you expect me to solve your problem. You’re in exactly the same position you were in before we met but, somehow, now it’s my fault.”                     so tonight my brother and i spent the evening modifying safe and sane fireworks to make them a little more fun. we had a pretty big group go over to the kmart parking lot. good times... lighting off modified piccolo petes and a few special fireworks that todd brought.   jocelyn showed up tonight, and i'm now convinced that she knows everyone in the world... because this is the second time that ive run into her this summer in a random place (first time was at a soak city bonfire).  then all the sudden a car pulls up and stops. both doors opened at the same time (it was at this point that everyone mumbled something along the lines of 'oh shit..'). it was an unmarked buena park police car.  they started questioning ben, christina, and todd. ben said that all  he had were piccolo petes and mad dog fountains and boldly asked for his ID back (and it was true, that's all he had with him). so ben and christina came back to our group. but half hour latter, a freakin paddy wagon pulls up. police van with a steal cage in the back.. the works. they handcuffed todd and took him downtowm for fingerprinting and gave him a $1200 fine and a misdemeanor.  then josh and kyle followed the paddywagon to the station (where we found out that modifying legal fireworks is a felony) and the rest of us headed over to jocelyn's house to light off the rest of the fireworks before midnight and get some grub.  during this whole thing, i did snap a couple pics with my camera phone and i pulled out our bluish camera, which can take pictures better at night. phone picture is on the  urlLink photoblog . the other picture--the better one--will be posted later. also, here's  urlLink ben's blog , and i'm sure  urlLink john's blog  will have something by tomorrow.                     why people go to water parks on days like today is beyond me. it's cold, windy, and wet. but i guess its find by me since that's where the money for my paycheck comes from.  on weekends we have insane numbers of guards scheduled to work (you almost never get a weekend off and i heard that there were over 150 of us..with more being trained this weekend). so today, as usual--it being a weekend and all--there were lots of guards. but its cold. so theres not as many guests. on top of that, we had to shut down the river today. i guess it's a state law that if a dead animal is found in the water, you have to shut down the attraction for the day. today, a bird was found. so all the guards that would have been on the river.. were not on the river.  also, while i was at gremmie lagoon (little kid water playground), there was an AFR (accidental fecal release). we called a supervisor who came, confirmed it was uhh.. feces, and told us to clear the pool. so at one point, gremmie and the river were both shut down.  i must have the worst luck because i ended up in the crappiest places on the rotation. i did river twice (then the river got shutdown), then gremmie (which then go shut down, but promptly reopened) and fun house rover FOUR times--totalling probably over 3 and a half hours. the fun house is basically like a house full of different things that squirt, leak, or splash water. but the rover has to walk through the thing over and over again while kids try to get you wet--not so fun on a cold day. hehe. what i would give to have been put on the top of a slide today.  hopefully it'll be sunny tomorrow. :)                       xrunvincerunx    :     hi   btbraalclk  :    hello there    xrunvincerunx  :     just letting you know.. you may not see me around for a while   btbraalclk  :    why    btbraalclk  :    r u comminting suicide?

naw. it's not overkill.   one day earlier...   i had my 2nd in-n-out interview. this one was with the store manager (after my previous interview with the shift manager). he seemed to like me. i haven't gotten an answer yet, but he said that he was impressed with what i have done in my life at my age (perhaps he thinks i'm like 12 years old? haha) but anyway, he said that he'd keep my application at the top of the pile for when in-n-out hires and that he would give me a call by next friday.  now let's hope that this job doesn't kill me like  urlLink john ,  urlLink simon , and  urlLink erika  warned me that it might.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
