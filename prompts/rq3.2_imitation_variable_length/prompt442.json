I remember going to the wedding of a couple of my high school friends back in the late 80s or early 90s. While we were in high school, both he and she had spectacular musical taste. Thanks to the both of them—and a few other people—I listened to a great deal of what became known as 'alternative' music, and I was saved from the horror that was 80s radioplay music. So I expected some coolass tunes at their wedding reception.  I was sorely disappointed.  Some awful thing had happened to them during their college years, and their musical taste went in the toilet. I can't remember what exactly sent me over the edge at that reception, but I do remember that I was relieved when they played Bust A Move.  relieved. I'm thinking of this as I sit here listening to  urlLink Mix 94.5  (I will have to explain why I am listening to The Mix for those of you not  in the know  at another time because, as always, there's work to be done and this is merely a diversion. Let's just say I'm doing homework, okay?) thinking to myself, 'why, this Matchbox 20 song is pretty damn good.'   urlLink Matchbox 20 . sigh.   urlLink These guys  are growing on me too. someone please smack me out of this.     This morning I sat with my mom while she euthanized her oldest dog, Murphy.  We were a cat family when I was growing up. The dog came along after I had moved to San Francisco. He didn't meet me until he was almost a year old, but he knew me, I guess because family smells like family. Throughout his life, he never forgot one of us, no matter how far away we were or how little we visited. And when a couple of us brought new people into the family, he welcomed them as if he'd always known them too.  He lived a good long life, especially for a big dog. Chow/shepherd/lab mixes shouldn't live to be 14 without major medical problems, I guess. But Mr Murph was healthy until a month ago. When Mom took him in to get his teeth checked, they found cancer all over along with a rotten tooth. They warned us that it would be sooner rather than later, and it was. She insisted that she would not make him linger or suffer simply because we didn't want to let him go. We owed him that. And last week, when he started stumbling and slipping, and stopped eating, my mother knew it was time to send him on his way. She and I sat with him, and despite his lifelong fear of the vet, he went without a struggle. The vet shaved his leg to get to a vein, and while she was telling us what would happen, while she was injecting the blue liquid into his blood, he relaxed and relaxed and relaxed. and then it was over. So this is what I've learned about life and death these past couple of years, it is a simple as breathing. You breathe in and you breathe out. and no matter what circumstances push you toward it, the end is nothing more than not taking that next breath in.      Is there anything worse than a summer cold? I think not. I'm tired of coughing like a terminal smoker. I quit smoking, dammit. Not even the occasional barsmoke anymore. Considering the amount of cough syrup I've swigged over the last 72 hours, I think I deserve more than 3 hours of sleep without a coughing fit. But no, this is not to be. If you are my elderly and hard-of-hearing neighbor lady, I apologize. I hope your hearing deficiency is sparing you from my hacking.  Dave Eggers thinks that college students should be required to perform mandatory acts of  urlLink volunteerism  in order to receive their diplomas. When I read this, I wavered mightily between automatic loathing of his privilege (to which I am inordinately prone, despite the fact that his parents died tragically) and actually siding with him.  Would it be a good thing if everyone who went to university came out with a respect for public service in addition to  their finely honed academic skills? Sure. But when you make things like this mandatory, you have to build in exceptions. Why? Because there are people who actually need to work to get through school, as in full-time. Those people don't have a trust fund or an inheritance to draw from. Their free time, such as it is, is spent doing things like homework, studying, laundry, eating, and, heaven forbid, sleeping a couple hours a night. They might also be interested in a few extracurriculars, like the school lit magazine. They might be taking classes like painting or creative writing that require more than the requisite two hours a week for homework. If you add mandatory volunteerism on top of that, well, they might just have a mental breakdown before they finish their first semester (rather than later, say in the middle of their final semester, just before finals and graduation). Building in exceptions necessarily means that there will be a certain population of students who will use them spuriously, and these will not be the student for whom the exceptions were intended. No, they will be the very students of privilege, be they moneyed or simply the star athletes, who might benefit most from learning to give of themselves. Those who will end up being burdened by such policies will be, as usual, the put-upon middle class students, the ones who, unlike Mr. Eggers, are forced to find jobs immediately after school because the enormous student loans are coming due, the ones who also couldn't be choosy about the jobs that put them through school in the first place.  You know, this is all ironic because what I admire Eggers for is precisely his  urlLink volunteer work  and  urlLink  his ideas about the merging of visual culture, music,  and literature . His  urlLink  actual writing ? not so much.  I've been in a month-long battle about turning on the a/c in my apartment. If it's on, there's a constant level of white noise that makes my pre-tinnitus ears ring. If it's off, my apartment gets really sticky and my candy melts. sigh.  urlLink summertime . makes me miss winter.     Ok, I saw the movie  urlLink last weekend . It's just taken me a little while to post. As I was saying to my brother-in-law, The Marine, whether you agree with Michael Moore's politics or not, it's really important to see this movie.  Yes, it's biased. All documentaries are, so don't kid yourself. Documentarians make documentaries because they have a point of view to explore. They are not supposed to be unbiased, unlike, say, the  urlLink news .  There are things in this movie I did not know about, things that surprised me. These are things that should have been BLARING headlines, things like the fact that U.S Representatives formally objected to the certification of the 2000 election by Congress, and could not block it because not one U.S. Senator would sign their objection. Not one. Not  urlLink the current presumptive Democratic nominee for President . Not even my hero,  urlLink Russ Feingold . Moore also, finally, provides the answer to my  urlLink previous query  about the Saudis, and it's not a comforting answer. If you think MM is a tired whiny liberal blowhard clown, you still should see this movie. Don't want to give him the money? Fine,  urlLink download it  while you can. But see it. One of the things I learned long ago in a class about writing research papers is that you should know what your opposition thinks and what their arguments are. If nothing else, folks who think Bush is a fine choice in the November election should take a look. The most troubling thing for me about this movie is the obvious apathy of the Democratic Party. They don't exactly come off looing like a better choice. Of course, I've felt this way ever since the premature end of the Democractic primaries. Despite my fear of another four years of Bushy, I don't think that four years of  urlLink His Majesty JFK the Lessor  is going to be any better.  Anybody out there want to convince me? \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
