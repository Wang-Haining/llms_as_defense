At a minimum, institutions must:  - Appoint an individual or group to bear specific responsibility for GLB compliance.  - Identify risks to customer information and assess existing safeguards.  - Implement safeguards that are needed to fill any gaps.  - Monitor the effectiveness of all safeguards.  - Ensure service providers are capable of meeting GLB requirements.  - Adjust the organization's security program as necessary when circumstances change.

Although that's larger than the minute 376 bytes used by SQLSlammer, “the difference is really trivial,” Huger said.   Not only might such a worm spread faster than Slammer, its damage could significantly outweigh Slammer's damage, for it would have a much greater number of potential targets. The Windows Messenger Service vulnerability exists not just in enterprise machines -- as with Slammer -- but also countless home computers running Windows.                          urlLink Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-005  - Vulnerability in Virtual PC for Mac could lead to privilege elevation (835150) - Important - This one is pretty out there for the average sysadmin..    urlLink Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-006  - Vulnerability in the Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS) Could Allow Code Execution (830352) - Important - if you run WINS (still) you may want to take a peek at this...   urlLink   Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-007  - ASN.1 Vulnerability Could Allow Code Execution (828028) - Critical - This one is fun.  The vulnerability is caused by an unchecked buffer in the Microsoft ASN.1 Library, which could result in a buffer overflow.  An attacker who successfully exploited this buffer overflow vulnerability could execute code with system privileges on an affected system. The attacker could then take any action on the system, including installing programs, viewing data, changing data, deleting data, or creating new accounts with full privileges.  Because ASN.1 is a standard for many applications and devices, there are many potential attack vectors. To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must force a computer to decode malformed ASN.1 data. For example, when using authentication protocols based on ASN.1 it could be possible to construct a malformed authentication request that could expose this vulnerability.  Server systems are at greater risk than client computers because they are more likely to have a server process running that decodes ASN.1 data.  So basically, this is in *almost* every Windows system (not installed by default on WinNT), there is no workaround, there are a wide numbers of attack vectors (not like you could just block a port), and servers will most likely be hit easier than workstations.    Couple this with the IE update earlier this month (which breaks websites) and it looks like I'll have some overtime on my hands.  THANKS MICROSOFT!!!                         urlLink Computerworld | Internet Explorer carved up by zero-day hole : 'Two new vulnerabilities have been discovered in Internet Explorer which allow a complete bypass of security and provide system access to a computer, including the installation of files on someone's hard disk without their knowledge, through a single click.   In simple terms, the link uses an unknown vulnerability to open up a local Explorer help file -- ms-its:C:\\WINDOWS\\Help\\iexplore.chm::/iegetsrt.htm. It delays executing anything immediately but instead uses another unknown vulnerability to run another file which in turn runs some script. This script is then used to run more script. And finally that script is used to run an exploit that Microsoft Corp. has been aware of since August 2003 but hasn't patched.   That exploit -- Adodb.stream -- has not been viewed as particularly dangerous, since it only works when the file containing the code is present on the user's hard disk. The problem comes in the fact that the Help file initially opened is assumed to be safe since it is a local file and so has minimal security restrictions. '                       Here's a good hint:   Enable Account Management Auditing   Sometimes you want to know what is going on w/ your Active Directory at all times (who wouldn't right?). User lockouts, creations, deletions, etc. To get these events into your event logs, you must enable the Audit account management policy for both success and failure. Here's how:   1. Log into your domain controller.  2. Select Domain Controller Security Policy under Administrative Tools in the start menu.  3. Find your way through security settings, local policies, audit policy.  4. Enable Audit Account Management for success and failure.  5. Done.   Look out for these events in your event logs (or use a filter program, such as EventSentry).   624 - user account creation  642 - user account changed  630 - user account deleted  628 - user account password set  627 - user account password attempt  644 - user account locked out  642 - user account changed: account disabled  645 - computer account created  647 - computer account deleted  635 - local group created  639 - local group changed  638 - local group deleted  631 - global group created  641 - global group changed  634 - global group deleted   Many thanks to  urlLink Windows & .Net Magazine  for publishing such a great article on this.
