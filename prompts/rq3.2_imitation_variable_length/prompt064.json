I was telling her that I just take life as it comes to me, and I try not to let things get me down too much. I said that maybe it's because I have somewhat of a pessimistic view of life, so when things don't work out I get up and move on. I prepare myself for the worst, and then when it happens it doesn't hurt as badly. When I said that, she told me that had nothing to do with pessimism, but that I look on life realistically. Sure it's good to hope for the best, but in reality sometimes things don't work out - and that's ok.  It's almost like being a Christian: Pray as if it all depends on God (because it does), but work as if it all depends on you.                       It's funny how things work out sometimes.  I've been following Gmail for a while now, google's new email service. At the moment it's in beta mode, and is not publicly available. Well, I found out that another guy on the floor had managed to get an account somehow, so I asked him how it went. He told me that he had been referred by another friend who had gotten one through blogger.com, google-owned blogging service.  Well, if you are reading this than you know that I also have a blog through blogger.com. So I'm thinkin', hmm, I didn't get any offer like that. I told Telman that if he ever got a chance to refer someone, could he please refer me? He told me that he had already promised that to another friend if the chance presented itself. So I talked to Ben, the guy he had promised to refer, hoping to get somewhere in the string of referrals, with no idea if Gmail would even continue the referring process that long. Well, Ben already had someone else in line, so my hope was pretty much shot.  That was at lunch today. After lunch I came back to my room, went to the blogger homepage, and right there was an offer for me to sign up with Gmail. It said that because I was an active blogger I was being given this opportunity. I couldn't believe it. So I signed up, wondering if this was really happening. And now I have a Gmail account, so you can all write to me there!
