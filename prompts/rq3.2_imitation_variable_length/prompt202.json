I wish the in these things instead I had somewhere to place my feet on. They want to go foreward but the world is a scary place Compelled to do the right things all under my mask of my happy face. Everywhere I turn it seems to be my fall rocks, pits and perilous things Everything I wanted, purposely ingnoring my call All turning away, past the dark, where I will not go.   The sunshines, yet i see all blankness nothing more dramatic than the queesiness my sickness growing with every second of quickness nothing more saddening than my sadness. Times may come, and Times may go but I can never seen to reach that even persistant goal. More lessons to learn more lessons to teach. A pool of water stands in my way and that one person stands on the other side How I tried to get them to look my way, don't blame me, for theirsake, I tried.   Consistant noises and withering confidence everyone pulling my to and away from where I want to be. I'm everywhere at everyone's dispence Just so I can see the smiles I give happily. I know God enjoys my work, I've felt it on me some Trapped in this machine of wishing wells and superstitious actions along with the crazy things this world tells. although what I wanted isn't in my grasp I continue, for their sake to weep. Although they may be telling some off hand story I still cry while I count my sheep.   Into the Darkness, I venture alongside the slight film of light, trying not to lose my way A distant voice of confidence, helps me everyday Preparing me for the long and lonely ride.   They mean so much to me I only wish they knew Because when I was around them The sky was a different blue. But now, my sky is a turbulent black. And all seems to cover all of me. But I can't get off track Have to watch in front of me. Tried and true applications are no use here, I am only, left with nothingness and there is no possble excuse Venture on, Into the Darkness...
