  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic:\n\n             i recently purchased  urlLink ESPN NFL 2k5  for the xbox. in this version, you have the ability to play in a league of people online. i went to the website, found one that looked good, and requested to join. i should have known something was up when the reply came back from 'Pusha C' from atlanta. anyway, instead of immediately embracing me into his league, he started frontin' and give me mad drama. he may have thought i was five-O or something. nonetheless, he said, 'if you promise to play all your games, then i will let you in. aight.' so i replied 'aight' in return, and he let me in. i sign in to the league, and on the page is the Pusha C's message to the league:  'Welcome to the Dungeon Football League. We gonna start this bitch when everyone joins up. Stank on it.'  what the fuck does stank on it mean? it's like that no diggity thing all over again.  anyway, the point of this whole story, besides that i am going to let this guy win everytime i play him in fear of  urlLink Getting Served  something fierce B2K style, is that as dumb and ghetto as this dude sounds, i would put my money on that he is just as white sumbitch, just like the goofy buttfuck bastards pictured above. 'im sorry mommaaa.  i didn't choose this life bitch, this life chose me.  only god can judge me now, ughhhhhh.' oh well, at least i didn't get tangled with a poopy christian. stank on it, bitches.                         Since this is entry # 1, and mostly because I couldn’t decide which celebrity was the biggest dipshit, I decided to enrich your day with two dumb-fucks, two of my favorites: Paris Hilton and Lindsey Lohan.  I know we were all shocked about the Paris &amp; Nick break up, and as tragic as it may sound, they did get tattooed together three weeks prior to the break up. But it’s ok, it was “true love”…Here is Paris’ earth-shattering revelation about her relationship:      'I was getting my makeup done [for a photo shoot], and it just hit me: I love Nick, but I need time alone. I called my psychic, and I asked her opinion. She thought I should be alone, and I agreed with her.'    The no-doubt 500$ an hour bullshitter strikes again. But don’t worry, Paris rushed out to the nearest Kaballah to get her red string bracelet so she’ll be back to whoring around in no time. PS. I hear your local Target now carries the red string bracelets in case you, too, should find yourself in emotional turmoil.     And onto the very mature, very wise, newly turned 'adult' Lindsey Lohan. When asked why she was not going to vote in this year’s Presidential election she replies:    “…if you say you're a Democrat, that'll turn off Republicans, and that's half of your fan base.'    Honey, the last time I checked, your fan base included pre-teens and pedophiles and guess what, they don't vote. And speaking of retarded, the retards are mad at her for saying retarded. Guess they won’t be reading this blog anymore.                         bacon beeots is now open for business. some may enjoy this blog, and others may not. and i could give a fuck. you see, on my way to work, with a frappacino in my hand, with a detriot pistons jacket, yankees hat, and new england patriot zubaz pants on, while listening to coldplay on my iPod, i released that there was still room on this bandwagon for one more trend that i just don't quite understand why its so popular, but i do it anyway, fearing that i'm not going to get laid anymore if my girlfriend finds out that i don't have a blog, thereby making me a wanksta. and i just can't handle that. so, you can expect to find me talking shit, never talking nice, about anything and everything, mostly current events and other various social phenomena that i observe. wow, this sounds so much different than every other dipshit blog out there. and if it weren't so late in the workday on a friday afternoon, i would dig into my first topic of talking about the big football headed bitch Brandy and her new engagement. but maybe next time, bitches..... and yes, that is a picture of me above.          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
