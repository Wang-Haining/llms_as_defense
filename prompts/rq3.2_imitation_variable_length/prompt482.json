Erm well yeah, yesterday, nothin was happenin until went 2 the park n met jack n jay n jess was there wiv andy large n sum ova lad; jst a sit off there talkin bout how times are changin. Then went footy&nbsp;trainin last night, and even though its a risk of bein big headed n arrogant, i was possibly the best player ther&nbsp;last night. Sorry. One of the blokes even sed that ill b in their team next year cos im better than most of the blokes in there. Shocked n well chuffed, if not aroused lol, messinnnn. Erm well that was all really, watched face off which is quite the film. Then went 2 sleep the wrong end of my bed lol. Had sum mad dreams last night as well, like re-doin me history exam n leavin the room str8 away 2 go 2 a cafe n av sum food wiv the likes of ben and chip. Then went bk, wrote '1)' on the page then ran out claiming i was gna b sick wen really i jst went n sat off in the toillettes. Then on return the exam finished with me still only aving written '1)' Thats all i memba. Anyway, BEACH SOOOON! lol, frisbeeville. But nt sure if i can b bothered tryin 4 the plan, jst wait n see what happens. Later                  Howdy, i did try 2 blog last nite after the partay but it fucked me with an elephant's trunk n didnt publish. Well, once again, jst the party ill chat bout. Went to Helen's parents silver weddin anniversary partaaayyyy last nite n it was quite the night. Had downed 3 bottles of stella b4 the party had even got goin, like it was nothin. Later on, around.... 9/10 it started reeeally goin. Stuff started 2 happen. I was innocently havin a piss, wen sum fella walked up 2 me n asked wer im from, then asked if i had any drugs on me. Hmmm, randomheiner. Well then yeah, went bk out and tom was now leathered. Erm, time flew by and b4 we knew it, i missed it 1st time, but tom was gettin in2 nikki, helens sistr, iye iye iye. I then gt in2 cheryl, a fairly nice girl but u no. First time i gt in2 sum1 since the ex actually. Cool. By the end of the night, tom was cained, i was, as my dad sed, 'merry'. Came in had a chat with me dad bout me drinkin lol, n he offered me advice and the a san miguel lol, which was drunk 2day. Then 2day, not that much happened. I fully apologise 2 every1 over my sledging comments, out of order, and ill b myself 2moro, im bein quite dick head-esque lately. Apart frm at the party, weri thought i was in my element, lotsa ppl, n me talkin. My element previously bein a football pitch, and will b again come september. Need 2 regain my fitness again soon tho, im about as fit as a fuckin smack fiend. 2nite, only sat off, n played bit of footy tennis with jay, yes i lost... okok, i gt absolutely hammered. Not much planned 4 2moro, so dnt expect too interestin a blog. Ah shut up, less of the moanin. Cry Me a River...  Which is btw the song im listenin 2... Later                  Mornin, its a hard knock life, for me. Today, had general studies n key skills introduction n talk, and the had games. Had beast of a game of hand head ball, in which, Richie and myself carried our team, Tom gt kneed in the balls, and we saw.... him, prancing about like a fat ballerina. Rough game, i recieved many a bruise, and gave many to those around me. Brilliant when a game like that becomes competitive cos it gets so violent. Then 2nite, finally came out (thanks jay) and had a chat with the old skool crew including Colley and Courtney. Colley then left with Courtney due to unforseen circumstances. Then I recieved a tackle straight outta the Division THREE handbook (thanks jay... ho) and tore me kex, which led to the tearing of my flesh. Lots of blood, and banged my ear on the railing, which hurt more. Delivered a few blows to jays kidneys and general torso. Then came in n spoke 2 lu, which is always nice. She's nt goin with 'El Cocko' now, it was Danny that changed her name 2 Louisa hearts Danny. Anyway, best go shower, I'm hot lol.
