Ok... so I may use them for a boring  purpose... to make teaching materials, but some are fun in their own right. A  few years ago, I started using  E-mode &nbsp;to get ideas... I think everyone  REALLY needs to know which breed of dog they are (Can it really be possible that  I am a chihuahua?) And as for me, I am glad to know that if I were an umbrella  drink, I would be a daquairi! I also found out that I am right brained, my true  color is green (but the color of my aura is orange). My strongest Chakra is the  5th one (that&nbsp;governing truth and honesty).&nbsp;In my past life, I was a  dog named Scooter living in Iowa.My best quality is my independence...&nbsp;and  the INKBLOT test reveals my subconscious mind is driven by  curiosity.      &nbsp;    However, E-mode has CHANGED! This is very sad  because now it's focus appears not to be&nbsp;on providing quizzes for  the&nbsp;Egoist looking for ways to waste time, but&nbsp;on running an on-line  match-making service and on making money. A couple years ago, all these tests  were free... even the&nbsp;more rigorous ones (like the Briggs Myers inspired  ones etc). Now you only get the initial result free and have to pay for the  details... Paying for the results&nbsp;might seem to&nbsp;indicate that one  takes the results a little too seriously! So&nbsp; now I am on the lookout for  new quiz sites.       &nbsp;    Quizilla is the one I checked out today! I tried a  test to find out which movie I belong in... The surprise is that it is a movie I have  never even seen. But glad to know Jack's creative world fits my curiosity and imagination.       &nbsp;       Nightmare Before Christmas!    urlLink   What movie Do you Belong in?(many different outcomes!)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla   This site is okay, but I am going to keep looking  as I would like to find one that is a little slicker and has fewer typos. I  realize this&nbsp;reveals insidious things&nbsp;about my personality, but I  don't care. Anyway, if anyone can reccommend a god quiz site, please post a  comment. Thanks.            \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
