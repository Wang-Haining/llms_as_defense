K says: hows cape breton  Foxy Roxy says: awesome I went jigging for mackrel today  Foxy Roxy says: haha  K says: I totally used to jig withmy grandadthats cool you catch much  Foxy Roxy says: yeah like 12  Foxy Roxy says: I saw a ground shark  Foxy Roxy says: like 25 feet long under the boat  K says: seriously, that's crazy  Foxy Roxy says: yeah you know how I feel about sharks  K says: too bad you don'tike fish you could have had quoite the feed  Foxy Roxy says: yeah I know  K says: did you freak out when you saw the shark?

But seriously, fuck off and suck it up,&nbsp;that's your job.     &nbsp;   If I wanted to deal with all that shit I wouldn't smoke myself into a fucking coma every night before I go to bed. I know practical jokes are all the rage now but I don't appreciate getting punked every time I close my eyes.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   I didn't want to have to threaten you but you leave me no choice.     &nbsp;   Mutherfucker, I got a half ounce of Salvia and I'm not afraid to use it. I'll burn my brain down with psychadelic recklessness and you'll have no&nbsp;place to live.     &nbsp;   So be warned. The next shit I see in my&nbsp;dreams better&nbsp;either be surf, girls who aren't my ex-girlfriend or better yet, nothing except peaceful&nbsp; emptiness.     &nbsp;   Know your role fucker and play it,     &nbsp;   K.     &nbsp;                     Hi, my name's K. and I write bad.       Not bad in the  Michael-Jackson-that-really-means-good sense, just plain bad.       Here's the latest and the worst: a shout out to my favorite war-time, freedom-loving, enemy-of-freedom hating, ex-alcoholic pimp daddy of a president: George Bush (aka: DJ little nuts, DJ Black gold, Big Tex,  DJ trim my Bush, DJ warcrime)       Right now I feel like my flow is heaven sent/    Drinkin' like an illegitimate President/    Before he found god and stole the presidency/    When Dubya stilled fucked with the blow and Hennessey/      This neo-con bullshit is makin' me sick/    Body bags get zipped while politicians get rich/    Billions of dollars ends thousands of  lives/   So how can the means be justified/     Who are the evil-doers? seriously?/ You drop bombs on civilians from 15 thousand feet/ The poor are free to live sleep outside at night/   And Guantanamo is still  locked up tight    Foreign policy got you talkin’ ‘bout spreading democracy/ While you govern America like a fucking Christian theocracy/ You’re a revisionist missionary and Cheyney’s deranged/ You’re a puppet caught up in a game you can’t change/    Meanwhile in the mountains near Pakistan/ Osama’s like, “damn, I’m still the man”/ “I got weapons from the States and cash from Iran”/ “and a beef with anybody reppin‘ Uncle Sam”/      WORD.      K.                   'At a point in every person's life, one has to look deeply into the mirror of one's soul and decide one's unique truth in the world, not as we may want to see it or hope to see it, but as it is.'  - James E. McGreevey (governor of New Jersey)  It's truly amazing when someone speaks a complete truth so succinctly. This guy is talking about coming out of the closet but it speaks to such a basic, yet unacknowledged truth.  Think about this shit, what is your truth in the world? I'm trying to figure out mine but my actions are totally determined by the expectations of whatever situation I'm in.  At work I'm witty, efficient, smart and professional.  When I'm with my friends I say shit like 'what up nigga, you wanna' get this green.'  When I'm traveling I can spend a month with only a book bag full of clothes and my surfboard.  When I'm in Halifax I worry about what golf shirt to wear.  I can be outwardly confident and a wreck inside.  I've done horrible shit, shit I won't even talk about when I'm trying to come off as the cool, crazy guy.  It's time to look in the mirror and find my unique truth.  But what really scares me is maybe my schitzo personality and approach to life is my truth and if my success is due to this psychotic versatility then it's all good but it's also all fake.  ?           \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
