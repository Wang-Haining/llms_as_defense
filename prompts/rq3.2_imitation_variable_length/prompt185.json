Strangew enough, I know, but it just gets weirder from there.  THe book has these really high quality photographs of strange japanese foods that Mr. Anthony has tried or encountered, along with a little blurb about how he came into contact with it.  The only one I remember was taco soup (influenced by  urlLink lauren 's experience with urlLink  taco salad ).  The picture was this bowl of soup with a dark colored broth, and this giant white octopus, with its tentacles flailing out of the bowl (it was still alive, apparantly).  Piers wrote that he, much like in lauren's story, had ordered taco soup, because it sounded interesting, and was very surprised to be served a live octopus soup.  I know, strange enough, but it gets weirder. I was then suddenly in a japanese resturant staffed entirely by young americans (in Japan).  there was this big bin in the middle of the place that had all these different types of live birds in it, all categorized by type (pigeons all together in one section, parakeets in another, sparrows in another, and so on).  I asked a guy if the birds were bread to be unable to fly or if they had their wings clipped, and he told me they were clipped.  These birds were killed and cooked to order, one of the waitstaff would pick one up from time to time and snap its neck, and send it off to the kitchen.   Strange enough, but it gets wierder.  There were also these dogs running around the place, like pets with collars and names and stuff.  This one dog had long tufts of hair on his ears, and one of the waiters was cutting the hair and talking to the dog in a singsongy voice, 'you won't be running away anymore, will you? Will you?  No you won't!'  (apparently the fur on the dog's ears worked like the flight feathers on the birds).  It came time to kill one of the dogs for a meal, and all the waitstaff gathered around this dog named Rico while a blonde girl spoon fed Rico some poison, and told Rico she was sorry.  Someone took Rico's collar off.  then, thankfully, I woke up.            Recently, some of  urlLink you  have been bemoaning the single girl's dining options.  You said to me, 'Steve, I like cooking, and I like eating, and all that, but it's so hard to cook just for one, couldn't there be some sort of eating or dining club for people like me?  You're so dreamy, can't you help me come up with some sort of solution? Thanks a lot, Hungry in Harvard Square.'  Well HIHS, I am  urlLink dreamy . And of course I can help you. Of course, you could start an eating or cooking club if you wanted to, but you've already stumbled upon that option.  And diffrent schedules can make finding a common mealtime a chore rather than a joy.  Besides, sometimes you just don't want to watch other people eat, not to mention the bothersome talking.  But that doesn't mean you have to eat poorly.  There's a new cookbook written just for you:  urlLink Solo Suppers .  You can buy it and other wonderful titles from  urlLink Wordsworth  and NOT from other multinational online booksmellers named after certain jungles.   You should be able to cook tasty and easy meals just for one.  While you're at it, why not open a bottle of wine just for you; you're worth it.  Maybe you can even get lucky with yourself.    Have a question? Need advice? Want a children's book recommendation? email  urlLink Dreamy Steve . for answers to all your questions.            So on my way to campus this morning, I took what I thought were two subway tokens with me.  I found out after depositing one of my coins into the subway-turnstile-coin-taking-thing, that really, one of them was a quarter.  So, a little upset that I just lost a quarter, I deposited my token and went to campus.  Once I finally got to the gym, I found out that all the rental lockers are full.  I spotted pay lockers (different from the rental ones) thak take a quarter to work.  My mind raced back to the quarter i had lost this morning (i realize that i didn't mean to bring the quarter in the first place, but had I deposited my actual token instead of the quarter, i might have found that quarter in my time of need.  Already cold and grumbling from my excursion to the bursar's office, i happened to look down on the ground, and there is a shiny quarter at my feet, like the universe put it there just for me, following some conservation of lost quarters law.  and the best part is, that after my workout, I found out that the lockers give you the quarter back when you return the key!!            For those who have been wondering, I have been away from a working computer for a week or so.  Spring Break '04 rocked!   when I was 18-22, spring break meant a road trip from maine to florida in a) a 1980 chevy impala with a rusted out hood, a leaky transmission, and an exhaust that would come loose from its moorings 40 miles outside of Richmond b) The Urban Assault Vehicle (a.k.a. The Hamborghini) c) Eesh's Ferrari 4-runner.  This road trip involved lots of peeing into cups and bottles (my favorite was always the empty Tide bottles we would pick up from the Hippie's house in VA; the residue from the laundry detergent had a nice way of neutralizing the smell), flirting with carloads of women by asking them if they 'want a cookie?!', watching Bill Bush flex on Daytona beach, Watching Bill Bush flex in Savannah Georgia, watching Bill Bush flex in Key West FL, eating peel and eat shrimp with the waitress of a bar during the 8 am-noon happy hour that would kick off a legendary fat day with Eesh and Mac, and a lot of other stuff I am leaving out or have forgotten.   This year spring break meant actually doing the homework that had been assigned over the break, going to NYC with my girl, (where we upheld the spring break fat-day tradition of spending an entire day either eating, drinking, or being on our way to either eating or drinking) hanging out in brookline, doing some laundry, and sleeping a lot.   But the spring break topic gives me the opportunity to let you in on my brother's million dollar idea.  You know how they have those girls gone wild spring break videos?  well his idea is a guys only version called Guys Gone Nuts, where the camera runs around asking guys to 'show us you're nuts!'             That's a dumb question.  Lots of people wear ties on a daily basis.  But today, I was going to a job interview for a part tim nonprofit gig.  I know that nonprofits are less dressy than profits, so decided to go without the suit, and wear a shirt and tie instead (yes, Shukie, i was wearing pants too).  But oops! in my haste packing for my trip here from Philly, i forgot to pack ties.  I'll stop in at the gap and get a tie on my way.   -Do you sell ties. -No, I don't.  Try Urban Outfitters. so i figured, I'd just go without the tie.  When I got off the bus, I realized that my chronic paranoia about being late for anything had made me almost an hour early for this interview.  And that the bus let me off directly accross from the Big K Mart at the Brighton Mills mall.  Ah!  They must sell ties there. Belts. Suspenders. Wallets. Silk Boxers. no ties.   -Excuse me, do you have any men's ties in stock? -yes. -do you know where they are located? -in the men's section. -but do you know where in the section; i couldn't find them. -did you look in the corner, by the belts? -yes. -then we must not have any in stock. -thank you, you've been very unhelpful.      \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
