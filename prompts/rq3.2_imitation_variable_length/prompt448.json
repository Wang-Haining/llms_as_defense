I finally got to see Kari! yay! anyways, then me and bean went to bob's out in howell and i got to ride my baby! the damn electric start was acting up so i had to kick start it. i coulldnt touch the ground! grrr then it kept bogging out on me and we had to use electrical tape on the tail-light cuz rick broke it. it was fun after all that though cuz i got to open it up out in the field. it only got up to 75 though cuz the field is too small. Bean was riding the 80 and she wiped out. it was funny as hell! i got to catch some of the bmx competition for X Games X but i didnt see much. they had some sick moves. 2 of them tied for 2nd with 88.00. . . . .okay enough about that stuff. im babysitting  right now and then i got to go get my dads house set up for whit's party.  ITS TOMMORROW!  i got her a carebear cake (HA) my birthday is almost here!!! woot woot! if ya'll wanna buy me a present you can.  *big grin*  i like cd's a lot. or money. . . .that's cool too. Last night i was talking to cameron and i was telling him i put a hex on him (although i didnt) and he was trying to scare me. he told me one of them cut his arm. yeah, uh-huh.  Ya know, i dont think kari realy likes me anymore. i called her and she wasnt really into talking to me. usually she tells me all about wherever she went. Of course bean filled me in. lord that girl annoys the sin out of me. thats why im having this party so i can see all of my friends again. Kari if youre reading this i love you. lol well i better go. shane is freaking out. talk to ya'll when i get a chance                               CharLiE              Oh my god i had so much fun camping! we went up to River Ridge Campground&nbsp;in Breckenridge. The campgrounded  SUCKED!  lol yeah we had a toilet-paper fight up at the bathrooms at 2 am. That was Me, Rick, Caleb, and Mike. Caleb got nailed in the face. Rick tried tackling me so i bit him on the shoulder. The he bit me back again. Caleb was peeking on me in the shower (or  TRYING  to anyways) Me and Rick aren't   'technically'   dating but we kinda are. lol anyways, yesterday we got in a water fight up at the park and Caleb and Jake ended up getting kicked outta the park!! the managers are fucking retarded! they told us we had to have it at the park but then they said we couldnt and they ended up booting caleb and his bro. then we went up to the bathrooms and had another toilet-paper fight. They kicked Caleb out again. that was fucking hilarious! me and rick had to share a tent. Oh dont worry, i wasn't complaining at  ALL  about it. i had fun. *wink wink* I tried getting rick to go skinny dipping in the pond with me but it was too cold for him. awww poor baby! that damn shithead (rick) deflated my airmatress so that i&nbsp;would have to share his.&nbsp;pathetic. . . .    &nbsp;  i got a new dirtbike two days ago. well its not new its ricks old one. It's a Yamaha TW 200. I cant even touch the ground on the damn thing. We took em up onto the Gladwin Trailhead and rode. Nuttin but whoops and soft sand. That was a really rough trail. and my damn bike kept stalling everytime i downshifted. Then bob's clutch broke so we had to go back. Rick got on my lil bro's PW 80 and crashed it going up a sand hill. i was laughing my ass off. Moron. . . We were pulling the bikes off the trailer and rick tripped and dropped the bike, breaking the right blinker in the back. oh well. . .im making him fix it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyways, i miss my kari so much! i've only got to see her 3 times all summer!
