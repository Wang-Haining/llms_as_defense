I was trying to let debbie be recognized for a bit by not ruining her spotlight at the top of my blog.  but her time is up.  apologies to all. Today, we go to Door County.  Royina is with childhood home friend who has a cabin there.  It is toit.  I was going to rent 'Zoolander' for the ride up, but I would feel very unproductive to not utilize the drive as reading time.  So it's back to 'Dune' I go.  Or perhaps I'll finish Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.  Or Tuesdays With Morrie. Or Fahrenheit 451.  Or The Thief Lord. Or The Known World.  As you can see, I'm not one to finish literature. Moving on, I assume that we're going to go to Al Johnson's, the Swedish hut restaurant out on the tip of Door County.  I dislike it, but of course, I'm not the majority.  The hostesses wear Bavarian-esque dresses and clogs.  Kind of like Pippi Longstocking.  Except Pippi was a child who wore Scandanavian-like dresses.  These are real people.  I find it humorous, atleast.  And, what would a Bavarian-Scandanavian-Swedish-American hut restaurant be without Bavarian-Scandanavian-Swedish-American goats on it's grassy roof?  How very classique.  I have so seen people just watch the goats eat the grass--the epitomy of great entertainment.  Chomp that sod! Chomp that sod!  I'll have to blog tonight.
