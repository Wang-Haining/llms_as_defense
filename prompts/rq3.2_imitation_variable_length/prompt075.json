I got hit too, fucking paintball went through a hole in the screen and got my back so&nbsp; i whiped it off on Clint. When I got there this guy Lance kept hitting on me and asked Clint how he knew me and he said g/f so I came in and said EX g/f as Allen went ooooooooooooooh! lol It was cool watching, there was a team of like 13 year olds named G SPOT lol. So me and this guy Lance kept talking, he goes to St. Bonie's and has like a 1,500 gun...why do boys do that? He was sweet and all but not my type, but he had the characteristics that Clint was definately missing. Allen and I are like brother and sister so when we yell or call eachother names we're just joking but sometimes it gets out of hand and Clint never like stand up for me even if its with his other friends and this guy Lance jumped in and was all sweet about it and told Allen to just chill..as Clint stands there looking at the&nbsp;dirt like&nbsp;there's fucking  gold hidden in it lol WHAT THE HELL! But yeah Jessie showed up to watch Allen, glad she came cause I felt kinda awkward being there. Right after Jessie left I did too and as I pulled out the dude Lance liek trew himself up on my window so I rolled it down and he was like, heeeey you missed my last game I kicked ass and we won..so I was like oh sorry maybe next time. He mentioned me going paintballing with him and Allen next weekend so I said ok and when he asked for my number I gave it to him..CAN ANYONE GUESS WHERE CLINT WAS LOOKING AT THE TIME???? If you guess the ground..YOU'RE FUCKING RIGHT! Once I left Allen told me the guy was acting like I gave him my number cause I dug him but I don't lol. Then Clint called and mentioned going out to talk n such so we ended up going bowling. Course we didn't talk cause we have issues like that..the people that work there put us right next to them so as they got strikes we got gutter balls n all lol. I won both games by the way. Then as we were about to leave Clint kept messin with the buttons and said the screen woulding work, and then he told me to look up at the tv thing and it said somethin like 'please, I want another chance,' and he went into this speech about us being together forever annnnnd of course I broke lol and kissed him and said I'd go back with him. It was a fun day but I got totally sunburned all around my neck and chest..and it's a gay sunburn not in places where it'd make me tan and look good for a tank top noo lol, oh and my neck has the tanline of my Tiffany necklace...looks totally gay lol. OH and I got to see Savannah a few times, she's adorable as always, she bought one of those kermit crabs at the mall with a pink painted shell lol, she leaves at like 4 in the morning or somethin...Mom and dad decided to be bitches to me today, everything I did or didn't do for my dad was wrong..and everytime I even mentioned what my dad did to upset me she'd go into the whole 'well why don't you live with me..that ass took you away from me blah blah blah' everything to pretty much depress me, so THANK YOU             So the other day it was the fourth of july..had a pretty good time. hung out with clint for a few hours and just talked and walked around, then allen and zack came over so we all went over to jessie's and hung out..we all hopped into allen's car and almost every fucking road is not possible to use and we almost got in a car accident (good job allen) we chilled at clint's and went to go get some food, jessie and allen took the car, clint, zack and i walked and the firework show started goin off so we went up on clint's roof and sat up there and watched it. it was pretty cool, we were thinkin about shootin paintballs at people with shitty fireworks..which was everyone around clints house lol. after it was over we watched jeepers creepers...never think of that song in the same way again lol, then later on jessie and i went to sleep downstairs but jessie lagged so it was just me...and of course i start hearing noises, usually i dont get all weirded out but i did so, yea no sleep for me lol. but i woke up to clint layin by me which was good to wake up to and late ron went home. all in all good time..OH just got back from my last drivers..lesson thing, now i feel like theres no possible way im gonna pass the driving test in oxnard, driving through the fucking ghetto lol..WISH ME LUCK            hmm lots to tell. yesterday my dad went out of town so i had the house to myself and i thought why not have clint stay the night. so he told his mom he'd stay at zacks then i picked him up and came back to my house. i remembered i had a shitload of popov left and i was like, well we gotta get rid of it, so him and i basically split half a bottle of popov...yuck. clint saw all these leftover fireworks and wanted to take the sparklers to the beach and we were already drunk(obviously) so once we got there we lit em and i ran around and i hit the water and freaked out lol and clints just standing there with the sparklers burning him lol. so we came back, drank more then watched 13, at that point i don't remember anthing else. we stayed in the guest bedroom since the beds huge and i was ready  to pass out but clint wasn't and we got in this deep convo and i ended up crying telling him everything about my life and how it sucked, why i started cutting..everything and then he started crying to and i felt bad. then somewhere down the line i wake up and its barely light outside and clints just laying there looking at me and he was like, lets go watch cartoons lol so i got up and nothing was on but then we found THE GOONIES, and this is where i get way fuckin sick. from 6 30 till now 9 30 i have been doing nothing but fucking throwing up, and i NEVER get sick i'm the one that's not sposed too huh Carlye lol. so now i'm gonna go lay down, doubt it'll help cause i'm usually not that lucky, clint if you see this i'm really sorry lol last night got dramatic and this morning...well yea lol love you             ok soo, yesterday i talked to sam, her babys due in like a week....she's only 16 imagine the pain. we talked for like an hour about school and jillian(if you see this..FUCK YOU AND YOUR SORRY ALBINO ASS YOU. ARE. NOT. BLACK!) so yeah anywho, carlye finally went back home after days and days of partying, it was fun. that guy lance from paintball wont stop stalking me, he calls me on 3 different numbers now and realized he can text to..need a new phone and number or somethin.OH so yeah yesterday i went to mc donalds cause I'm cool like that and i was just startin to go over the bridge and these guys in thsi durango or somethin kept tryin to talk to me but ya know..windows are tinted and THEY themselves don't even realize that lol and i have my sunglasses on so they can't even tell i'm looking at them so they swerved a lil closer to get my attention, so i looked over, laughed, and sped up behind this shitty car at a red light and i realize this huge red truck like tailgatin me and then they go next to me in the next lane and i look over and this chick driving is giving me a dirty look and they guys like flippin out at me yet..both of our windows are up and my music is kinda loud, so i looked up to the shitty car again and turned my music even louder. light turns green the car infront of them speeds up but noooo they have to drive right along side of me, i didnt even bother to look but at the corner of my eye i could see the red car. so i'm almost home and i'm still behind this piece of shit car lol but no ones infront of them yet they stop next to me yet AGAIN, so once the light turned green the piece of shit car went over into their lane and i sped up like 90 and they stayed behind...for a good 5 seconds then they came into my lane and zoomed up to me and i slowed down a lot and right when i was about to turn and they were behind me i flipped them off and they honked as they went by. i STILL don't know what i could have done to even piss them off that damn bad but w/e....people just hate me cause i'm drivin a mercedes benz and their ass is stuck in a piece of shit like the one i had to follow practically all the way home HA! oh yeah and nice 'get together at clint's house on sat' his mom's gonna be out at her bfs..VOPOP!!     \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
