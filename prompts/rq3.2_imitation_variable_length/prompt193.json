How could I forget that, my parents have only been shoving it down my&nbsp;throat for the past 3 weeks. I had a talk with my mom this morning and told her that I'm not sure if I'm ready to work and do school. It's my Senior year and my grades last year weren't very good at all and so I want to really concentrate on doing good this year. On one hand it'd be good to do co. op. it shows responsibilty and Id get out of school early and get home earlier from work than I would if I went to school the whole day. Then on the other hand, I would have a lot more spare time than I would if I had a job. I just don't know. Im just so torn on what the right thing to do is. I should just face the music and get a job but on the other hand I don't know if Im ready for it. I just dont know what to do. Agh. Someone advice please, although no one ever comments. I just want to do the right thing but I just don't know if it's what I want. However...if I want to do the right thing, maybe the right thing is doing what I want and not what my parents want.     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   On a lighter note and a happier note, Alex is coming over tomorrow and practicing with Brian! Im glad, I hope that they work on some stuff and maybe we can go looking for people to be in a band. I mean if we don't look...how else will we find people. Just waiting for people to come to you is just taking too long, I mean look how long it took us to find Alex.                                                  Last night one of the best things happen, oh by the way, listening to Marilyn Manson (Antichirst Superstar)so that helps the mood. Brian finally ended his friendship with Tashia, she is finally out of our lives! See if you don't know the whole story then you won't get it, but wrapped up in a nutshell she tried to take Brian away from me and she was in his band as well, but now she's not and he ended their friendship so now we will never have to asociate with her again! Yay! Life is good! Anyways. Im going to dye my hair purple today! Im excited, I just hope that it looks good. I don't want it to come out crappy. This Saturday Im leaving for Colorado for a week. Ahhh, Im going to miss Brian so much!!! Im going to cry, I don't want to leave. I've never been a week away from him. The most was like 2 days, and that was torture. I don't know what I'll do *sadness* Holy Shit is it cold in here. Im freezing. I keep putting off doing the dishes. I guess I must do them...they call to me.                                        You cant trust anyone anymore. I hate everyone in this stupid world. Just piss off. I cant trust anyone anymore, except my soulmate. Even my best friend fucked me over. Stupid bitch. What the hell. She turned to drugs. Just like everyone else in this world. She's just another stupid poser who doesnt know who they are and never will and blame all their problems on others before realizing half the problem comes from the inside but their to lazy to fix it. Theyre all the same. Everytime I go to trust someone or care for them they just fuck me over. Why bother. She doesnt care about our friendship. She only cares about making her problems disappear with weed. Gee..what an intelligent thing to do. Turn to drugs to be happy. Whats the point of living if you have to have drugs to make it happy? Im joining the DTA club, The Dont Trust Anyone Club. Im so angry. Fucking hell. I just want to throw things and burn things. People seriously PISS ME OFF. I hate them all. Theyre all fucking pricks. DIE. ALL OF YOU. I just want to cry and cry. I never wanted to lose someone that meant so much to me. Screw it all. I hate you I hate you I hate you. You say you dont want to be like your dad, a drunk, so you dont drink. But yet you still get messed up with a drug. Its the same fucking thing. Youre a hypocrite. I dont care anymore. Just leave me alone. I know this is my first entry, but Im angry, Ill write more later about myself when Im in a better mood.                                     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't feel like taking a shower. I want to be clean, but I hate drying my hair. It's so long and it takes 25 minutes atleast to get it dry and its a pain in the ass. I love my long hair, and I would never cut it, I just wish there was an easier way. But, oh well. I wonder what Brian and I will do today. Oh, he pierced his nose! Its sexy! I like it a lot, now he has his labret and his nose..ohhh so hot!&nbsp;I wish my dad wasn't so anal about the whole piercing thing. I pierced my nose once but he made me take it out. I don't get whats so big about it, I mean a tattoo I understand, its permanent. A piercing is just a hole that will close, its not Forever. He just doesn't understand. He thinks they're ugly, but it's not really his decison. I just can't wait to be a little older so my life can belong to me, instead of my parents. I have no say in anything. I'm ordered around like a little servant, and I can't even get a piercing or 2. When does my life belong to me? When I had&nbsp;a job, my paycheck wasn't even mine. I had to save half of it and I mean yes thats good, but shouldn't I be the one to decide that, I am working for it. I can't ever sleep in or stay up late anymore. I used to stay up until like 5-6 am. and sleep until 3pm so fucking what? But no...I have to go to bed atleast by 2am and be up by 10 am at the latest. I don't understand what the big deal is? I mean, yes I have chores to do, but its not like they wont still be there when I get up. He just likes to control me and Im sick of it. I guess it makes him feel like a 'man' to control my every move. Granted, I do get to go places and use the car, but a lot of times it's places for them. I do everything they ask me to but yet still to him I don't deserve food, clothing, to use the car, or have any of my stuff. I have to earn everything I get. Well, I've been cleaning this house ever since I was 7 yrs old. I think I've earned my fair share, and since I got my liscense..oh god. I go to the grocery store, I pick up all his medicine, I take him to the Dr. when he asks me to, I drive him places..like computer stores, I go everywhere and clean but yet its still to much to ask for to have a piercing and for sleep. I'm not asking for a later curfew. My curfew is 12am. I don't mind that. It's fine, and if I got to a&nbsp;late movie and get home around 1am, they don't care..I mean Im not asking to stay out late, I just want sleep and 2 piercings. I don't even get paid for this stuff, and I dont ask for money either. I dont care about money, its not an important issue with me. I dont know, maybe Im too spoiled and being ungrateful and shouldn't complain, but you know what, this is my journal and I can bitch all I want!                    \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
