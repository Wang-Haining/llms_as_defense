  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic:\n\n             First thing I think of when typing this is 'does anyone even read this?'. I really don't think so. 40 hours of my life down the drain but hey, that's alright.  Item #2 on the list. My shoes are sweet. I love them. I'm a bit of a shoe fanatic, you see, I have 5 pairs. All skater shoes too. I love these Lakai. Phu's are awesome too. Sweetness describes it well. We're like Lakai Twins now, with our board graphics and shoes. I think we have a new place to buy our shÿt now. I got the Soca model and Phu got Carrol 3 (Girl limited edition).   People mostly said 'nice shoes', 'those are really nice' and 'how much were they?'. Then comments came like, 'holy crap, you wear a different pair everyday' and 'you bought another pair of shoes?!'. Vans, DC, éS, Hawks and Lakai. So what if I have 5 pairs. So what I have have more shoes than most girls I know (actualy, every girl I know). Meh it doesn't matter. I rock, and will continue to buy shoes. Next comes a board though. I almost snapped mine today pulling some big stuff.-_-                       Okay I have 2 days to cover here. Sony Camcorder with LCD screen and all that camera stuff, $350. Now I make anywhere from $42 to $49 a day. Do the math. It would take me at least 9 days to work it off. But I already have some money. I think I can get it by next Friday. Good deal, for a camera that would be regular $800 (approx.). There's like hundreds of things I could do with a camera. And it would be completely mine, so I can do anything at all.  Yesterday, I went out to meet Phu and Kyle in the other end of town. Well they were at Bishop to we were skating and then like 10 minutes later Kyle leaves. He wasn't going to come back out because of a phone call (wth?). So Phu and I hung out and then skated at Jean 21 and then went to his house after a little accident eek. So we talked Kyle into coming over, and then Quy and Nick came too. So we were skating at Blockbuster and crap and then the damn cop came and told us to leave. So we did, and we went back to Jean 21, this time with everyone. Then Kyle left, and the rest dropped like flies. So it was Phu and I again for like 90 minutes skating at 10pm, it was cool. Then we decided to leave and got these sweet planks and brought them to Phus house. Then I went home from there. End of story.  Now on to today. I'm tired so I'm not going to write much. Party at Erikas. I met up with Phu and our plan was I buy hotdog buns and he buys hotdogs. That worked out just fine.  oh well, other stuff happend.. I'll leave it at this. goodnight                       School was okay, well, as good as it gets. Let's see.. most classes were easy, we didn't do much. Steve came over after school and wanted to see if I wanted to go skate but I said no, just not up to it today.  I went to a dance at Heritage. I went with Sam, Lauren, Jessica and I don't know who the others were. I thought 'hey, wait, I hate dances & dancing' but it was too late by then. I was supposed to get there at 6:30 but I thought 'naw' because I have a thing with being 'fashionably' late. I'm always the last to arrive, for some reason. Anyways, I get there and they go 'when we get in, just say you're in grade 8, because it's a 7 & 8 dance'. I was like 'wth? oh, wonderful'. I'm only 8 inches taller than half the people in there. My night consisted of standing around alot, I did kinda dance at some points. Then, I slow danced a few times, since that's as easy as dancing gets.  I suppose it was okay, I'm glad I went. I doubt I'll go to any other dances though, unless I have to. Oh yeah.. lol, the wedding too.                        Highlight of yesterday- Phu, Steve and myself went to Heritage. They actually still had school so everyone went to class after a while. Then this class came by and these girls were watching us, so I blew some kisses and they blew some back *awww so cute!*. Not much happened there, except we got a good look as some posers. Remember kids, posers come in all shapes and sizes. Long story short, the principal came out and told us to leave so we did. Walking through the college parkinglot, Steve got really low on his board and did a kickflip and it poped up and hit him right between the eyes. He was bleeding like crazy so we washed him up at my house then walked him home. Turns out he got 4 stitches from that ordeal. -  As for today, nothing much. Checking about the camera to do some filming and we got a bunch of new living room crap. I'd be happy, or at least smile. But no. Been crappy for a while. Lieghter fools. (You know és footwear? It is pronounced 'ess' like the letter 'S'. Althought the majority of people call it 'E-S'. I knew that before and I told people but I wasn't certain so I pronounced like all the cool kids do =(. Anyways, I'm right.) http://esfootwear.com/etc/faq/  **QUOTE OF THE DAY** 'non non, n'est pas des boys' -someone at the school                       I went out to the college today with my skateboard, planning to ollie one of the barrier things. They're identicle to the one at the skate park and they are equal to 3 decks. There's like 100 all around the school too so it's perfect. Anywho, I talked to Ashley about it and she got a little upset and my consience got the best of me so I ended up not trying it (I'm a good boy =O). I wore my éS' and when I got there I thought 'darn, shoulda wore my DC's'. WHY? Because my damn éS are getting scratched to hell already (same thing happened to my DC's). They are some of the best skate shoes money can buy right now. So I figured 'hey, I desperately need to find a more efficient way for flip tricks'. And then, with my expertise (w00t) I found another way. I'll explain it, even though nobody cares. Before: I would slide my foot up as I was going up and flip it then land, scratching the toe cap to hell  Now: I ollie up, as high as I want (better height than before) and then when I'm at or near my highest point I push down and flip it instead of sliding my foot off the edge and flipping it. It didn't work so well the first while but now I'm getting the hang of it, I'm flipping higher and landing more than before. Best of all, I don't think my shoes get messed up.                            Well I've been much better. I think I'll be fit to go back to school soon enough. I'll admit, I feel like shit mentally and physically, so don't expect me to be all outgoing Mr.excitement. Seriously, not in the best mood.   I don't know what else is going on.. I left the house to get Ginger Ale today. LIEK OMGZ. I'm so proud of myself. Hmm.. oh yes, I want to learn (back foot) Impossible. It seems simple enough, but I don't know, I haven't even tried it yet.  I found a pair of Lakai's for only $39.99US. Which will come up to about $80 with all the shipping and crap. Not bad, and they even have the pair in all sizes. One let down is, the last time I ordered something from here, it took like 8 weeks because of the damn US Customs slowing shi- stuff down. They have it in 2 colorways, White/Gum and All Black.. yeah, I don't know. I'll probably just go out of town and buy a pair. Montreal or something. http://skateamerica.com/Skate/showdetl.cfm?&DID=7&Product_ID=13280&CATID=29                       Wellllllllllllllllll Nat is finally back!! woo 'bout time too, it's great having her around again. 3 weeks without seeing and 2 without talking. Cripes lol. Went to Heritage today, got Kyle and Phu to come with me. That was fun until it started to rain pretty bad, then we all went home. I got home, Kyle stayed for 5 minutes or so, then left. I went to my batcave and stayed there 'till now. Going out to do something every now and then. Like laundry, at 12:30pm and shower at 12:45pm. Sometimes I amaze myself. I can do that retarded primo stuff now. Something so simple, I know grade 6's that can do it, and I just learnt this afternoon. One word 'wow -_-'.   I might actually be sick. Pooey. I haven't been sick since last year, I think. Now, my throat is all swollen, and Ashely has the exact same thing. Can you make the connection? I can't. Anything else notable.. Ashley might come over tomorrow, to meet my mom for the first time. 2 months, and she's only going to meet her tomorrow (possibly). Hmm.. =O! 2 months, awesome. We're great.                       Today I went to Ottawa, to West 49 to pick up some Lakai shoes but noooo the have to carry other shit brand shoes instead. But Lakai is a very rare shoe, not easy to get. So my mom has this friend, and her boyfriend is a skater. He skates like 4 hours a day, everyday and he goes to the skate shops in Ottawa alot. So I talked to him and he gave me the names of some places and said they just might carry Lakai. I tried Top Of The World first, and I got lucky. They carry 'em. So, I might give them a call, and then we'll definately go down and pick up a pair. And if they carry Fallen, then I'll see if Phu can come along, so he can buy his pair.   We also played hockey tonight. Our new player of the week was Lis Fraiser. We had alot of people say 'maybe' and not one of them showed up. So it's all out revenge, seeing as there's one real week of school left. Maybe I can try skating in the halls now...  I have a video camera idea going around, to film some skating and some general screwing around.. but don't get your hopes up, no promises.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
