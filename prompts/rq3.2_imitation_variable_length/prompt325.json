Of course we don't discriminate against anyone, but nevertheless, there are some very smart young folks in our band.    One particularly bright young man is going into the eighth grade and can carry on a conversation as if he were in college. He commented today that he is disgusted with the lack of desire on the part of his colleagues to be more intellegent.  Most particularly, he described improper grammer and a lack of varied vocabulary.    I found myself in agreement with much of what this young man had to say.  I'm not going to say that this is just with 'kids today' because it is clearly not.  There were a great number of twerps that couldn't intellegently discuss their way out of a paper bag.  I think society just has a way of weeding those folks out and making them inconsequential to those that want to accomplish something.    I am very pleased that this young man has noticed this and is compelled to tell his peers that say 'why do you use such big words' to 'open a book or simply listen to intellegent people speak.' It gives me great faith in our young people.                       Okay I love golf.  I mean I think there's no sport any better.  If you're thinking 'but Fulkie, you just chastised athletics in an entry yesterday' you make a good point.  I still feel that athletics should come COMPLETELY secondary in our school systems, but if there is one sport that you truly gain something other than athletic ability, it's golf!    Golf is a sport where even if you aren't any good, you can still really enjoy it.  There is a specific etiquette to the game and the professionals are truly gentlemen and ladies.  (There is of course always an exception.)  It is a quiet game where you can gain a great deal of insight to things going on in your life.  Golf requires a great deal of strategy and planning and nothing feels better than a well hit shot.    Sadly however I am still what you may call a 'duffer.'  I'm not that great at the game.  If I break a 100 on 18 holes I'm doing a victory dance like it's nobody's business!  I love playing though.  It's such a wonderful game because it's very noble.  I will always love the game and play it regardless of how good I am.            \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
