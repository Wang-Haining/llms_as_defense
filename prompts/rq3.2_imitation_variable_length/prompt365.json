Im typing this from my 'sis's' laptop which my dad is lending her typing this crap ( lemme cuss a lil just bcuz my censorship doesent feel right) shit*,  so im THAT fucking bored. So i cant wait to crack this shell where my only peep hole is downstairs connected 2 the internet where ppl say dirty words, how i envy them.  Yes, it is sad how i am breaking into conversation after just noticing that maria was on, a blog isnt enuff, we need an IM or something because i feel so lonely in this hell w/ my grandma mumbling about all my imperfections and my sister kissing every shit that comes out of her mouth. Sadly that is the most poetic thing i have said all summer. 4 me this has been the summer of classic rock. W/ these gay posers @ my new summercamp 'sym gym' these guys are so desperate to rhyme. They have activities like guard start, bay play and some other gay crap i cant remember. But its a good rich-bitch summer camp. Kiawah was fun in that kik ass beach house even though it rained every single fucking ( how i love that word) day. At least i was with my cousins. I write this essay because i am that bored. I h8 the fact that they have that 'back to school' crap already at the mall.  well, g2g. BYE                         Yes, it does indeed suck that Spring Break is almost over.  It has been immensely enjoyable to be free of homework, to go to the beach with my friends.  And Isabela, it really ISN'T all that funny....although I suppose my view is rather biased since I wrote quite a lot of it.  Oh yes, a little while ago, I tripped and hit my foot on a chair so badly, I went flying.  Literally.  Everything I was holding flew out of my hands, and my glasses off my face.  Half my toes have swollen to at least twice their normal size, are bright red, and are bloody throbbing!  I can't even walk properly, I sort of shuffle along.  Oh yes, these past few days I've been at the beach, and have taken care not to get sunburned.  However, I still freckle.  And I discovered that my arms have freckeled enormously, except, where my urf top sleeves have been.  So, it's like a tan line, but a freckle line.  And the only place I got burned was the back of my knees, which is unpleasant indeed.   And upon proofreading this, I have found that every paragraph begins with 'yes' or 'oh yes'.  I suppose that I am being optimistic today.                       I had a very interesting moment today.....here is what happened: I was in the shower, and, seeing as our windows have been open because of the weather, there are various mosquitos in the house.  However, in my bathroom, was not a mosquito, but a jolly overgrown fly.  I don't like flies.  Especially when I'm washing my hair.  So, I pick up a deadly weapon (i.e. a bottle of Pantene), and smash it against the (then closed, seeing as I was showering) window (don't worry--the bottom of the window is at eye-level).  Our windows are very interesting.  On the inside, there is a screen (which obviously doesn't work), and, on the outside, glass.  To open the window, you turn a knob and the glass moves, but not the screen.  So this corpse of a fly was trapped, with its tail end (or its front end--don't particularly care to look) smooshed into the screen. My question is, how long will it take for the fly's body to begin decomposition, with the added factors of daily heat and extreme humidity for about half an hour (shower time + amount of time for steam to disperse)?  Any idears?                       What is wrong with this thing?  I first look at the blog and all I see are Rick's entries and 'Bob's' entries.  I hit 'Refresh'.  Nothing doing. Then, I post a frantic post and I hit 'Refresh' again.  And miracle of miracles, everything appears back to normal, and all of 'Bob's' entries have slipped off the face of the bloody planet!  Now, what exactly is going on?  Do we have a bug?  A glitch?  A virus?  Or...dare I suggest it? : P... ...might we have hackers on our tails?  That's right folks...(cornily DRAMATIC male television commercial voice) DUNH DUNH DUNH...those who you interact with every single day...friends by day, hackers by night.... : P, whatever.   I must admit that I am not too certain of all the inner workings of the Internet...BUT.... Oh yes, Rick, sorry for accusing you in my other post, but if you or ANY ONE ELSE IS in fact messing about on this blog....you, sir/madame, are in a large load of compost. In other words, a whole lot of poo in a hole.                       Ahem, an article has now confirmed it folks.....   Homework fails to make the grade     Mark Townsend Sunday February 8, 2004 The Observer    Children have long suspected it, and now research confirms it: homework is a waste of time. Anxiety, boredom, fatigue and emotional exhaustion are all side-effects of bringing schoolwork home, according to a review of 75 years of study into the issue.   Even those who believe homework improves their performance in the classroom resent the encroachment on their spare time.   And the best place for extra study may not, in fact, be at home. The report by the Institute of Education makes a case for out-of-hours study to be done in after-school learning clubs, away from the potentially disruptive influence of parents.   Tensions are the most pronounced in middle-class families where the pressure to succeed can create a volatile atmosphere. Parents who are overbearing can undermine any pleasure children derive from study.   The report's author, Dr Susan Hallam, said: 'Parents have the most positive influence when they offer moral support, make appropriate resources available and discuss general issues. They should only actually help with homework when their children specifically ask them to.'   Current government guidance ranges from at least one hour a week of homework for five-to seven-year-olds to two-and-a-half hours a day for students aged 14 to 16. Yet Hallam found that homework tended to boost achievement only when done in moderate amounts.   Her findings follow comments from David Bell, chief inspector of schools, who said that parents have a key role to play in tackling an endemic anti-learning culture in society.   'Early support from parents is crucial. A very significant investment in the early years has got to be right, even though we are still not 100 per cent sure what the biggest single influence is in these years,' he said.                        Little Ricky's going outside to play.  How amusing.  Caitlin, your posts on the GS blog are pure gold!     But yeah.  Holy Goddamn F%#@.  Tomorrow's the last day of school.  It feel so surreal.  I mean, where the hell has the time gone???  Time moves man, and it ain't going slower.  God.  It's scary.  We're all going to get old.  And get sick.  And die.  And the time will go faster and faster and faster.  And honey, your life will be GONE!  Jesus Christ.  Remember how looong it would take in preschool and first grade for things to happen, for days to pass?  How early we would wake up, bright and energized and wanting to play?  Good heavens alive man, I never wake up happy.  I never even wake up ALIVE.  And it is beyond sad that we are spending the years in which according to primordial law, we are supposed learn about ourselves, and become adults.  But instead, we are living our days doing things we hate, taking orders from people we hate.  I am willing to bet that every songle person in our science class is able to function as an adult of this 'society'.  And, dude, today's adults are nore babies than we are.  And by the time you hit 70, you start regressing.  You become a baby again.  That's not the way it's meant to be.  But.  Life's a shit. What are you going to do?  So there's my emotional philosophy end-of-the-year.  Aka PMS.  or something.    But yeah.    Fuck the soundcheck.                       I've got my own blog to play with.  If anyone cares, they can read that.  And I like to think of my profile as rather amusing too.  Surefolks could post day-to-day events.  We could also do current political happenings, scientific discoverires, and ethics (i.e. cloning: evil or helpful).  This blog could be a form for hot debate!  I'll be working with 2-year-olds, so maybe I'll ask them how babies are made, or somehting funny.    Really, the only people on this blog are the Usual Suspects and Rick, with occasional visits from Maria.  Erik had a temporary fling, but I reckon there ain't gonna be no more folks on this-here blogoferous.  So...whatever.  Go crazy.  Help yourself.  P.S. I was channel-flipping this morning and I came across a Christian channl show.  It was like 'Jesus knocks at your heart which is your house and if you open up, he'll come inside and Jesus will be in your heart which is your house and so don't be mean, but read the Bible everyday and don't crap in your neighbor's mailbox and don't try and copulate with you dooooggg....'....  It was unbelievably funny.
