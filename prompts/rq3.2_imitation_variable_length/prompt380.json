I couldn't agree more with this...       All legal battles aside, I find the saddest reality at work here is the perceived sense of freedom being preached alongside of same-sex marriages. I watched on television as newly'wed' 'couples' celebrated, hugged, rejoiced with their family members and adopted children, held up celebratory signs, and shared with the media the 'liberty and freedom' they felt.  If only people knew how far from free they really were. It is my opinion that the lowest form of human existence is to live our lives the way God never intended. To see people celebrating the relativistic un-truth of freedom in a relationship God never intended us to have is absolutely heartbreaking. This is true separation from God. This is the big lie.  A lie not only told via the homosexual agenda, but through the humanist agenda, the feminist agenda, and many others. The lie perpetuated is this 'false freedom' people believe they have when they can do whatever they want to do, say what they want to say, live how they want to live, doing whatever comes naturally, completely unencumbered by any laws (but in fact, set free by those laws), and certainly not hindered by any religion, let alone a God whose only goal is to make our lives miserable on the Earth right? It is this thought exactly that is holding many captive in bondage as we speak.       I think Ambra hit the nail right on the head. The problem with our society today is that people want to live like they have no responsibilities whatsoever. They want to do whatever they want and have no restrictions... no rules to live by. But God gave us rules and commandments for a reason. Living a sinful lifestyle does nothing but bring you further from God and deeper into denial. I'm not saying that everyone who is 'gay' is a sinner and everyone who is 'straight' is squeaky clean. That is FAR from the truth. Sin is sin. But to be fully redeemed in Christ, you have to let go of the sins that control your life and follow Him. That is the ONLY way to find peace in your life and in your heart. This one life is the ONLY chance we have to give our lives over to God and to receive Salvation. Please do not waste it. Before you know it, your time on earth will be over. Are you ready to stand before God? Will He recognize you when you do? Now is the time to choose between an eternity of peace and an eternity of pain. Which will you choose?     What does the Bible say about homosexuality ?          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
