Summer was supposed to be here already.  I'm cold and it feels like 50 degrees around this town tonight, WTF!!  I want my well deserved warm weather.  Second thing, never have a person that loves to travel, live nears an airport.  It's f'in torture I tell ya!!  Also Summerfest is over and those semi-free concerts I will sorely miss.  Consolation prize - Cats tomorrow night!  This will be a busy week since I have to get all the documentation done so that someone can come into my lab and work.  Well most of it will be done cause there is just too much to document and not enough of my willingness to do it all.  Maybe while I'm gone for a week I'll be able to decide where in the South Pacific I wanna go. I'm still hung up on Fiji but it might not be as remote as I like.  We'll see.  Maybe I'll head for the Cook Islands instead or American Samoa.  Check out The Rock's home.  Wouldn't that be something? :)  Other good news.... My babies got their Lion haircuts and look adorable per usual.  Did I mention HDTV is damn awesome?!  Well it is and HDTV/Cable is damn good too.   Craig if you're reading this, you look damn handsome with those gray-distinguishing highlights.  Just thought I would mention it.  Sorry it wasn't in person but it looks like it will be awhile before the group gets together for dinner again.  Ren faire starts soon so go and have fun somewhat living in the past.   W, keep on truckin' safe.  OK the question is:  Shopping for decorating the home alone or with friends, fun or just something you have to do?                     Well today will be an interesting day.  Friend of mine quit today.  Looks like there is another Help Desk job open.  I believe the top two canidates will now get hired to fill the posted open position and the recently open spot.  The HD team needs a good boost/shot in the arm.  Too much bad past blood in there and new favoritism is not helping the situation either.  Anothre fun moment about the situation today; the part-timer, AKA: The Princess, is so far, AWOL.  She's almost outta here as well.  If not on her own according then theirs.  Good thing I'm in an isolate spot and pretty free to do what I want when I want. Love the size of my office too.  If anyone is in the area and wants to do lunch, let me know.  Call the cell it's on during the day.  I can go almost any time I want too. :D  Another fun part of my day is sending out 10 laptops to the UK to get there by Friday.  Let's see if this goes better than last week's did.  They did get the machines, a day late thanks to airborne cause they can not read but they did get 'em.  Strange out of the 700+ machines I have shipped out of here in approximately 4 months, I have only 'lost' 3.  I say 'lost' cause 2 were scanned as being on the truck but funny how they never made it to the airborne hub. hmmmm.  The third made it onto the truck, into the hub, shipped to the state but never made onto the truck or to our office in NC.  I find it a big odd and humorous at the same time.  Now I'm not perfect by no means.  I have done my share of miss shipments but I have not lost a laptop on my own accord.  Budget Movie night tonight.  I have one friend that is available wants to go.  Not sure if I so much up for it but we'll see how the day goes and how my back holds out from a crazy busy day.  Question:  Is life an adventure or something to get thru?                     Had a fun time Friday night at Planet.  Awesome to see Mack, Doro and Waiken again.  I so miss the days of Hoolies or BBCs for drinks and the occasional BS sessions.  I love hanging with the guys.  I'd like to do that more often.  Too bad many are taken and aren't allowed out to play. Only part I didn't like was having it all end so early.  Unfortunately when Jen or I work we have to be there until 3 before we get to leave.  Saturday was such a lazy day.  Slept most of the day due to being up almost 24hrs yesterday.  Did get up for a bit and was online.  Today isn't looking too much more energy producing but then again it really doesn't have to.  No kids and cats love to sleep on hot days. Have a great nap everyone.   For those that do not wish to read sexual content - stop now.     Those that are married and keep hitting on me - please stop it.  As much as I like 'fun' I also like to have a person that can be with me instead of having to go home to another.  Here's a clue for anyone:  I want to be with someone that loves to have fun, likes the outdoors, loves to travel and be adventurous.  First and foremost, the person has to already be single.  Not married. Not in the process of a divorce.  Not engaged to another.  Current status has to be:  completely single.  I know it can be annoying but deal with. It's what I want and I almost always get what I want.   Question:  What irks you the most?         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
