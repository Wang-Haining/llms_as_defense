I used to be really uncomfortable meeting someone blind, but I'm either getting used to it or getting desperate, or a little of both.  She's an ex starving artist (artiste?), who gave up starving and got into waitressing (quite the upgrade). She seemed really fiesty in our conversations so I was looking forward to meeting her. She was also tall, which as you know is a bonus.  Anyway, we met at the El Camino for drinks. Given how much some women stretch things with their pictures, this one was pretty good. I didn't have any trouble picking her out of the crowd, which is a good thing.  I always make an effort to do the listening instead of talking about myself because a) I already know about myself 2) I'm not one to talk about himself and iii) I know women appreciate it.  In this case I didn't have to worry. I don't think I got anything in after hello, but it was such a blur I can't be sure.  She's a nice woman and all, but it just wasn't there; no spark. I realized that I could appear to be looking at her but instead be looking at the table of very attractive women just behind her without her noticing (which it totally out of character for me), and at that point it was pretty clear that it wasn't in the cards.  Oh well - can't like 'em all. Back to the drawing board.    urlLink IM Chick  Update  I blocked her, but now she's sending me mail. It's weird; it's like the more I ignore her the more she wants to talk to me. I've always heard that this is what happens, but it's the first time I've experienced it.   Any time I can't decide whether to be flattered or annoyed I remind myself that the last time we went out she made me wait for her in my house for half an hour while she resolved an argument on the phone with another guy in my driveway. That usually clears things up.          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
