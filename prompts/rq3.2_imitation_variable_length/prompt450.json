I was prayin for who knows how long that Matt would hug me memory day and after that, I'd get to hang out with him at least. It happened. I was so scared to go up to him at the memory day thing and so I was like right behind him and I looked at Adrienne and I was like 'i can't' and she tapped him on the back and pointed at me! lmao! omg! and he hugged me...i cried so much that day. I started cryin  SO  bad when Matt's pictures came up on the screen..that was the first time I cried...then I finally got calmed down after a few minutes and then Monica's pictures came up and I didn't expect to see my pawpaw but she had a pic of her and him on there and omg i broke down again..ugh so sad. then a pic of me and her when we were little :D we were so cute. and holdin hands in our lil dresses. but anyways, ok..yeah it was terrible. It was too sad..I wouldn't go thru it again. But at least Matt hugged me, it made my day. Anyways so I get home and I talk to Matt and we're not doin anything so we do somethin together. It's like we were never even apart...well ok kinda. We talked a lot. He's crazy. I love him with all of my heart, still. I'm out of school. Today was my last day. English exam? freakin hard. Math exam? freakin hard. I hate exams. But anyways, so I'm a senior now. One more year. It's sure gonna fly. My birthday's Monday *excited* I hope I see *matt*                     :D !! The last two days have been so great! Aw ya'll I really think Dustin is sweet. The night before last, Patrick and Dustin called me and wanted to come over but mom was goin' to bed soon so I told them I'd have to come outside to talk to them...so they asked if I wanted to jus go with them and get some food. Sooo I did. It cracked me up so bad bc when they got here, I got in the back and Dustin was like 'Do you want me to drive and you sit up here and make Patrick sit in the back?' I looked at Patrick with an evil smile and said 'yeah sure!' lol he was like *hmph* :D Dustin's so great! I haven't known him long at all either, but I know I'll like him more and more if I keep hangin' out with them! Well, when they dropped me off, they wanted to know if I wanted to go to church with them the next day..Wednesday...and I said yes...and I told them if Monica couldn't go, thennnnn I'd have to have one of them pick me up. They said that was perfectly fine.  Anyways, Monica comes and pix me up for church Wednesday night and we sit with Dustin *smiles*. Patrick was mostly on stage playin' guitar. They usually have some youth service but their teacher wasn't there so we went upstairs anways and they talked about some trips they're takin' soon. Saturday they're goin' to some thing. I don't even know what it IS and Dustin's mom (the one talkin' to us about the trips) asked who all was goin' and Dustin had her put me and Monica on the list when we don't even know if we can go yet! I'll have to ask mom and Monica's gotta see if she can switch hours. *sigh* lol he's so crazy! He's like 'if ya'll can't go we can always scratch ya'll's names out'! *smiles again* He really wants us to go though. And they're goin' to Six Flags, August 5th! He wants us to go with them there too! lol.. Six Flags WOULD be fun though. I'll see if I can go...but I'm not sure if I can or not..depends on if we have enough money for me to go. I hope I end up goin'....I'll be sad if I can't..*frowns*! Anyways, after church, me and Monica watched their band practice...they are so good...I love the way they sing and some of the songs they sing crack me up ;) !! Well, after they practice...we go outside and stand at Monica's car and they all start writin' on her car hahah!! It was funny!! BUUUT it upset me! B/c Dustin wrote 'Alicia likes Brandon' I was like 'noooo Alicia likes Dustin!!' oh, aww! I was standing on Monica's car..like on the side where the door is opened and he was standin' behind/beside&nbsp;me and he had his hand on my back and I just thought that was so cute b/c I was about to fall offa there :0 !! Patrick finally went over to Monica's side and wrote 'Dustin likes Alicia' on there and I was thinkin' 'ahh! thank you!' ;)&nbsp; Ohhh no. And the other night...I don't remember where this was but I wrote 'Dustin is hot' on Patrick's window and it was still on there last night and Patrick showed it to him! haha I said...'Patrick! now you KNOW you wrote that' He knew I was jokin' and that it was me *smiles*... Well, we're going on our double date tonight. Hope all goes well. For me and Dustin.                      Well, it's Saturday. I'm sick..I have been since yesterday morning! It sucks. I'm coughin my head off and sore throat. Yeah..it's suckin. But I'm really excited. My dad got me another celica. same as my other as far as I know. I think I have to get a job though. :( Not that it bothers me too bad...considering I'm not ever doing anything anyways. Ok let's see...we have 13 days left of school I think. GOOD THING! I miss Matt. Yes, Matt Harding. You know? It's weird. Everyone was telling me 'hey you need to date other people, you dont need anything serious while in high school'...well i don't care. I miss him so much, we were together too long for me just forget him..I can't and I won't. Couples have their ups and downs...and their break ups and stuff...PLEASE let this be a bump in the road! I'm not going to try to talk to him and get him back, I've done that before. I'll let him go. I know that's what he wants...I think he likes the whole dating thing better anyways. I love him with all of my heart still though. If there was...ANYTHING in the world I could do to get him back, I'd do it. I'd die for Matt. I don't want to be with anyone except him. I'll love him more than anyone, always. and if he wanted me back, I'd go with him quicker than anything. I don't care that he's going to Alabama, I'd stay with him, hoping to see him any time that I could. I want to be his so bad. omg and that song BURN-USHER..yeah I cry everytime I hear that song. I'll pray everyday that something happens and I get to be with him. I'd be the luckiest girl in the world. He means more than life to me. I know I love him, if he loves me back and it's TRUE love, I know I'll end up with him one day...no matter how long. But if I don't end up with him, i know it's not what's meant to be.  Ok, I just felt like writing about Matt. I love him with all of my heart.  -alicia         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
