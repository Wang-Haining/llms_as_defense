Passers by only see a wisp of smoke rising from the chimney and continue on their way.' --Vincent van Gogh  There aren't many things I regret in life, most of the one's I do, were just plain old carelessness. I usually hold other's feelings at a high point and try my damned-ist not to make anyone hurt intentionally. But things happen in this lawless universe. But perhaps things happen for a reason; that would be the way of the Optimist to view things, but some of us less loyal Susie Sunshines approve more directly the Gloomy Gus school of thought that 'It could have happened and what if' scenarios. I tend not to ask too much of what could have been, but at times I feel the pull of curiosity, 'what if I took the long way home that night?' But what purpose does it really serve? It won't change anything. Just like an armchair enthusiast criticizing the plays when he refuses to partake. who am I to be selfish enough to end one thing and get upset when the other is more content. For example, I may quit my job and speak to someone who still works there, and find out business is going well. I can't curse them for enjoying their job when I voluntarily left! But this is the problem of being human. We are fascinating creatures but our fancies change a little too quickly from time to time. We have no one/thing to blame but ourselves, unfortunately. Especially speaking existentially; what ever fortune or misfortune is brought on by your own hands. No one is given a great hand, you merely must make the best of it and hope for the best and prepare for the worst. But, for what its worth, Love comes quickly, but it seldom leaves abruptly.   Ok, now lame commentary. The more I write on here the more I realize my life is quite uneventful. No offense Rob... but I don't have floods of goings on.. except Rob and the 'teaching me of facts not on the IQ test'... which makes me shutter, and my stupid accounting class that makes me respect my CPA a lot more now. Let's see if I can not make Rob upset with my retardedness.... he is super silly. Well, anyone to put up with my bizarreness should get an island... Here I declared it!!! Send me your requests and I will see what me and my eccentric brain can do!!! Arrivederci!!     The pain that has encompassed me entire being is one in which cannot easily be explained. It was the final blow to end all blows which made the sunset on happiness. I find myself more alone than I may have exaggerated in my prior writings to add emphasis. This feeling makes me feel like I cannot breathe, but I have to sigh. It makes me unable to swallow for fear of nausea. It is this dull pain through my chest and stomach, but recurrences play like an old movie which I know all the lines to in my mind. Each like the dagger being twisted deeper and deeper. Feeling paralyzed and helpless gave way to hopelessness upon reflection. How could something one thought to be so beautiful and pure turn so ugly and gray? I must go on and search for the radiance I used to possess and searched for. If nothing else this has been a lesson well learned, though these lessons are better not taught. All one needs at this point is tranquility to remove the sorrow. My mind has a hard time settling and now it cannot move on.      Well, I had a wonderful time yesterday with a certain someone. I didn't think hanging out at parks and cursing malls could be so enjoyable.. It sure had been awhile. We hung out from 10am-about midnight and I still found it extremely difficult to leave... crazy kid, how'd he do it? I haven't the foggiest! But the views were breath-taking, the conversation delightful and the other stuff.... exclusive Hehehehe... Let's just put it this way, it's all down in history for sure! I do recommend seeing the view from the Oddessey resturant where ever it is. Hopefully, this is just a beginning of more fun times to come. I just have to try not to be a smart-ass all the time, curse, correct constantly (though he swears its cute), and I think I will let him win an arguement or two now and again. *wink wink*   ~*~*~*~Brief pause at recollection of yesterday*~*~*~  What in Sam Hell was I talking about now?? Ok, I guess we should get some philosophical mombo-jumbo out of the way, since that is why I have this crazy contraption! I told Rob last night that no one lives for the moment, and everything you do is in preparation for a tomorrow which is uncertain of us ever seeing it. No matter how you think you are living, its apparent that it cannot be for the moment. The simple task of eating is to sustain you for a future moment and life. Work is to get paid in the future. So if one was to merely live for today, he wouldn't eat or work or even use the restroom because they are a waste of time and prevent you from enjoying the 'now'. I stuck up this conversation with my fav. prof and he said 'Is God living for the moment?' and I replied, 'God is not subject to time and cannot live, since he created time and life. He is eternal and cannot have personifications.'  I stumped him and presented my hierarchy: Goodness (God has to be all good for most people) God Time Earth Man Each is subject to what is before it and dominated by what is after it. That's all for now. My dog is in a crate crying and its sooooo sad, My Poopie baby!!!!!!!      After all the guy hating thing, I found a fella who is a nice guy!!!!! Ok, he is the nicest guy! We hung out in LA and it was the best-est time. See, fun enough to use made up words for.. At any rate, I don't even know how to describe him because he is so special. He is totally selfless and caring, but not in a sissy wierdo kind of way. We aren't completely opposites, but we aren't the same, but I don't know. The only thing that is great is the usual stuff that bothers me and makes me worry doesn't. And its hilarious how he is so concerned with Michelle (best friend for those who haven't met her yet) finding flaws in him so things aren't like 'too good to be true'. I don't know, I like the way I feel when I talk to him and .... I'm gonna stop all this talk because I think I'm rambling a little too much here. (Sorry Rob  *wink wink*)  Besides that... more randomness. I haven't been able to get passed an idea that is so simple: Time has never stopped for anyone. Even Jesus was a slave to it. There has never been anyone who didn't have to turn old, who lived forever, remained a child for eternity, etc. It's a fascnating notion really that everything must give way. Water can dissolve absolutely anything through time. Time is so great there is no way of expressing its greatness. How long is infinity and forever? This does help one's everyday struggles as well. Though we may be completely finite, there is comfort in knowing 'this too shall pass.' Everything must come to an end and a new beginning is waiting to get started. Pain can not last forever, niether can sorrow. Though life is full of these emotions, take solace that everyone is on this adventure and carries the same fears and loathings as torches through the endless tunnel of life. They are not permenant and do come and go like other emotions. Some go on to the end where the light has teased and begged them. Others are weary and have stopped on the sides to catch their breath. And still there are those who have stopped all together going or even starting and trying.  \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
