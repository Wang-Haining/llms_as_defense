I'd say it's like 85% as good as the first one, but it's always hard to meet or beat the original.  anyway...I'm not going to ruin anything for you fuckers, so just chill.  all I'm going to say is that they talk some about how everyone needs a hero, and that you shouldn't change who you are.  you are who you are.  I really took that to heart, and yes that's lame of me, but it makes sense, and I sorta got some glimmer of hope from it.  I think I'm hanging from a single thread here, and I'm _this_ close to cutting it myself instead of letting it break.  I'm sick of just hanging here, for all to see, and mock, and laugh at.  It's BULLSHIT.  but yet again, I see a sign.  not a fucking sign from god in a religeous aspect, but in a 'haha, you fucker. take this. in your face' aspect.  prick.  Let me explain.  tonight, in my boredom (not so much boredom as pitiful me), I'm browsing the personals on yahoo, as I do every now and then, and I'm like, fuck goldsboro, this place sux.  so I go search Columbus, OH, where I used to live.  I'm moving back there when I get out of this monotonus, ass-kissing excuse we call a job.  I'm sorry, but I kiss no one's ass to move up the ladder.  I will work for my pay, and not by making my knees sore.  I prefer to earn what I reap, not skim the top.  anyway, I'm moving back to cols.  so I'm browsing, and I come across this ad.   urlLink Nicole (I hope she doesn't mind)  She is absolutely gorgeous.  And the intellect to go with.  I tried my damnedest to get in touch w/her.  Icebreaker.  searching the member directory, and finally, actually (attempting to) PAY YAHOO to email her.  Yes, I was actually going to spend $20 to send an email.  That's the level I have reached, and it's not the first time.  only THIS TIME, this is where god, murphy, and who the fuck know who else intervened and as a group got on a microphone and yelled in my face 'F U C K   Y O U,   S E T H'.  Yeah, the shit wouldn't go through, so I couldn't even send a goddamn email.  why does god hate me?  he must.  someone does, and I'm sorry for being stupid, but what did I do to piss him off?  he must be a woman, because I don't understand what I did wrong, so I don't know how to fix it or not do whatever I did.  it's fucking stupid.  this is the part where I stop giving a shit.  I don't need to spend anymore energy watching my hopes become the hindenburg.  I just can't take the ups & downs, the stress, the bullshit anymore.  i give up                          Yahoo! is experiencing temporary communication issues with the banking network. Please try placing your order later. (7)    now I fucking dare you to tell me that I am not hated by someone.  no shit, this is the 2nd time I tried to attempt actually spending money to email a woman, and this is the fucking response I get.  fuck it.  I just need to spend that energy doing something that actually yields me results (you should've seen me the second I knew she was online; you would've thought I just drank 2 pots of black coffee).  but I _need_ that; a woman who just by her looks can give me energy I never knew I had.  Life I never knew I had.  to hell with it.  to hell with it all.  I'm not bitter towards others who have achieved what I only dream of, I'm truly happy for them, I just don't want it flaunted in my face.  ...maybe I need to start drinking.  heavily.  solitude, depression & I shall be as one.  everyone else can fuck off, I don't need your fucking sympathy, so save your breath.  really.                       dejected does not even begin to describe the level of depression, pissed off, disappointed, & sadness i feel right now.  jesus christ, i don't even have the fucking urge to capitalize my goddamn sentences.  if you know me, you'll know that's fucking bad.  i had hope for this evening.  i don't know what for, but what i got wasn't it.  i need a companion.  a wife.  a soulmate.  i need more than a friend can give.  and i have nothing.  i need someone who will be there when i come home, who i can ask how her day went, and when she asks me how mine went, i can say, even if it was shitty, 'honey, YOU just made it the best day of my life.'  if i am ever lucky enough to have that for one day, 1 life would be grand, but 2, if she ever left, after have knowing what it's like to have her here, i don't think i could live w/out her.  look how fucking bad i am now, BEFORE i even KNOW what life is like with her, let alone actually feeling and experiencing the joy, the life she gives me and then taking it all away, i don't think i would or could live after that.  what a pathetic piece of shit i am.  look at me, i'm garbage.  fucking going to sleep at fucking quarter to midnight on a goddamn fri night.  fucking worthless.....         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
