I decided to just go in tomorrow. Thats business math and english 101b that i am missing. But heck i dont fickin care.  Anyway i had a very good discussion with gerald, a friend of mine over the phone about silly girls and boys. Why silly girls drop their silly guys like a hot potato, the concept of love and all. Honestly for me i am not taking these seriously, love and how other poeple percieve it. Basta ako I have so much love to give to everybody. I am ms. friendly. Noel and I thought of it as the safest thing towards the opposite sex. And that is the way that i am most comfortable with.  I have been so very single for 3 years already and enjoying it. And yeah siguro im a scared fart that i wanted to keep every guy a friend. Pero masaya naman ako eh. Tama nga naman si gerald you can get sex by charm and paying for it pero hindi sya human. Nacocompensate nya lang yung times na feeling mo nagiisa ka at kelangan mo ng pisikalan. Its so nice to hear from a lot of guys tungkol sa honest opinions nila about women and their feelings. Yun nga lang nahihirapan ako mag guage ng lalaki para sakin dahil na ooverwhelm ako sa mga information na binibigay sakin mismo ng  mga opposite sex. Lagi na lang ako natatakot dahil babae ako. Would it be easier for me if i was one of them? ehehhehe. If i was indeed gay?   Hay nay, excited na ako later.                            tis the forced leave season...and what do we do?          team building here and there       beer binges in the food court           We just had a blast last friday, me and some of my vellpeppers teammates drinking to death at my house. As usual, Russel took the centerstage with his crying bouts over his mom, who now we learn has cancer and annabel, an ex gf from high school he is yakking about. Russel is not like that in his normal self, bibo yan eh, makulit, autistic. It seems that drinking is a form of release for him, sakin ayos lang yon.  Some girls can be strange as in psycho strange...isa lang masasabi ko. Ang tahimik ang pinaka mabangis. Kawawa naman si eric.   On a lighter note, I seem to have developed this little crush over a guy who looks like Mr. Robb of Hoobastank. And its funny coz he sings as well and i cant help but admire his singing one time when we were in the food court on our very light and cheap moments. Cheap fun is enjoyable, i cant help but be mused by other poeple s drunken ways. I have the weirdest fellers in the food court one guy there lasts a whole drinking session by singing 'its my life ' by Bon Jovi all through. One guys singing to death as if it was one of his concert series (me kasama pa yong welcome to blah blah blah this is blah yada yada) And us, we laugh at no end and shout.  Me and condrad once asked our selves over beer,   'bakit di natin maiwan ang globalstride'   sabi ko kasi parang college at high school eto pinakamasarap na trabahong napasukan ko kahit di ganun kataas ang sweldo compared sa iba. Sabi naman nya   'Global kasi parang skul bukul'          .     AND THERE HE WAS AGAIN, Andre the giant a.k.a My father, Mario     He came back from where he came from, wreaking havoc to the house hold with his alalay again. His purpose: To get materials for his shop back there. He yakks about shit, pesters us to hell, wakes us up in our sleeping hours and blast unsolicited hurtful comments on how you act PLUS textes my mother every now and then siraan kami and stuff then makes my mother call us and curse us from the other end. How stupid and childish can a grown moron get diba?   We just acted the normal person not minding him, escaping his route every single minute, forcing ourselves to go to the office even if its a forced leave. Creating false lakad on a sunday or saturday wag lang syang makasama sa mga invites nya, like that time when he wanted to go to my Lolo s place or when he asked me to go with him to buy perfume. Nung sa perfume shit sinabi ko na lang na ako na lang bibili at mamimili ng perfume for him, he thought it was sweet when i was thinking lang na fuck i dont want to have a bonding moment with you. We tried bonding a couple of times already pero hes still the same ass of a dad. There was even this one time when me migs and soy went to work na we didnt witness a very monumental event, migs' evil dad had a drinking session with my evil dad I wonder if satan conjoined them there or whatev.  And at long last he went away, then there i had a party. A sort of celebration of his voyage and at the same time a time for a reunion with mamita and a bonding moment for joey and russel na me alitan.                                               drill: don't reply. copy and paste in a new  bulletin and put your answers, then click send.  haha.

First, in the very heart of katipunan, where the usual traffic is, we saw 2 very cute guys in their not so cute and OA car last thursday ( a baby blue 'over shocked' civic esi with that pathetic www.blahblah.com/his name sticker shit, to make it look like a racing car) one in the passenger seat is married (reez saw the ring) and the free one was the driver named jmariano. 3 girls at the back, thats moi, gen my friend and reez my sisters friend got a little bit infatuated so we were turning our heads in the car's direction. Migs on the other hand felt empathy and started to make us write down our names in a paper...the only brave soul to have her number written there was gen, not because she wanted to fool with the guy but to help us, mga friends nya na scared shit to give out our numbers. And so it happened, migs gave gen s number to the guy in the baby blue pathetic car and we started texting... tonight is when were finally going to meet the man.  Anyway after the flirting-with-the-other-car thing I decided to have a decent night out with my girlfriends way back UST soccer days, had a ball drank beer to death until 2:30 with them then made senti with carlo in whistlestop until 5 am. My crew (naks crew!) went to a different party where i was supposed to go as well but opted not to for the simple reason that i dont want to see the arrogant whore that made a fool out of my 2 friends for i was in the verge of giving her yung sampal na makakaitsa sa kanya hanggang mars you know. So there, temper was in a a real high nung gabi ba yun kaya i decided to take a break and unglobal myself for the weekend (UNGLOBAL HUH).  Sunday I recieved a text message from Ivan for some strange reason. Got pissed coz theres a possibility na me nag trip sakin. Its either gary or some guy who knew i liked him. If I get to see who that is Ima tear him to peices i swear. To text him back for that instance is an embarrasing thing for me, since ima be breaking my code. The responsible guys gonna pay who ever that is i swear.  So yun lang                      Back to Malate: The night of the balls   Went to malate last saturday, have a date with my cousins so i tagged noel along. It was Teaz night at bargo courtesy of Addict mobile and Deepa was one of the teaz patrol. It was all fun fun and then there were mini contests, a girl won for herself a brandnew erricson fone by just 'picking the mannequins balls'(har har har). I shouldve came up there and gave my self a chance to pick balls, bwehehehe ( like alvin's balls for example, one of deepas friends there.)  It was suppose to be a getaway sans office entities but i saw Freaky Ricky wandering around the Gay'ol Nakpil Orosa sts. Me and geeta talked about boys, how insane they are, what they want and how to read their minds. And soon got tired of it , we just gurgled our san migs away till 3 am. Deepa never returned so geeta went home and me and noel stayed in the streets..ehehehhe.. I met some of his gay friends and ate squid fuckin expensive balls.   Geeta set me up with this gerald. He just texted last night but i was mighty tired and my body aches so i apologized for the delay of the answers and told him i would gladly text him back tomorrow. i hope he's nice and not an asshole. I have a lengthy list of assholes in my book, i dont want to add more names on it. oh well.  Its 5 am . We slept yesterday 4pm and woke up 1pm. Now I have a mid shift which is 2pm later to think about. Now How Am I gonna survive? ........................
