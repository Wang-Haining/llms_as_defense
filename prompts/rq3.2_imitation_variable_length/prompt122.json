Got some grub...cam back to my room n went back online...this time my cuzz was jus strollin in...so u know she had the world of things to tell me...By time noon came around...it was time to lay it back down...i close the curtins in my room and GOOD GOD....i was out till 2am. I was like....DANG...that ain't normal for NO ONE!! N e how....the next day I checked out the hotel n headed for Katterbach...My co-worker was drivin....N people.. HE NEARLY KILLED US...tryin to point at this car...I was soo&nbsp; scared!! But i played it off and brushed it off...cuzz when i looked at him...he looked like he jus seen a ghost! In my head i was like...he so lucky i can't drive stick, id snatch his azz from the drivers seat n put him in the passenger seat so he could look at all the dam cars on the auto bahn n i could get to the next desitnation safely!   L8ter that day ...i played ball outside with some ballers from the local base...where they good...uhh yeah they was arite...did we win...HELL YEAH..thas not even a quesiton to be asked!     &nbsp;                          I know i know..i've been gone for a min.    This is what has happened since my last move...   Im in Katterbach Germany with no internet connection,   a burger king that is being renovated so their running   their resturant out of a huge trailer, so we have to&nbsp; set   up and do training...about a mile away from the actual    store. But what makes it worst is that when we did set    up the computers, we had to set them up in the new    burger king...so there a lot of consrtuction going on, a lot   of dust, wires, n flies..now these flys are every where..    some days&nbsp;i felt like i was working in Africa! They're just    everywhere. Pleased, im not...a bad combo of DUST, WIRES   CONSTRUCTION WORKERS N BIG OL HORSE FLYIES! Its&nbsp;been   a nightmare for me. Though my co-worker was this is jus   a specail case...im not tryin to hear it. Katterbach is going under   one of my many horror stories of working for MICROS. I swear i    take 2 showers a day...then what makes it worst...im staying on    base...for the past two nights i have been eaten alive by mosquitoes!!   Last night i slept in a long sleeve shirt n my sweat pants...i may have   lost 30pds but i was BIT FREE of them critters.    &nbsp;  NOT HAPPY OR PLEASED.                          Good Morning Good Morning Good Morning...Man its early!! Well I have made it safely to the wonderful DC area...im actually in Columbia....I know one person and they stay in washington area which is a hour away....best beleive they will come c me...i mean im jus cool like that...haha. Well i have been here two days and so far its not bad...though i am the only one training in this big office...with millions of computers and co-workers that are WAYYYYYYYY older than me...it tends to get a TAD BIT BORING!! But hey...its good money and once again an opportunity has opened up at the right time. Ok, About work...its cool..I work for Micros....long hrs 8-5 but i do have the weekends off to do...hmmmm whatever comes to mind! So you know me and my addiction...im heading str8 to the mall to do what i do best SHOP!! I mean its like a anti-stress thing for me...plus i need to pamper myself. Well bp today i will have to cut it short....but best beleive i will be back with more substance to talk about tommrow...shoot maybe tonite!   :)                          Its saturday....the last day at my old job as an assitant manager...I have decided to try my luck as a Contract programmer...I will be training indivduals around the USA and Europe how to use what ever popular program out in the fast food industry, resturants and hotels as well as airports. I choose this job b/c it allows me to work independantly (growing up I have done very well with independant projects)...and I get to travel the world for weeks at a time ( I still have some places i want to visit)...and the pay is str8. (LOL....i know ur not expecting me to say what the pay rate is....cuzz if u did...JUS NOSEY..lol). Okay back to what i was rambling on about...though I have have to put in some long hours...this might be the job to kick start the other goals that i have. I know that this job will effect my life in many ways...(keeping in contact with friends, being away from family n my peeps) but once again...it will be sort of like a scholarship in the sense that i will be extremely busy n time will determine who n what i can fit in....though I make my own schedule it still will be tedious with travling and all. So it will go a lill sumthing like this...............work for 2-3 weeks in lets say...Germany (that will prolly be for 3-6wks)and n e time after 5 i can do what i want....knowing me; quick bit to eat, shower, get in my cozy cloths, n then im laying it down to sleep...but by the time I get up it will be 9ish...lol..good time for free calls...had i been in the states...oh lord i forgot about the time difference...germany is 6hrs ahead of eastern time. Okay...yea this job is going to be exciting for me....I wish i could do it with some one i knew...thas its only down fall. :(  Ok...lovely BP  I got to pack it up and get ready to head out...I will be in the washington DC area...so hit me up and ill get back to u when.....TIME PERMITS!
