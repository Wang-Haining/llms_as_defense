OF course, they claimed that the data indicated US students are generally dumb as rocks.  Gerald Bracey, my favorite de-bunker, goes after that report with a chainsaw. Enjoy!  ************** I first flew in an airplane in 1961 at age 21, a twin-engine NASA prop from Langley Air Force Base to Cape Canaveral.  I experienced a little queasiness.  I had not had any problem since then until coming back from Detroit last night.  But I determined that the bad feelings in my gut didn't come from the turbulence rocking the A319, but from what I was reading: Do Graduation Tests Measure Up?  From Achieve, Inc.   I give only two horrific examples, one of spun and misleading statistics on page 8 and a baldly wrong statement on page 15.   One graph on page 8 purports to show that while only 48% of the class of 2003 passed the MA high stakes test, MCAS, in math, 95% of the class of 2003 eventually passed..  The graph is from the Massachusetts Department of Education, which should arouse immediate suspicions.  Izzy Stone's basic assumption applies: governments lie.  It should be yours, too.     The problem with the graph is that it does not account for those who dropped out or switched to GED or other programs (in Florida the number of kids getting a GED almost doubled from 2002 to 2003).  When those are taken into account, the pass rate drops into the 70's, lower in areas that are heavily black and Hispanic.  And, of course dropouts and GEDs occur more in minority groups.  Removing these students from the MCAS-taking sample would automatically raise their passing rate, which is relevant to the next graph discussed.   This other graph is labeled 'achievement gap closing' and shows passing rates from 1998 to 2003 by ethnicity.  This graph is horsehockey.  The graph shows passing rates.  Passing rates tell you nothing about whether or not the achievement gap is closing.  To make a judgment about that, you need scores.  A passing rate shows you only how many kids jumped over the hurdle.  It gives no idea how high in the air they got.  My guess is that the minority kids who had to retake the test fell farther and farther behind as the white kids went on to study other stuff.  The report itself says 'the tests are not overly demanding' (p. 1), so while minorities are confined to studying this not overly demanding content, those who passed the test moved on (only 29% of African Americans and 37% of Hispanics passed initially, compared to 77% of whites).   Here are some actual scores that do bear on the achievement gap:   In 1998, whites outscored blacks by 90 points on the SAT verbal and 96 points on the SAT math.  In 2003, whites outscored blacks by 93 points on the SAT verbal and 98 points on the SAT math.  Some reduction in the achievement gap!  (The ethnic composition of the SAT testtaking pool was virtually unchanged over the span of years).     Similarly, on NAEP 8th grade reading, the gap was 28 points in 1998 and 36 points in 2003, while the gaps on 8th grade math were 33 points in 1996 and 32 points in 2003.  Some closure.   I found theses data at the College Board and NAEP websites.  It took about 20 minutes including typing these paragraphs.  Mike Cohen, Achieve's President, and Matt Gandal, a vice president know about these sites and it wouldn't have taken them any longer than it took me, had they wanted to look.  But they didn't.  Why?  I don't know but it's clear that the intent of the report is to persuade, not inform.  In some places it reads like it was funded by test publishers.   A paragraph on page 15 begins 'Because the performance of U . S. high school students in math lags behind that of students in other industrialized nations...'  This is simply not true.  Achieve is lying to you.   In 2000, OECD tested 15-year-olds in 32 mostly industrialized nations in reading, math and science.  The U. S. was average in all three subjects.  But...only three countries had significantly higher scores in reading, only eight in math, and only seven in science.  Most of the countries did not differ significantly from one another (http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2002/2002115a.pdf).    Even in the Final Year apples-to-aardvarks study of the Third International Mathematics and Science Study, the groups of American students most like their European and Asian peers were in the middle of the pack--right where they had been as 8th grades (see my critique of this study in the May, 2000 Educational Researcher).  Oh, by the way, while many final year students in Europe and Asia were getting ready for their national, life-determining exams, ours, knowing what at least the immediate the future held, suffered senior slump.  TIMSS tested American high school seniors with a test that meant absolutely nothing to them in the merry month of May (!).   Among the several thousand people receiving this post are about 800 education writers.  I urge them--and actually all of you--to be more critical of stuff like this bubbling up from the bowels of Achieve.     This report should never have been published, much less publicized.  Michael Kinsley once called the Heritage Foundation a propaganda machine masquerading as a think tank.  Achieve is working hard to assume that mantle as well.   Sincerely,   Gerald W.
