Ko Maw Gyi asks about the Alamo and the famous battle that took place there.\nThe Alamo in San Antonio, Texas, is one of the most famous places in the United States.  More than two million people visit it every year.  The Alamo includes gardens and buildings that provide information about Texas history. But most people go there to see the place where a battle was fought more than one hundred seventy years ago.\nThe battle at the Alamo in eighteen thirty-six was perhaps the most celebrated event in Texas history. The area that is now the state of Texas was then part of Mexico. The people of Texas wanted to change this.  On March second, eighteen thirty-five, a group of Texan leaders declared independence and announced the birth of the Republic of Texas. They named Sam Houston to command the troops.\nTexan fighters defeated Mexican troops in San Antonio in December of eighteen thirty-five. They then occupied the Alamo building.  It was part of a religious center at the time.\nGeneral Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna led the Mexican army to end the Texas rebellion and punish its leaders. The army arrived in San Antonio in February of eighteen thirty-six.  About two hundred Texans inside the Alamo survived for thirteen days against the much larger Mexican army.  These Alamo defenders included the famous Western heroes Jim Bowie and Davy Crockett. But they were defeated and Santa Anna's army entered the Alamo on March sixth.\nHistory experts now say one hundred eighty-nine people defending the Alamo were killed, including Bowie and Crockett.  Different stories tell about how they died, and history experts still cannot agree about which are true.\nThe battle of the Alamo began a series of events important in United States history. Sam Houston and his Texan troops defeated Santa Anna's forces in April of eighteen thirty-six and gained independence. for Texas. Later, the Republic of Texas became part of the United States. People continue to \"Remember the Alamo\" as a heroic struggle against a more powerful opponent.  And as a place where men sacrificed their lives for freedom.\nRobin Thicke\nRobin Thicke has written songs for popular singers including Christina Aguilera, Usher and Mary J.
