The exciting part is that I got to drive there (in a separate car from my siblings and with my dad to supervise, of course). It was going good and I even parked correctly this time! lol. Not something that's frequent with me.  However, after dinner...I swear my dad showed signs of PMS. What's his problem? Kept screeching about take turn now, no this turn!! Well, if I could concentrate maybe, just maybe, I could pay more attention to the light. Wouldn't that be much better? Not to mention, safer? I should just ignore him completely and only pick up when he's talking about turning. There. Well, it's seems childish--but that's how he's acting too.  Then, we came home after stopping for a few groceries from VONS (which btw he didn't help me upload or put them away--the selfish...). Oh, I bought a few magazines and some gum to add to the cart at the store in vengence. Do I need to know what the lastest trends for fall are? Maybe. Or what celebrity is dating who? Hell, no. But will it make my dad spend more money than he has to? Of course. (It's not as if I don't like teen magazines because I do read them but I can live without them.)  My brother Ryan, who's as irritable as hell, comments 'Oh, you have no taste in food....oh, why did you choose that?' My response: where you there--NO, did you bring the food in--NO, then stuff yourself. That and I didn't tell him where the ice cream was or that we even bought it, well, Mr. Think-He-Knows-All can find it on his own.  Why is my family so damn moody?? Later, at home I found my siblings fighting over a ball. A stupid rubber ball. Of course, that triggered my mom. And well...the rest is chaos. Now, I'm not going to say that they're dysfunctional because they aren't but they freak out at the littlest things  way  too much.  On the plus side, I think I'm ready for my behind the wheel test. My permit expires on Aug. 14th and my test is on Aug. 10th. Think that's cutting it too close? It is! I can't believe it. One chance to make or I start all over again. I'll do fine if I'm not nervous though. And as long as neither of my parents are in the car with me (and they won't, yes!).                           I went to Maji's 1st b-day today. The first thing she did when I saw her was cry. I didn't think she liked me that much...(and who wants to be known as making babies cry??) but she actually warmed up to me later. I also saw a bunch of other aunts, uncles, and cousins. But I was mobbed by my grandma (from my dad's side) who then proceed to grope my ass while hugging me. I've noticed that my other grandma, and occassionally my mom, do that sometimes.  What is with the butt thing?  Leave me alone!! ::sigh:: It was still great to see them all again.       How kawaii!  It's s/t my aunt gave me from the cake.   I saw another lil cousin, Anica (she's 3 yrs old), which is always amusing since she's used to having her way and does that most hilarious things. She started to strip her clothes off because she had wanted to swim but Sophie (another baby cousin) had her suit. LOL. Geez, she's bold. Then again, I guess all three-yrs-olds are typically carefree.       Here's the b-day girl!  Eating my kitty...no!! Well, maybe she's attracted to the frosting still on it...                               Well, today the DMV wasn't closed, it just didn't open till 8:30 a.m. instead of its regular 7:30. Why? That's thanks to the 'Saturday session' this week. I had to waited for over an hour in line. Not funny to me. I felt drained when the doors finally opened. Ya know the price for a permit doubles (???) when you have to redo it. ::sigh:: But, as I was in the lil testing room, there was a nervous 1st timer on my left and a confused immigrant on my right. I just sat all calm and checking off answers w/ confidence. However, there were a bit annoying. They seriously needed to relax. And to stop that tapping and frustrating sighing. Plus, never forget how the DMV doesn't care whether you have peace while taking the test. Annoucements were as loud as ever and the people outside of the room didn't have the decency to keep it down. Good thing I used to working under distractions.  Fortunately, I passed the written exam again. 100% this time (the lady turned the 100 into a smiley face). I had three errors the last time and now that I think of it, they were dumb questions to miss. But, oh well...c'est la vie. Now about that behind-the-wheel test...         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
