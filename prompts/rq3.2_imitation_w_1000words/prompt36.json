Not too much going on today.  Pretty quiet here at work, so I figured I'd just take a moment and jot down a few quick lines.    Not feeling well again...dropped off taking my Celexa for a few weeks cause I was switching pharmacies, and now that I'm back on it, it's kicking my ass all over again. Hopefully after a couple more days I'll be feeling 'normal' again.  Loving the hell outta being a redhead.  I almost feel like I should have been born this way.  This must be the way my sister feels about being blonde.  I'm completely looking forward to showing it off at the racetrack.  Most of my friends there had not seen me red before....should be interesting :)  So glad it's Friday.  I'm tired, it's been such a long week.  Not really wanting to do anything for my birthday this weekend.  Steve doesn't believe me, but I'm just so tired and I'd just like to spend a nice quiet, relaxing weekend hanging out at home.  My leg aches so badly today...I know it's going to rain tonite or tomorrow.      It's later now than when I wrote the first part.  I'm so glad I'm not is sale.  It looks like life as they know it is just self-destructing.  I hate talking about work all the time, but this is where I do all my writing.  I feel like I need to get some creativity going again.  I'm not sure if I have something like writer's block, as I'm not really writing about anything.  Maybe it's just because I'm not dealing with problems at home, or Herb-related issues.  For the most part everything is settled.  I guess that doesn't lend itself to being very creative.  There are a lot of things I could talk about.  Not sure if anyone would care to read though.    Let's see...there are a couple of races this weekend, so I guess I'll talk about that.  I know there is something there I have a few strong opinions about.  Namely, the fact that I realize that the NHRA (National Hot Rod Association) is going to dump the hard working men and women who compete in Top Alcohol Dragster and Funny Car in favor of the Pro Modified class.  I have NO problem with Pro Mod, they are some bad-ass cars.  But the way the NHRA has been systematically screwing over the racers who travel the most miles, still have full-time jobs at home, spend the most money getting volunteer crew members into races, and generally are the most local and hard-working people you'll ever meet.  What the hell??    I think that's about it for right now.  I might post later, depending on how I feel (which now at 1pm is still like crap).                       It is Monday morning, and my mind is filled with a thousand regrets.&nbsp; There was so much I wanted to have happen, and almost none of it did.&nbsp; Will I ever again have the pleasure of feeling his lips on mine, of his body pressing me against the wall?&nbsp; For all our talk, our teasing, our flirting, all I have to show for the time spent with him is two hugs.&nbsp; Two hugs, and memories of the man who makes me weak, makes my blood run like fire, makes me think of leaving everything behind just to be with him.&nbsp; It was just like old times.&nbsp; It is painfully obvious that the desire is still there, burning strong after nearly two years apart.&nbsp; And yet at the same time, I had fun with him, laughed with him.&nbsp; There is something about him that makes me feel like I'm 18 again, like anything and everything is possible.&nbsp; I guess I can't complain.&nbsp; I was lucky enough to have almost an hour alone with him, just to sit and talk.&nbsp; And, I did get those two hugs.&nbsp; Lord how I've missed him.&nbsp; This will be the difficult part, getting back to life without him, for another whole year.&nbsp; I will try harder next time to spend more time with him.&nbsp;                       Back at the very beginning of my Blog, I posted a poem that I wrote one night.  Something deep, and powerful, and summing up everything I've felt in the last two years.  I actually dared to share it with another living sole yesterday, someone I work with who is considerably more musically-minded than myself.  Very much to my surprise, Jeff thinks it would make a great song.  I'm kinda torn between 'wow, it would be cool to hear a song I wrote on the radio', and 'wow, I can't tell my husband about this because it would be obvious who it's about'.  I guess I'm getting way ahead of myself there though.  Actually, I think it would make a great Lifehouse song, but I HIGHLY doubt that is even earthly possible.  I'm also borderline sorry that I asked David to take those pics.  I just sit here at my desk all day, staring at that fabulous body that drives me wild.  I feel like I'm not getting any work done again, just sitting here obsessing.  I know it'll be three months until I see him, and that seems like forever from here.  I'm so afraid....afraid something will happen, afraid nothing will happen.  Part of me wants to tell my husband, 'I'm going to this race, whatever happens happens, we won't talk about it, it doesn't mean anything to our relationship, I put up with way too much of your shit everyday and get nothing in return.  Just give me this one weekend for myself'.  Yeah, and I think we all know how well that would go.    I'm also still very frustrated about our fight the other night.  I think I'm getting near the point where I'm just not sure how much more of this I can do.  How many more times I can hear 'get out' and still somehow manage to get beyond it?  I promised myself last time we did this that the next time he said it, I'd do it.  But I couldn't.           \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
