I speak there language, literaly! If you listen to me talk and goerge bush, we sound alike, make no since, dont say nothing of importance, and think a 2x4 upside someones head is way things should be done.  I'm serious now. Im driving to work, someone cuts me off?  Get my gun and shoot them!  Terroist crash planes into World trade center, Goerge, gets a gun and wipes out a country!  Same thing, both pretty dang stupid, dont make since, but by golly, we fell alot better!  so I apeal to the gun totting people!  (mostly redneck republicans)  We both are from midland tx.   we both had failed buisness. (although, I didnt close mine oweing people money)  Now reason dems like me, I believe in social service, I believe in helping the poor (unless its the sob that cuts me off!) I dont mind paying taxs.  (for yall dumb rednecks, how do we pay for the roads you drive on?  the guns we use to kill the millions of innocent people in foreign countries?  taxs stupid!)  I believe that since I am a male I cant tell a woman what to do with her body (although there are a few I would really...oh never mind, thats bad!)  so yea, i could apeal to both side a little, Id make a much better president than george although, a turd in a punch bowl does that!  so call kerry tell him to pick me, and I can quit my job, funnell billions of govt contracts to friends and family, and all will be good in the world!  If you can think of some more reasons why I would make a good running mate, put em down!               One of my bros has been coming over and helping on the pool on weekends.  He is deaf so our communication is not the best.   I sighn worse than I type.   So he comes and helps saturday, about 4pm I thought I asked him to drive me to the hardware store.&nbsp; Guess not.&nbsp; about 30 min later he calls thru relay texas asking what kind of cement I wanted.&nbsp; he just took off without me to get what I needed.&nbsp; and he did get what i needed. was cool.   So sunday, we are working hard on putting down cement, and he tells me his legs are tired from dancing the night before.  Me being the big brother ask the only good question.&nbsp;   'So did you get lucky?'   he says 'arghkdighh'&nbsp; (i dont know what the hell he said)  I said did you 'get with a girl?'   at this point I think we had some more poor communication.&nbsp;  I think he said 2 girls.&nbsp; I know thats what he said.  I said, 'you got with 2 girls same time?'  He said,&nbsp; 'no 2 diffrent girls'  me,&nbsp; 'oh so you got with one girl then got with another in the same night?'  he said something i didnt understand,  something about 2 girls same time, or something.  i then told katy, and he started yelling, stuff i didnt understand.  so i just said to him, 'ok you got with 2 girls same time then 2 diffrent girls diffrent times later?'   at this point &nbsp;he quit talking to me.   so im wondering just what the hell kind of party he went to.  and next time he should invite me!   &nbsp;  editors note.   after reading this after i posted, thought i should clarify.&nbsp; Just picture said brother, and i think you know who it is, getting mad at me, then really getting mad when i said something to katy.   He said some choice words outloud!&nbsp; I think i embaressed him&nbsp;somehow!    &nbsp;               The sun came out  yesterday after 6 days of rain! I was able to work on the pool yesterday evening.  Today should be sunny, and also all weekend.    I should be able to get all the walls up, and concrete collar around them done.  Its suppose to have a heat index of 104 degrees today. And I am happy as hell!  I can drink alot of water, get in shade for breaks, but at least I will be working on my pool.  For those that are interested,  as of now, I should have 7,500 in cost for the pool when Im done. That is for a 14 x 28 foot pool with a 6 foot deep end and 6 foot wide stairs.  and that also includes all the concrete decking im doing.  That same pool made with gunite with me being my own contracor,  would cost about 16,000 to 18,000  and if I had just hired a pool company would have been about 25,000 to 30,000. Also I leveled my yard, and did not destroy any of my shrubs or plants.  A pool company would have ruined alot of them plus tore up my grass in the front yard with there tractors.  It does pay to do it yourself.  Dad might be coming to help this weekend, I sure hope so, I need it.  I will post a pic I have of him driving the backhoe.  He was like a little kid on that thing, quit funny to watch.     \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
