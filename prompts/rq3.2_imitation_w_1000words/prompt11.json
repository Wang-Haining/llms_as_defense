News - Sleazy Guests Prompt Call to Ban Hotel Porn    Mon Jul 26, 9:12 AM ET    OSLO (Reuters) - Angry hotel workers in Norway want to ban pay-TV pornography to stop naked porn-watching guests calling room service to lure female staff to their rooms.   A typical trick by guests, mostly businessmen, is to call the front desk for extras, such as fresh towels, to get female company, said the Norwegian Hotel and Restaurant Workers' Union, reporting a rising number of complaints.  'Most room service personnel work alone. It can be very unpleasant to get called to a room to be met by a naked man,' union leader Eli Ljunggren told Reuters. She said the complaints ranged from sleazy remarks to physical assaults.       'Pornography does not belong in hotel rooms. (Really?)     Pay-TV should be limited to entertainment,' she said. Most Norwegian hotels, like many hotels around the world, have easy access to pornography channels in hotel rooms for a fee.

Moore Slime  Having already angered science fiction writer Ray Bradbury by plundering the title of his best-selling novel for his own film 'Fahrenheit 9/11,' Michael Moore is now being accused of doctoring a newspaper headline shown in the film. Given that every media examination of the 2000 presidential election in Florida found that George W. Bush would have won a statewide recount, Mr. Moore was obviously hard up for headlines that would bolster his claim that the Bush forces had stolen the election. He wound up using one from The Pantagraph, a newspaper in Bloomington, Illinois. In the film a copy of the paper's front page from December 19, 2001 is reproduced with the headline: 'Latest Florida recount shows Gore won election.' The only problem is that The Pantagraph's editors say those words didn't run in its December 19 edition, but rather on December 5 and not on the front page. Instead the headline appeared in much smaller type above a letter to the editor, which the paper says reflects 'only the opinions of the letter writer.' The falsification of historical evidence here is calculated and blatant, and the paper is understandably demanding an apology. Given Mr. Moore's track record of 'hit and run' journalism, however, the paper's editors can expect to wait a long time.                       urlLink Newsday.com - National News : 'Police worry about Taser misuse&nbsp;   FORT WORTH, Texas -- Tasers, the weapons police use to immobilize suspects with a 50,000-volt shock, may be available at the mall as soon as this fall.   Scottsdale, Ariz., -based Taser International and retailer The Sharper Image are negotiating to make the store the only national retailer to carry Tasers.   The store would sell a variation of the Taser used by 5,400 law enforcement agencies nationwide. The consumer version is designed for personal security, and the cycle of electricity from the gun lasts up to 30 seconds.   'It's nonlethal, yet it's extremely effective,' said Steve Tuttle, a spokesman for Taser International. 'People can feel confident that they can knock down the most difficult of targets.'   Although Tasers have been publicly available through phone sales and the company Web site for more than eight years, some police officers worry that wider availability might open the door to criminal use.'                       urlLink KOBTV.com - ABQ woman killed by lightning   Last Update: 08/02/2004 5:00:17 PM By: Reed Upton   An Albuquerque woman was struck by lightning and killed during a hike near Breckenridge, Colorado on Sunday afternoon. The Summit County coroner�s office identifies the woman as Mary Wiper. Wiper had reportedly just recently moved to Albuquerque and was working with the New Mexico chapter of the Sierra Club. According to the Summit County Sheriff�s Office, officers were called at about 3:20 Sunday afternoon after wiper was hit by lightning while hiking. Bystanders had unsuccessfully attempted cardiopulmonary resuscitation on her when paramedics arrived. Paramedics were also unable to revive her. The incident happened in an area known as Little French Gulch, approximately seven miles from downtown Breckenridge. Wiper was hiking with a group of approximately five other people when the strike occurred. She was hit directly and several other members of the group were knocked down by the bolt.

Hehe...    urlLink The Onion Movie Praised For Not Being As Bad As It Could Have Been    'BURBANK, CA�Moviegoers coast to coast hailed Catwoman, the new action film starring Halle Berry, as not as much of an unforgivably awful piece of formulaic commercial pabulum as it could have been.   'You know, I have to hand it to Warner Bros.,' Miami resident Tom Peebles said Monday.   'Catwoman was terrible, but it actually had one or two decent parts. I really have to say: It could have been a lot worse!'   Catwoman, loosely based on the DC Comics character, has similarly shattered other viewers' bottom-of-the-barrel expectations, offering a small number of redeeming features instead of the expected none. 'That one part where the woman pushes Catwoman off a balcony to demonstrate that she can land on her feet was sort of cool, I guess,' said Bangor, ME's Sally Burrows. 'And it was kind of funny when she ate, like, 10 cans of tuna in a row. Oh, and when she drank that glass of cream at the bar�that was, though not exactly funny, at least funny-ish. My kids seemed to like it. Well, Mindy, at least.' 'Mindy just turned 7,' Burrows added.           \n'''\n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
