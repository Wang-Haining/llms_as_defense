I thought for sure I was doing something wrong, and as I continued to look I became more fascinated as to who would be the first to help me find it.  GOOGLE News with their superfast news page?  Nope.  How about world famous Ted Turner and CNN?  No, not here either.  Well if not them, then surely Rupert and the boys over at FOX News will have it.  Hmmmmmm........I just dont see it.  MSNBC?  I mean surely with Bill Gates at the helm I will find what I seek here.  NO Damnit, frustrated again!  What about our foreign friends?  Maybe they can help me find that which I seek.  BBC, my fine British cousin, how bout you?  Do you have it here?  NO.  How about Pravda our fine new Russian allies.  Do you have it hidden away there somewhere?  SKYNEWS?  Anybody???  IS ANYONE STILL LOOKING FOR OSAMA?  Well the sad truth is that no one is apparently minding the store and keeping an eye on the most dangerous man in the world.  Al-Qaida works in cycles for those of you who are uninitiated in the martial arts, and the summertime schedule in the US provides a whole plethera of target rich environments for those wishing us harm.  And yet as I searched through the main pages of the world's most recognized news sights, I couldn't find word one about this man?  Have these people forgotten about 9-11?  Are they ashamed to remind themselves as well as the rest of us about what happened that day?  Those of you in charge of these news organizations should take a hard look in the mirror and ask yourselves if you are doing your jobs to the best of your ability.  People care and they should be able to rely on what they are told.  But what about when none of you are doing the telling?  I hope the next time Osama is back on the front page of all of these websites, its not because he's killed another 3000 Americans.   Arrick                       About time!  The United states has launched offensive military operations against the Taliban forces still in Afghanistan.  US Intelligence agencies in recent weeks have stepped up security apparatus around the country based on 'considerable chatter' by the terrorist network.  There has been considerable concern on an attack trying to intimidate the US elections this fall.  This military action is an attempt to keep the Taliban on the run and to disrupt planning for their continued activities.    It can only be hoped that any actions on the part of US and Coalition forces in Afghanistan, will shake the Taliban and al-Qaida leadership.  Osama bin Laden remains in the mountainous region there, and still is the most dangerous man in the world.  His ultimate capture and execution will end a lot of motivation for the people who continue to reek havoc around the world.  ANY ACTION OR MEASURE SHOULD BE USED TO ACHIEVE THIS PURPOSE!  There are times when the ends does justify the means, and this is certainly one of those times if there ever was one.  ARRICK                       When seems to be the new question of the day my friends.  Not if but when?  Everyone seems convinced that after the al-Qaida bombed the Spanish rail line, they seemed to be at least partially responsible for changing the government over to one not as friendly to the United States.  This new government was democratically elected by the people of Spain in a free election.  Was the bombing of only a few days previously on everyone's mind?  Of course it was.  Was 9-11 on Congress' mind when we passed the Patriot Act?  Of course it was.  People react strangely sometimes when faced with extreme adversity.  WHEN the terrorists hit the United States again, and Im sorry friends but I truly do believe this is going to be the case, they will be doing so with the intention of influencing the American Presidential election.  Unfortunately for the al-Qaida, this is'nt Spain!  You see, this is the part about America everybody else just doesn't get.  When we get hit again, Im afraid that the average Joe Schmo who probably doesn't pay that much attention to politics is going to become involved in the process.  And then my friends they will elect in a landslide the man who they think will go out and kill the bastards who keep trying our patience.  Does anyone really believe that under these circumstances that John Kerry can beat George Bush?  Get your head out of the clouds people and remember who sits in the White House always gets the advantage as the incumbent.  Look at the team he has put together around him, and you see it's a virtual whos who of the US Government over the last 20 years.  Combine with this another attack on the homeland or the capture of Osama binLaden, and George will win running away.  The question is WHEN?   Arrick                           By now you have seen an initial headline or done some reading about the 911 commission report.  To say I was shocked and dismayed at what I have read so far would be a massive understatement.  For the purpose of this article, I would like to concentrate on what I have read and seen from Dulles Airport.    Maybe we could have stopped the other attacks and maybe we couldn't.  That will be debated for generations to come just like the Kennedy assassination.  But we certainly could have stopped the one that came out of Dulles.  Four of five hijackers failed some part of the inspection, two of them failing twice, and yet somehow still were allowed to board the plane.  One who had failed two metal detector tests, still managed not to have his bags checked.  I have seen the video and many still shots already and it just reminds me of everything else about how crazy that day was.  To see these people pass right on through and enroute to their objective, sickens me like nothing has in quite some time.    The whole concept of security at the airports has supposedly changed now, but still, you have to admit those bastards made it look too damn easy.  And this is one of those times friends when I have been inspired to share with you my solution to this problem.  This is one of those things I have written about briefly before.  This would be the perfect duty for the National Guard.  The President should federalize the Guard, declare the airports 'points of national interest', and assign the Guard to lock them down.  Check every single person and package coming and going.  And you revitalize the Guard, and assign them to duty to which they are better suited.  This is much more sensible than having them serve in places like Afghanistan and Iraq, duty to which they are not well trained or equipped for.  Additionally, they should take over all perimeter security for the nation's nuclear reactors.  It is scary how vulnerable some of these places are, even today.  It is noteworthy that The US Coast Guard is adding some 9000 troops, and has been provided a budget through Homeland Security that will update virtually every ship and copter in the fleet.  Its nice to know we are using SOME common sense about these issues.  But let's go all the way.  Most of the items we can address, we can do something about.  Yeah it might cost a lot of money.  But this is America.  We got the money people.  Let's not wait till it's to late to stop another attack.  Nobody will care about the money then either.
