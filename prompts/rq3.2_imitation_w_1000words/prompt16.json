I thought I would try this in order to have a means of keeping a journal... a task I am supposed to do for my Master's degree... and a pursuit I have had on hold now for nearing 2 years. Now over half a year has passed since I made my last entry and NONE of the entries have been about what I am studying! I was excited by blogging only when I found out that html coding was easy enough even for me - self-proclaimed technophobe.   Well, anyway, here I am again. The problem is that I have absolutely nothing profound to offer. I can only offer recent thoughts. Although I am no longer trying to learn Serbian online, I was searching for information on history and the arts in Eastern Europe (after having lengthy conversations re: such with the Russian wife of an American diplomat). Instead I came upon a story of  urlLink Elizabeth Bathory , the Blood Queen of (what was then) Transylvania - a woman who believed the blood of young maidens was the secret to youth.  This was a timely discovery as the movie Van Helsing just opened in Taipei. Normally, I dislike violent movies, but I am always interested to see in which new direction they will take the story each time. I am given pause to wonder what Romanians and Hungarians and all those living near the Carpathians think about what stories Irish Author Bram Stoker and the American film industry have saddled them with.                       Although I sometimes find it quite amusing to read editorials and news in the  urlLink China Post  or the  urlLink Taipei Times , I feel sometimes that we in Taiwan might be slightly underpriviledged in the limited quantity and quality of news we receive that is NOT related to Taiwan.  I rather miss witty editorials and news magazine articles (who can afford to buy news magazines regularly in Asia at US$10 a pop?)complete with forecasts for the future and maybe even some posed solutions.  Looking for such kind of information, I came across the  urlLink World Press Review Directory of Think-Tanks and NGOs . It has a number of sites with interesting articles on current international topics of interest. You can read about the same issues on different country's think tanks' pages and see the problem from a variety of different viewpoints.  Feeling somewhat removed from Canada these days, I will likely start with the commentary section of the  urlLink Canadian Institute of Strategic Studies .                        Note: Logo copied here without permission.                Do you remember the  Oracle of Starbucks ? Did  you know that the woman who appears to have developed the&nbsp;Oracle&nbsp;also  has a personal weblog? You may also remember that all of the possible outcomes  of drinking ANYTHING at Starbucks is BAD! The sad thing is the Oracle of  Starbucks states that I drink sparkling water and shop in designer grocery  stores... and&nbsp;both of these are true! However, as I don't always drink the  same thing at Starbucks, in addition to&nbsp;my heinous habits,&nbsp;I am also  lame and&nbsp;an asshat (whatever that means). Well,&nbsp;you have to be all  those things&nbsp;to waste $90+ (local currency) every time you drink coffee.  For only $50, you can purchase coffee AND breakfast at the other places.  Luckily, I can drink things not recognized by the Oracle to avoid  categorization: tall double low-fat no-foam half-sweet caramel ice latte;  shaken, no ice!   An accountant I know adviced me  that rather than DRINK Starbucks, I should purchase it! Her stock has doubled!  If only I knew how to do that! Anyway, the point of this blog was not to remind  you of the shame you felt the first time you visited the Oracle, but to point  out that the developer's (if I have miscredited... please correct me)  personal&nbsp;weblog  is as interesting as  the website. The&nbsp;entry&nbsp; a guide to understanding  writers  sounds like me the first time I tried writing something here in  current place of employment!                        Over the weekend, I had the pleasure of joining some other expats at Saint's and Sinners Pub for the going away party for one of our acquaintances. Saints and Sinner's is your typical  American pub ... so generic, it could be picked up and dropped into just about any airport in the world and it wouldn't be misplaced! You know the type - with those old-fashioned American ads that someone obviously produces just for pubs like this one! Anyway, we all ordered. I must say that I must have been in Asia for too long, because I no longer notice if there is mayonnaise and asparagus on my pizza or hello kitty fishcakes floating in my soup. Peanut butter on a ham and egg sandwich? No problem!  This was not the case for some of the others. 3 people ordered cheeseburgers. Two of them ate half before decided the rest wasn't worthy of consumption. The third cheeseburger diner; however, decided this was NOT ACCEPTABLE. Being quite fluent in Chinese, she called over the waiter and ranted at him for about 15 minutes re: the poor quality of the stuff stuck between the two fluffy halves of the bun: What kind of filler was used? What kind of humiliation was inflicted on that ground beef? At first, I watched/listened in morbid fascination! Then a Wendy's commercial from the '80s came to mind and I had to laugh!  urlLink 'Where's the beef?'          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
