I think it was 1996 when my tech-savvy girlfriend helped me set up my first Hotmail account. Then in college another computer scientist pal (I seemed to be surrounded by them!) referred me to this newfangled thing called Google for all my search engine needs.   As an advertising copywriter I was given the unholy assignment to write and edit white papers for Hewlett-Packard's division of imaging and printing documentation management services...or something. I remember reading analyst quotes about how the volume of information in the world is doubling every five years and thinking,  is this a good thing ?  I liked information as much as the next guy but this was ridiculous. Overwhelm, entropy, chaos. What can we believe? What sources are valid? Trustworthy? How can we possibly begin to process anything with all the ads and spam and data and reports and stuff being hurtled our way incessantly? And WHY do they have to put 'e-' or 'i-' in front of everything? And WHO are 'they'?   I'm feeling lucky  When I packed up and moved to the San Francisco Bay area the second summer after college, I dreamt of being a full-time yoga instructor but knew it wouldn't happen overnight. Literally within a few days of arriving on the West Coast, I landed a job at the Googenheim itself. GOOGLE.  Decent pay, free lunch, all the soft drinks you could swallow, healthcare, hammocks and babbling brooks in the landscaped lawn surrounding the office complex. For a while I convinced myself it was corporate heaven on earth.  I was hired as a temp in the advertising department. Though the company was prestigious -- who doesn't know and love Google? -- the job was mundane, robotic, unbearable. Sixty other temps and I would review teeny text ads and their corresponding websites against dozens of random policies on everything from grammar to product claims to acceptable versus rejectable pornography. Yes to girl on girl. No to S&M.   Our managers emphasized 'quality,' whatever that meant but what it came down to was a sheer numbers game. How many ads could you review, correctly, in the eight hours of mind numbing screen staring Monday through Friday? I was a caged monkey with a blistered index finger. The other temps lived in constant fear of being laid off, and the flies were already starting to drop. I was invincible though. I had five years of advertising agency experience under my belt. They'd be crazy to let ME go.  Within three weeks I was fired because I treated it like a game. How fast could I go? And I refused to kiss ass. Hindsight is 20/20 but at that moment, I was utterly shaken. I  wailed . My ego was bruised, my root chakra punctured.  What am I going to do now? How am I going to survive without a regular paycheck?    As it turns out, being released from my duties at Google was the best thing ever for my career. The next morning I woke up elated.  I don't have to go to work!  I blanketed Silicon Valley with my yoga teaching resume. I took jobs of varying degrees of oddity to pay the immediate bills. Valet, caterer, limo driver, receptionist, cashier, substitute teacher, medical guinea pig. At the same time I was half-heartedly running four businesses -- my brainchild, Yoga Freedom; a new network marketing venture; an online furniture store; and an educational non-profit. I was overstretched and underpaid.   The yoga gigs came in slowly but surely, enough to where I was able to phase out some of the more heinous employment. Then it went to the other extreme. At one point I was teaching ten or twelve hatha yoga classes each week. Now I was  really  overstretched and my hip flexors had had enough. I was putting all my energy outward and none inward. You know what they say: if you don't go within, you go without. Burnout was imminent.  I quit some of the yoga classes and vowed to take more time for myself, my personal yoga and meditation practice, simple pleasures like walking the dog and watching sitcoms and getting a pedicure. And reading. Oh how I read! Novels, short stories, self-improvement books galore, magazines, websites.   I had come full-circle when I began posting my own Google ads. I clicked 'submit' and sent a little vibe of pity to the poor peon who would be reviewing my ad at the other end.                       confessions of a nervous hippie   In perusing the bookstore shelves lately, I've noticed a sudden spike in the new titles containing the phrase, 'Confessions of...' (a dangerous mind, a teenage drama queen, an ugly stepsister, a grieving Christian, to name the most popular).   Why the sudden need for penance? Or the forewarning: you are about to read a confession? But really, every piece of writing can be viewed as the author's 'confession,' whether she is revealing a deep, dark secret or simply telling it like it is.  I confess! I miss Austin in the spring. At the same time, I love California and it's beautiful and warm and there are nice beaches and mountains and forests. But Austin has SXSW, Eeyore's birthday party and Bob Marley fest, three events quite distinctive to the city, which I have attended for years and will no longer. SXSW is going on next week, I think. For you laymen, it's South by Southwest, a massive convening of musicians, filmmakers and interactive/high tech people upon the city to eat, drink, and rock. (See also www.sxsw.com.) On the downside, it's crowded, expensive and a bitch to park.   Eeyore's, of quite a different vibe, is a one-day tribute to Winnie the Pooh's fictitious donkey friend in Pease Park, complete with drum circles, live music, vegetarian snacks (and greasy meat too), vendors, and every hippie within a 50-mile radius of Austin. If you don't smoke pot, beware where you breathe. And, within a week of Eeyore's is Bob Marley Fest, which is clearly a reggae music festival. It's held at Auditorium Shores, a big grassy field right next to Town Lake, with a killer view of the Austin skyline.   I'm sure there are a plethora of equally great spring and summer festivals here in the Bay Area. Now to find them!          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
