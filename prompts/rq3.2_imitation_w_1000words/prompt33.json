Maybe that’s why I like it so much. I love being a kid; just ask Amelia.   As you know, Disney has 4 parks: The Magic Kingdom, MGM Studios, Epcot and The Animal Kingdom. They all are very different, and obviously very successful. One thing I noticed this time around about The Magic Kingdom was that it felt old-school…  reeeaaalllllly  old-school. It felt like it was conceived at a time when little boy’s adventures consisted of broomstick horses and giant lollypops. I’m sure it still strikes a cord with all the grandparents that get dragged around the park by their grandchildren though. Never-the-less, it’s still a great park.  As a creative professional, I get a charge from going to those parks. You can’t help but be swept away by the magic there. I get back to the office with so many buzzing ideas. The atmosphere allows you to think bigger, and dream longer. I love it.  The same love I have for Disney isn’t shared by many of the locals though. I hear the same small thinking as I did in G.R. about  urlLink Quixtar/Alticor . I don’t think people like to face the fact that 1 or 2 men can change the world through something as basic as capitalism and a dream. It forces them to deal with their own lack of ambition and lack of dreams. That’s a sad way to look at success if you ask me. The success of those companies aught to inspire you, change you, motivate you and free you. Maybe that’s why I like visiting those places. If you have been to Disney you know how overwhelming the attention to detail can be. Also, if you have ever been through the “miracle mile” you know how awe inspiring that can be. Both built by big dreamers. Both inspire. Both challenge your thinking.  I have a gabillion more thoughts on dreamers and inspiration. I’ll save those for my book.                                  urlLink Amelia  and I hit the pavement for a 2 mile walk when I get home from work most nights of the week. This is our time to connect. We chat hand in hand about life, goals, owning a house someday, kids, faith, business, culture... the list goes on. Needless to say it's the highlight of my day.   One of our most talked about subjects is  faith . Not faith as in; what religion we subscribe to. We know where we stand with that one. Instead, we talk about the kind of faith that moves us through the day. You know, things like: I felt forgotten today. Did He forget, or did I lose focus? In fact, that was our most recent conversation.   I came home from work in a rare mood where I felt like God was ignoring me. O.K. I'll confess, the mood is not as rare as I'd like it to be. We have been trying to save money and do some things for some people we love. Just when we get things headed in the right direction our car starts having trouble. I felt forgotten.  Amelia greeted me at the door. I quick change clothes and we hit the pavement. She soon began to tell me about her day and what she was dealing with. It came up that she was feeling the same thing that morning. She, on the other hand, handled it much better than I.  This is one of those times when I just shut-up and listen. She began to tell me how she started listing all the things she was grateful for. Things like good friends and roof over our head. It didn't take long to realize I had lost my focus. She then recounted all the times in our past where we felt like God had forgotten, and in hindsight He was with us every stumble, trip and fall of the way.  I needed those reminders. It was one of those times where God heard my moaning and sent and angel to set my focus back on Him.                       As I looked at the photos of the tragic and inhumane killing of Nicholas Berg I was horrified.  I was confronting the images of our enemy - the people who would kill our families in the same way.  After observing these photos I want to ask you... Who would you rather lead our country?  John Kerry?   A flip flopping people pleaser who changes his tune...  A man who would treat this as a law enforcement issue rather than a matter of war..  A man who blames us first and our enemies second...  A man who would rather appease instead of taking the hard path of confrontation...  What about George Bush?  He has proven he backs up his words with action.  He calls us time and time again to remember that we are in a war.  This is not a law enforcement issue - we must see this issue differently.  He goes after those responsible and calls the best out of America.  He is a man of conviction who chooses a path he believes in rather than the politically rewarding and safe path.  In this time of terror I will choose the man who has principle, honesty, strength and believes in America.  I encourage you to think of your security and to vote for Bush.         \n'''\n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
