  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic:\n\n           Sa2b here. I have yet to tell you more about me. My last name is Tame (same with Camo and Knumchuck). Foxy's last name shall not be released for security reasons. Katt's and Hobbes' last name is Tygre. Pheen's last name is Niks. And finally, Leon's last name is Strechel. I also have some friends that don't live with me:  Cybe (last name not releasable): 18 yrs. Jane Strechel (Leon's sister and Cybe's girlfriend):18 yrs. William Blaine (everybody calls him B.B. for short): 7 yrs. Pyde Arack: 17 yrs. Giette Armour (Pyde's girlfriend and calls B.B. Baby Blaine): 17 yrs.  OK, Mack must be running out of robot ideas. Today he sent a pink robo-bunny holding a drum after us. I kicked it once and its battery fell out. Pa-the-tic. A guy downstairs came back from doing some marshmallow commercial. Before he could even get in the door another guy punched him into a wall. I think the first guy left an imprint. Katt and Camo (against his will) got the double's high score on DDR Max 2. And... hold on.   Gage just called. He told me to post that his dad got HULK on DVD. I've seen it already when it was in theaters. Well, I forgot what I was going to say before. Oh, well. Bye!                      Ummm, where did I leave off? Ohhhhhhhh, yeah.  ' DDR Max, 2! '  Katt gives a gasp of surprise, and Camo gives a gasp of horror. 'I won a DDR Max 2 kiosk!' 'Peeeeeeeeeerrrrrfeh-ka-teh,' says Camo, sarcastically, 'let's go look at some of the other rides.' 'Kay,' says Katt, and she puts the kiosk back in its capsule. They went on a slew of different rides, including the Tilt-O-Whirl (run by my friend Shane), and Katt found out that one of the things Camo should do is eat  after  the rides. At the end of their vacation, they decide to go to the gift shop, run by  urlLink Mandy . 'Hey there!' says Mandy, 'What will you be buying today?' 'Ummm, how about this 1' Nightcrawler action figure?' asks Katt. ' No, that's mine,' says Mandy. 'All 120 of 'em?' says Camo. 'Yes,' says Mandy. 'How about this stand-up cardboard cut-out of Nightcrawler?' asks Camo. 'NO! Not that! Definetly not that!' screams Mandy. 'Okay, we'll just take these issues of Sonic the Hedgehog,' says Katt, all weirded out. 'That'll be $6.57, please,' says Mandy, politely. 'Thanks,' they say, and quickly leave. 'Well, I thought this vacation went pretty well,' says Camo. 'Me too,' says Katt, and she gives Camo a small kiss on the cheek, 'Wanna play DDR when we get home?' 'NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!' screams Camo as he runs off. 'Hey, get back here!' says Katt as she gives chase.   THE END  -Sane Intolerant-                     'RUN AWAY!' the two brothers yell. As they dash away, they think about how handy it is to be able to run faster than a cheetah. 'Hey, wait a minute,' says Camo, 'why are we running when you could just teleport us back?' 'What, and ruin the fun?' says Sa2b. 'There's the hotel,' says Camo, 'get ready to turn.' 'No,' says Sa2b, 'then they'll know where we live. Just keep running.' So they pass the hotel and keep running for about 5 blocks. 'Ok,' says Sa2b, 'now we can teleport.' They both vanish in a puff of smoke and reappear inside their hotel room. 'Maybe we should lay low for a while,' says Camo. 'Yeah, I guess. Hey, want a DP?' said Sa2b. 'Yeah, sure.'   2 nights later...   At 12:00 at night the phone rings. '*Yawn*, hello?' says Sa2b. 'I know where your brother is,' says a mysterious voice. 'Yeah, he's in the bed next to me.' 'Wha, no, the echidna! He's being held at Area 13!' 'What are you talking about?' Suddenly, Sa2b remembers a small child and a giant thunderstorm. 'No way.... Thanksmangottago!' says Sa2b, and he hangs up. 'Camo, Camo, get up!' 'Euh, what is it?' asks Camo, sleepily. Sa2b whispers to him. 'No way!' says Camo. 'That's what I said. Come on!' The two teleport out of the room.   To be continued...  -Sane Intolerant-                     'HOLY CRAP, HE'S GONNA EAT US!' 'Thanks for pointing out the obvious, Sa2b,' says Knumchuck. 'Hey, look down there!' exclaims Foxy. They all look down and see a red cat. 'Hey, you're the girl I saw in the last part of the story!' *Danggit, you've already burned it down and thrown its ashes into the wind! Will ya give it a rest?!* *Geez, sorry!* 'Yeah, and my name is Katt. And that's the Reex.' 'So  that's  why it was called Reex Cave...,' said Sa2b. 'NO FREAKIN' DUH!!' everyone yells. 'Don't worry, I'll help you!' said Katt. Suddenly, she tears out a flat section of a stalagmite and picks up a few rocks. Strange thing is, she didn't use her hands! 'Hey, how are you doing that?' inquires Foxy. 'I'm telekinetic.' 'Oh, so you can move things with your mi-' 'SHUT UP!!' they all yell. Katt jumps up on the section of rock she tore off and floats up to the Reex while holding the rest of the rocks with her mind. She flings the rocks at the Reex and it lets out a roar of pain. Sa2b and company are dropped to the ground. 'Thanks for saving us,' says Camo. 'No prob,' says Katt. The Reex lets out another huge roar and everyone runs away in fear. Suprisingly, they all run at the same speed. 'Hey, you wanna come back to our apartment? I don't think you want to stay here any longer...,' asks Camo. 'Sure, that'd be nice,' says Katt, as she kisses Camo. Just before Camo accidentally trips from being distracted, Sa2b teleports them all out of the cave.
