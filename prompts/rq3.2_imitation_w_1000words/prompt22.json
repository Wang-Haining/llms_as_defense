Which I whole-heartly agree with.  Jessie, my devoted fan (No...really...she is.) 'Yeah music!' - Jessie.  I am sure she meant me.  Make a gripe about people who are like 'I LOVE YOU! MUAH MUAH!' to their   boyfriends/girlfriends/goats/etc after like a day.  Mer.   xxx   Oh goodies. An amazing GREAT GRIPE. Congrats Jessie. We love you. Here goes.   Have you ever been walking down the hallways at school, enjoying YOUR school day (Does that happen?) when you see a couple making out...in the corner....of the hall? Tounges obviously whipping out everywhere. Does this not make you ill? It sick and gross. If you want to make out, go do it in the comfort of your own home, not in a public viewing area. Okay. Kiss. No tounges. No touching. And don't be all like 'AWWW!! I love you baby!!!' Because you know what, I don't feel like seeing your friggin' PDA all the friggin' time. Go into the bathroom, for the love of God! My virgin eyes, Gosh, seriously. Don't do it in front of me, and if you do, next time, I will rip our lips off. Violently. With a chainsaw. I seriously, seriously hate it when people are making out. And i'm not a boyfriendless person either. When was the last time I was all up on Casey and making out? Never. Because it's not....it's not nice. Try me with kindness. I don't like your tounge, or your make-out partner's tounge. KEEP IT IN YOUR MOUTH. GET IT OUT OF MY FACE!! Tounges don't like company, not in public. THEY ARE NOT SOCIAL BEINGS.  They aren't Fraggle's for God's sake. They don't live and mine in a cave and seek help from a friggin' talking trash heap. They like to be alone, in public. When they're in your home, let them go wild, lick all you want. Just not in front of me. Never in front of me. I HATE IT! Do it in front of me and see what happens.  Just like...don't have sex within my bubble. That's right people. And my bubble is the whole room. That's right. Mine.    Song of the moment: -[Perfect Sonnet]- Bright Eyes GRIPE:Like hell...Nothing at the moment. ^-^                    Flavor of the week.    As for life, we see a lot of these, well, i see a lot of them. Short term relationships. It's the way to go if you ask me, unless, you decide to get attached. Attachment is something that no human being should do without consulting the person they've become attached to. Attachment is just like love, a grave mental condition that half of the teenagers in my high school suffer from. Which is the extact reason I've totally given up on love altogether. Finding your soulmate could take years, finding your lifemate could take decades, which I don't have time for. I refuse to go out looking for love now, because I'm totally convinced I can't find it out there. Love is just a stupid thing in my mind. You have someone else to support you, but aren't friends for that? So, you have sex. Get a condom and a friend without a STD and have a ball. Get birth contorl for God's sake. Love is just a painful and pitiful emotion. If you love someone, don't draw a heart around there name and yours, draw a circle, because a circle can never be broke, but a heart can be.     Well, bit of the winter break. i have nothing else to do but Run later, or just sleep. Which sleeping is sounding better and better to me right about now. Well, besides those things, I'm starting to write my book in my free time these few weeks that I have off from school now. Being in high school is a sucky thing, like, when you're in Advanced Acting. If you ask me, too cut-throat. But hell, they got themsleves into a hell of a lot of pain with me, they want the role, too damn bad, I've learned not to crumble, say all they want, They'll eat there words. When I'm famous...one way or another, I'll get there. Newspaper, books, movie director. See you there, this is just High school, deal with my insight, bitches.  But everybody's gone, and I've been here for too long. To face this on my own, well I guess this is growing up. Damn straight.     www.thecloser.org   Go read my review of their Decemeber 19th X-mas Show.     Did I mention how bad-ass RoTK is? Well. It's the most bad-ass. Of course, as my Father and friend Jason said, it was a little homosexual, but who cares!! They're hobbits! Everyone loves Hobbits! I love Hobbits! I even named my new laptop Pippin! I'm naming one of my kids Peregrin! So!! Put that in your pipe and smoke. If anyone wants to go see RoTK again...I'm up for it!!

'It might not be the right time I might not be the right one But there's something about us,  that I want to say because there's something between us anyway. I might not be  The right one It might not be  The Right time. But there's something about us, I've got to do Some kinda secert I will share with you. I need you more than anything in my life. I want you more than anything in my life. I'll miss you more than anyone in my life. I love you more than anyone in my life.'   -[Something About Us]- Daft Punk          \n'''\n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
