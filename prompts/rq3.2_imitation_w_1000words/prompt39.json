Its exam time, for students that tend to leave everything on the backburner like me are now making sure we know our stuff and handing in all our missing assignments in the last two weeks of school. This is the most stressful time of the school year where you miss a lot of sleep and study all night and wake up really early just to refresh your memory because these exams pretty much make you or break you in your future education and career.     I myself have to do quite well in my final exams because I consider myself a average student in everything except technology sciences such as computer science so I have to do well on my other finals or else I may be lying at a 'c-' or possibly even a 'I'(fail) if I do really bad on either my math or socials exam. Ontop of my final exams I also have my provincial exams which are completely new to me but I know they are used to compare schools all across British Columbia which will most likely be quite hard.      Last but not least I also have to take a extra class during the summer to graduate on time such as physics(cause I plan to get my electricians ticket) or math since I was taking a easier version of math when I was younger since I was so lazy.  ****Anyways this whole week is going to be extremely busy for me because I have to make flyers for a new store in surrey, Help a friend put up a neon sign at the mall, work out, do door to door sales, and study and do homework like crazy. So as you can see this week is going to be pretty insane with expectations coming from all over the place.**                     After being through Socials 11 and learning about WW1/2 I seemed to have developed quite a patriotism for Canada and have much more respect for our country as being a peacekeeper and being a democratic and socialist society even tho we also have a bureaucratic government. The reason I am thinking of joining the army is because I really feel like I take my freedom for granted and that I must pay my dues to help protect our country. Another reason I feel like joining is because I have always liked the idea of war and the strategies involved and I subliminally desire to be disciplined.      I realize this could be a decision that could put me in the grave at a young age but its always going to be on my mind. It is not like this is a final decision I have made because there are so many things in the technology field that I could really see myself excelling in such as a electrician, graphic designer, website designer, advertising multimedia, marketing, and since I've started working out firemen and police officer(and yes the soldier again) have come to mind. To summarize my talent or the type of person I am I would say that I am a very creative and technical person who takes risks to achieve greatness. On the other hand I can be unorginized, lazy, and paranoid about how economy will fall, world will end and things like that   For now I think ill just keep my mind on graduating with a good GPA.  Its late, Been great, write to you tomorrow mate.                 Been super busy lately. Friday I got off school at 3:30pm&nbsp;and straight to work until 10 PM, went straight home to go to sleep then got up at 6AM for work in Nanaimo and got back at 10pm then straight to sleep I went again then got up again at 6AM to work at the Pacific National Exhibition lottery home until 5:15 then went for a workout at the gym and crammed 5 hours of homework in for a chapter test in math&nbsp;the next morning. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Things have been quite busy over the summer and I was planning on visiting old freinds and doing outdoor activities more than i have been but work and education get in the way of playtime which kinda sucks but it should pay off in the longrun. I have also changed my dieting program to eat more nutritious foods such as tuna, salmon, and chicken which i prepare in mass amounts to make it convienient to eat every 2-3 hours&nbsp;since i need a minimum intake of 130 grams of protein a day and still take supplements to improve my gains in the gym. &nbsp; **Sorry this post had to be so quick but i really just dont have the time at this moment in time to constantly update my blog. Gunna prepare some food&nbsp;for the next few days&nbsp;and go to sleep to cram geometry the next morning so this is good bye for now. GOOD BYE!**                       I myself am non religious, most likely because I think like a scientist and demand proof which means that I cannot rely on good faith and also because I was sick of going to church as a young child because I found it extremely boring so as soon as I gained freedom to make my own choices I decided that I would not go to church. One reason that I do not believe in religion is because I notice that in the olden days religious leaders used to use censorship, fear, and propaganda in order to keep their followers obeying their orders almost like a militia or a corrupt government and they prevented improvements by banishing anyone who dared to believe that they had more intelligence then church leaders as another way to stay in power for longer. Another thing I do not like is in every religion there tends to be a reward that will be given to a righteous follower in the after life which seems ridiculous because if it really were true and we knew for sure that we would be getting a reward when we die churches would be packed and nobody would commit crimes and people might even try to kill themselves on purpose or like the Islamic cultures where the Muslim men become suicide bombers so they may be known as martyrs.       don't get me wrong now, to everything negative I believe there is a positive and 'modern' churches definitely give out a good vibe because they help people that cannot help themselves, they build a sense of community, people that attend church tend to make the world a better place, and it helps promote social interaction between people which does not happen as much anymore.    I myself could never possibly believe in a greater power that controls the universe, I personally believe that all of us organisms living on the planet earth somehow evolved from small bacterias that began to evolve to better adapt to the changing of the planets characteristics.  **Anyways its the weekend now and its late so I'm going to bed and catch up on some much needed sleep and who knows, maybe ill dream about some sort of greater power telling me something and I will create a religion called 'Brophism' ...lol well L8R!!**         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
