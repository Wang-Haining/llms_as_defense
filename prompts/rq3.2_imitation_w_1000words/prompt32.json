We hung out in LA and it was the best-est time. See, fun enough to use made up words for.. At any rate, I don't even know how to describe him because he is so special. He is totally selfless and caring, but not in a sissy wierdo kind of way. We aren't completely opposites, but we aren't the same, but I don't know. The only thing that is great is the usual stuff that bothers me and makes me worry doesn't. And its hilarious how he is so concerned with Michelle (best friend for those who haven't met her yet) finding flaws in him so things aren't like 'too good to be true'. I don't know, I like the way I feel when I talk to him and .... I'm gonna stop all this talk because I think I'm rambling a little too much here. (Sorry Rob  *wink wink*)  Besides that... more randomness. I haven't been able to get passed an idea that is so simple: Time has never stopped for anyone. Even Jesus was a slave to it. There has never been anyone who didn't have to turn old, who lived forever, remained a child for eternity, etc. It's a fascnating notion really that everything must give way. Water can dissolve absolutely anything through time. Time is so great there is no way of expressing its greatness. How long is infinity and forever? This does help one's everyday struggles as well. Though we may be completely finite, there is comfort in knowing 'this too shall pass.' Everything must come to an end and a new beginning is waiting to get started. Pain can not last forever, niether can sorrow. Though life is full of these emotions, take solace that everyone is on this adventure and carries the same fears and loathings as torches through the endless tunnel of life. They are not permenant and do come and go like other emotions. Some go on to the end where the light has teased and begged them. Others are weary and have stopped on the sides to catch their breath. And still there are those who have stopped all together going or even starting and trying.      Perhaps its the achy body from improper sleep talking, but I started thinking about the artists. Those back in the age of the Renaissance, particualrly. Those men and imexpressable talent and their works have withstood the test of time. Shakespeare, Milton, Homer, Lord Byron, Emily Dickenson, etc. So it begs the question to be asked. Undoubtedly, there are some people who's talent is no great that it is a tower and an immeasurable ruler to compare others by. But is there an artistic part in everyone? Somepeople (me for sure)would kill to be able to paint or draw. We love the work so much that to be able to contribute to society in that way would fill us with the most happiness... But alas, I can draw only cartoons, and I doubt the Louve will ever want a characature of my 10th grade Chemistry professor on its walls, next to greats. So I an a faithful patron at museums and try to live vicariously throuhg the works of those who suffered and gave their lives for their art. So that it wasn't in vain!  I was having a pretty yucky day a few days/weeks ago and I saw Rob, and he got me some Godiva chocolates... but of course it was 94 degrees so it melted... but the gesture was sweeter than the candy. We have been having some tough times... fighting a lot.. but we have been working through it and I think things will be ok. I know my moods can be a little annoying at times, but I think the way I make people feel when I am in a better mood more than makes up for it.. I hate to toot my own horn but BEEP BEEP! Thnaks hunny! I miss you... though I don't say it often enough for ya!     Things just have a habit of going from bad to worse. As a friend once told me, when you think you have hit rock bottom, the floor gives out on you. But oh well, I'd say I have my health, but I'm not feeling well. I'd say I have my friends, but I am just not going there... I have most of my friends and I thank God for them. And I will leave family and school out of this. At any rate, here is an exerp from a story I'm working on.  Please tell me the good and bad parts.   She was in a frenzy to get away from everyone she could. It pained her to be around anyone, even to be seen. She always felt alone, and that was this was the climax of her moments. But now, she craved to stay alone but couldn't. She tried to stop crying, the tears wouldn't. She tried to calm down, her heart told her it shouldn't. He kept following her and she tried to get him to stop. Finally, she gave in. She warned him about her moods and that he didn't want to be around. He replied he wanted to be there for her and she said she didn't. Then in a flash, it seemed like he knew she would hurt him more than ever, and he told her he would see her later. This broke her broken heart further. She thought he didn't care even when he said he did, and now it seemed absolute that he didn't. She had no right to be further upset, but she desperately wanted to believe him and only him. She wanted him to make everything all right, to take her in his arms and calm her. Now, she was devastated. As he turned and walked away, she stared in disbelief. Just as he turned back, she left. Resolute not to give in to anyone; to stay with her emotions alone. She was the only one here now. She is all she knows; she is the shroud of mystery, to herself especially.     '   She walked a ways, and it seemed that she couldn't remember where she was , or where she was going. She finally sat down on the street corner. Her eyes moved up the street to an unusual figure. A woman across the lane holding her child. The brown hair interlocked in the rough hard hands of the mother. The face was scrunched against her chest with his eyes closed as if he were in a deep sleep. But this looked strange, the mother was not singing a lullaby. She was screaming frantically and at the top of her lungs and shaking. Her voice and body shook violently as her tear stained face showed the rawest of pain. The sights and sounds sent chills up and down the spines of everyone within an earshot range.   Who would dare to go near this grieving mother? There was a helpless hopelessness in the abundant in the air this evening, and it seemed to foretell of the season to follow.
