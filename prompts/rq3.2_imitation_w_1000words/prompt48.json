So I give you the first ever edition of:  The Sunday Mok  Routine church service on Sunday, including Dad's stage fright performance. In the afternoon I attended the farewell service for Richard. At the evening service, I sang and performed in a skit. That's three services, and it made me miss my usual Sunday afternoon sleep. My LED light inside my computer has broken, so now the window on the side of the case just looks in on a few boring circuit boards. It could be a while before I replace it - I've got heaps of other stuff I'm saving for. Monday I watched 'Faking it' and Big Brother. I liked Faking It enough to keep watching in coming weeks, and observed some familiar behaviour in BB - a last-ditch romantic effort to get someone's attention that just ends up with humiliation. Tuesday I felt like I got back into the work routine after two days off, but still felt like I was doing less work than I should have been. Made a little progress. Bus ticket prices went down by $4.80 per week for me. Wednesday - still feel like I'm slacking off at work. Decided to start the Sunday posts here. Bought 'Fallen' by Evanesence and 'Peach Pit Politics' by Rookie. Still waiting for the Rookie CD to arrive by post. Had a youth leadership development meeting tonight with Jane and the rest of the youth group leaders. Noticed how Michelle is getting energised for the church. Thursday I felt like I'd temporarily run out of ideas for my weekday blog posts. Until then I'd had a backlog of ideas that I'd been running through at the rate of one per day. The 'rich client' software started to fall to bits. It's a massive tangle of data, events, controls and rules. I don't want to have to keep working on it. I noted my tendency to use any and all change in my pockets to buy food from the vending machine. Friday I managed not to buy anything from the vending machine. I bumped into Lyn, a friend from church who has since moved to another church. Her kids are both getting married, and she seems to be always interested in my love life in a way nobody else is. It's nice to be able to talk about it sometimes. Planned out the coming term of youth group programs along with the SLAM leaders. Ate way too much pizza. Found that Star Wars: Attack of the Clones is playing on Showtime on Monday night, and planned to record it. Saturday I bought Buffy season 2 on DVD and stayed out until 02:00 watching videos and playing Bomberman and Tetris - good retrogaming. Saw Chris for the first time in ages and learned that he's hooked up with a girl he mentioned ages ago. I've been a bit out of touch since he stopped writing to his LiveJournal.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - I think this will work well. PPS - The format may change a bit as I get more used to this.                      The Joys of Code Re-use   Any programmer who's worked on a project of any notable size would like to re-use code. I certainly do, and I usually plan objects that way. I've been working on one project (in C#.NET) for over a year now, and have developed a business layer that is reasonably generic, but still needs lots of work. A few days ago I was given another small project - an online graduate job application form - and I decided to re-use my business code. That part was relatively easy, although it could be easier. The hard part was the web front end.  Okay, to be honest, the web controls code I was using was more specific to the old project, so it wasn't much intended to be re-used, but I did it anyway. That just served to highlight the point that a generic web front end framework would be really useful. Besides the hoops I had to jump through to get the thing working, it's not extensible. If I need a new control - say, a date input - then I can write it, but I need to go back to the original code and modify that, too. This makes me think there is a better way, like an interface. I think I can make it better, but it would take lots of time that the company probably wouldn't pay me for.  In all, and as usual, the more interesting job is writing frameworks, tools and components rather than writing actual applications.   Mokalus of Borg  PS - A true hacker, I suppose, is the programming equivalent of a research professor. PPS - That is, the ideas matter more than whether this will actually be used by anyone.                     There are no Jedi and, furthermore, you are not Luke Skywalker. What is it about our lives that makes us seek fantasy? Is it the realisation that we are as boring as everyone else, or is it that increasingly unreal movies have created a thirst for the life less ordinary? It's probably both. Whether we just want to go on holiday or have adventures on a starship in a galaxy far, far away, we all seem to have some desire to shake off the dust of this one-horse town, so to speak.  The rut we dig ourselves into, before it gets too deep to see, becomes uncomfortable, and we look to hoist ourselves out and start something fresh. No harm in that, I suppose - neophilia has served to inspire many people. The problems come when we stay away and don't bring back our stories and lessons to the everyday world.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - I am now about a third of the way through reading ' urlLink The Last Command '. PPS - And I may be having a little trouble telling fantasy from reality.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
