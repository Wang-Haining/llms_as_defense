  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic:\n\n             Leibniz once said, 'Necessary truths, on the other hand, are founded upon the principle of contradiction.' I like Leibniz.  At least in his thoughts I find some of my own.  The educational tensions we experience may stem more from the contradiction of being human as much as contradictions in pedagogy and  urlLink curriculum . It seems reasonable that we should inquire as to what makes learning real to students.  Just as it seems reasonable that we try to make ourselves 'real' to learners rather than 'fake.' Whatever may be the criteria for 'realness,' we sense that this matter is important.    Oddly, as educators we spend an interminable amount of time questing to understand knowledge (a philosophical branch called  urlLink  epistemology  ) but mostly shy away from  urlLink  metaphysics   (the branch of philosophy that grapples with matters of reality). Yet, the matter of 'realness' versus 'fakeness' continues to sneak up on us as it has through the ages from pre-Socratic times right up until the Wachowski brothers, who captured our imagination momentarily with the first   Matrix  installment.  Philosophers, artists, and scientists have been toying with 'reality' for the better part of the 20th Century and any  uncertainty  (Heisenberg) suggested by scientists can provoke peers to cry out, 'God does not play dice' (Einstein)!  It appears that contradictions are inevitable especially whenever a practical application is attempted.  Even when we give credence to the existentialist ideal that reality is merely  point of view , arguments never cease!  In general, scientists accept truth by consensus (more so than artists and philosophers?), for as long as skepticism exists and testing persists, there will always remain 'checks and balances.'  The trouble with philosophy and art, of course, lies in the fact that 'proof' is achieved through rational thought (i.e.,  a priori ).  Not easy to argue by  logic  alone!  Why anyone chooses to investigate problems that are insoluble has always puzzled the pragmatist (sometimes referred to as the 'practical' thinker).  The pragmatist, according to William James, is likely to 'turn his back resolutely and once for all upon a lot of inveterate habits dear to professional philosophers away from abstraction and insufficiency, from verbal solutions from bad  a priori  reasons.'  Should we wonder that American ideology was founded upon Pragmatists, particularly the educational system, since capitalism necessarily requires practical means?  Ah! Ideally, life ought to afford humans time enough for both philosophical musings and practical applications (if one so desires).  It takes pragmatism to navigate daily life, to find a companion, to raise children, to labor and to survive.  On the other hand, it takes a lifetime of contemplation to fall in love, to create art, to be curious about the world and to venture into the unknown.   PS I suspect that we have all practiced the art of  being real   or  faking it , at one time or another...(Nieminen vs Lecavalier anyone?)                       GAIL SAID:  I couldn't resist responding to your 'E-mail as a propaganda tool' e-mail.    Technology has, of course, been employed for propaganda for some time. The Nazis were quite adept at recognizing the power of new technologies for the purpose of propaganda and manipulated multiple technologies to disseminate their message. Radio, airplanes, and even television comprised mediums by which the Nazis successfully propagated their ideology. Modern political parties similarly employ whatever technology furthers their ends.  Computers have added a new dimension to the propaganda game through websites, newsgroups, and, following the train of advertising which is in itself a form of propaganda, those immeasurably annoying pop-up ads. Thus far, however, the use of e-mail as propaganda has seemed to consist mostly of a grassroots movement. Case in point, Anne-Marie passed on a couple of e-mails from individual citizens who took the time to express and collect like-minded political views. Although the technology of the medium itself is advanced, i.e. computers and the world wide web, the dispersal strategy is an old one: essentially chain mail. You send it to someone. And they pass it on to five friends. And so on. And so on.   How effective is a chain letter?   You tell me. Back in the 'good ole days' of snail mail (for those old enough to remember them), did you ever forward a chain letter? I donâ€™t recall actually having received one, but knowing myself as I do, I likely would not have sent it on.   Do I forward chain letters that I receive now over the Internet? No. I may read them depending strictly upon the subject matter. But essentially I treat them as junk mail. They inundate my mailbox and, more significantly, consume valuable time to peruse. My 'real' mail compels lengthy enough consideration and response; the burden of unsolicited information, regardless of its content, annoys me boundlessly.   To forward an e-mail or not to forward? That is not a question. My rationale for not forwarding is one of empathy: I am caught on the receiving end of this time-consumer, why on earth would I visit it upon anyone I know?   Perhaps that is why e-mail has yet to be exploited by major players in the political world as a medium for propaganda. They recognize that it has quite limited potential and hence remains a grassroots form of dispensing information. Of course, there is always bulk mailing and undoubtedly, as soon as someone figures out how to automatically forward junk e-mail to everyone in your mail box propaganda by e-mail will reach its saturation point.           \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
