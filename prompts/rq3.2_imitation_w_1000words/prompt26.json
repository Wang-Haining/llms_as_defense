DOWNLOAD THIS PLURAMON TRACK NOW. its totally mbv's 'touch my breath' & 'loomer' combined.   urlLink pluramon - hello shadow                                oasis i still love you. it took me a while to 'get' heathen chemistry but i've realized hindu times is probably one of their best songs since slide away. plus liams got the same godamn jacket i do. this means jack shit but in case anyone questions my taste in leather, you can take it up with mr gallagher. he'll stick a champagne supernova up your bum.     memorable oasis quotes!  'If I saw an alien I'd tell it to fuck right off because whatever planet he came from they wouldn't have the Beatles or any decent fucking music. So they can fuck right off, I ain't going nowhere with them.'  - liam  'It is hard to be modest at times like these so I won't even try...you are all shit!'  - noel   'I was staring in the mirror, and I saw god staring back at me' - liam   'It's a good thing we won, because we were going to thrash the place if we didn't.' - liam after getting another award  'Being a lad is what I'm about. I can tell you who isn't a lad - anyone from Blur.'  - liam on being a lad   Noel orders a beer, the rest opt for lemonades and Cokes. Above, the TV is on CNN News. 'Have you seen some of the stories they have on here?' Noel enquires. 'Check this one I saw this morning. There's this guy who's 75 and he's got cancer. So his doctor tells him he's got about two years to live. So he thinks, 'Fuck it, I've always hated my wife, the stupid bag.' So he kills her. 'What the fuck, I've got nothing to lose.' Then he's put in jail but, the problem is, he doesn't die. He's 99 now and guess what he's doing?' Noel surveys our expectant faces. 'Suing the doctor,' he cackles. 'He's taking him to court,' he continues, pissing himself. 'And he's saying, ' If it wasn't for what you told me I would never have killed my wife and now you owe me ten million pounds.' I'm sitting there thinking, 'I know I live in a mad country but it's not half as crazy as it is here.'' - noel in america                                  as if there werent enough breasts sporadically bursting out lately. GODAMNIT   urlLink COURTNEY LOVE KILLS HER POSSIBLY FICTIONAL BABY    urlLink further proof that john mayer is the biggest loser in the world   nyc's  urlLink dfa records  have legally forced toronto's  urlLink death from above  to change their name. they're now known as FIRST TO FIGHT.   heres the word from the FIRST TO FIGHT boys:  quote: 'hello due to legal issues we want nothing to do with we have had to change our name the people at DFA records apparently trademarked DEATH FROM ABOVE in america and so our label in america (vice/atlantic) wont release our record as long as they have taken legal action. we tried for the last 3 weeks to make this go away, we had the best lawyers working on it non stop, we tried everything. but now, rather than fooling around with this anymore we have had to change our name to FIRST TO FIGHT. we went through about 100000000 names and they all sucked in thier own special way.  so nothing will change on here for awhile cause im not at home and the all important logo is still the same. its a downer but it had to happen. a rose by any other name, right?  so in closing FUCK DFA RECORDS FUCK JAMES MURPHY WE DECLARE JIHAD ON THEM HOLY WAR ENDING IN THIER DEATH AND DISMEMBERMENT  -j f k'  oh jesse. 'THIER THIER' it'll be ok.                                you know what? im just going to get this out now. I LOVE HIPSTERS. SERIOUSLY. a hipsters life is seriously the source of oh so much hilarity! hello nyc! meg! jasmine! you know how it is! either way this is the best and funniest thing i've read in a while. this is a story about..get this... urlLink FRIENDSTER ! aimee now has the floor. ps i love aimee.  urlLink  CLICK CLICK   anyway someone explain to me the hype surrounding  urlLink tv on the radio  cause im not feeling it yet.. have they even written a song about nyc yet? everyone knows if you're living/from there you HAVE to write about nyc. interpol and the strokes did and look where they are now?  duhhhh     thora birch looking hot for the first time in her life? now everyone scatter to your american beauty dvd for the full on nudity scene! ps she was 16 while the film was shot? how did that even pan out?   tigre benvie! why oh why did you leave montreals' indie pop icons  urlLink the dears ? oooh scandalous not really. i guess hes going to school in toronto or something. not really. though i want to remind everyone that he was in the seminal canadian rock band THRUSH HERMIT! you'd also be able to hear him on the first  urlLink joel plaskett  record. im pretty sure being within 5 feet of joel plaskett for even a few mere moments makes you a genius. word to awkward alliteration. either way check out benvies  urlLink new project  whenever it actually stirs up.   if you havent already, watch  urlLink the rapture - house of jealous lovers video . good luck. i have no idea how anyone could possibly stay still during this song.             \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
