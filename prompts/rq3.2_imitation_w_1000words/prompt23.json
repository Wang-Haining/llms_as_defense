I'm currently on page 63 (Chapter 18) of my rewrite of  urlLink The Duality of His Life  (44,500 words).  I just realized something last night.  As I mentioned in my Blog entitled 'So what is a novel anyway?' (Wed Apr 21), I started this rewrite by getting rid of the first half of the manuscript, which left a text containing 22,500 words.  My first thought was to do a simple edit, since the manuscript was largely finished before I hacked it up.  Writing another 7,500 words to get it to novel length seemed more than I was ready to do, given the option of publishing it as a strong short story.  trepidation.  So I got my pricing and started the edit.  As I moved forward, I realized that their were a lot of opportunities for improvement.  I guess the best way to explain my initial trepidation is that, after the completion of  urlLink Sanguine Fluid , I was left with the feeling that it would be very challenging to write something this good again.  But I got into the zone again with Duality and, before I knew it, I had crossed the 30,000 word mark and was just 4 chapters into the edit.  It was at this point I realized that I was actually rewriting the story, not simply editing it.  It deserved a rewrite and I was just the man to do it.  My motivation became self-fulfilling.    Then I reached my second point of trepidation.  I crossed 40,000 wordcount and took a good look a stab at what my ultimate goal should be.  Through calculations based on my previous experience I came up with 70,000 words.  This initially took me back, but last night I just looked at it as doing the same thing I had just done over the last several months again.  I added 22,000 valuable words and I just need another 22,000 to 26,000 more to reach my goal.  Again, since I'm only on page 63 of a manuscript that is presently 132 pages long (8 1/2 by 11), I have 50% of the story remaining to be rewritten.  This is exactly were I need to be.  And the bottom line is, my creativity transcends each book I write.  The only limits it has are those that I artificially introduce.     urlLink SerialThriller.com         One fan is just as important as one million.   I thought I might share a special email interaction I had with a high school student from Pt. St. Lucie, Florida this past February.  Since she is a minor, I will refer to her as Spring.  Names within the emails have also been changed to protect the family's privacy.

St. Lucie, FL  34984-4720  In her final email to me (which I unfortunately can't locate because she sent it during my transition from New York and Massachusetts), I believe Spring mentioned that she received an A for the essay, was invited to deliver it in front of the class and was given special praise for the extra effort she put into the project.    So what is the moral of this story.  Sometimes, especially when you are in the middle of writing a story, it can feel kind of lonely because you are the only person aware of the world you are creating.  It can also be scary because, as much as one derives self-fulfillment from its completion, acceptance by the outside world is always a concern and you just don't know whether it will be there.  It's important to remember that writing is an art, an expression of yourself.  Just as in this case, you may find appreciation from the most unlikely places.  I am primarily an author of hard core horror (though I also dabble in drama), yet a teenager who is not yet allowed to even read my books found a way to make a connection that enriched both of our lifes, no matter how brief our interaction.  Let's take that to the next level.  When you publish a story, it cannot be unwritten.  You are now immortalized and, some might say, the book is more important than your own life because it will still be here long after you have returned to your maker.    So, I am convinced that if you stay true to yourself in your writing, reward will find you.  It might not be the monetary reward every new author dreams about, but that type of gain won't make you a better person, husband, wife, son, daughter or friend either.
