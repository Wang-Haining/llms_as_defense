I went out to the Montreal International Jazz Festival in the afternoon and then went to the Canada Day concert that evening at the Old Port Montreal... after that I saw the firework which was lots of fun... The rest of the week has been really hot so I went out to downtown to shop and chill out. I watch MIB2 last night which I am kind of disappointed, all these new movies all disappointed me... Why can't they made them better??? Anyhow, today I had a fight with my little brother Jacky... he was being a Jerk or more like a stubborn jerk who just assume things too much and only hear part of a conversation and immediately jump to a conclusion. Horrible personality... So that sort of stop all my initative to do anything for him... My brother always believe what he thinks is always right and never really look at things from another perspective... I don't know what to do but freakly I don't care anymore... anyway, today was the 4th July and I hope that all the boardie will have a wonderful day and wonderfull weekend... anyhow, I will drop a line sometimes soon... coolio... sweet sweet...  Peter                               Ah... what a nice day here in China... yes, I am in my china office right now :) I will take some pictures of my office and show you guys in the next few days :) Pretty nice place, especailly in China... you probably won't find a factory in china that is cleaner and more beautiful then mine.... haha, I am not being cocky, but it is true. I have been to so so so many factories here, most of them got horrible working conditions... I really feel bad for the workers in those company. Some people who works for those company make less then USD100/month... I guess that's what we hear about all the time on the news in North America. But not everybody one makes that little money. Some people do make a good salary in Chinese standard, for example, some of the designer in my company could be making around USD2500/month. Of course that's not comparable to North America, but that's a lot of money in China, especially when you can get a meal for less then 25 cents US.  Anyway, it is about time to get back to work. I will post some pictures of my office in the next few days. In the mean time, have a nice day everyone :) Take care. Ciao.  Peter                               (Sorry that I haven't update this blog for so many months, my life is pretty hactic right now.) First I would like to say, I have been back in Hong Kong for about 3 months now. I liked the city and I sort of liked my job but I wan't that happy and I feel pretty depress since I came in town. I really don't know why is that happening. It was only until tonight that I realized what's wrong with me! Tonight, Mikey, Dave, Stan, John and my friend Chad (not a boardie) have been trying to cheer me up because I was complaining about my love life. I was complaining about how I don't have a boyfriend. I was complaining on how nobody ever loves me and everyone only wants to be my friend. I don't know why I feel that way, but I just do. I thought that's the reason why I am sad and that's the reason why I am kind of depress but it is not.  I am not sad because I don't have a boyfriend, it was more like the fact that I am so far away from all my friends back home. For an example, Chad, a friend that I met from second year of university whom I haven't talk to for ages came online tonight. I immediately got so excited and I felt that I am the happiest person on this planet. Later on that night, a friend Adam from school and a friend Darren from high school also dropped me a line and I became even happier since. I think I am not sad because I don't have a boyfriend (althought that just increases my sadness) but I am sad because I don't get to talk to all my friends back home.  I have been saying I need a bf since I came out, and I have been complaining about my love life but none of these were the real issues. They were just the fuel to a more complex problem. My real problem is that I am not that happy here in Hong Kong. Not because of work, not because of the environment nor was it the culture or the people but it was more like I am bore and I don't know anyone. I want to chat with my friends back home but due to the time difference, it is very difficult. There is no where I can share my daily experience with the most important group of people in my life and that's why I am sad. I donno how can I fix this problem and I don't see there is any easy solutions, I guess I will just have to live with this and do my best to keep in touch. But I think I am strong and I will survive. As time goes, I am sure everything is ok. Hopefull that's true. Anyway, to all my friends, I just want to say I love you guys and girls. MUAH... Ciao.
