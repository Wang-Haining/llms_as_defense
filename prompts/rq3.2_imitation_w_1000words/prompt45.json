  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic:\n\n       My choices for entertainment this evening, after the&nbsp;family&nbsp;got bedded down,&nbsp;were numerous:     Watch the donks' convention  Break out the telescope and gaze at the Moon  Blog  Fix the kitchen chairs  Assemble the dresser for the baby's room  Re-organize the pantry  Fix the fridge's ice maker  Sit on the deck and drink copious quantities of rum   Number 1, watching the donks convention was right out, as I've heard it all before and I can't afford to break anything and the discharge of firearms is discouraged in this community.  Number 2 was out; while it's a rare clear night around here, it's also Garbage Night; so the hour I had for being outside got consumed with other endeavors.  Numbers 4, 5, 6, & 7 got shot down, as the rest of the family is sleeping and I shouldn't make any excessive noise.  Number 8 is not an option, as I can't in good conscience sit on my ass when there's so much yet to be done.  Fortunately; I found a happy alternative:&nbsp; blog and drink copious quantities of rum               I'd be lying if I said that I wasn't getting a chuckle out of  urlLink Lance Armstrong  mopping up the field in the Tour de france.&nbsp; Here's the premier event in france (name something bigger in france.....I didn't think so) and the entire cycling world is getting it's collective ass kicked by Lance Armstrong, American.&nbsp; For the sixth consecutive year.&nbsp; They should just go ahead and change the name to 'Tour de Lance' and be done with it.   At the end of today's stage, our hero's lead is something like six and two / thirds minutes over the second place guy.&nbsp; The man in a fookin' machine; he smoked the field today, biking 34.18 miles in one hour, six minutes, and thirty-nine seconds. &nbsp;That's over 30 mph to you and me.   Wow.   I was on the (old and decrepit) mountain bike this evening, and rode about 10 miles in just over an hour and twenty minutes.&nbsp; I'm beat and my rump hasn't been this sore since the last time I rode the bike for over an hour, and I don't have to get up&nbsp;in the morning and ride over 100 miles to paris.&nbsp; Re-hydrating with a large jug of Ernest &amp; Julio Gallo's finest isn't going to help my cause.   Bravo, Lance.               urlLink Rachel Lucas  offers some excellent commentary on&nbsp;Flight 327.&nbsp; Go read&nbsp;all her posts in the 'Gimme Valium' series right now.  This whole 'Flight 327' thing should drive us all into some serious introspection:&nbsp; what would you have done if you were in Annie Jacobsen's seat?&nbsp; I'm semi-observant and obnoxious enough and my voice carries well; I'd like to think that I'd have been spouting out a very loud running Keith Jackson-esque play by play commentary regarding the goings-on in the cabin.&nbsp; What would I have done if I were travelling with my wife and children?&nbsp; Would I have been more vocal, or less?&nbsp; And why?&nbsp;   If there were Air Marshalls on the flight, what were they doing?&nbsp; The in-flight magazine is not that interesting.&nbsp; Picture all the sheeple, talking in hushed tones and passing notes, waiting for someone (else)&nbsp;to Do.Something.&nbsp; Are we still so deeply embedded in political correctness that the 'Todd Beemer'-type personality is rare?&nbsp; Where is the man (or woman) who would stand up and say 'Hey! WTF are you people doing?&nbsp; Sit down or we'll kick your ass'?&nbsp; To continue in&nbsp;the line of thinking that Rachel explores, prior to 11 September we had no frame of reference, no hard reasons to overcome our political correctness to question 14 Arab-looking men merely on the basis of their Arab-looking-ness.&nbsp; We have such a frame of reference now.&nbsp; I agree with her: the next time I get on a plane and see a congregation of Arab-looking men, I'm going to be singing like a canary, and not worry about who I piss off.  Go read Rachel's posts, follow the links&nbsp;and sit down and do some serious soul searching.  &nbsp;  I'm actually waiting for the left to bring Flight 327 up as an example of GWB's failure to do something about terrorism at home.&nbsp; It is an election year, after all.                    So anyway  I found myself in a bookstore in the mall this afternoon.  Man, did that put me in a funk.  They had a display of Reagan 'memorabilia' books on an end cap and, being in AnnArbor (aka 'Moscow on the Huron')  every other shelf  on the end cap had al franken's book of psychotic ramblings, interspersed with the Reagan books.  Keep in mind that I had to walk past roughly two pallets of billyjeff's thousand page 'Love ME' yawn-fest and a life sized cardboard cut out of michael moore (how many trees had to die for that?) just to get into the store.  So I end up in the 'Political Commentary' section of the store (go figure) and I'm already pissed off, and there is a shelf of billyjeff's book and a shelf of hitlery's book.  Retching, I staggered away, bumbling into the next aisle.  Down on the bottom shelf, certainly not 'Alphabetical By Author', I find it.  I grab the only three copies on the shelf and go back around the corner where I interspersed the clinton's books with  urlLink Ann Coulter's   urlLink  'Treason'  .  The Missus is still asking me just what the hell was so funny in the mall.....  Maybe we should start a Movement.  Sure it's not quite like Hoffman's 'Steal This Book' or Arlo Guthrie's 'Alice's restaurant' movement, but it sure would be fun.  The next time you are anywhere books are sold, do a little stock shuffling.  'Treason' juxtaposed with billyjeff's or hitlery's books makes a nice statement.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
