Too bad the dinner hasn't worked out yet. Maybe someday, huh? I hope you had a good birthday. And you may have the first Shrek CD but I am getting the Shrek 2 CD for you somehow so we can blare 'Hero.' I saw interviews from it the other day and it made me remember how funny it is all over again.    Next movie recommendation:   The Terminal . Very, very good movie. A bit long, but overall very cute. However, if you have not seen  In America , I will drag you out of whatever location you are in and place you in front of a TV with a DVD player so that you can see it and love it.   Muhaha  . My evil plan for the world- to make everyone watch a movie about a poor Irish family in Hell's Kitchen, New York.    ANNOUNCEMENT:  My favorite band of all time, Five for Fighting, can now be played on my blog. It doesn't come in very well as of yet, but it will be perfect bait for you to go out and buy  The Battle for Everything , their newest CD. Or you can get  America Town , the CD which features 'Superman' or  Message from Albert... , their first CD. I got their autographs when they came to Memphis when I was 14. OMG it was amazing as well as my first concert. So, in order to show the genius of John Ondrasik's lyrics, here is the chorus of 'If God Made You.'    Sunset sailing on April skies Bloodshot fire clouds in her eyes I can't say what I might believe  But if God made you he's in love with me   Happy Birthday, mon ami.                      All hail the return of the Governor's School kids! I am so very excited and have missed them terribly: Katie Camille, Morgan, Eric, Rachel,  EVERYONE! YAY!  I'm sure they all had a fabulous time. Morgan was apparently the choir slut.  Hehe . I saw Eric today which was glorious and he told me that he is directing Barefoot in the Park this year.  Lovely.  I am going to be doing the cabaret and it will great, simple, elegant fun.  I gave Miles a ton of the paperbacks which Mom and I read. She is reading The Notebook as I type this, most likely off of the sugar high from the  insanely lethal cookies  we had today. She and Xander and I had a grand time dancing to her mix in the car. Poor Xander didn't get to steal it though.  Sad.  Perhaps I'll steal it first.     We sit here Silently Watching the ducks  And eating mystery meat   We wait here  Lying  In a dandelion ring Tossing toothpicks in the air  We dance here  Serving  In a sea of comedy  With words we've never heard  We help here  Smiling Seeing it clearly A group of good hearts and minds  We laugh here  Waiting  Random anticipation  Falling over onto gravel   We love here  Reeling  Day like no other And the dandelions sing...                      TGIF, ladies and gentlemen! Now, normally, TGIF would mean 'Thank God It's Friday,' however, for me at least, I think it is time for a new abbreviation. So here goes:  &nbsp;   T  stands for Tae Bo, which is totally awesome. I did a 45 minute version of it last night- twice! Exercise diva? I think so.  &nbsp;   G  stands for Going away, seeing as I will be doing that starting on Wednesday. Thank God! However, I will miss everyone terribly but have promised to bring Sallis frostees haha.  &nbsp;   I  stands for Internet- Amanda got an sn! Finally! Amanda is my best friend up in Chicago whom I saw over spring break. I shall soon invite her into the world of blogging. Muhaha.  &nbsp;   F  stands for food- I have a new cookie recipe, and I am going to try it and bring it for all my soup kitchen friends on Sunday. Soup kitchen rocks. Even Brad the creepy waiter guy.  &nbsp;  I wanted to post something on DOY today, but backed out and posted something else. Something about it just makes me nervous. I'll get over it. Oh and Sallis? I'm kicking your&nbsp;ass at Halo someday soon.  &nbsp;   I could wait for all the hours    It could take to fill a day    I would stand the test of time    To get your heart    I would brave&nbsp;the nastiest storm    That this city's ever seen    Just to hold your hand for a second    Yes, longer than before    We'd exist in symphony    And the notes would fill our ears    Beautiful sounds just playing    In the night    The stars would take a bow for us    And twinkle all the more    And the man in the moon there    Would&nbsp;be smiling&nbsp;    The grass would touch our toes and feet    As we run along the bend    With a chance to change the way    Our worlds have been    No rhythm, no rhyme and    Time would not exist&nbsp;    Seconds simply tick    As we run into the sun    Just    Smile.    :)  Happy Friday to all!              \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
