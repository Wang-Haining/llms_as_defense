We went to meet Keris, they were feeling kinda of down. Pity them. After that, we went and have a drink at Mas Ayu wif the other Kelana guys. Hmm...ayu cracking jokes about Talib, all the way from Bukit Batok to Mas Ayu. We were out control...giggling and laughing our hearts out throughout the journey. Irony.  I woke up late this morning. Marking my karangan...the neverending ordeal. After this, Im suppose to meet my P6EM3. I just realise how happy I am. although Im shoudering a lot of responsibilities.   The other day, my sis saw Khai, presuming with his wife. Hmm...life, what can I say. Yet, the bigger picture is, trust, guys and marriage. Marriage is a huge responsibility... a commitment. Nevertheless, when to think of it back, everything make sense. Maybe, it was a good thing in getting to know him, yup...he hurt me, but if we were to look at it at another perspective, he had hurt his partner even more, the trust. Me, being the third party. Retribution, I do not want to see it coming. I love my dear Hanip so much. Even to think of it, will make me sick. Then again, if it is meant to be...then be it. In life we have to be strong in tackling problem. It can be him and it can be me. He told me,  feelings can change, which is terribly true.     2.55 pm   Just finish cutting the tickets, the alignment has gone haywired. Ismail has been bugging me on the tickets. Hmm...Im searching for the C.C chop, I misplaced it , somehow. Im tired. My eyes are tired. Im tired. Ismail asked me whether they can use the mirror room. I try to see what I can do.    5.55 pm  Hmm...at de spur of moments, things can change. Now, Im feeling restless. Sad.   ' Which is one is better, 3 years or one n a half year...'  I think it is better if it is 3 years, then I won't be leaving in denial.  An everlasting commitment... ' the person can be me or you...' it can be Me or you...  &nbsp;     Kris Dayanti & Ajai             Hmm...my blogspot...where I share my deepest worries and at the same time ambition. My dear officer cheated on me. Yup. I used the word cheated. He is married. Yup, don't believe it but my dear sis saw it...and that is the conclusion,no wonder he wanted to take things slow.Therefore, she saw him after I met my dream guy.   Anyway, luckily I choose my Shariff or should I say that the Kelana guy came in my life at the right time. 3 days before he came back from Taiwan, Ive already made up my mind to be with Shariff Sah...eheheh.Its true ... if it is meant to be, then it will be.   How many times I tried to forget him, again and again memories with him will always emerged beneath my desperate soul. I tried all means to forget and hate him...very difficult. Shariff here, is a Taurus,  traditional Taurus Traits Patient and reliable Warmhearted and loving Persistent and determined Placid and security loving  On the dark side....  Jealous and possessive Resentful and inflexible Self-indulgent and greedy                  Im hurting again...that's the irony part,I don't know why I am feeling this way. I can feel my heart bleeding thou...its happening again.Yup...as if a knife,slowly piercing deep through me. Yesterday, I went out with him and he brought up the issue of one of the gerl's group. I was so pissed off... yup... I totally lose control and the worse part, it was only like  30%  of my anger... bursting...it was not a full blast,then again.. it did make an impact.I kind of settled in when he crack some jokes about the boriah tingy...hmm,he is sweet...very sweet.  Guess what...7 new messages.Hmm...so many people I've blocked from my msn.Missed chatting with Shariffah aka yan, been busy lately...hmmm...  Again, let us analyse what the hell am I suffering from...is it an infectious or contagious disease...heheheeh, maybe I need to rest for another month or was it a pure act of jealousy..nah,that would be the last thing.... then again, maybe if you love the person too much, I would just like to imagine him being wrapped up neatly,in a package,put it in my closet,far away from all the girls as possible.At one point,I tend to become restless,twitchy and uneasy when he mentioned to me about his x.Im not a paranoid.To look at my past, I do have loads of Xs but then was then. Perhaps,Ive never been ditch before.The feeling must be overwhelming.Hmm...sad to say this,I think he still loves his x...that's it!! I couldn't sleep because I think he has feelings for his x. I feel terrible now...inferiority lurkes again. What a jughead, how can I not see this.. thats why I am feeling miserable..it has nothing to do with that masked man... Shucks...hmmm...jiwa retak pulak saya ni... Hai...how love can makes you a desperado and defy the norms.merepeknyelah saya...: ) Im listening to... Ada Apa Dengan Cinta...apa nak jadi hafidah,yeah...away feminisme and what is left of it...         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
