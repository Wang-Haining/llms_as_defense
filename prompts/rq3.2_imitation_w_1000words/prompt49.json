From trains to dinning, we often have to book a chair, a chair is then allotted to us and at the right time we use it. So why on earth can't people realise this when it comes to sitting down?  Today I had my geography exam [the irony here is amazing] in which I found someone where I was meant to be sat, after a brief silent argument [mostly hand gestures] they refused to move so I was forced in to sitting else where. So in geography exam they couldn't navigate to their seat. What is the world coming to? Short of putting up neon signs pointing out which seat is yours, there isn't much else people can do other than say which seat is yours and make sure you know it. If you’re on a train, you can SEE the reserved ticket things on the seat. Why, oh why can't people SEE them?  That said geography didn't go too badly. Well Thursday is when my next exam so tonight has been my little 'break' as it were - basically wasting time listening to Talking Heads while complaining to friends about the heat - which is unbearable. REALLY awful. Just think, global warming will give us another ice age, or alternatively we could have a more Mediterranean style climate. Frankly things are hot enough as they are - and too cold in winter so lets not contribute to global warming folks.            Quite out of the blue ( mem. find the origin of that phrase) I have decided on several things; 1. To stop doing the Live Journal-esque things at the bottom 2. To try and put some things on the side bar 3. To use '()' instead of '[]' so much when doing brackets Of little consequence really, but this will be the last post of being in the style of Live Journal. Don't cry too much children.  Anyway; to the present, it's Sunday afternoon and I have nothing to do. Revision is always there, but that can be tiresome, I don't have a job, and haven't since I completed my work for  urlLink Hunter Seeds' website  and I haven't been able to buy myself a bass guitar yet.  A glance over today's 'world news stories' showed every one of them to be war-related. Seems that's all which is important today is war. Global Warming is of little consequence - in fact, it’s rather good if you’re Russia [warmer climate is better for their agriculture] and you don't really care if you’re America [because you ARE America and if it wasn't for them there would be a global depression]. Which I think is very thoughtful of the latter: economic depression soon or apocalypse later.

Anyway, today was my English Literature exam - an exam where it is by no means an exam on your knowledge of English literature and it isn't really an exam on  English  literature; my set text was Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck; an American. The poems that I looked at were written by an American, a welsh person, an Irish person and a Scottish person. No one technically English was involved in my English exam. But what is it to be English? They all speak the same language, some of their descendents could have quite possibly been English and an 'English' persons ancestors could quite possibly be Anglo-Saxons or of some other European origin. Who is English?  As it is indeed Friday night [now Saturday morning], I went out for a meal earlier, except on finishing the mile walk to the Indian restaurant, one of our party realized they had forgot something which meant that I had to get from the restaurant, back to the house, and back again - a two mile round trip - all in time for the first course. I did it, partly as they were delayed by a few minutes and partly because I ran a good deal of it. Getting back to the restaurant I arrived in good time to receive my curry. I would like to inform anyone considering doing a two mile run and then going for a meal, to go for something a bit more cooler, like a sandwich, curries just don't seem to be quite the right thing.  On the topic of sandwiches I recommend a Safeway Chicken and Bacon 'sub' [you know, one of those baguette like things which isn't], at £2.69 its hardly value for money but for a cold and wet May day it worked for me. Speaking of baguettes, Sally's Place provides an excellent guide to them. Let them eat cake.

I'm guessing the former is where you have an imaginary job and the latter is where you pretend you work on a space ship. Maybe not.  Also I seem to be under constant attack from beetles looking rather similar to  urlLink May Beetles . While these pose no threat to my existence, I still feel it my duty to dispatch them, except I can't bare to kill the things so the result is a twenty minute chase in order to corner the thing and then send it out through the window and hope that it managed to survive the fall. I worry too much.  Anyway, I better do some  more  revision. It's all good.
