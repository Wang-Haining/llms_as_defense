PLEASE find a service that actually provided the service it offers.  (Pretty reasonable right?)  and they reply:  Hi there,(hi there???? not even personalized!)  Unfortunately, we do not provide support for Hello. Please visit http://blahblahblah.plp for further assistance with this  matter.  Sincerely,            etc etc  So to which i replied:    no  shit ? so then offer me another option. (please note that i had already mention i had contacted hello support..)  i go through this computer generated crap all day, everyday lately. i need a computer to make sure my bank isnt screwing me, seriously. my bank withdrew 60 bucks of 'courtesy fees' last week. no i didnt overdraft, i called, indignant like, it seems their mainframe had a slight 'glitch' creepy. i wonder how often this happened  before  the internet... then i went to my employer's bank to cash my paycheck, and not only am i fingerprinted, but they charged me five bucks to cash a check drawn on the same bank! am i the only person who hasnt quite gotten used to paying money to get your OWN money??? i could have gone to cash my check for 70 cents at a gas station for god's sake! And the ATMs are just as bad. the bank charges me a buck and the ATM (MAC to the northerners) charges me a buck fifty. so to take out 20 bucks may as well count as 25. with the seven cents a year i get for interest, it is better to bury money in a coffee can in the yard! if you have alot of money then bank savings, iras', CD's-it's all you. but if you are me? banks are just places you go to cash your checks...if that.  going on with the computer generated annoyance... i hate talking to the fake person when you call somewhere: 'hi im irene, your automated assistant!- Please say if you want billing, service, or new orders!' i say, oh forget it.                   i promise to post b-day pics when(if)they become available. (see below post) it was lots of fun, even though we decided to get together at my work. MP and her man were there, as was my good friend KH and his friend. The BF came by after work, and of course my work crew was there, some working, some not. i might have paid for two drinks all night, and i think they were the BF's. my friends bought me a drink or two each, the bartender (MS!) bought me a few. my work friends kept buying me shots, and the regulars who were out on the patio got me a few rounds. the interesting part was that i think i was the least drunk at the end of the night, with possibly the exception of A? who just got off of work. one friend in particular, who said she wasnt going to drink much, (you know who you are!) decided at one point that she would be responsible for birthday spanking. although i had vetoed this idea earlier in the night, she ignored me and, damn she hits hard! its ok i teased her mercilessly the next day. at least no one sang. happy birthday that is, BF did a karaoke rendition of a guns-n-roses tune. it wasnt karaoke night, but that didnt seem to bother anyone. i lost some pool games, as usual, and smoked more cigarettes then i thought possible. we left before last call, (we have  some  dignity!) and met up at my place where the party continued, for  some  of us, ahem. then i kicked everbody out because i didnt want to embarrass myself further by falling over.  it wasnt a big bash or anything, but it was cool to hang out with all my (texas) friends in one day. CM in cali sent me a cute ecard, (who i have yet to email, sorry CM! i promise to get in touch soon)as did my mom who also donated funding to the broke 'incognito' fund (thanks mom!!!) to those of you that forgot, its ok i probably forget yours too.          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
