Today, he released a radio ad in which he equates the move towards gay marriage to living under a totalitarian regime, like Castro's.  The logic on that is completely loopy. But it gets worse. Martinez's campaign finance chair is an out gay men.  Hence, my little e-mail note. (FYI) kirk@melforsenate.org ******************* Dear Mr. Fordham:  I understand that you are the finance chairman for Mel Martinez’s Senatorial campaign.  I have just listened to Mr. Martinez’s campaign ad in which he compares extending civil rights to gays and lesbians to living under Fidel Castro.  *HUH?!!!!*  Castro has long persecuted gays and lesbians.   Martinez is officially against extending civil rights for gays and lesbians.  Since Castro is hostile towards gays and lesbians and Martinez’s central campaign theme is hostility towards gays and lesbians could you please explain why Martinez is not like Castro???  I eagerly await your response.  PS: As a gay man, you should know better than to fund this crap. For Shame!                      From the NY Times...   Here's the backgrounder on this issue. Back in the 1980s, the Reagan administration, then Bush administration systematically CUT OFF black farmers from Agricultural subsidies that they were legally entitled to, while at the same time funded larger, white-owned and controlled, agricultural coroporations (Think con-agra, monsanto, etc).   I remember seeing an interview with the head of the program during this time. He's was just increadibly bigoted (BTW: My dissertation was on the Reagan administration--they used to place the most bigoted and numbed headed racists in the domestic agencies).  Anyway, the results for black farmers&nbsp;were devastating...   The farmers filed a class-action&nbsp;suit and finally reached a settlement with USDA in the mid-1990s.  And now, the current Bush administration is&nbsp;denying these same farmers (9 out of 10) the settlement money that they are legally entitled to.  It's evil, evil, evil crap.    urlLink The New York Times > Washington > Black Farmers Accuse Agriculture Dept. of Failing to Live Up to Racial Bias Settlement                       The following is from the Toronto Sun  Here's a fast snip.  The era of strategic deception  Sun, July 18, 2004   The era of strategic deception  By Eric Margolis -- Contributing Foreign Editor  HAVING PRESIDED over the two worst intelligence disasters since Pearl Harbor -- 9/11 and the misbegotten invasion of Iraq -- the Bush Administration and its apologists are now whining, 'Okay, we were wrong about Iraq's weapons and supposed threat, but so was everybody else. Besides, it was all the CIA's fault.'   No way. The Iraq weapons fiasco was absolutely not caused by an 'intelligence failure,' as the White House and the recent Senate whitewash claim.   U.S. national security and CIA were corrupted and blinded by extremist ideology, cowardice, and careerism.      Nor was everyone wrong about Iraq.   Scores of Mideast professionals, this writer included, insisted from Day 1 that Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction, posed no threat to the U.S., and had no link to al-Qaida   urlLink Toronto Sun Columnist: Eric Margolis - The era of strategic deception                      Hi Folks:  Sorry there's not been an update. I've been traveling. ANyway, below is a post to the latest snafu from Johnny Ashcroft's Department of Injustice. Actually, it's looking like the keystone kops, with apologies to the Commonwealth of PA.  Here's a snip:  ************** WASHINGTON (AP) - Prosecutors in the first major terror trial after Sept. 11 were hindered by superiors from presenting some of their most powerful evidence, including testimony from an al-Qaida leader and video footage showing Osama bin Laden's European operatives casing American landmarks, Justice Department memos show.  The department's terrorism unit 'provided no help of any kind in this prosecution,' the U.S. Attorney's office in Detroit wrote in one of the memos, which detail bitter divisions between front-line prosecutors and their superiors in Washington ************* But then again, going after women's medical records is far more important. (Johnny is just a bit cuckoo about abortion).  GRRRRRRR!!!!   urlLink iWon News                      Normally, reading Nick Kirstof in the NYTimes makes me wince--in anger. This time, he's nailed an issue.  He takes on the 'Left Behind' series by Tim LaHay. Here's a snip: *********** If a Muslim were to write an Islamic version of 'Glorious Appearing' and publish it in Saudi Arabia, jubilantly describing a massacre of millions of non-Muslims by God, we would have a fit. We have quite properly linked the fundamentalist religious tracts of Islam with the intolerance they nurture, and it's time to remove the motes from our own eyes.  In 'Glorious Appearing,' Jesus merely speaks and the bodies of the enemy are ripped open. Christians have to drive carefully to avoid 'hitting splayed and filleted bodies of men and women and horses.'   ... No, I don't think the readers of 'Glorious Appearing' will ram planes into buildings. But we did imprison thousands of Muslims here and abroad after 9/11, and ordinary Americans joined in the torture of prisoners at Abu Ghraib in part because of a lack of empathy for the prisoners. It's harder to feel empathy for such people if we regard them as infidels and expect Jesus to dissolve their tongues and eyes any day now.     urlLink The New York Times > Opinion > Op-Ed Columnist: Jesus and Jihad          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
