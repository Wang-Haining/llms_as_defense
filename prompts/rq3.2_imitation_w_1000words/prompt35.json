  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic:\n\n            Even though it feels like I am fighting a constant uphill battle - I am still determined to make this work - decisions have been made now I just need to find a way to make them happen - I won't give up now I have already done so much to start this & love is helping to keep the dream alive.  Behold the heart of mine in flames A top the highest mountain Below the darkest depths In the valley of hate I wander My frost bitten heart is set ablaze, set ablaze  Ravage my soul Plunder my mind Branded by thunder, fire and ice  Trampled in fury by hordes of the light I am crushed by the hand of my sky My sky has forsaken me  Rivers of crimson lead me now Trail of fire In a place of fire eternal Left in flames  Scattered in a world of thorns Torn from my earthly self Aggrieved in tears and bitterness I fall beyond stars, beyond stars  Ravage my soul Plunder my mind Branded by thunder, fire and ice Trampled in fury by hordes of the light My fiery heart is stronger than ever It's stronger than ever before  My heart in flames  In Flames   The air tastes just like you, it's the smell of june A sensory shock that jolts my spirit, i slowly swallow you A spray of little droplets, a fragrance so refined The spirit of nostalgia is passing me by  Opium and poison, jasmine and rose Dream of ambrosia, all flavours glow, it's sensual,it's sensual, sensual  It all began so easy, with you on the floor Against your willing flanks and knocking down your door Until the day it crumbled, no game of win and lose You told me nothing, you left me confused  Expelled like poison, a trim of the dose, A limb disposed of, in a whim she chose,so rigorous,she's vigorous  She's vigorous,  Heart of the hardest world, it's just the thought of you All those variations, the air is full of you The smell of summer rain, once more the scent of june This sweet concentration ,brings me back to you Opium and poison My taste of june, my taste of you Inhale, inhale your trail Opium and poison, jasmine and rose, dream of escape with me, all flavours go, It's sensual, it's sensual, it's sensual  What was ours will drift away, a simple breeze on a humid day  Oh, nothing lasts, nothing lasts, forever   Clan of Xymox - Jasmine & Rose                       My soul is burning but the chill of dying love is whirling around me - trying to find an entrance - I have no armor - no defences left I have no more will to fight for something that I no longer feel.  I have chosen a different path...there is one I wish to walk with me if he chooses but it cannot be you.  You have let this happen, you have watched the disintegration for months - you still choose to fight when there is nothing left to fight for.    You tried to clip my wings but they have regrown.  I am stronger, wiser and more free than ever before and I need the freedom to explore every realm of possibility.     When the dark wood fell before me And all the paths were overgrown When the priests of pride say there is no other way I tilled the sorrows of stone  I did not believe because I could not see Though you came to me in the night When the dawn seemed forever lost You showed me your love in the light of the stars  Cast your eyes on the ocean Cast your soul to the sea When the dark night seems endless Please remember me  Then the mountain rose before me By the deep well of desire From the fountain of forgiveness Beyond the ice and fire  Cast your eyes on the ocean Cast your soul to the sea When the dark night seems endless Please remember me  Though we share this humble path, alone How fragile is the heart Oh give these clay feet wings to fly To touch the face of the stars  Breathe life into this feeble heart Lift this mortal veil of fear Take these crumbled hopes, etched with tears We'll rise above these earthly cares  Cast your eyes on the ocean Cast your soul to the sea When the dark night seems endless Please remember me Please remember me  Loreena McKennitt-Dante's Prayer                        Rofl....*ouch*...bloody hell - Is everyone around me giving up?  First actual communication with soon to be ex husband and I get the above - WTF? We have not even seen each other in over 2 years and only very brief phone conversations to try to get the seperation papers rolling.    Dare to live, dare to follow your heart, dare to find your path and never look back and you will have your reason to live - there is no courage in dying - choose death and you extinguish the fire within - you choose to give up - hypocrytical statement? perhaps but I lived through an attempt I should not have - I will never take my life for granted again.  I feel as though I am being put through a test of strength - why must it be now?  There are still days where I barely have strength enough to hold myself up much less everyone around me - but if I am needed I will be there if it is my tenacity that is needed by my friends and loved ones than it will always be there - I will take it from wherever I can draw it from and give what I can.  There is always hope, there is always love - there is always something to reach for.    Even in the fog of darkness I found one man - and my heart is safe in his hands as his is safe in mine.     Angel of the night In my mind you're by my side See you - wherever you are I feel you're touching my skin The time stands still just for us Without you there's no hope in my darkness  You give me the moment Which is never ending Let me feel your heart And I'll go with you to the end of this world  My angel of the night I'm forever by your side fly with me to eternity hold me in your arms and kiss me I close my eyes and dream with you Carry me so far away Never let me down and kiss me  Angel of the night Unite in one soul You lead me on the way, the way of our shadows Show me your burning desire I follow you I follow you into the garden of pleasures   Angel of the Night - Blutengel                 \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
