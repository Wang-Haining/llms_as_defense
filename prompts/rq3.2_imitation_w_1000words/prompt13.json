Last week, I forgot to get off the GO train then messed up my knee, yesterday I had the call night from hell (see below) and this morning I locked myself out of the car at the train station while leaving my bags in the car.  Whatever this is, I hope it passes soon.  It's not even full moon anymore.  I think last night was the worst on-call night i've ever had.  Non-pharmies feel free to tune out now.  I was on the phone from 8-10pm and at one point had 5 calls in limbo while I was looking up info.  Then at 11pm I had to come back to the hospital to  compound  sodium benzoate oral solution for this pt in emerg with high ammonia levels.  Picture me, weighing out sodium benzoate powder then pulling out the beakers and stirring rods.  Flashbacks of orgo labs!  I was technically supposed to make the product in the sterile hood, but I figured since the pt was from a shelter and her gut is definitely not sterile, it shouldn't be a big problem.  And technically I was supposed to check the pH of the solution and adjust it with HCl or NaOH to achieve a certain pH.. but at midnight, I wouldn't even know where to go to find pH paper.  I was more preoccupied with getting the dang powder to dissolve.  Then after I get home (scary driving home in the thunder & lightning storm), I get another page from this resident about this pt with subtherapeutic phenytoin levels, who's now NPO and has brain mets.  I think I was ready to seize at that time.    So ready to crash right now..                                 I fell off the bandwagon today.  I had been doing so well in controlling my obsession for cute things and haven't bought any Sanrio or Pooh bear stuffs for so long now.  Then today it all came crashing down.  I was at Roots Kids looking for gifts for my lil cousins in the US since my Aunts are leaving tomorrow.  Then I saw  it ... a deliciously cute red tee.  And to test my will power even more, they had my 2XL size and was on sale too!!  So I caved.  Sometimes the cute thing works in my favour, so it's not always bad.  On our way to Cancun, I was wearing my 'Sweet but Forbidden' tee and instead of being grilled about where I was going or what I had in my bags, the security dude wanted to know more about whether my shirt represented my personal philosphy in life.    And the cute thing works against me as well... ie, being called the 'little pharmacy girl' by one of my patients.  Rather than listening to me talk about his life-saving drugs, he was more focussed on finding a candy for me in his drawer.    I guess one of these days i'll grow out of this cuteness thing and finally grow up.  But in the meantime, I'll keep wearing my red skater shoes and pink hair bobbles proudly!  When i'm fifty and if I still have a Pooh doll hanging off my backpack, someone please give me a swift kick.                                    The thought of cancer just terrifies me.  I can't think of anyone who's life hasn't been affected by cancer in one way or another.    I usually try to make a point of not connecting emotionally with my patients because I think I would just go mental thinking about them all the time, but there are some faces who are permanently etched in my mind.  One of my patients had osteosarcoma and was pregnant at the time she was admitted.  They gave her a prognosis of 6 months to live and yet she still had a smile on her face everytime I saw her.  I also think of this elderly Chinese man who was coming in for chemo three times a week.  He seemed like such a frail man, but you could see the determination in his face.  I just can't get the sounds of him retching out of my head.  A little closer to home, a good friend and a coworker, are both having investigations done next week for cancer.  The wait is driving me bonky and weighing heavily on my heart.  Please send warm thoughts and prayers their way.                                 Surgery scares me.&nbsp; The longest time I’ve ever been a patient at a hospital, besides when I was born, was when I had a migraine headache during a math test in grade 12.&nbsp; They hooked me up to some IV drugs, I slept for 4 hours, then I went home.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I had my physiotherapy assessment today.&nbsp; She’s pretty sure my ACL is 100% torn, along with some damage to my meniscus & collateral ligament… what they call the “unhappy triad”.&nbsp; It’s silly… before meeting the surgeon, I was pretty gung-ho about getting it done.&nbsp; Then he said let’s wait and see and I was happy cuz I felt relieved and maybe a bit hopeful that I could heal without surgery.&nbsp; But now my physio said I should think hard about surgery because I’d likely need it if I wanted to return to a similar level of physical activity.&nbsp; And now I’m bummed again… jolted back to reality.   My hamstrings are constantly contracting right now trying to hold my tibia in place and that’s what’s causing my pain and my leg to be bent.&nbsp; Physio will help to straighten out my leg and calm my hamstrings down, but that’s about it.&nbsp; I didn’t understand why surgery would so painful.. thinking they just cut a few holes to manipulate in the joint space… but I didn’t know they drilled into bone!!&nbsp; No wonder you&nbsp;need morphine.&nbsp; Nine months for rehab post surgery&nbsp;to heal too.&nbsp; Sucks eh.                   \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
