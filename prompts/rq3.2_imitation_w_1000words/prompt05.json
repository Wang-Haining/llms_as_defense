It was the first time we’ve played in a while. Most of use were out of shape, but we didn’t let it keep us from winning. We won 9-4. Beau only scored 7 goals. Gambill scored 1 after missing two easy ones in the first half. I also scored 1 in the second half after having a few good shots not go in. Overall we looked pretty good. Rosey, Jamie, Tracy and Anastasia played a good game. If you haven’t made it to one of our games you should come watch us. We play at Hat Trick arena on 122nd St. Our team name is officially Rhombus, but unofficially we are known as the Cochran Family. Anastasia and Rosey decided to surprise us with their custom team shirts that say “The Cochran Family” on the front and a phone number on the back. We all plan on having our own custom shirts eventually. Mine will say G-unit, Beau’s will say Metro Beau, and so on. Any way as soon as I get a schedule I’ll post it on here so you can know when we are playing. Come support us. We promise it will be worth your time.                    urlLink    Grandpa Jones&nbsp; urlLink     The other day, I had a some one say to me, 'you're a cool guy.'&nbsp; I thought about it and realized that in actually, I'm not that cool of a guy.&nbsp; I mean, 'you're a cool guy' is a great compliment, but perhaps my standards of cool are set fairly high.&nbsp; I mean it takes a special person to merit such an adjective as cool.&nbsp; I don't know about you but I don't like to just throw titles like that around loosely.&nbsp; The reason for this is simple, those who I look to for coolness, hold that title to very high standards.&nbsp; Probably the coolest cat of all is the famous Grandpa Jones.&nbsp; I mean it's hard to find anyone that's cooler than Grandpa Jones.&nbsp; He was the unnamed member of the Rat Pack, the original choice for James Bond before Connery, and had more dates than Hugh Hefner.&nbsp; Grandpa Jones is my hero.&nbsp; Of course, I am nothing like Grandpa Jones.&nbsp; I don't have his good looks, charisma or even self esteem.&nbsp; But I can dream can't I?&nbsp; So I even though I enjoy being called 'cool'. I know it takes more than just&nbsp;a title to help me reach that level of sophistication.                  Ok, so apparently I tried to type my last blog in a yellow font to get the black and gold look that would match the Colorado Buffaloes colors. And I apparently wasn’t grammatically correct because I didn’t type it in a word document before I posted it. I apologize for my mistakes. But in my defense I’m still new to this thing. I still haven’t learned how to post pictures. Sorry but I do have a life outside this cyber world. But I did learn tonight how to link my friends blogs to my blog (Thanks Gambil). And this got me thinking, if I connect just one person to my blog then my blog could possibly be connected to just about any blog in the world. Think about it. I’m connected to a blog and that blog has 5 friends connected who all have 5 other friends connected. So pretty much its all connected through blogs. Pretty soon you’ll be able to play that 6 degrees game that you play with movies. For example we'll be sitting around quizzing each other. “ok I can connect Troy Townsend to Hank Torn in under three people. Troy’s blog is linked to Cochran’s blog who is linked to Hank’s blog.” Its like that Kevin Bacon game but only more gay. What’s this world coming to? Why am I writing about this? Why am I this tired this early in the night? Especially after i went to Starbucks to get “juiced up”. Well let me know if you agree with my connected blog theory. Its pretty deep I know. I think I’m going to watch Dumb and Dumber now.              urlLink    Hole #1 at  urlLink Rose Creek     Well I finally got to play  urlLink golf  again. I finally have found some time to play for the first time in 2 months. Normally taking 2 months off from golf would be bad for your golf game. But surprisingly I played very good. Golf is a game that never ceases to amaze me. If you’ve never played it before you should try taking it up sometime. It’s a game that you can play even as you get old, and you don’ t have to be good at it to have fun. But don’t expect me to play with you if you haven’t played before. I don’t have much patience with beginners.  When I got home from the golf course I turned on the TV while I cooked dinner. I normally don’t watch TV but I made an exception since I was trying to rest from playing golf. The TV show “ urlLink Everybody Loves Raymond ” was on. I’ve heard good things about it so I watched it. And it just happened to be an episode where the wife wanted Raymond to take her golfing so they can do more together. And that brings us to our topic of discussion.  I will never get married to someone that plays golf. The golf course is to be my place to go, not my wife’s. The golf course is where I will be going to get away from my wife. A place to be on my own away from her. You need times apart. Just like in relationships now, you can’t spend all your time with the same person. You’ll go crazy if you do. And it will in the long run end with a bad relationship. But like in the TV show, you’ll see that when husbands and wives get too annoyed with each other on the golf course. Golf is already a stressful enough sport. When you add the stress of a women to it then it becomes too much. It can only do harm to your relationship. Of course this is coming from me who plans on having a separate house for my wife. But that’s another story for another day.     \n'''\n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
