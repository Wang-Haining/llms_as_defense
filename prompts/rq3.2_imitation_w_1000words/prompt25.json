And I took some of those incredibly blessed herbs and the blessed water my lama gave me and I feel this wave of love and devotion too.  I'm gonna beat this pain problem, for everyone's happiness' sake.  Including yours, dear reader, so you don't have to suffer my bitching about it forever.  You're just gonna have to forgive me though, 'cause I'll probably be bitching about it until it's gone.But on to something even cheerier.  It's a beautiful partly-sunny day here in Seattle, and I live in a house with a beautiful garden which is blooming in a lovely way.  It's a pain not having a life, but there are much worse places not to have a life at, that's for sure.  It's a great house too, and I have a sizable separate apartment in it so I can be as isolated or as connected with my parents as I feel like it at any given moment.  And my parents are very supportive and wonderful.  I just wish I were brave enough to come out to them.  They're mostly not the problem here.  They'd understand it just fine.  I'm just a little cowardly about it, and I'm afraid that even though they'd still love me and support me and all they might be a little bit disappointed anyway.  They're very good people.  But they're not perfect yet.  Nor am I.  Oh well, that'll change.  I'll be perfect someday, or otherwise I'll just have to be perfect anyway.  Either way I'm determined to become perfect.  Sure, I'm a bit of an idealist, but it works for me.  And I recommend it to you, too, my friend.  The world needs more idealists, good practical idealists.  Hey, while you're here, let's idealize together!  My email address is at the top of the page, and I want to communicate with my readers, and I'll post whatever seems suitable to the blog too, so we can all figure out together how to make each other happy.  That's the point, after all, for us all to be happy.  Which you'll hear me repeat quite a lot in this blog over time.  Write me!  I have plenty of time these days for email and the blog, and I'll be nice atcha if you're not mean and/or spam me.  I don't like meanness.  And I don't like spam.  But I love people, even mean people and even spammers.  It's bad patterns of behavior I dislike, not any living being per se.  I mean, to be practical, we're all stuck in the same multiverse together forever anyway, and we all want to be happy and not to suffer, so we've all got to learn to make the best of it all and make each other happy.  And in Tibetan Buddhism 'love' is defined as the wish for someone to be happy.  Personally, I use the word 'love' to cover the Tibetan meaning and also compassion (the wish for someone not to suffer) and kindness generally, and more.  Love, as I define it, is definitely a many-splendoured thing.  So.  Count on it that I love you, 'cause I love all living beings on general principles and in fact.  And you can't possibly make me not love you, so don't even try.  And because we're going to have actual perfection some day (I've vowed it, so that's decisive and definitive) you're going to come to love me if you don't already, so you might as well get a head start.Okay, I've run out of stuff to say for the moment, so just think about all this stuff and write me if you feel like it, and I'll blog atcha soon!Love, David.                        Good morning, dear reader my friend.  Or at least pardon me because I'm going to pretend you're my friend.  That's because I think we *all* should be friends, by nature if not in a formal sense necessarily.  By which I mean we all should be looking out for everyone else's best interests at least, all the time.  The world would be a much happier place if we all would just learn to do that.  And it's a simple enough thing to do, in a way, too.  Just develop that attitude, and the way that should work out in practice will just naturally fall into place gradually.So.  What's new this morning?  I'm waiting to take some very highly blessed herbs this morning, which were given to me by a Tibetan lama with whom I'm beginning to study.  He's wonderful!  He's very practical and a brilliant teacher.  I only wish his English were slightly better, because it takes an effort to understand him sometimes, and I need his assistant to clarify points occasionally.  He knows about my pain problem and is working toward healing it, and I really believe that he has the ability at *least* to help very greatly with it.  I'm gonna *beat* this thing and have a *life* again.  That also is a vow.In other news, I just learned yesterday that a childhood friend of mine is also gay.  I'm arranging through a mutual friend to get in touch with him via email.  Oh, he's taken, it's nothing like that.  But I have very few gay friends, being so closeted and all, and I would *dearly* love to be back in touch with him and talk about stuff and hopefully develop a deep friendship with him.  I've missed him a lot over the years.  A lot.I should really come out some day.  Oh, I'm already out to a few friends, but that's all.  It's just that my life has in some respects been very lonely and unhappy here in the closet.  And I deserve better than this, much better indeed.  If nothing else, let this blog be an object lesson in the value of coming out of the closet whenever that's practical.  Don't try the way I've handled this at home because you'll probably make yourself deeply unhappy, as I did.Get yourself together, David.  Think of something more positive.  I know!  I'll go do my daily exercise (half an hour on a treadmill every day).  That should lift my spirits.  I'll be back, dear reader, hopefully with something more happy and useful to say.
