Because the anesthetic of suburbia also involves having three parents—a mother, a father and a TV set.  Two of them are equilibriums, but one of them is more powerful because it’s always new and fresh and entertaining.  It doesn’t reach out and tell you what to do' (Steven Spielberg in Rolling Stone Magazine, July 1982).    Some of you may know the story of Steven Spielberg’s start in the film industry before  Jaws  made him a name.  At the age of 17, on a tour of Universal Studios, sneaking away to a sound stage, he eventually talked his way into obtaining a visitor’s pass that turned into a summer of “squatting” in an abandoned office and hobnobbing with producers and writers. His small filmmaking trials (with 8mm film)  and his abundant knowledge of the medium propelled his imagination and audacity.  In the end, that “chutzpah” led to his eventual success.  Here then is a “self-taught” filmmaker – yet to what degree was he taught through the medium itself?  Through a watchful eye and an amateur lens, he gained knowledge as he journeyed with media “mentors” (both machine and human). Quentin Tarantino, as the story goes, never learned the language of film production, and continues to invent words on a regular basis.  His film crews have learned to figure out his intent whenever he defies the use of conventional terms.  His accomplishments (like him or not) display another “self-taught” filmmaker.  Like Spielberg, his media literacy began while watching TV and countless movies (from martial arts to Westerns).    Over the past two days, we watched the opening of  Altered States  and  2001: A Space Odyssey   as well as a 30 second short with sci-fi overtones made by a third grader.  Perhaps science fictions may begin scientific discourse or perhaps they are merely precursors to movie making.  Either way, one cannot help to notice the inevitable debate that ensues from such starting points – from medium (Is the book/text or the movie/visuals/sound better?) to message (What does it mean? Is it truth or fiction?).     More questions…  Can we deepen discourse in science, social studies, math, art…etc…through stories found in movies, music, poetry, art   and   books? Do movies or TV have a place in our classrooms? Should we teach the skills of the medium by  analyzing  films or   making   films or both?  Did your iMovie experience demystify the medium of movies?  What of Shaun’s powerful thought under “New Economy” post?  Does any of this matter?                       I don’t really know how fair it was to have introduced McLuhan into our short course without focusing much on his work.   His words have buoyed me up during a twenty-year exploration of “media” (whether human, analog, or digital).  Though I have bobbled up and down with his words (finding meaning and losing it), I am still peeling back new layers of nuanced ideas.  What intrigues me today is the McLuhan revival especially in  urlLink  business and management  .  In my search to understand the phenomenon of “creativity” (a word that even as late as 1969 was not included in the OED) McLuhan’s words have galvanized my thinking.  In particular, I am more fully aware of the “figure” and “ground” aspect of any medium.  Throughout my research, I was drawn again and again to the features McLuhan expressed regarding all media (conceptual or concrete) and this alliance led to my early-formed conclusions regarding “creativity.” I say early because while I defended my thesis, I am still on the journey of discovery that includes the continued exploration of forty leading experts from around the world, and the perusal of the more than 7,000 books, 40,000 academic articles, and 5,430,000 google hits found on the Web! Yes – it’s definitely one of the more challenging fields of investigation!  When I was first introduced to McLuhan in the late 70’s, while studying communications, I was very much aware that his thinking had been drawn from a famous communications theorist,  urlLink  Harold Innis .  I had heard his famous and oft repeated aphorism for  urlLink  medium and message   and we had become more and more familiar with the idea of a “global village” (long before globalization became a reality).    I hope that our final class will bring a not too cursory closure to our term (although I suspect that the mental dialogue will continue long after) as we will journey into  urlLink  McLuhan's Tetrads  (four questions posed to analyze media) as a tool to explore the medium of language, literacy, technology, and other “media” that have been discussed throughout our class and on this blog.   Thank you for all of your terrific thoughts expressed in this blog!  It has been thoughtful, compelling, humorous and inviting.  Great work!                        I like Vanessa’s closing thought, “…we can do our best to please them some of the time.”  There is no doubt that teaching is a tough gig in the 21st Century – it almost seems that were we to teach in a far off place where the only resources available were a few books, we could fare much better.    We have not solved the issue of creating an “equal” society by ensuring that all individuals achieve a level of “literacy” commensurate with democratic and economic rights in any nation.  Literacy, like new media, has become a “moving target” and pinning it down may be perplexing.  But staying alert and trying to understand the nature or importance of language, technology, special and general knowledge, creativity – all such things that our contemporary literate world demands – may be the only way to find the bull’s eye every now and then.  Moments where learning is pleasurable!   Our world is that much more sophisticated than even a decade ago  (there are many persons to thank for the steep digital learning curve we experience today).  But in my view, Pablo couldn’t have said it better – the human quality will always be at the heart of our existence (not solely machines or ideas or things)…humans are remarkable beings with the capacity to both triumph in love and falter in hate…humans created the system…but…we do not need to be slaves to our creations…  Everything today is simultaneous and now (we are in instant communication mode) and perhaps as Peter indicated slaves to “poor” memories and “bad” planning as a result.  Tetrads show that the status of any medium is always happening simultaneously somewhere.  Whatever a new medium is  enhancing  somewhere, there is bound to be a  reversal into  something negative somewhere else – or that familiar thing is  obsolesced  – or the  retrieval  of yet another past artifact is ready to launch yet another enhanced extension of our…eyes, hands, ears, mouths, minds…  Where does creativity fit in all of this?  Creativity possesses many meanings (as many as there are individuals).  Its essential nature, however, is born of being uniquely human. It requires one to “see” what had not yet been perceived, then to communicate it in such a way that others might perceive it also.  Human beings possess the unique ability to know things  a priori  (i.e., conceptually) and to make the ideal world concrete.  For children, being creative is “seeing” and “expressing” without full knowledge of its existence in specialized fields.  Creative endeavors become trickier with age and knowledge.  Do you remember as a child when the world being so enormous held endless possibilities?  As we grow older, our world becomes smaller and possibilities seem to follow suit.  It is harder to “see” with those same innocent eyes…harder still to express ideas with innocent voices.  Yet…when creativity is nourished (given time and space)…pathways are sure to unfold.  Just reading the whole blog again…and all of the comments is enough to convince me that language is a compelling tool for creating ideas (and possibly this new technology called a blog).  And like all technologies, language may become a central force – it is a primary force for expressing the moments when we have captured the new, the unexpected, the hallucinatory, and the delirious…  For some it is the arts whose primary force captures those moments – though with language we can express with both artistry and clarity.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
