I swear, some people don't give a horses ass about other people's time. Some people as in one of my marketing project's group member. This particular guy's sense of time is absolutely scewed up.  Exibit A: Yesterday we were supposed to meet at 12pm. What does he do? Smses to inform me that he was gonna be late >> 1230pm. A half an hour came and went. No hide nor hair seen of him. I message him to ask him where he was. he messages me back to say that he was in fact not gonna be able to make it after all. Meaning? Two hours of my time flushed down the drain.  Argh!  Exibit B: Proposed meeting time? 1230pm. Oh this time he actually decided to turn up. At 145pm. Oh I was SO overjoyed to see him! Grrr!   Verdict? GUILTY AS CHARGED!  Ok, what the hell am I gonna do about this joker? He obviously isn't one to be flustered about tardiness.  Ok, enough about that dolt. Well, other than the the lateness of Mr greatness, we (the 4 of us) actually achieved something. Finished the survey form we were supposed to come up with. Gonna let the marketing lecturer review it tomorrow. Hope it's ok bu  it's probably gonna need some revisions. Oh well.  Ok, after the meeting was concluded, I went with 2 of them (minus one great one) to shoot some pool. Won 5 games of 6. Woohoo. Well, I think i'm on a roll here. Gotta love the game of pool eh.  Then after that, went to kino to read the pool book I saw a couple of weeks ago. Phew, time can pass pretty quickly when you're reading. Stopped that at about 7. Coincdentally met fairoz and paul at orchard mrt station. Had a good chat about the stupid gvt's policy on the university intake on the way to tampines. Oh well. Again.  Met Kings at tampines and had dinner at ljs. Had a nice chat on the intricacies of trading via ebay.  Went home at about 10.  Ok that's it for today.                     Have you ever stopped to think about the concept of time? That's all it actually is, isn't it. A concept formed by man, pretty much as a convenient way to measure moments in an accurate way. And it can be relative. A moment here can be less or more than a moment there, depending on various factors such as relative position and speed of movement of matter. Time is not something that is tangible.  How do you actually prove that time actually exist? Do you really feel it? It it really something that moves forward? Why can't it move in reverse, if it is moving at all.  After pondering this for a while at 4 in the morning (don't ask why I was still awake), I thought of a lateral way to interpret the concept of time. Instead of viewing it as something that is separate of us, it could be said that it is something innate to all reality. Consider this for a moment. If nothing ever changes, does time exist? In my view, time only exists if things change. That probably why things freeze in movies and on television shows when they try to show that time has 'stopped'.  Therefore, time only exists when matter moves, or evolves, so to speak. We could say that we are still occupying the same space as the dinosaurs did. Take away the application of the concept of time, and it just means that matter moved around a bit which resulted in us, mankind and the world that we know of, at this moment in space. How and why or how long matter took to move around is subsequently irrelevant for all intents and purposes.  That just one of the thought that I have recently been trying to grapple with.                     Well, I have this afflication called shyness. Everytime I talk to strangers, especially to one of the opposite sex, I turn into jello. I can't think, I start to tremble and I basically just freeze up. It doesn't happen all the time nowadays but it happened today at the YEN meeting.  I had to tell genevieve that I hadn't receive the invitation to the club mailing list yet. I though I could do it without any trouble but I was obviously wrong. I suppose that I care too much about what others think of me and my personality and brain just shuts down. She was trying to be nice but I didn't react to her being nice to me very well at all. I hope I didn't look too much like a dweeb.  But I'm working on this problem. That's one of the main reason that I joined yen in the first place. That is, to force myself into situations where I would have no choice but to interact with strangers, especially those from the opposite gender. I mean, if I want to get anwhere in life, I can't do it on my own. It's not to bad with people whom I know well, but there is still that niggling fear inside of me. That's why I've never had the nerve to get into any relationship.  You have no idea how frustrating it is to want something so bad but are to god damned afraid to just reach out and get it. No matter what happens, I  WILL  overcome this  disability , if you will. And the only way to do that is through increased interaction.  The other problem I have is that of positive thinking which directly affects my motivation. I don't want to say it as it's too overused but its the truth. It's all my parents' fault. Especially my mom. She's just so negative ALL the time. It might seem unfillial (I'm not known for that) to say this but it's all to do with her society and upbringing. They aren't generally known for their achievements. Now she's passed it on to me. The only positive thing is that now that I'm aware of this shortcoming, I can work towards eliminating it. I Have to be smart about it.  Talked to the yen guy I met through darren. Damn. I can't recall his name. He's a total 'Adam Knoo' convert. It might be unwise to turn evangelical for anything but in this case it's a positive thing. he should know that fanatic behaviour has a knack of turning people off. But the thing is that he made me realise how negative in my thoughts I've been lately. How small I've been thinking. So negative I am disgusted with myself. I will stop using the word 'tyr' and use the word 'MUST'. It's amazing how much difference a word and thought makes in your life. So I MUST come up with a study and work schedule on sunday and I MUST follow through with that schedule. There! That's settled then. I paradigm shift in actions and thought.         \n'''\n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
