Just close your eyes (and read this at the same time! hehe) and think about this. There was a day way back in may, oh soo long ago ;). You were bored, and we were in our talking phase. You told me to come up, and I of course wanted to so I did. When I got there, we had our fun little LOTR trivia dealio, cause we are both dorks like that, but I love it. Then we went for a walk in dark hollow. Just a nice simple, fun, walk. The world faded away behind us, and it was just you and me. You found out I was nervous about you, and I still am just fyi, but that also meant I could open up to you. Then on the way home built up my courage and got to hold your hand. Such a lil accomplishment in todays sex minded world, but it meant a lot to me. And they lived happily ever after is the ending to that lil part. Cause it is is true, been happy ever after that, and I hope you have been too, deep down inside, where it counts. I know there has been a lot of shit going on, but I hope on top of everything, where it really counts, you are still happy. Thats what matters :-*  Now for part two of this. I dunno how much I will be able to talk to you till u get home, so I wanna explain this here so I can save those minutes that cost you so much. I was talking to Heidi today about how nervous I am that your coming home. I want you home, yeah, but I love being with you and don't want to screw it up. I really have put so much 'into' this month, and I just don't want things to fall apart once your home. So I am asking you to do me a favor. If I get too 'in your face' or overbearing or pushy or anything, just tell me to back off. I know you are going to need some space once you get home, and I am not the only person in your life and there are plenty of other people you are going to want to see. So just tell me if I am getting annoying before it makes you or me snap or anything. On the same token, I don't wanna distance myself or anything too. I know this all sounds weird, but me and heidi decided it made sense, so there, lol. I'm just not used to actually having you be here when I want to be with you, so things are going to be odd. But y'know what, that is us, i dunno what we would do if things were normal.  Now I am sorry there is so much to read on here. It is all weird since its out of order too, but oh well. I hope the rest of your trip is as good as possible. Hope the pool went well and no one freaked out or got mad. I smashed my hand today and my finger is swollen and my back is all sore, so it was a good day, nothing too bad ;) hehe. I love you.                       first off, if you are reading this before you go and it is the 22nd, good morning! if not, well, um hi!  I love you. That is the bottom line. I love you. You are 4628 miles away. I love you. You have been gone 22 days. I love you. You have had ups and downs. I love you. You will be here in 6 days. I love you. We have many more months ahead, only they will be together. I love you.  Get the hint?  good! *mwah*  I can't see the future, lots of things change, I will admit to that. But however that future goes, I want it to be with you. I want us to both to enjoy the ride, cause yknow, im a bmw, the ultimate driving machine ;) (i know it was corny, but it made you giggle! so ha!)  oo and guess what, i think i found something out about chris and the heidi situation. No one had heard from mia in well over a month, including him. I think this is what maybe triggered interest in heidi. Turns out mia got hit by a car and was in a coma for 2 weeks. She wakes up and either calls or somehow talks to chris recently, and so yeah, think that had a part of it. or not, might all be imagination.  but anyhow, I just want to be with you. and that want is so great, nothing is going to get in the way. the love so strong that nothing can break it. you are going to get home safely, nothing is going to go wrong, and i will be able to hug you once more, kiss those wonderful lips of yours, and gaze into your gorgeous eyes.   I kinda want to spill something here too. The last two girls I got interested in both burnt me, and burnt me bad. I just wanted to say that you are wonderful, absolutely perfect in my mind, and that I trust you more than anything, and that my heart mind and life are just as much a part of you as they are me. I'm just saying that it isnt easy to get that out of me, but you more than deserve it, and you meant that much to me. I love you and want to be with you. I don't want you as a status symbol, I want you as my best friend. I don't want you just to fool around with, I want you to be around. You make think of yourself as, hell, i dont remember that long list of adjective you used that one day, but I have just one for you; perfect. I can't think of anything I don't like. I love you michelle, thru and thru. goodnite *mwah*         \n'''\n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
