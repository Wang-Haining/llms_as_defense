Beach for a week with Alexandra (she's comming home, yay!) Thus, I won't be taking the landscape class :( and I won't get to update my blog or IM any of you for 2 weeks!!! So sad....sorry...anyway....yesterday! *** 4th o' July was fun! Was at the D's for most of the day...most of it consisted of eating, and breaking sticks and throwing them out the window...yeah...Then at five we had to leave for the Mannix's. You have to understand that when I got there I was wearing my hair back tight, short shorts, and a tight top. I kinda scared everyoone there when I came downstairs changed in my baggy pants, my Styx shirt that was intended for an adult, and bearing all of my frizzy blue hair. When I came downstairs with my shirt a guy there named Bernie looked at my shirt (he works in the music record deal bussiness). Well, first he made a joke that I was too young to like Styx (I could tell when I went to the concert). Then he told me that that very morning he was talking with someone he works with who asked him if he wanted a signed photo of the lead singer of Styx who plays the keyboard (with the tight tight tight pants!!!) and he said no cause he thought no one would wanted it. Now he feels really guilty. But oh well...he turned out to be a cool guy. He gets to vote for the Grammy Awards. He found it facinating that I was interested in Classic Rock for my age. We ended up talking a lot about it. In the end, he sujjested that I listen to Pink Floyd. I'll try it... When am I gonna get thses drawings on my blog????                 (22:47:01) Dougie: I told 'em, I told 'em, spyin' on me with rays... (22:47:25) Jood: You gotta watch out for those rays (22:47:30) Jood: they'll getchu with 'um (22:47:35) Dougie: buggrit, buggrem (22:48:24) Dougie: The old pool shooter had won many a game in his life.   But now it was time to hang up the cue. When he did, all the other cues came crashing to the floor. 'Sorry,' he said with a smile. (22:49:18) Jood: It was at this moment that the other men realized that without that old pool shooter, this world would fall apart. (22:50:05) Jood: And when they had this apocalyptic epiphany, they all dropped their jaws, and let their eyes grow wide with amazement as they watched his silhouette fall into the horizon (22:50:34) Dougie: as he dropped 500 feet onto a raging river that flowed over razor-sharp spikes (22:50:40) Dougie: that were poisonous (22:50:46) Dougie: and explosive (22:50:54) Jood: doug. you just lost the cinematic feel (22:50:55) Jood: c'mon (22:51:27) Dougie: and the a glorious, soaring eagle picks him up and wraps him in an American flag (22:51:30) Dougie: then* (22:51:41) Dougie: and everybody breakdances (22:52:08) Jood: Only to have the flag burn his skin, like holy water on a demons chest.  This is when everyone knew his true identity. (22:52:35) Dougie: Lord Gribnak had returned! (22:55:21) Jood: Only to wield his mighty sword, and thrust it to the heavens!  And Hell rained down upon the earth, bringing an end to this meaningless process we call life. (22:55:46) Dougie: and everybody died happily ever after (22:56:01) Jood: Fin. (22:56:12) Dougie: ::roll credits:: (22:56:26) Jood: ::eats roll::            And it is when you look into that bright light at the end of the tunnel that you realize 'Oh God, we are so fucked.' This is where we begin and end.  One bright summer afternoon when all is well, birds chirping, sun blasting it's radioactive death rays down onto us, not an apocalyptic cloud in the sky; everything can go awry in a matter of seconds.  Just when everything seems ordinary, the extraordinary goes and gives you one giant wallop in the face.  A small child, it could be any small child, but let's just call him Billy, was frolicking in his back yard when the sky opened up. This is your extraordinary. What happens when the sky opens up, you ask?  Well, let me tell you my children, it is not a pleasant thing.  Your eyes boil and your skin melts, then you are torn to shreds in a matter of nanoseconds.  The sky, you see, wants to fill this void and therefore needs matter to fill it.  This matter could come from anywhere, typically it uses oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen that's floating in the air.  But this is different.  It wants Billy.  When the sky opens up, it creates a giant BOOM which feels very much like being punched by a 15 foot novelty boxing glove.  This knocked him to the ground, and allowed him to see this extraordinary event take place.  As he lay flattened on the grass, unable to breath, his vision began to go askew, making everything bubble.  His eyes were indeed boiling, soon they will become part of a soup formally known as his central nervous system.  At this very moment, his skin became prickily and wet.  His skin was indeed melting, soon to become a puddle on the grass.  Shortly after, he was ripped into the vortex, his body torn to bits, then reassembled in whatever fashion it could be reassembled.  As he swirls through the atmosphere, or rather lack of one, he sees a bright light. This is your light at the end of the tunnel. He had always been told in church and by his parents that the light at the end of the tunnel symbolized hope.  This, however, is not the case in this situation.  Billy attempts to reach his hand up for that bright light, only to hear the garbled tearing of muscle in the wind.  It has Billy.  His arm, at least.  What is this bright light you ask?  Well, interpret it as you wish.  This is up to you.  Billy's eyes started to water, he knew it was the end.  When he reached that light, it felt as though he had been reborn.  The purest water you can't even imagine washed over him, cleansed his body and mind, and restored him to his former self.  But for what? He had been stranded in the middle of nowhere, to die.  His light was some kind of hope, but it was also his greatest fear, and will cause his demise. He walks. And as he walks, the world around him begins to form into something familiar.  It is at this moment he realizes what has happened. He collapsed into himself. But what kind of life is this?  He is alone in his mind, and what will happen when his subconscious takes over?  This will have to wait for next time.    \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
