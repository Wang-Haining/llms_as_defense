  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic:\n\n       I just&nbsp;feel like a relate to&nbsp;this song, this feeling of just wanting everyone to lie to me and pretend.&nbsp; &nbsp;   Let's pretend were not needy.    Let's pretend our hearts still beat.    Let's pretend we fall in love tonight,    Clumsy enough to fall for anything.    We'll stumble on our words.    We'll spill our guts on creaking bar stools,    Below the neon blue.    Low lives hiding in dives there's no feeling in drinking, sleeping with strangers.    Ghosts passing through bedrooms unaware,    A faint reflection on the barback's mirror,    A face I never knew whispering,'Please dont be a stranger to me.    Who are you if you're alone?'    You're no good at pretending.    All my plays have tragic endings,    You wish I was a fairy tale.    This frog will never change anything.    Just pretend that you're in love,    That scolding sun is bound to come up eventually.    So who is it that whispers in your ear?    A haunting voice blows in through the window.    There's no feeling floating over beds,    A needy pleading apparition    Crying, 'Who am I if I'm alone?    I hardly exist at all.    Let's pretend that we don't need anything anymore from anyone.    I don't want to feel anything anymore let's just pretend, we'll live happily ever after.'   &nbsp;  If I was to say anything at this time, with all honesty, it would be treacherous poison gushing from my block of wood representing my heart hoping to seep into a barbaric wound and create eternal oblivion.               Hand in mine, into your icy blues  And then I'd say to you we could take to the highway  With this trunk of ammunition too  I'd end my days with you in a hail of bullets  I'm trying, I'm trying  To let you know just how much you mean to me  And after all the the things we put each other through and  I would drive on to the end with you  A liquor store or two keeps the gas tank full  And I feel like there's nothing left to do  But prove myself to you and we'll keep it running  But this time, I mean it I'll let you know just how much you mean to me  As snow falls on desert sky  Until the end of everything  I'm trying, I'm trying  To let you know how much you mean  As days fade, and nights grow And we go cold  Until the end, until this blood  Until this, I mean this, I mean this  Until the end of...I'm trying, I'm trying  To let you know how much you mean  As days fade, and nights grow And we go cold  But this time, we'll show them  We'll show them all how much we mean  As snow falls on desert sky  Until the end of every...   All we are, all we are  Is bullets I mean this  As lead rains, will pass on through our phantoms  Forever, forever  Like scarecrows that fuel this flame we're burning  Forever, and ever  Know how much I want to show you you're the only one  Like a bed of roses there's a dozen reasons in this gun  And as we're falling down, and in this pool of blood  And as we're touching hands, and as we're falling down  And in this pool of blood, and as we're falling down  I'll see your eyes, and in this pool of blood  I'll meet your eyes, I mean this forever               Got to pick up my sister tmr, which means more driving practice. Brother's back at school.  I hate how queenslanders get it so easy when it comes to driving. They just need some practice then they can get their P's?  CRAZY  In Vic, we have to have 120 hours of driving practice, with an experienced driver always by our side. We then need to sit 3 tests. A written test, a virtual driving test and a real driving around test. If we pass, we get our P's. After 3 years on out P's (when we turn 21) we can have a full license. Before you say 'sooo simple', it's not. You can't drink any alcohol at all while on L's or P's. So that means no alcoholic trifles and what not. They're very strict too. You do anything wrong, you're off your L's/P's for at least 3 months and then have to resit the test.  It was really funny though, when I first got my L's, my dad pulled over and I got in the front and started going vroom vroom. I drove past a booze bus, and a few seconds later, dad piped up. 'Why have you got your parking lights on?' I'm just glad I didn't get pulled over :|            Wonderful morning.  Dad's sick - got the flu or something, so he's home. Mum's working all day.  Lots of people online. Just no one I actually talk to :P  Hearshot Kid Disaster - Coheed & Cambria.  I love this song.  I listened to it alot when we went to Brisbane. I way wasn't over Dan when we went (and considering he lives in Brisbane - and I saw his friend every day), so it was a really depressing trip. The song kept me busy. I so didn't enjoy being in Brisbane. I'm glad we went though - simply because of my new clothes :P I don't know what I would do without my cargo's.  I'm sorry. For the lies I've spielt. Please forgive me, For my demise.  I apoligise, with all sincerity, Please accept this, I am alone.  I need who stood by me, supported and cared, back with me, return.  For you know who you are, and you know how much I need you, I'm broken and wrecked,  but I am too weak.  I want to turn back time, and remove all the tapestry, that dared ensue my life. Please, my worm.    \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
