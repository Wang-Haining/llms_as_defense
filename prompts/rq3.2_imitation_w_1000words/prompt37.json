History  - crossword puzzle 3.  Indepent Study in Music  - i will be going to  studyhall  which im happy about 4.  Band  - ugh! we have to play 5.  Studyhall  - i actually have a studyhall that im spose to be in 6.  French  - i will again be going to  studyhall . we dont have class 7.  Phy Ed  - we'll probably weightlift so see there is no point to going to school tomorrow. moving on...i did learn something today though...i learned how to use some of the weightlifting equip. today. i cant lift very much but at least i can do it. i can lift anywhere between 50 and 80 for my arms. 80 is pushing it though and my legs i think anywhere between 30 and 60. lets talk about lunch...guys are  asses  especially the ones who sit w/ sarah and i. we do not have to take any of that crap! today really got to me and for the first time it was also directed toward me and i listened and it really hurt me. normally they just make fun of sarah and say really cruel things and laugh in her face and i always told her to not let it get to her but today it got to me. i really dont understand why they needed to rag on us i mean we didnt do anything to deserve what they said to us.  band...i needed to go to a mental institution  only for today during that period. too much  flute  this and that! ahhh! i wish school would just be done w/!                       so last nite was SOUNDSATIONS it was grand! uhm, i didnt really care much for that Jazz Band...but they were good. I learned that some people who i thought couldnt sing could actually really sing. The pie was good i guess  uhm, this weekend well actually tomorrow is the FIRST real race at KNOXVILLE! i just hope it doesnt get rained out or anything. Skip's Car Is looking GOOD! ok well ima gonna add a link to my 'raceblog' and maybe to hannah's since i was checking out chads and he posted that she had one so i went and read a few entires pretty interesting and uhm yeah but right now  i need to go and clean out the litter box....aww i dont want to.....its really icky when tiger decides she wants to use it as im cleaning it out and so i have to switch and do the other one. yes we have 2 litter boxes....and 2 kittens actually they're not all that small anymore...ok i know that was just way to much info but if you know me when i talk its hard for me to stop so ok i really need to stop typing and go. if i remember which i doubt b/c im so forgetful i'll post or well add to this later but all that i'll remember is to add links and stuff.  ok im leaving NOW!                       Last nite was the game and we lost but we did good i think. i actually saw like a whole play where cj almond got a touchdown that was pretty cool and then i also saw another touchdown but i cant remeber who got that one but yeah i was so excited that i was yelling and screaming and wow it was awesome. then i saw and heard the impact when a midget and one of our players...cant remember who but they collided and i saw it and heard it and yeah they was hovering over both of them for a long time then our player got up and that a good thing but the other player was put on one of those board things and put in the ambulance. after we performed the national anthem for pre-game fireworks went off and that was really cool too i turned around to look even though we werent spose too then when we made the tunnel and football players ran through they had really cool like pyros that went off on either side of them as they ran through...it was so cool! oh and when we got a touchdown everytime the also had fireworks go off. itwas just way cool i though....whoo-hoo!   me and sarah went to the dance just b/c and partly b/c of something else but anyways we went it was super lame but we stayed til like 12:10 and then i drove her home and i went home and yeah it was really lame like last year but hey its homecoming why not go? there wasnt a whole lot of ppl there either....i didnt see any football or cheerleaders there so im assuming they had another party and yeah.  tomorrow i have a master class to attend for all-state preparations and i've never gone so i dont really know what expect. it think it'll be fun though.                         Friday : we had large group contests in Forrest City. I thought we did really good but i guess not as good as i thought we got a 2 rating. the other band, 9-10 got a 3 rating which is just unbelievable b/c i thought they did better than what they did at the parade of bands. anywho back to my band we played really good i thought but yes there were some mistakes but overall i thought it was good. my solo-sih trio-ish part i sort of goofed up on in this one measure where i always mess up on but i dont think it was that noticable.   Saturday : i had a wedding reception to go to which was a total complete boring time. the food was good but it was super boring. dad and i didnt go to the races which i guess is ok but  tony stewart  was at knoxville i guess, supposedly.  Sunday : i went out to my grandparents house for a lunch type of thing and laura and my little cousins were there. it was grand. i went out to the pasture and hit a baseball around then i lost it and couldnt find so i looked forever til i found it and i did then stopped and decided to mow the pasture. i got a nice sunburn. dad looks like a LOBSTER! ha!         \n'''\n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
