I was talking things over with myself, yes myself , and have found that I am distancing from my moms death. I am moving on from the situatuon more and more as time goes by. I have learned  that time heals many wounds. Noty entirely , but it helps. I havnt spoken to my dad in 1 year or more. I am not even sure what he thinks about me anymore. I dont think I care, but not sure. He maybe realizes the large mistake he made with being such a incredibly large jackass in more ways then 1 for several months of hell. Either way , it doesnt change anything.   Moving on from my dad ... I hope that life gets easyer in reguards to this last year of school. Junior year I still felt large effects of whats transpired 2002-2003. It hit so hard im just getting up and dusting myself off now about to go on.   -- Going to start a video project this week on the election and what it affects, from peoples to animals and all that lies in between. It will be an ongoing process concluding February 1st 2004, the first day of presidency for the 2004-2008 term. If you are asking why I am doing this, it provides a angle of America of how and election does and does not impact a person.   Side note to the vid - http://www.unitedforpeace.org/article.php?id=2428   Its a protest against Bush Aug29th, during Republican Convention                     Support our troops! --  Migraine was nothing serious, as so the the doc says.   --  I was discussing my take on women with someone and apparently what I want in a gal is to much to ask. :   'LanceA28: no but u see my point **** : No I don't.  Because you shop for girls like your at Circuit City buying TVs.  You want the most expensive one, the thin one, the one that looks nice, that people will be impressed with when they visit you. LanceA28: well i want more then a plasma tv. i want to know it intimatly ****:Yea, you want to sit in front of it every night, staring at it's beauty, you want to take it in for all it's worth.  The amazing technology.It doesn't matter what it says to you, what's on the screen, it's just that it's yourself, in your own home.  It's a status symbol and something to marvel at and you like it.The point is that you need to look beyond looks, so to speak.  People are not objects.  You should shop with a blindfold on.  What does looks matter if one's personality is horrible.  Sure, you don't want someone who's wider than your uncle's hummer, but your standards are unreasonable.'  Now what **** says is not exaclty accurate. I love women for who they are and for what they have to offer into a relationship. A relationship is a mutual thing. The dictionary stating a relationship to be, 'The condition or fact of being related; connection or association.' I agree , 100% .   Women are amazing and should alway be treated with 100% respect and with dignity. Any less is unacceptable in todays society.                        Bin Laden is next   ----------------- EPD Rules!   Dare Race went very well. approx. 170 people ran. Though I was in charge of most of what was going on, it was still a lot of fun.  ----------------------------------  Ross got his G5 Desktop today. I cant wait to get his old computer, its better then myn.  So , overall, life is very good right now, we are getting a new John Deere Tractor, a dog soon , ross's computer ,and I am making $ (though I had to pay alot of $ in taxes last week) All is good.   On another note, I have been contimplating whether or not to take most everything that has happend in my life (thats of interest) and put into book form. See , so many people know me , but they know little about me if you were to ask them, or atleast they would know um-important facts, or simply make assumptions. The story of me is complex, and sometimes very personal and compelling. But I feel that I want to at the very least document my life as it has unfolded thus far. It would cover the major events ( as I see them ) of my life by approx. It will range from a large variety of topics , I think, i am yet to figure the format of the 'book' yet.                       Support our troops! -- Bush's radio address today  : 'Good morning.  My most solemn duty as President is to protect our country, and in the three years since our country was attacked, we have taken important steps to overcome terrorist threats to this nation.e have pursued terrorists across the world, destroying their leadership and denying them sanctuaries.  We are working with other governments to break up terror cells and stop planned attacks, on virtually every continent.  We've created a new Department of Homeland Security......... ' ,            BLAH BLAH BLAH.  Though later in the address what struck me in taking a 2nd look was this , '... our country is safer than it was on September the 11th, 2001. '  Ofcourse our contry is safer then the day of 9/11. Any place is safer the NYC , DC that day. How stupid is that sentence. No matter what he meant, its a very un-intelligent sentence. On 9/11 we were attacked , out fireman and police and ems were the first soldiers into the war on terroism. NYC and DC were the front lines as far as I see it. Someone explain to me then how a place is  not  safer then NYC and DC on 9/11/01 ??                         ------ Cheney in July '04 at a rally in Arizona , speech ,  ' Now, as you might have heard, there was a political gathering in Boston this week.   THE VICE PRESIDENT: It's now official -- I have an opponent. (Laughter.) No, really, I have an opponent. People keep telling me that Senator Edwards was picked for the job because of his good looks, his charm, his great hair. (Laughter.) I said, 'How do you think I got the job?' (Laughter and applause.) ' Exactly how did he get the job ? Now I am not saying Edwards is 100% what we need but, come on!! Cheney is as well qualified as my cat for VP.                 ---------- I thought I would express my mind alittle on the crack squad of savy motivators and do'ers in the top of this country. If Bush means the ideals of the US , well I  am  moving to Australia . As far as polls go , the race overall is close. Though today Kerry had a 8% lead on Bush when it came to who the people trust more on national secuirty. What does that tell ya ? Lets get Kerry in office and maybe we can focus on a few more things then just Terroism. Not to say terroism isnt a important issue , but lets apply some focus on medicare, education and enviroment.          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
