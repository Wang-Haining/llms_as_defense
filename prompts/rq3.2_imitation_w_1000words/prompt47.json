It's been a pretty laid back week to say the least.  Tuesday after work, I went up to Ch'town for a bit...hung out with Donovan, then the two of us went over to Dave's for supper. Dave BBQ'd shark and it was delicious!!!! I went to see 'my man' for a bit afterwards and then headed to Ruth's for Big Brother and Amazing Race.  Yesterday, Pam (my co-worker) and I went on a 'field trip'  We went and hiked a trail near Stanhope because we're working with a community that is thinking of doing something similar.  We also stopped at the Island Preserve Co. on the way back; the owner put in a botanical garden so we took a walk through there.  We were back by about two but instead of going back to work, we each went home and pretended like our trip took all day!  I was poolside by 2:30 and it was HOT!!!!  It started out as a cool and dreary day but ended up being a scorcher.  Last night, I lazed around, went to Wallyworld with Ruth and that was about it.  Today should be a busy one at work.  I have a lot of paperwork to get caught up on.  I'm facilitating a Business Camp in two weeks so I have to start getting things in order for that.  Should be fun though!                   Hi All: Phew! What a night last night!  I was sooooooooo homesick for living in Ch'town and being a 'hop in the car' away from visiting my friends...Not a big deal, it's that time of the month but I was one sad chicken last night. All the talk yesterday about how I was looking forward to having a romantic night with Ethan on Friday had me missing him in a HUGE way yesterday.  I tried him in the morning, he was asleep...tried him in the evening he was at work...tried him even later...he wasn't home... in the midst of all this, I watched 50 First Dates which made me think of him and then also started reading my new book which was girly and made me laugh but also a bit sappy.  All in all, I missed my boyfriend and didn't get the opportunity to talk to him...Sometimes I really hate living in Scummerside.  I like my job and I have a great arrangement with Joanne and Jerry but I don't know...I still feel confined sometimes...Ch'town isn't that far away but fuck,...anyways...as you can tell, I'm still in a 'mood' today...I'll post again when I'm in a more positive frame of mind                  Hi all!  Work is busy today!  I just looked at the clock and it's 11:20...I've been working steady since I got in this morning.  It's nice to have the day off on Friday but it kinda sucks fitting 5 days of work into 4.  After being bummed about not talking to Ethan the other night, I ended up talking to him like 3 times yesterday plus one REALLY cute voicemail from him on my cell phone as well.  He's so cute!  Tonight they're having a 'hardcore BBQ' at there place.  Four bands...Buried Inside (from Ottawa), Doctor Unk, Cheers to Beers, Gruesome Feast and another band Poison.  I've been to the last two shows at their place.  The turnout is pretty amazing.  They do it all-ages, no alcohol allowed, and even though the kids are thrashing around like crazy their respectful at the same time.  Besides the bands, their BBQing veggie burgers and dogs, having salad etc.  I've chosen not to attend though, I'm opting for a night with my Ruby Tuesday.  I'll see Ethan tomorrow night and all day Friday!!!!  So yes, tonight I'm hanging with Ruth...we may veg and watch a movie, or possibly head into the Heritage Pub for trivia to meet up with some of the other nurses she works with. My cash flow is pretty limited so I'm hoping just to hang and watch a movie.  Anyways, my life is unexciting...I don't know why I'm continuing to ramble.  Hope y'all having a great day.                   Tonight I teach my first marketing workshops to the participants in the Young Millionaires Program. I’m here until 8 o’clock tonight so I’ve been pacing myself workwise this morning.  For some reason, I started searching friends’ names in google.  This is what I found so far:    urlLink Ruth Dawson       urlLink Adam Genge       urlLink Amy Sprague       urlLink Nadine Reeves       urlLink Julie Clow       urlLink Charlene Gillis       Some things you may have noticed... Although Nadine's last name is now Stevens...I put a link to Nadine Reeves only because the story of Nadine Reeves was about how her son had been killed by cops (not so happy) Julie (by far) had the most actual articles about herself or that she had written Charlene actually wrote that paper at Mount A And obviously, the others are not my real friends.  Kinda blows my mind that there are other people in the world named the same because as far as I'm concerned my friends are one of a kind!!!!  Corny eh?!?!?!         \n'''\n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
