He was concerned that maybe my devoted readers (all 4 of you) would think I was dead...you know, that I had finally succumbed to the tetanus. But nope - I'm still alive and well. Well,  alive  anyway. Yes...my jaw still hurts. It must be the TMJ I have, since I have the neck/back pain and headaches to go along with it. I really hate my jaw. If I could change one thing about my body, it would be my jaw. Wait, no. Scratch that. I am way more vain than that. I would change a physical feature first.  So it's Thursday, and it's my day off. So far, my day has been boring. I brought my car in this morning to have the CD player checked out. It took the d00ds about an hour and 20 minutes to 'diagnose' the problem. I have no idea what the problem was (they don't tell you these things), but they said they are ordering me a new radio. w00t. And it's all free, since it's still under warranty. Life is good.  Other than that, eh...just the same old same old. I added a new person to my favorite people list over on the sidebar.  urlLink Bada Bing  was nice enough to take the time to read my blog and comment, and this is his reward! So whoever reads this, go check out  his  blog please. And also, if you could maybe check out  urlLink my boyfriend's blog  and  urlLink my pal Keitha's blog , I am sure they would greatly appreciate it.                        So today is my doctor's appointment, and needless to say, I'm kind of nervous. Of course, I am afraid he is going to take one look in my throat and tell me that I have a tumor, and that I only have about 6 more months left to live. You see, it's not only the lump that has been concerning me. I've had things going on for the past few months - things that I have ignored because I hate going to see the doctor. Now I'm just afraid I am going to find out there is something terribly wrong with me, and that it is too late to have it reversed because I waited too long to have it checked out.... *Sigh*  I need to take my mind off of this. What is a good way to do that? Oh yeah - work! I have to leave in less than an hour, and work up until 45 minutes before my appointment. I guess work is a good way to take one's mind off of something like this. At least I will get to work with my boyfriend for a couple of hours beforehand. He helps to calm  my nerves a little bit. That poor boy puts up with A LOT when it comes to being my boyfriend. And he does it without whining or complaining. He really, truly is the best thing that has ever happened to me. *kiss kiss, babe*                         So I turn 24 next week. Eek. One year away from a quarter of a century. Eek. Let me ask you...where has the time gone? It seems like just yesterday I was playing with my Barbie dolls, and running around in pigtails like I didn't have a care in the world. And now...now my Barbies have all been sold in a yard sale, and I never wear pigtails. Nor do I run anymore, for fear I will drop dead of a heart attack (not really...I'm just out of shape and lazy). &nbsp; So anyway...I can feel my biological clock ticking. Ticking away. Practically everyone I went to high school with is now married or has children, or both. But they're all just kids! No, wait...they're  not &nbsp; kids anymore. It's so hard to think of myself (and them) as adults. It's just not possible. I mean, one of my friends from high school is 25, and she just had a baby a couple of weeks ago. But she does not&nbsp;seem like she is 25. I keep thinking of her as that teeny bopper girl in high school, who loved New Kids on the Block.  She  had a baby?! What the...?! It's so hard to believe, really. It all seems surreal. Everyone is growing up. Including me. Yet...I feel like I'm standing still. I have hardly evolved since high school. I'm not married. I haven't had a baby. I don't have a career. It's like I am frozen in time. All around me, time is ticking away. I can hear it, see it, and feel it tick on by, but I'm not doing anything. Oh look at me....I'm rambling. &nbsp;  Tetanus Update #...3? 4?  Eh...anyway...my jaw&nbsp;still hurts a bit. And it's still a little stiff. But maybe it's gotten better. I'm not sure. I should knock on wood when I say that. I've never understood how knocking on wood has any significance whatsoever, but I say it all the time nonetheless. Look! I'm rambling again! I think I need to go find something to do.       \n'''\n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
