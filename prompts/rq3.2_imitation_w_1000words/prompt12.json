  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic:\n\n       i can't believe it's august already! where'd july go??? it's already 'back-to-school' shopping time (silent cheering from my chair) and my kids are SO ready to go back! ok, maybe i am more ready for them to go back, but whatever... one month vacation is plenty.  yesterday, i took my son to get some new sneakers.... he's 12, going on 35. he already knew what he wanted, mowed the lawn at least 10 times to earn the money for them. (mind you, our lawn is acres) so now he is the proud owner of a pair of sneakers that were more expensive than my entire closet of shoes. damn. but he earned them.  so while we're browsing the aisles for clothes for my daughter (she's 9) i can't help but notice there is no difference in buying for a 9 year old than buying for me (not a 9 year old). all the jeans, low rise, snug fitting in the seat, tops cut to fit, cropped to show off ... show off what? a 9 year olds belly button?! wtf. she found a pair of jeans to try on, slipped into the changing room and came out to show me. when she came out, she told me she didn't like the pants, (thank god) so i asked why...  'cuz I can't sit down in them without my bum showing.'  and that is what happens when you sit on the floor in a 4th grade classroom when it is circle time and all the kids sit on the rug in front of the teacher while she talks....  who decides what children's clothes should look like anyway? children in elementary school should not look 'sexy'. it's sick. it just is.  funny how all the boys clothes are baggy and loose fitting with a hundred oversized pockets on the jeans and t-shirts that are too big for me.                  living in the middle of the nowhere in particular limits my pizza intake.  noone delivers in the boonies.  all for the better i guess.  nibbling on carrot chips dipped in fat free ranch dressing is better i suppose.  it's the commercials on TV that get ya... i'd kill for a spicy chicken sandwich from wendy's right about now...  it's lack of sleep, really.  see, in the wee hours of this morning when i couldn't sleep, i was flipping channels on television and came across a commercial.  seems innocent enough.  for a blender.  but there in the commercial, probably not intentionally, is the reason why so many americans are over weight.     'it's that simple, you don't have to do a thing and clean up is a snap, just put it in the dishwasher'     seems innocent enough, but my brain was fully awake at 4a.m.  ...what it should have stated is this:   'it's that simple, don't get off your lazy ass to make a low-fat-good-for-you smoothie... snap the 'cup' on, push the button, turn it off, and take the 'cup' to go.  the rest is dishwasher safe, no point in wasting energy washing dishes when a machine can do it for you.'   i misplaced the remote during this commercial so i was forced to watch the entire thing.  cuz after all, why would i get up to change the channel?  i don't think i can do that on the TV itself anyway, can i?                     for quite some time now, i've been reading other blogs.  one in particular because he is quite entertaining... and as soon as i learn how, i will add some links and you can check him out.  anyway, today's post was a flash back, to the time around 9/11.  dealing with racial profiling.  just the phrase alone makes me tense.  i am a white american, lived overseas, but looks alone i'd probably not be asked for an ID as much as a non-white person might. the term racial profiling makes me feel like i should apologize for my skin color.  i don't believe we should ID anyone based on looks alone.  yet i do understand the immense fear after what happened on 9/11.  so many if's... if we paid more attention, if we didn't have any corruption in our own government, if we followed rules we created in the beginning to keep our selves safe, if we didn't cut budgets where it counted and had the people or equipment necessary ....  well, it happened.  now we're left to deal with it.  i still don't believe in racial profiling.  and i don't get angry when the airport security tells me to take off my shoes.  just because i am white doesn't mean i think racial profiling is right.  i'm sure there is an answer that is politically correct to all of this... and i am also sure there will be many people who have lost or will lose loved ones because of terror issues that will want answers and actions.  it's a shame it isn't a perfect world.  just as it would be a shame if a person of another ethnic backgound known to be some type of extremist crashed a plane on your loved one, knowing it could have been avoided had someone ID'd him before he got on the plane.  touchy subject for sure...  you got the right answer?               \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
