I’m the same human being, the same person from head to feet                  “An Oasis in the Wilderness”  A child scorned by his mother before he’s delivered  Shivered in the womb, the lake of life, the maternal river Phobia of a premature birth, the earth’s tomb captures her desires The efforts retire, the struggles expire, not knowing where they’re going Lost in the fears of haunted memories as her blood pressure gets higher  Credulous of her infected fate, zeal of impatience infested her ability to wait Intended aspirations proved to be bait, the hate of life was the hook Thunder shook her bosom tremors awake her from slumber The negligence came in numbers, her experiences too petrifying to be remembered  Amnesiac past, pediatric care was lost, burning respiration turns to frost  Yearning to free the predicaments, clearing of dark smoke and the suffocating scents Her feelings fluctuated with terror and looking at the mirror She was puzzled by the presence of no reflective image Her mind sizzled with vigor and rage  She salvaged her pounding heart from sinking in her blood The wrath eased, the burdens ceased, she was rescued from her knees Even though her dungeons had no keys Miracles sparkled her eyes, a halo sprayed when she smiled Rescued from turmoil her seed emerged from the soil  Germinated by the truth, developed into her roots Evolved into happiness, her problems resolved, found an oasis in the wilderness                  “Product Of Sin”  Virgins fornicate on a night with a full moon and trigger changes in the equinox An entire day of darkness, blackness pervades the air with the wind The sun never rises, light disguises as shadows The birth of innocence, the womb was infested by sin The placenta was the tears  of Christ protected, showered, I devoured divinity My birthstone fell from the sky as ice and shattered into signs of zodiac  Sucked knowledge as milk, inhaled parental acceptance, exhaled the negligence of hate In the presence of peasants, living was unpleasant but happiness had wealth  Inhibition of pain, evanescence of sanity, an introduction to despair   The stars melted when I cried, the nights got dim Time deceived my fragile little mind, the days vaporized with the past I hid in the attic when in fright; I slept in the cellar when the thunder tried to shatter my future I inherited a curse, but blessings poured when it rained, unfortunately the clouds were dry The strange fruit which came from the trees with missing roots, the product of impatience and disobedience                    “No Tuning Back Now”  With no conscience, it strikes with a vengeance, unexpected, premeditated like an avalanche  Veins dry like a broken branch, as fast a rocket launch, your untimely departure haunts, the minds of humans vulnerable to death, stiff body with a stench  Hands bloody, no scientific study can stop this blood dripping, electric shock with static, hair sticking out like wires of a fence  Extremely diaphanous, see right trough the cumulus, the clouds screen the beam of the sun when it shines, but everything seen isn’t what it seem  Clean smell of the blossoms that bloom when kids scream, pollinated by insect, nature had no defect, but now the ozone is destroyed because of our neglect and lack of acceptance  Scientific inventions of plastic, anesthesia flushes away the feeling and my skin feels like bricks Sympathetic when you’re sick, taste of garlic when I lick, rendezvous with destiny, never seen the worst of me, there’s more resistance to come when it time for defense  Apple crushed, cider to a brew, new innovations the sea is no longer blue, because the sky is now white, from the smoke precipitated acid rain burns the kite which once flew But it no longer flies, increasing hunger, lives in danger, but only in certain places, another suffers the curse of races, but unfortunately only one chance  No turning back now, sky’ll soon turn to black, no time to pack when it’s Armageddon, a day in history, the stop to all mystery, the coming of the lord, prophecies were true, we had no clue, but now we do, no turning back now, nothing we can do, no more existence                  \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
