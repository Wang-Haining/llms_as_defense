I must've watched too much tv or too many movies, or some shit because I just have this _stupid_ idea that one day - BAM! - love at first sight.   >  Wake the fuck up, Willis; not gonna happen.  Especially when you expect it to happen.  That's when Murphy's at his greatest.  Oh, I've tried NOT expecting it, but that really doesn't make sense, does it?  How can you NOT expect something, because you're always thinking about NOT expecting it...stupid ass catch-22... And then on top of it all, (hypothetically speaking here, of course) if it ever did happen, it's not going to be w/some woman who looks like Shania Twain.  Or Sophie Ellis-Bextor.  Or Sandra Bullock.  Or Jane Leeves...you get the picture.  Basically I'm screwed.  Mentally I can accept that, but even w/all this proof (history), I still have the hardest time NOT believing in it.  When I was a kid, I used to think how someday I would just live by myself, away from everyone, and how much I would enjoy the silence and peace.  Now I realize that it would SUCK, because I kinda feel like that now, even though I have a roommate, talk to people everyday, etc.  But I feel so secluded, alone.  For some reason I feel like people talk to me because they have to, to be 'considerate, or nice' to fit in w/their peers.  I just wish I could be a 'fly on the wall' when I'm not there one day and really hear/know what they say/think about me.  How pathetic is that of me...that was a rhetorical question, ass :)                       dejected does not even begin to describe the level of depression, pissed off, disappointed, & sadness i feel right now.  jesus christ, i don't even have the fucking urge to capitalize my goddamn sentences.  if you know me, you'll know that's fucking bad.  i had hope for this evening.  i don't know what for, but what i got wasn't it.  i need a companion.  a wife.  a soulmate.  i need more than a friend can give.  and i have nothing.  i need someone who will be there when i come home, who i can ask how her day went, and when she asks me how mine went, i can say, even if it was shitty, 'honey, YOU just made it the best day of my life.'  if i am ever lucky enough to have that for one day, 1 life would be grand, but 2, if she ever left, after have knowing what it's like to have her here, i don't think i could live w/out her.  look how fucking bad i am now, BEFORE i even KNOW what life is like with her, let alone actually feeling and experiencing the joy, the life she gives me and then taking it all away, i don't think i would or could live after that.  what a pathetic piece of shit i am.  look at me, i'm garbage.  fucking going to sleep at fucking quarter to midnight on a goddamn fri night.  fucking worthless.....                       Once in your life you find her  Someone that turns your heart around  And next thing you know you're closing down the town  Wake up and it's still with you  Even though you left her way across town  Wondering to yourself, 'Hey, what've I found?'   When you get caught between the Moon and New York City  I know it's crazy, but it's true  If you get caught between the Moon and New York City  The best that you can do...  The best that you can do is fall in love   Arthur he does as he pleases  All of his life, he's mastered choice  Deep in his heart, he's just, he's just a boy  Living his life one day at a time  And showing himself a really good time  Laughing about the way they want him to be   When you get caught between the Moon and New York City  I know it's crazy, but it's true  If you get caught between the Moon and New York City  The best that you can do...  The best that you can do is fall in love   When you get caught between the Moon and New York City  I know it's crazy, but it's true  If you get caught between the Moon and New York City  The best that you can do...  The best that you can do is fall in love  -Arthur's Theme, by Christopher Cross                       Well, as much has I HATE dayshift, I'm up now and I feel somewhat optomistic about getting some shit done.  I don't know what, just stuff.  I need to do an oil change, get my timing belt & tensioner changed, fix a damn broken bulb (that I bought 2 days ago!), and I feel like spending some money on computer shit, but I hate waiting for shipping, so I may just go carrouse around town and see what's up.  I'm feeling a little better than meloncholy, not sure why...I guess cuz I got off early today, but then I think, 'hey dammit, we got off early and that's all fine and dandy, but why did swing shift get off COMPLETELY?!  WTF WILLIS?!!'  God I miss swingshift.  Ok, I also need to pickup dry cleaning, I better not forget that shit.  I need to buy some food too.  Not sure what, but I'm getting sick of cooking shit.  I need to buy some premade, no-cooking-req'd food.  Snack food kicks ass.  Damn,  urlLink Jane Leeves  (on my desktop) is fucking hot.  I need this picture blown up and put on my wall.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
