I have just bought  The Sims Deluxe Edition  and I can''t stop playing it. I'm at the library once again and the kids reading session is about to begin on the other end of the room. &nbsp; My former contributor and good friend, Jace Walker, has  urlLink written a novel  based on the hit French anime series, Code: Lyoko.&nbsp;On the home page,&nbsp;it's the first installation of Code: Lyoko - Chaos Factor. Jace is also constructing a forum on Code: Lyoko, so when that premieres you'll be some of the first to know. Heck, he's getting so successful I think I'll bring him back, if that's okay with my readers. Please comment on this post with your opinion. &nbsp; I also want to thank my readers for being with me this whole summer, making my website a wonderful palce to be. When I was thinking of giving up this site, people came to read and comment. After August 11th, don't expect a whole lot of posts during the weedays, for my first year in high school will be a busy one. Thanks again and keep visiting, because I think we're gonna be here a while...                  You will NOT believe this.&nbsp;Today on our local classic rock radio station  urlLink 92.5 KZPS , the normal morning DJ's were on vacation. Bo Roberts and Jim White were somewhere enjoying their vacation whole-heartedly while Mondo Mike, a lousy filler DJ, kept the seats warm. Mondo Mike was doing quite well and in his third hour of a five hour slot. He would soon make a mistake that would ruin his career forever.   NOTE: This is completely and solemnly true. I heard this just this morning&nbsp;my way to Lake Dallas. Back to the&nbsp;story.  When the commercial break came along, poor Mondo Mike forgot to turn off his microphone, and started talking to the traffic guy sitting next to him. During a commercial for GMC, Mondo Mike yelled the f-word three times in a row so loud that you could hear him over the loud background music on the GMC Sierra commercial. They kept talking as if nothing happened, and we kept hearing them in the background of the commercials for a good two minutes. All of a sudden the jabbering stopped, and the commercials continued. Then, the station returned with a song, then to reruns of Bo and Jim's best moments.  Mondo Mike has most likely lost his career at KZPS, and his FCC license revoked. He'll never return to this town again.                    I'm my personal news, I now have a wonderful 3-month-old Chocolate Lab simply named 'Buddy'. He's due for his Rabies vaccine tomorrow so I may be taking a trip to Dr. Stucky tomorrow. Yesterday afternoon  urlLink our phone company  ran into a few problems with our phone and our phones were dead all of yesterday afternoon and this morning, but all is well now and the news shall go on.  Call for Help 2.0 with Leo Laporte in Toronto will start taping August 3-6. The new CFH will only be broadcast on G4TechTV Canada.  From Leoville:  The Chicago Tribune, which hasn't missed an issue since the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, crashed yesterday. A software glitch left 40% of subscribers newspaperless. The rest got truncated editions with weird page numbering and washed out colors. The publisher says it will cost 'under $1 million' to fix the problem.    Electronic Arts, (EA), has reported huge success of their series of Harry Potter games. EA says profits have increased 32% compared to the same time last year. EA just keeps belting 'em out, don't they?  Gateway continues to srivel ike a prune after they posted a loss of $339 million. The sruggling computer manufacturer has reported that they are approaching better time since their deal with Best Buy.  Sony will release a 7.2 megapixel consumer digital camera that is an inch thick and is poket-sized. The Cybershot DSC-150 will be released this September.                 Ok guys, time for another update.  Legend of Zelda fans, it's time for another awakening.  The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures for Gamecube is here!  There are so many awesome features!  Let's start with the new single player mode (oh, and the graphics are all like Legend of Zeldas for Gameboy, only with a little more real-life 3-D and a bit of cartooning from Wind Waker.).  In this, you'll be able to control all 4 Links as you battle through hordes, and I literally mean HORDES of monsters, mights, and magics in one setting to reach your goal.  Not to mention the different formations that you can use.  They are as follows: wide (horizontal), long (vertical), cross, and box.  The plot is like this:  You meet Shadow Link and he tricks you into pulling out the Four Sword, releasing Vaati, that wind sorcerer that you all met in GBA's Four Swords.  You go throughout the land of Hyrule searching for him and try to put him back.  As for multiplayer, enjoy stabbing your teammates in the back!  After going to Tingle's tower, you'll be able to play many multiplayer games with your GBA's, all connected to the GCN of course.  Well, that's all I got for now.  Next time I'll come back with Sony's PSP:  Sony's version of Nintendo DS.  'Till then!         \n'''\n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
