I've taken to saying it more and more because it's just one of those fun words to say! Like.. 'hugemongous' or-or 'qoinkidink' or 'fucky'! And this is my inner child poking her head out.. or is it my all-the-time child? Hm. Back on the topic, don't you remember when 'trippy' was around all the time? I really don't, actually. But it should come back.   A memory came flying back to me the other day.. when I was a little girl, my mom had my brother and I going to church every sunday and had us also attend primary school once the sacrament was over. We were Mormons [I don't belong to any one religion as of late]. And there was this TV show on PBS which was affiliated with our [and others] that chose different primary classes from different schools to come and participate in the show. It was some childrens morning game/talk-type show. So once our clas was chosen, I was ecstatic.. I was around 5 maybe?  So we went to the studio and my dad waited in the lobby while my brother and I went into the filming room with the other kids and the first thing which was filmed [it was live, btw] was which one of us could say 'insert tv show's name' the loudest. Of course I raised my hand to participate in that and once he got to me, I went to scream it in the microphone but no sound came out. I had lost my voice. On live TV. At the age of 5.   ETA : I absolutely must add this.  urlLink George the Monkey                      Now, this has been itching at me. And it's my memory. Why were people staring at my mary-janes? This continually happened throughout that year of school, yet I never knew why. Too shiny? Too new? Too girly? Was I the only one wearing them or was I just following the trend? Or does this just prove that kids, of whatever age, have that evil side to them? Okay, that's a given. Hm.. I keep coming back to being the only one wearing them. Maybe that conclusion will quench my mind for now.  ***  The wind blew the tree branches against the window, bringing forth a strange scratching noise. One that Maggie could not stand, but thankfully she was about to have company and the approaching storm would not be a bother to her much longer.  She rose from her chair and padded over to the counter, where a bottle of wine and two glasses rested. Pushing her hair behind one ear, she removed the cork and held the stem of her glass as she poured. Once the liquid had settled, she brought the glass to her freshly glossed lips and took a tiny sip before a knock sounded at the door.  She set her glass down and made sure that her clothes were straightened and that her red hair was flyaway free. Satisfied, she sucked in a breath of fresh air and headed to the door.  Hand tight on the knob, she hesitated. This was something she'd been waiting for for a while. Yet she had her doubts. But this was not the time for them, so she forced all bad feelings out of her mind and softly smiled as she turned the knob and pulled the door open.  There he was, smiling back at her, with roses in his hand. His hair was spiked and his clothes were casual. His blue eyes shined bright as he stepped forward and wrapped his free arm around her waist, pulling her forward and into a hungry kiss.  Their mouths parted, still smiling. She stepped back into her apartment and away from the door. 'Come in.'  Wayne's eyes swept up and down her body before stepping inside and handing her the roses. She was wearing a blue and purple, form fitting sweater with dark blue jeans. They had decided not to wear anything special since they weren't going out. Yet there was something about the way she looked that night that made him think she had spent some extra time in front of the mirror.   Once the door was closed, Maggie walked back over to the counter and turned to him. 'Wine?'  He nodded in response from the chair he'd seated himself in. Her apartment had a vintage look to it, one which he liked very much. It was a small apartment but one that she had fixed up to her liking, making it feel quite comfortable to all.  Before he knew it, she had seated herself in the chair across from him and handed him his glass which he promptly took a sip of. And now it was time to begin.                     Have you heard the 'such is life' saying? What does that really mean, anyway? Though I don't understand, it annoys me nonetheless. Because it's always said about the bad.. just like 'everything happens for a reason'. Sure. I believe that. But ever notice that whenever someone says it, it's always about something shitty? It's strange.   Onto another topic I was thinking about earlier, on the way home from the airport. Ever just stop to think about the life of a greyhound? Here's a greyhounds average life cycle: You're born, you're trained for about a year and a half, you begin racing, getting whipped, kept in small cramped spaces, you run until you literally can't run anymore, you retire around 3 years old, and then you die with scars all over your body from a life with nothing but work. 'Such is life' John, a friend of mine, says. But shouldn't it be different? Shouldn't it be different at some point? My dad says you shouldn't get a puppy greyhound because if you get a puppy, an adult will die. You see, if nobody rescues [houses] the greyhounds once they retire, they kill them.   I had a greyhound when I lived in Las Vegas. Her name was Fay and she wasn't quite three yet, but she wasn't fast enough to race. So if nobody adopted her, they would have killed her. Once we got her, her body was covered in many, many cuts and scars and she was extremely timid around humans. We had two little mini-chihuahuas at the time, too. But I loved Fay and I wanted her to be happy and free around me, not timid and scared. So everyday when I'd come home from school, I'd go and I'd hang out with her, just because. I'd pet her until she would fall asleep or I would pet her while laying down next to her and napping with her. She warmed up to me instantly, and to my dad, who loved her just as much as I did. But she was still quite timid around my brother and mom. It even got to the point where, when I would come home from school or I had free time, I would go down in the big front room of our house and get on all fours and bark at her and run around playing with her. I would get a bowl and fill it with water and whenever she would go get a drink and rest, I would go and get a drink from my little bowl and drink out of it like she did, and lay down beside her to rest. She was basically my dog. And she was soo sweet. My little chihuahua dog, Sampson, was like her little puppy, too. He was the same color, just so much smaller, and he looked a lot like her. He would hang out with her in her big huge cage [she didn't have to sleep in it, of course, she had the freedom to do as she pleased around the house, but she liked it in there] and act like her little pup.   Until the day my mom decides Fay was too big for our house so we had to give her away. I was completely devistated. I was out on a bike ride with a friend and when I came back to the house, Fay was being put into someone's car. It felt like something was being ripped out of me and chopped into little pieces. My mom promised me we could go see her but we never did. Even when I wanted to, I would remind them 'Mom, you promised! Can we go visit now?' and it was always 'maybe another day, honey'. I miss her even to this day. I still love her, and wish she were here. Wish I had more than a few minutes notice before she was taken away, wish that her entire life had been different. That she didn't have to endure the years of pain and not being loved until she got to our house. I'm just glad she was among the many greyhounds they kill when they don't have a home to go to once they retire. I wish greyhounds didn't have such cruel lives, that no animal did. 'Such is life'? No, life should be different.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
