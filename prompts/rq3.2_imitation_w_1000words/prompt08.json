I sat on the four sided sea saw or something and my ass hurts now. but kids were like harrassing me and they didn't listen and they were saying stuff they shouldnt have been and busting me about this kid. Nina came to visit me which was cool .. i wish she was working again. Matt's going on vacation next week so i might be stuck walking home =\\ ooo and then my brother john threw something at a little girl and she cried for like 10 minutes and i was pissed at him and then i was arguing with my dad about it. in the end john is not going tomorrow but keira might be which is probally worse. ugg  I want to go for a run but it's too hot and i just cant run in this weather. Oh and i was going to have people over tonight but I dont think that's gonna work out either cause my mom's away and i cant deal with my father. And i need to visit my greatgrandma but my dad probally wont want to bring me but i havent seen her in a while =(  But i just read Mandie's journal and it motivated me to do sit-ups so i'm gonna go do that.. write more later   Pink Floyd- Wish You Were Here   'so you think you can tell heaven from hell, blue skys from pain?' *Kyle was playing that for me when i was talking to him on the phone yesterday so that made me happy and now i'm in a better mood =)  Well now it's 8:27 and i showered after my 45 minute/hopefully 4 mile run. My dad is bonding with steve over music like Pink Floyd ..who's CD i listened to when i was running and other real music like that. So that made me happy. I beleive people are going to carissa's after the Hannan bball game but i might just chill here. That's it for today xoxo -kacie                       haha well  today was quite an experience. In the afternoon&nbsp;my cousins came over and Angelina went online on the American Girl Doll website. While she was on that carissa called me from Atlantic City and i told her that. Then we started reminising on the dolls we used to play with. I asked my mom to get it outta the back-back closet and found that the cool thing to have when i was 10(ish?) was  Magic Attic  Dolls! So i started playing with mine. Her name is Rose and carissa has the same one. We decided that when she comes back we're gonna play with them together and buy clothes for them.. because they are sold on the streets of scranton haha. Then tonight I went to some festival/picnic i dont even know what it was haha. I think it was in pistton tho. I went with Mandie, Heath, and Matt who all some of my favorite people in the world! While we were there we called about every other person 'dirty' and that became the word of the day. I beleive that i started it haah but it was just an overall good time so it doesnt matter. When we were in Mandie's car planning on going home we had a little problem.. the car battery was dead! So she called her mom and they were going to come jump us. For the time being we tried to push the car... in the rain of course. It always rains at times like this haha. But that didn't work. I rang on the doorbell of the house we were in front of but nobody answered. A car was parked in front of ours so even if Mandie's mom came she would have had to go in the middle of the road for the jumper cables to reach. Then the lady who's car it was came (she was at the picnic) and she left and Mandie's mom came so it was all good. Her brother (who's 15) did all the hard work because Matt didn't know what he was doing. haha but Now i can say that i know how to jump a car so it was a good experience. But that's it for tonight. I have camp tomorrow so Ill update then =)&nbsp;   I got a country song that I'm rockin out too.. my love  Tim McGraw.  It's a new one by him so I give it my approval. 'I became a friend, a friend would like to have...Some day I hope you get the chance to  Live like you are Dying '&nbsp;&nbsp; .. amazing song that reminds me of my counrty lovin' days                       Today started off average. I had work and i got hit in the head with a tennis ball while playing 'wall ball'.. i was doing good too haha. Jared Hill was there for a little and that was cool cause i dont see him that often even tho he lives right by me. I cant wait till next year when ill get to see him hopefully everyday at school. He always was on of my favorite people in the world. Tonight I went to heath's house. That was really funny in the beginning but then matt got pissed off and left. We were bustin around with him and i took&nbsp;his keys and he just freaked out.. like he was really serious. I dont know if i've seen him that way in a while but he got bitchy and left. We all kinda expected him to come back but he never did =\\ I called him and he yelled at me .. a lot and i'm really not used to that from him. I feel really bad. I'll say i'm sorry again tomorrow at the park and hopefully he'll get over it. But it was a really good night besides that. The guys were all busting eachother about being gay and stuff. It was fun. Now i'm hearing that craig and heath are talking and that's really good. Me and heath were talking about that today and i told her it would be great if they could make up. Mandie still seems pissed but i hope they all .. live happily after and everything. Espically cause they're all going on&nbsp;vaca in 9 days and i wouldnt want that to be shitty for any of them. Craig might only be with them for two or something i'm not sure how it all works out but w.e.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Matt is on and i'm talking to him. He's bitching that he worked all day and he didn't need girls 'playing mind games with him' .. alriteee you work at the park with me which is nothing and at a tanning place where you sit and watch girls sign in! You over react and are a drama queen.. but yet i'm still saying i'm sorry. Go figure .. more tomorrow      CCR - 'I wanna know,  have you ever seen the rain , commin down on me.'            \n'''\n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
