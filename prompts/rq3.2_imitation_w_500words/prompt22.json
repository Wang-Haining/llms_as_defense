So...I pitched a fit in Music tech today because...I suck at it terribly....Terribly....It wasn't even like on purpose, I was like...ugh. I didn't, however have to play it until tomorrow, which requires me to RUN vigorously from C01 to A15 in order to finish my piece of shit Zelda Techno song which is just HORRID. I'd be better off playing something totally different, I'm just not musicallt talented, however, being a drama queen has it's advantages, such as drivng Mr. Jean to say 'enough drama, we'll do this tomorrow.' thank you God, thank you God!! Anyway, our drama peeps got back from conference on Sunday, and we (those of us that did not go) did get to hear about it. I was amazed by Colby Lemaster, as I always am, seeing as in my eyes, he is just remarkable. He is a juinor, and out of all the the...uh....7 people that auditioned for Sholarships Colby got 9 call backs from 9 different colleges. Truly, he is amazing, remember that name, he's not just a high school star, he'll be big, or at least, I'm hoping he makes it big, he deserves it, he's amazing. And he told me I was talented, so I nearly pissed my pants that day, even though I sounded pretty stupid, I was happy he said something, anyway, today was a new day in which I was grounded...for..ummm...a week. But that so matters not, I didn't go to school today... I'm uh....sick if you will,sick to my stomach, I was sobbing, and ugh, PMS took over....and I just died....not really...just went to sleep. Mental and Emotional breakdown really...just...ugh, had one. I am feeling so much better now though, after eating my weight in necco wafers. I just hope to hit school tomorrow, enough to be off book at rehersal....UGHH!! I HATE EMOTIONAL BREAKDOWNS! Insanity....INSANITY! I'm going crazy.....and...i just broke...down....   Ciao....  Steph                 Hello Houston.  'You say If you were to wait Something just might change I say That i don't have the strength  to burn our fueling Flame.'  -The Starting Line.  That was the first song that popped up on my Random. It says in the song that Love can make you stay. Somehow, I have gained belief for this. I.E., Casey. For those of you that know the story, doesn't it make sense? It does to me. I figured out..That I have a new favorite song, by my new favorite band (I have a new one each week). First off, It's either 'Kissing you goodnight' or 'On my mind' by Alister. Which is a band that rocks. But it's great song. I also like 'Somewhere Down in Fullerton.' Which is a great song by the same band. Anyway. I decided that my favorite movie was Ever After today. I like Princess Movies. Like The Princess Bride, which is such a GREAT movie. It's got the guy from Robin Hood: Men in Tights in it, as Wesley. Gosh I could go on for hours about that movies...those movies. I could aslo go on for hours about Homestar Runner and the enviroment. I'm such a Marizpan! Any...way...  Song of the moment: Seriously? -[The Sorry Song]- The Troys.  GRIPE: The name of that BAND!  Other gripe: COCAH WATERS!!   MUAH!! KC is my baby!!!          \n'''\n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
