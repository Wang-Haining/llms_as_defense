RIDICULOUS. this definitely makes them hotter than the  urlLink liars  right now.   im not sure how i feel about jarvis cockers  urlLink relaxed muscle  project yet. if noel gallagher says attempts at avant garde'ness are needless, then THEY ARE NEEDLESS. either way, we need the sexy jc back, not the idiotic deranged misfits costume bullshit.                                   for those of you who've absolutely no idea whats going on ever, the strokes have been appearing weekly every tuesday this month on conan. im assuming they're going to finish off with 12:51 but where was THIS END HAS NO END? gaaaah. in case you missed them you can download each performance here (whatever happened/reptilia/under control):   urlLink thestrokesfan.com   yah so i dont really see why anyone would bother reading this blog. i talk about/bash all these nyc bands despite the fact that i dont even live in the same country! there are plenty others much more firsthand and informative than my sporadic babbling but whatevs i guess. i think im going to have to find some HOOK or 'thing' that i and only i do and write about. suggestions would be awesome. t'was my birthday last week and im too old to come up with anything fresh anymore. also complete and utter laziness ad infinitum. until then, boring nyc-wannabe blog it is! eat it.  ps thanks giulia/ urlLink new york doll  for the sweet mention!  listening to: talking heads - mr jones             \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
