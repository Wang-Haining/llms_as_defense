Friday I got off school at 3:30pm&nbsp;and straight to work until 10 PM, went straight home to go to sleep then got up at 6AM for work in Nanaimo and got back at 10pm then straight to sleep I went again then got up again at 6AM to work at the Pacific National Exhibition lottery home until 5:15 then went for a workout at the gym and crammed 5 hours of homework in for a chapter test in math&nbsp;the next morning. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Things have been quite busy over the summer and I was planning on visiting old freinds and doing outdoor activities more than i have been but work and education get in the way of playtime which kinda sucks but it should pay off in the longrun. I have also changed my dieting program to eat more nutritious foods such as tuna, salmon, and chicken which i prepare in mass amounts to make it convienient to eat every 2-3 hours&nbsp;since i need a minimum intake of 130 grams of protein a day and still take supplements to improve my gains in the gym. &nbsp; **Sorry this post had to be so quick but i really just dont have the time at this moment in time to constantly update my blog. Gunna prepare some food&nbsp;for the next few days&nbsp;and go to sleep to cram geometry the next morning so this is good bye for now. GOOD BYE!**                       Lately the weeks seem like days, they have just been flying by and I feel like I haven't done anything exciting in a long time. I recently got some new channels that my parents ordered on the TV (Movie Central) and I never used to watch much TV but now I find myself in front of it for hours on end losing track of time slowly becoming a couch potato because these new channels have all the newest movies on and there is always something good to watch. I really got to break this TV watching cycle because I already don't get out enough because of my computer, school, work, and fitness and it makes time fly by so fast that I don't even realize what time it is and I finally get to my homework by 10 PM then I'm to tired and ill put it off to the next day and will give it to my teacher of late marks. Well, I have decided I'm going to try to break the cycle and add this to my list of monthly goals and resist the temptation of sitting on the couch after getting back from school.     I have recently started putting out my resume to get a head start on the whole summer employment thing and am really hoping that I get a job at this grocery store in my community(Especially since ill get a discount on FOOD!!). The reason I need a job is because with my habits of buying expensive protein powders, gym fees, saving so I can finally leave home and gain independence, entertainment(amusement park, movies, ect..), clothes, upgraded/new computer equipment and not getting much money from web design I really need a part time job that pays hourly wages like most people receive.  Well its 6 PM so I'm off to the gym and I promise, no matter what, I wont watch a minute of that dreaded brain melting TV and actually catch up on my homework especially since all my classes are academic this semester.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
