Support John Kerry  --  Its 10:36 , for multiple reasons I have hit a bit of a low point. So much going on, so little time, and what I had in mind to do is not what is going to happen. UGGG.     What am I looking for right now?     Maybe a girl friend from somewhere else then Barlow. God how I latelty despise people from Barlow. Barlow is becoming a hell hole. I looke at Barlow , i think of a reunion in 10 years or what ever, I say fuck 90% of em.  I just look in the yearbook and think, I need to get to college, new faces and a new start.     Getting back on topic, mainly I want relaxation, fun, to stay somewhat busy unless im away somehwhere. I am busy but I have had these awful on going migraines. i will be on meds Monday for it thank god.      A few things need to happen :  1 : Liscense , not till im 18 , Jan 16th 2004.  ( due to legalitys)  2 : I need to cycle more   3: I need to enjoy life a lot more  4 : Make more $   5 : Get some guidance from above , lord knows I need it lately.                              Support our troops! --  Migraine was nothing serious, as so the the doc says.   --  I was discussing my take on women with someone and apparently what I want in a gal is to much to ask. :   'LanceA28: no but u see my point **** : No I don't.  Because you shop for girls like your at Circuit City buying TVs.  You want the most expensive one, the thin one, the one that looks nice, that people will be impressed with when they visit you. LanceA28: well i want more then a plasma tv. i want to know it intimatly ****:Yea, you want to sit in front of it every night, staring at it's beauty, you want to take it in for all it's worth.  The amazing technology.It doesn't matter what it says to you, what's on the screen, it's just that it's yourself, in your own home.  It's a status symbol and something to marvel at and you like it.The point is that you need to look beyond looks, so to speak.  People are not objects.  You should shop with a blindfold on.  What does looks matter if one's personality is horrible.  Sure, you don't want someone who's wider than your uncle's hummer, but your standards are unreasonable.'  Now what **** says is not exaclty accurate. I love women for who they are and for what they have to offer into a relationship. A relationship is a mutual thing. The dictionary stating a relationship to be, 'The condition or fact of being related; connection or association.' I agree , 100% .   Women are amazing and should alway be treated with 100% respect and with dignity. Any less is unacceptable in todays society.           \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
