At least there is stuff at work to keep busy with and keep my mind off my fight with Ethan last night.  I talked to Donovan...he assured me that Ethan loves me and that he'll forgive me for being a retard last night.  He tried to convince me to call last night but knowing how stubborn Ethan can be...I knew he wouldn't answer the phone.  That's our problem when we get into these stupid little fights...we're both stubborn and they turn into huge, disastrous fights.  I just called and ordered him a plant.  He went to work this morning... and I wanted to do something to extend an 'olive branch' before we actually talked on the phone tonight...if we talk.  I sent him the plant...he has to call me...because as much as I overreact with the whole jealousy thing sometimes...he knows I'm like this...I wish he could accept it.  He always gets offended though and then gets all defensive which just further fuels my paranoia. Neither of us do anything to rectify the situation...just wait and let it blow over.  What happens the time that I piss him off so much and he thinks 'well if she thinks I'm doing it, I might as well just go out and do it...'  I think I have a generalized anxiety disorder.  Ironically enough, the only house plant that  Hearts and Flowers  had in stock was a Peace Lily.  I had them sign the card 'sorry about last night; hope to see you on Wednesday night..'  Before the fireworks started last night, the plan was he would come down on Wednesday...  Anyways, I don't want to think about it...if I think about it then I have to come to a decision...do something to fix it...I usually never fix it...at about this point (a little over a year) I always seem to turn into a three-headed monster, drive the guy away and then can say 'he broke up with me...his mistake' I guess I have to decide whether or not Ethan is worth finally doing something about myself for...I think he is...if he is, where do I start?                 Morning all!  One more day and it's the weekend...yippee!!!!!  It's been a pretty laid back week to say the least.  Tuesday after work, I went up to Ch'town for a bit...hung out with Donovan, then the two of us went over to Dave's for supper. Dave BBQ'd shark and it was delicious!!!! I went to see 'my man' for a bit afterwards and then headed to Ruth's for Big Brother and Amazing Race.  Yesterday, Pam (my co-worker) and I went on a 'field trip'  We went and hiked a trail near Stanhope because we're working with a community that is thinking of doing something similar.  We also stopped at the Island Preserve Co. on the way back; the owner put in a botanical garden so we took a walk through there.  We were back by about two but instead of going back to work, we each went home and pretended like our trip took all day!  I was poolside by 2:30 and it was HOT!!!!  It started out as a cool and dreary day but ended up being a scorcher.  Last night, I lazed around, went to Wallyworld with Ruth and that was about it.  Today should be a busy one at work.  I have a lot of paperwork to get caught up on.  I'm facilitating a Business Camp in two weeks so I have to start getting things in order for that.  Should be fun though!           \n'''\n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
