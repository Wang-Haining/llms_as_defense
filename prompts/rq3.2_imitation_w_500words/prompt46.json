Pool kit                      4730.00 backhoe/skid steer            1050.00 sand and sand gravel          1200.00 pipe/wire/concrete             250.00 laboreres once                 190.00  total to now.                 7420.00   I still need 300 in sand and 150 in bobcat rental=  450.00 concrete                                            100.00 gravel/pea                                           60.00   also going to upgrade to a salt water chlorinator for 704.00  this does not include the 200 for concrete mixer.  The only tool I didnt have. Also, I borrowed a wheel barrow froma friend along with 2 of his shovels, his wheel barrow is cheap plus he has helped so I am going to buy him a new wheel barrow.  also borrowed several digging tools from my sister in law, one , the pick ax is dang old, so going to buy her a new one since they loaned me all there shovels etc.  One good thing, is my bourbon drinking has gone way way down, you dont drink and work on pool, that is all you should drink is water so i have saved a few bucks there.  my goal was under 8,000   without the salt water chlorinator i would meet that, but i do want it as it will save me money in the long run.  a pooll this size built by a co. would cost about 25,000 to 30,000.   so we have alot of sweat payment to ourselves!               urlLink    Panels from stairs view.  &nbsp; urlLink     The Picture above shows what I have finished as of Thursday the 24th.  I have 4 panels left to do. This saturday, I should put in the cement 'coller' and get insdie the pool ready for the mason cement bottom.  Let me explain about this pool.  It is a vinyl liner pool.  The top 42' are a polymer plastic, with a polymer brace at each junction of the panels.  There are 20 panels plus the walk out stairs. On the outside of the panels, you put in cement, 8' thick and approx. 2' wide.  this is called a collar, it adds support to the walls.  once that is in the pool walls are not moving!  Each brace has a 2' long 4' sq brace that is drove into the ground before the cement is pored.  Then you plumb in the main drain in the deep end.  After that is done, the bottome is made from mason cement and sand wet mixed and leveled 2' thick.  this provides the smooth, none moving bottom.  The deep end, is made by coming off the back wall 4' and is dug down to 6'2' and is a 4'x6' rectangle in center, with slopes up to the bottom of the 42' walls. Its kinda like and upside down pyramid with top of the pyramid cut flat.  After the bottom is put in, plumbing is run for the pool.   As soon as plumbing is done, you put in the liner, and fill it up.  While the pool is filling up with water, you backfill on the backside of the walls with sand.  The backside is were the color is and the black braces are.  the bottom has the coller, on top of that you fill with sand to the top as the water rises, to create equal presure on both sides of the walls.  I have allready bought 12 yards of sand and will buy another 6 yards next week, that should be enough.  once the pool is full of water, check pumps and filters make sure they all work, and you could swim.  Of course without any decking, be litte hard to ge in and out!  so I am poring deck all around it also.  That is the last step!  My goal today is to be filling it with water on the 5th of July.      \n'''\n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
