Been a long while since I added any new entries (not that anyone would care of course) But hot damn! Lazy bones strikes again. Sometimes I wonder why I bothered to have a blog in the first place.  Well, it's the school holidays now. Finished the exams. I hope to pass all four papers but we all hope for good things don't we. Anyway, the accounts paper was a bust. Same feeling as the stats paper last semester. Probably gonna flunk accounts. But there's always a chance I'll pass eh. heck same thing happened to stats last sm and I passed that one.  So tomorrow, or I should say today, I'm gonna go down to the registry of companies and I'm gonna register a business partnership with kumar. It's been a long time coming I can tell you that much. Gonna call the new company 'Epac Trading Company' in honour of the earlier supposed but on hold partnership with the other two future partners for Entrepac. Well, see what happens tomorow then.  Oh and I'm working on tradenet now. Damn I  loathe  programming. But I gave my word that I'll do it and I don't like to break it. Though sometimes there  are  extenuating circumstances. heck, there's always an excuse to not do something eh.                     Well kings has gone and gotten himself a girlfriend. Well smack me silly and turn me inside out. Wouldn't have thought that would happen anytime soon. Goes to show how life can sometimes blindside you when you least expect it.  So there it is. My kemosabe in bachelorhood arms has deserted me. Can't say I blame him though. Except the reason for him to get together with this girl are rather suspect. I'll never be sure whether he got together with her just to prove to himself that he could get a girlfriend or that he is really sincerely into this girl. Only way to find out is to just ask him directly but that would just make our friendship take a weird turn. Oh well.   Don't know how long he'll be with her. Seems to me that this girl is the controlling type. Scolded him for playing pool with me the other weekend. Maybe it's because they're in the 'honeymoon' period of their relationship and she doesn't foeel secure enough with him to let him out of her sight (claws).   Or maybe I'm just over analysing things. Nah.   Bleah.                     Well, i was just in one of my rhetoric moods just now. I was thinking of how sad it was that good friends can grow apart as you grow up.  You gain new perspectives as you grow and those might now be the same as your friends. Like you're in different realities. Sometimes you grow apart because of differeing views and sometimes it's because of circumstances. Some of which are not under your control but most of which that are.  Things like gaining a new idealogical beliefs, new social groups or just something as simple as getting a new job. Any of which can cause you to not make contact as often as you would like. I used to believe that it was their fault for not keeping in touch. But then i realized that I was as much at fault as anyone else in my life.  People walk in and walk out of your life. You can try to keep them from walking out but ultimately, it's their choice. Guess that's why you have to choose your friends carefully. But then again, if you are too guarded in your choices, you might be artificially restricting yourself. Ah the choices we all make.  I've had many good people in my life. It's sad to reminisce on the good times past as you know the chances of regaining those timeas are slim to none. So there's no use dwelling on them. But you don't want to discount their value in helping to shape you into the person that you are today. And yet, you don't want to let them hold you back from become the person that you're going to be tomorrow. Sigh.  This doesn't happen much when you're a teenager but it starts when you reach adulthood. You wish to be as carefree as you were then. Letting your parents worry for you. Reality was just for other people. You lived in a cocoon, in your own world.  Ah the good old days.         \n'''\n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
