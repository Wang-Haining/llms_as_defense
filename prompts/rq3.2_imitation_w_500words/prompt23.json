Sure, outsiders can and do appreciate our finished product, whether that be a painting or a novel.  But when we are in the middle of creating, they just don't get it sometimes.   We often here complaints like, 'When do you think you'll be done,' as if what we do has time limits like a 9 to 5 gig.  Or, 'Why can't you do that later.'  All you artists out there, ever try to remember what ideas were on your mind hours before?  Never happen, and you may have just missed an incredibly important creative moment.  Who knows.  Or, '[Sigh], again?'  That's the guilt trip.    These complaints are not always in the form of words either.  Sometimes it's just a look that says it all.  But the lack of empathy outsiders have towards our art is not intentional.  It's just impossible for them to understand how relentless, yet fleeting creative juices can be.  They don't know what it's like to be woken up in the middle of the night by an idea that has to be put down on paper.  They take it personally when you are totally distracted during 'quality time' because you're just not satisfied with that last piece you rushed to finish in order to be with your significant other.    That's the paradox we have to live with.  You're damned if you take more creative time and interfere with the 'quality time.'  And you're creation is damned if you cheat the creative time for the benefit of the 'quality time.'  Artistry is a beautiful burden, and we are slaves to its sadism.  It's a love that burns icy hot because it provides a soothing escape from 'reality,' yet can only be shared once complete.    Of course, then we have the joyous pain of letting our love go ... until we fall in love with our next text.   urlLink SerialThriller.com       Write every day, or wrong?   It's suggested time and time again that authors write every day in order to keep creativity flowing.  But, sometimes, it can be just like exercising--you know you should, but you just don't always feel like it.  (In fact, it's a lot like exercising your mind.)  Anyway, I'm pretty good about following that advice.  As I mentioned in  Be a composition criminal  (Thu Apr 29), I usually write during my lunch hour--after my walk--and after I get the kids to bed.  Last night, I didn't feel like following through with the second half of my routine.  The plan was to lounge in the chaise and watch a program about the Hindenburg on the Science Channel.  But on my way to get something to drink during a commercial, I also grabbed my manuscript off the kitchen table.  The next commercials I muted and started writing.  That eventually turned into the muting of the entire program as I got into the zone and came up with a nice rewrite of a transition piece that had been bothering me.  Once I completed my notes, I unmuted the program and caught the end.  I may have missed most of the program, but I didn't miss a productive opportunity.  I'm sure this was not the first time the program has aired and it probably won't be the last.  What if I had left the manuscript in my backpack?   urlLink SerialThriller.com  \n'''\n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
