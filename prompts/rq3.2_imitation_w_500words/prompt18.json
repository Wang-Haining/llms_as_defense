I am in a much better mood now, cause I sat down and thought a bit more.  I think what is making the us stuff even harder is the weird way it happened. We had only been 'dating' for a month when you left. Hell only really talking for about another month before that. So two months then your gone a month. Now keep reading cause I know bad stuff is going through your head, hear me out. We didn't have very long to get to know one another, and so i think there are lots of bumps when we can talk for every now and then. I don't expect to hear from you everyday, every other day, hell even once a week i doubted when u left. When you left I just wanted you to go and have a great time, and I would be there to support you every step of the way. What its come down to now is stress and the distance and all that stuff, its just getting rough. I just kinda am starting to break down out of my supportive role and then feel horrible cause im not helping, thats all. Anyhow, back to the only two months thing. It could have been so easy to just wait until after you came back, like you thought about. Or to not want to stay as we are while you were gone, or so many other ways of giving up. Hell even at this point, you could be going off with guys and having a wild time, or we could be at each others throats in anger and such. All I know is that when you left, I thought to myself this is going to make or break us. Nothing has been broken so far :-* Its been hard as hell, I know, and it still isn't over and the last few days are just going to make it that much harder. But think about it, its been 24 days now that you have been gone. That is 3 and a half weeks after only talking to each other for 8 weeks. I thought it was definitely a good thing, and just goes to show that things great are to come. I love you, and I feel you return it, even though you are not here. Things have and will be rough the next few days, but you and I will come out on top, together, and stronger. I love you and am never letting go.  Also, please don't worry about calling me. If you are having a crappy day, I would be more than happy to help. But if you call just for my sake, don't. I don't wanna make that bill bigger than I already have. The only time I really want to talk to you before you leave is right then, right before you do leave, thats all. I also have to admit it just gets damned hard to say goodbye on the phone, so yeah thats the other part of that. Anyhow, I am rambling.   I love you, I hope the mail helped, even if you did have a crappy day and said it didn't and that you weren't feeling better. Like ive said, you're a horrible liar ;). That is all for now. I know youve prolly had an emotional rollercoaster with this and the previous post, sorrie, just had to spill a bit. Feel free to return the favour if you can, if not, no worries.  OMG, funny porn story just happened too. This will sound very, very ironic, but I found a band named budapest while you were gone. I wasn't hunting the name out, I was just clicking through random things online and listening. When I heard them I wanted more and so I have been downloading more songs by them. Well I was doing that when you called and so got up and left. I came back and on the screen there were all the search results, with hundreds of 'hot hungarian budapest love slaves' and what not, lmao. Well my mum saw it and was all like wtf, and i had to explain, in between my laughter. Hope you at least got a giggle out of it, my hungarian love slave ;) can't wait for *that* porn ;) lol  So there, end on a happy note. I love you dearly michelle, more than anything else. *mwah*         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
