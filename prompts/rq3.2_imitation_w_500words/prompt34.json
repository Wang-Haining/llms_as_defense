Mapquest said 4.75hrs, but in reality, I believe it was more towards 5.5.  I dunno, I SUCK at directions...  So I bought a car off ebay.  A beautiful black 1992 Saab 900 Turbo.  Leather, power everything, sunroof, the works.  So it's not really the preferred method of purchasing a vehicle, but it works.  The worst thing is that you can't look at shit that _you_ want to look at, not what the owner wants you to look at (good or bad).  But I said fuck it, for $2200 I can't lose.  They said the car didn't need anything.  KBB said list was like $2500 or something.  Anyway, Willis, Me & another buddy (sorry, man, can't remember your name!) drove all the way up to Fairfax VA (which, by the way, 277mi is a LOT farther in real life than is is on paper) to go pick up the car.  I paid for it already the night before w/Paypal, so I was good.  ----The trip there--- Well on the fucking trip up, my phone rings, and in my fumbling to see and answer the phone, I drop the directions and the shit FLYS OUT THE FUCKING WINDOW.  Great.  So now I have no directions to where the hell I'm going.  Note, I'm like half way there.  Well low and behold, it was the seller seeing how we were doing (I told her I'd be there at like 5, and it was 5).  She gave us new directions, and we finally got there,  all fine and dandy.  We also stopped for a break around this time to get something to drink, etc, and while we were browsing around the gas station, we said 'hey, NC sux and doesn't have a lottery. let's play'.  So I threw down $6.  ---The trip back--- On the way back, not more than 50mi away from our original destination, we stop to get gas.  We decided to cash in our lottery tickets, which yielded us a $10 profit!  So that paid for the 3 of us to eat at Wendy's.  (kickass :)  Ok, so Willis wants to drive the saab, but he can't get it in gear.  Hell, I had a hard time driving it.  The clutch pedal isn't doing it's job!  She always wants to go in gear.  Well, I found out when I got home, that you have to pump the pedal a few times to work; this means my clutch master cylinder is toast/leaking.  A cheap repair, just a little inconvenience.  So anyway, I was able to get her going at the gas station (chirping the tires sometimes, but better than stalling :), and I drove her all 277 miles back, no problems.  She runs great, and she's faster than the 760T :)    I'll try to post a link soon w/pics of my new baby.  Anyone want to buy an  urlLink '89 Volvo 760 Turbo Intercooler  for $2500?  She's only got 216k mi....         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
