There aren't any teeth to put them on! The laughing gas really got to me. It was just like that episode of the Simpsons where Lisa got braces and got laughing gas. I started seeing double all the time...Then whenever they put a needle of novacane in my mouth the people who were working on me would say, 'You will feel a sight pinch.' Then the scene would freeze in front of me and some silver spirals would appear below their faces. The whole tiem in my mind I kept hearing a voice (prob my inner self) singing, 'I'm on the Simpsons! I'm on the Simpsons! I'm on the Simpsons!...' and so on. It was a weird experience a lot of the time it kept playing the one scene where Lisa dreams about The Beatles, from the laughing gas, in my mind. All that I could remember from the actual procedure was getting the weird needle dream and the pulling of the last two teeth. When I got home, I felt like a chipmunk...I hate being numb...I lost feeling in most of my face...including my ear. Now that's over...I gotta lotta Tofutti (tofu ice cream) and sweet potato mush...AlexD suggested I drank liquid prime ribs **shudder**. Great, now I have to go through the pain all over again for braces on Thursday...                 It didn't work on my dark hair, I need to highlight my hair first...I'll do that tomorrow (hopefully before the Styx concert). In my desperate attempt to get my hair blue, today in my art class I took my beige ( for the people who don't know what it is, it's light blue) sharpie and colored a strand of my hair blue without highlighting it first. Surprizingly, it worked out really well and stands out, but it partly dried out my hair. I dunno yet if sharpie washes out of hair. If not, I'll dye over it cause it a lighter blue than the dark blue dye from Hot Topic. Well, I shall try again tomorrow night. My advisor on my hair dying is Brian, the councelor from art camp. He's actually a Gunker almost and, like Sporko, has dyed his hair many times and also wears the same Gunker pants that Sporko has from Hot Topic (except they're blue and black with skulls instead of red and black with stars). I also drew him in those pants when he posed as a rock star on Wednesday with his electric guitar. Tomorrow is the last day of portrait camp but I'll be back to camp the 14th or 17th or something like that for the landscape class (Brian will be there again). Well, wish me grood luck on my hair and the concert.          \n'''\n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
