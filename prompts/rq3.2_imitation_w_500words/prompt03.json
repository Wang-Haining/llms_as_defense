I am sure most of you have heard of this before... but now there's is the graphics to go with it... so it is so so so cool... by the way, click on the play button as soon as the bottom of your browser said play... or else you will have to wait until eternity before the loading sign disappear... hahaha... Anyway...  I feel good right now for some reason... even though I should starts studying for my APSC 132 Quiz... but somehow I am not worry as usual... I really don;t understand how can I pass all of my courses without really doing any hardcore studying... hahaha... I donno... right now, I am just going to study really slowly... go out to dinner... and then go watch a movie or something :)  It should be fun fun fun... anyway other then that... nothing much is cool lately... the weather is nice though... it is warm, but I guess warm during winter is not really that good... all the snow melts = slushy snow on the ground... haha... Anyway... I really donno what am I going to say... I guess I can tell you the Mini-Baja is coming a long slowly... hahaha... Anyway... talk to you all later... cooli  Peter                               Ah... what a nice day here in China... yes, I am in my china office right now :) I will take some pictures of my office and show you guys in the next few days :) Pretty nice place, especailly in China... you probably won't find a factory in china that is cleaner and more beautiful then mine.... haha, I am not being cocky, but it is true. I have been to so so so many factories here, most of them got horrible working conditions... I really feel bad for the workers in those company. Some people who works for those company make less then USD100/month... I guess that's what we hear about all the time on the news in North America. But not everybody one makes that little money. Some people do make a good salary in Chinese standard, for example, some of the designer in my company could be making around USD2500/month. Of course that's not comparable to North America, but that's a lot of money in China, especially when you can get a meal for less then 25 cents US.  Anyway, it is about time to get back to work. I will post some pictures of my office in the next few days. In the mean time, have a nice day everyone :) Take care. Ciao.
