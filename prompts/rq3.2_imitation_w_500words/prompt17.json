A brief snip:  '...still smarting from the defeat in the Senate of a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriages, the president has returned to playing the God-and-patriotism card heavily — always implying that the GOP is the party for 'real' Americans. During his Midwest swing, he promised to protect those homeland values from the latest big threats: gays who marry and Hollywood entertainers who support Democrats. Bush did not quite equate gay marriages with Al Qaeda, as Pennsylvania Republican Sen. Rick Santorum did: 'Isn't that the ultimate homeland security — standing up and defending marriage?' Bush just held that gay marriages would destroy 'the most fundamental institution of civilization.'   **** Yup, W is using the us vs them electoral strategy. I really hope it bites him HARD. Perhaps like father like son...  urlLink Homophobia and Apple Pie                      Normally, reading Nick Kirstof in the NYTimes makes me wince--in anger. This time, he's nailed an issue.  He takes on the 'Left Behind' series by Tim LaHay. Here's a snip: *********** If a Muslim were to write an Islamic version of 'Glorious Appearing' and publish it in Saudi Arabia, jubilantly describing a massacre of millions of non-Muslims by God, we would have a fit. We have quite properly linked the fundamentalist religious tracts of Islam with the intolerance they nurture, and it's time to remove the motes from our own eyes.  In 'Glorious Appearing,' Jesus merely speaks and the bodies of the enemy are ripped open. Christians have to drive carefully to avoid 'hitting splayed and filleted bodies of men and women and horses.'   ... No, I don't think the readers of 'Glorious Appearing' will ram planes into buildings. But we did imprison thousands of Muslims here and abroad after 9/11, and ordinary Americans joined in the torture of prisoners at Abu Ghraib in part because of a lack of empathy for the prisoners. It's harder to feel empathy for such people if we regard them as infidels and expect Jesus to dissolve their tongues and eyes any day now.     urlLink The New York Times > Opinion > Op-Ed Columnist: Jesus and Jihad                      Looks like my experience with the PA gent a few weeks ago is playing out across the country. Why are life-long GOP-ers supporting Kerry??  It's the lying....the never ending lying of the Bushies. Here's a snip from the Yahoo piece: ****** In Tennessee, Brian Boland, a young music company manager shopping at a market near Nashville, said: 'I've always voted Republican and my folks will just kill me if they find out I'm switching to Kerry this year ... but I am just frustrated with the way Bush has mishandled everything. All the untruths.'   His wife said she too was switching. The Republicans carried Tennessee in 2000, even though it was the home state of Democratic nominee Al Gore.  At the same market Ron King, a black Vietnam Veteran, said: 'I always voted Republican before but I'm against Bush ever since I found out that he doesn't love this country. His so-called military record is a sham. And the worst part is that he lies so much. He lied about weapons of mass destruction.'   Lloyd Huff, 64, retired director of the Dayton Research Institute in Ohio, says he has 'voted for a Republican in every presidential election I can remember' but it will be Kerry this time because 'the Bush administration has been the most deceitful, duplicitous, secretive administration this country has ever had.'   'Going to war in Iraq was a horrible, horrible mistake,' he said. He accused Bush of 'an arrogant, swaggering cowboy mentality ... he has done more than anyone to inflame the Muslim world by his words and actions.' ******** And the chickens are coming home...      urlLink Yahoo!
