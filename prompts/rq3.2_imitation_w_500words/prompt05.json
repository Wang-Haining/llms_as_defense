I know it takes more than just&nbsp;a title to help me reach that level of sophistication.                   For many years there has been a debate in football over   urlLink  grass    vs.   urlLink  turf   . Which is better to play on. They both have good and bad reasons why to use them. For instance, Turf you can run faster and you never have to mow it. It's consistant cause its all man made. But more injuries can occure on turf. So then grass you don't get as many injuries, its safer for the players. but you can't run as fast on it and it takes a lot of maintanence to keep it nice and consistant. And now they have this new hybrid of turf that is like grass but is a turf type material. Weird. So anyway different players prefer different things.  Well This week we found out what   urlLink  Ricky Williams    preference was. He prefers the grass. He prefers the grass over turf so much he quit playing profesional football at the peak of his career. He is giving up 8 million dollars because he prefers the grass. But the grass he prefers is   urlLink  Marijuana   . Yes that is correct. Ricky Williams has given up football because he likes Marijuana too much. After failing his third drug test by the NFL he decided to retire because he is tired of living by the strict rules of the NFL. In an article on   urlLink  ESPN.com    he talkes about how he's always got away with it because of a supplement drink he would take that could cover it up. So he's pretty much admitting he uses Marijuana on a regualar basis. Hmm. Wait one second. Isn't Marijuana illegal. Shouldn't the police be paying attention to this. Why isn't he being dealt with? Seriously. I feel like i'm taking crazy pills. He has already admitted to it. Where is the law. Why aren't we dealing with this problem.   urlLink  Dwight Gooden    and   urlLink  Darryl Strawberry     both went to jail when they were caught. Why isn't Ricky going to jail or something. Is it because his hair made him look Jamacian so its ok. Maybe thats why he shaved his head so that the police wouldn't recognize him and now they can't arrest him. Seriously. am i crazy? What's your thoughts? do you even care?          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
