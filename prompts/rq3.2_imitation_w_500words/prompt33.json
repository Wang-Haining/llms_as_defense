Be sure to check out the pictures at that site.  I’m sure no one knows, but I have been working on a VERY BIG project for OPMG. It’s a product I would like to launch this summer. I’m sure it will be a big hit in the CMS world. I won’t bore you with the details… or give away my brilliant ideas. =)  For those of you who have been keeping track, the CSA drama is over. I am still working with them; however the drama is down to a dull roar. I love those guys; it’s the Stone I get frustrated with. They help me rise above it though.  On another front: It sounds like I may have company on the drive up north this summer. My uncle Dan may be riding with me. I am truly looking forward to that! He is a great guy, and I think we will have a blast! I’ll be sure to post some pics of our trip.  Well, no big PO!NTS today. I have some rolling around in my head, and should be flushing them out… however; I have some work to do.                                 I have been catching up with an old friend via AIM this week. It has been great to connect with yet another guy that is headed in the right direction. He has killer Flash skills, and a big heart to boot. He gave me some  MUCH NEEDED  Flash help for the ' urlLink Ben site '. (thanks nD!)  AIM is a wonderful thing.  On another note:  Small Town Poets  have a new album coming out.  urlLink www.smalltownpoets.com   At one time STP was my fav band. They have been out of the biz for a few years starting families. I'm stoked about their return. They have been one of the most influential bands in my life over the years. They have so many songs that bring back memories. Kurt and I saw them in G.R. a few years ago. That was a concert highlight for the both of us. I like them for being real with their music. They don't write 'sing-songy' lyrics, or over Christianize everything. They are poets, and I like that. The combo of poetry and music is a powerful one.  Check em out at a  urlLink FCS  empire near you.                                 'Help, I lost my balls!' At least that is the way I’m interpreting the cats cry for help at 6 a.m. Those of you, who know Sadie, know that she LOVES those little sparkly balls that you get at  urlLink Michaels . They remind me of pompoms huffed up on Britney Spears. Needless to say, she loses them on a regular basis. As a result, you can   often   find Sadie staring under the couch or behind the fish tank letting out random cries for help.  This morning was like many others. I follow Sadie around the apartment with a smirk on my face as she leads me to where she lost her balls; under the couch, entertainment stand, behind the fish tank and in the closet. As I followed her anxious prance from one treasure to the next I couldn’t help but wonder if that's what the Father feels like following me around.   I have a habit of dorking things up and then crying and begging for help. I can just imagine Him close beside me waiting for me to tell Him and show Him when and where I went off track; maybe even with a smirk on His face... as if to say 'I'm ready to help when you’re ready to be helped.' It doesn't seem to take long for my blubbering and pointing to get His attention. He reaches down, fixes my mess, and then lets me do it all over again.  I suppose that's how grace works. No matter how many times Sadie loses her balls, I'm there to pull the couch out of the way and help her get back to living. I have a feeling that that kind of grace is how He made us to reflect Him. You can't help but see it in His character over and over again.  That's my PO!NT 42day.               \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
