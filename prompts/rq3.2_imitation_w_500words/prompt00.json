To the sounds of Josh Groban whose voice makes me  melt . (Happy now, Catherine? haha) Oh well. At least Miles is happy with the poem. Ian has yet to talk to his mother. I think I might break out the rosary for this one. I think God's sick of me saying 'If you do this, I'll become a nun!' though.  Oops.  Maybe this one last time...    Today is Bastille Day!  I stormed Herb Parsons Lake with my bike in honor of this lovely French holiday. Last Bastille Day, Derek gave me a Celine Dion CD to celebrate it. I'm going to miss little things like that. Perhaps I shall go pull out Celine and dance. Ahh...  No wait! I can't dance! I'm too busy packing! Yes, as of today, I will be leaving in a week to go far away to  Pensacola, FL  with Randi and my surrogate family to find seashells, check out boys I'll never have, and hang out on the beach. Then, I will return home and the next morning I will catch a flight down to  Dallas, TX  to be with my  amazing  cousins, the only people I really love to be around on Dad's side.    I can storm as much as you  Bring the rains and lightning too  I could cause a hurricane  In an altered view of pain  Fire would be blazing bright  Winds whipping in the night Hail could just come falling down And still would not create a sound Thunder would creep along the way  To embrace the night or curse the day Tornadoes would have a job that's kind  To sweep bad memories from my mind A storm to clear my head from grief  To blow away what all I've seen  To somehow form a new clean slate Someday soon before it's too late  I'd control nature just for a time   Even if it's only inside of my mind    Do you ever have one of those times when you just write like crazy?  It's quite fun.                       It seems a lot of people have been incredibly lax on posting. However, I can fully understand seeing as we have all procrastinated. Yes, senior year is about to start.  God help us all.  But I do believe it will be fun. :) And stressful.  I took senior pictures yesterday and managed to have major panic attack beforehand. I thought I looked really, really bad. Once I got into the studio though, I must say Billy Ross is a god. And made me feel beautiful. Hurrah for nice people. And hurrah for the Torrid dress which made us all laugh cause it is so very  loud . 'I'm sorry... beauty makes me fog up.'  My question for this post is, why must money govern almost everything that we do? I feel like my life has turned into a Mastercard commercial, where they tell the price of things and then say something such as ' Spending time with an old friend... priceless .' Rawr.  But at the same time, amidst the financial woes which face us all, I am excited  beyond belief ... excited about initiation, cabaret,  Tempest ,  Cinderella ,  Dear Edwina , working the Voices of the South shows, prom, and figuring out where I am going to go for the next four years. It's amazing how everything has happened so quickly. This summer has been insane.  But good.   Must dash away to the land of the boonies. Mom put an ad in the paper about selling the goats and some lady is coming to possibly steal a few away this afternoon. I'll miss those little guys. Even the one that never stops calling. I didn't think I would miss them, but I already do. However, I have Cody and Casey to think of, and must go outside to keep them from ripping each other apart out of boredom. aeklrjgaleg  they are so CUTE!   Recommendation for the day: Look at the stars. If you wish, come out to my house and look at the stars.  They're beautiful.  Oh and get some TCBY. Yum.   'Et toi, tu auras les etoiles comme personne n'a...' - Le Petit Prince    Translation: And you, you will have the stars like no one else has. - The Little Prince      Je t'aime.
