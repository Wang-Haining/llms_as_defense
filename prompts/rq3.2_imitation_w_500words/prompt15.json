Let's pretend our hearts still beat.    Let's pretend we fall in love tonight,    Clumsy enough to fall for anything.    We'll stumble on our words.    We'll spill our guts on creaking bar stools,    Below the neon blue.    Low lives hiding in dives there's no feeling in drinking, sleeping with strangers.    Ghosts passing through bedrooms unaware,    A faint reflection on the barback's mirror,    A face I never knew whispering,'Please dont be a stranger to me.    Who are you if you're alone?'    You're no good at pretending.    All my plays have tragic endings,    You wish I was a fairy tale.    This frog will never change anything.    Just pretend that you're in love,    That scolding sun is bound to come up eventually.    So who is it that whispers in your ear?    A haunting voice blows in through the window.    There's no feeling floating over beds,    A needy pleading apparition    Crying, 'Who am I if I'm alone?    I hardly exist at all.    Let's pretend that we don't need anything anymore from anyone.    I don't want to feel anything anymore let's just pretend, we'll live happily ever after.'   &nbsp;  If I was to say anything at this time, with all honesty, it would be treacherous poison gushing from my block of wood representing my heart hoping to seep into a barbaric wound and create eternal oblivion.               Hoorah for exotic accents. God I love the spanish/mexican one. &nbsp; It's interesting when you kindof already know something and when someone tells you something that others would see as crazy or immoral, you just accept it. It took a bit for me to actually have the opportunity to think about (ie; spin it around in my head a few times, exercise the idea etc etc). What only really annoyed me then was something different. &nbsp; It's cold, so I might go lie down for a while till I warm up or something. An early night more than likely. &nbsp; Mmmm, Thursday mum is working all day, but I have an appointment so god knows what I'll be doing. I want to rearange but alot of places have like, set times for people (ie; if you go thursday morning at 9:15, then you go every week at the same time, same day, for the rest of your relationship with said institution). &nbsp; Been listening to more of my sister's music. She took my laptop by mistake back to Melbourne. But it's really funny because she's using some of my pictures for avatars on msn. But some of them are completely out of context and look innocent :P &nbsp; So I guess, I shall end my post here.     \n'''\n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
