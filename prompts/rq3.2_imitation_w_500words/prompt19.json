But anywayz, I walked downstairs into the kitchen because I was told that my friend Kristine had called. As soon as my mom saw me she asked for my help. She needed help to order her name badge and business cards for her new career as a realtor because she's absolutely clueless when it comes to the internet and anything else computer-related.  I tried  to be patience. I  honestly  did. But that's hard to do when I wake up late so I still a little achy, I haven't had anything to eat, and she keeps questioning me on wheather  I'm  doing the right thing. So I got snappy. End resullt: I'm responsible for her now snappy mood. ::sigh:: That's life.      I really  can  be patient and understanding but  not  after I wake up or if I have an empty stomach. And it's even worse if I'm related to the person I'm being crabby at because I won't feel much, if any, qualms about lashing out first before assessing the situation.       She told me that she doesn't snap at me when I ask for help. But oh is she wrong! She does it when she's very frustrated. She compare my behavior to my dad's, which I find insulting. She says that she didn't learn anything because I was too fast. Hmmm...well if she had  said  something oh I dunno...maybe I would have stopped. She also said she asked me at that moment for help because she didn't want to bother me later---when I'll probably be more content because my morning crankiness is gone?? If I had said later, she would have called me selfish and lazy, which is what she called me after this little episode anyway! Well, now she's out running errands. I've calmed down---I've had bowl of moose tracks ice cream, chocolate does do the mind good. Hopefully, she'll be calmer when she gets back. She won't drop what she said but what else can I expect? ::sigh::                           My family went out to this chinese buffet for dinner tonight. The exciting part is that I got to drive there (in a separate car from my siblings and with my dad to supervise, of course). It was going good and I even parked correctly this time! lol. Not something that's frequent with me.  However, after dinner...I swear my dad showed signs of PMS. What's his problem? Kept screeching about take turn now, no this turn!! Well, if I could concentrate maybe, just maybe, I could pay more attention to the light. Wouldn't that be much better? Not to mention, safer? I should just ignore him completely and only pick up when he's talking about turning. There. Well, it's seems childish--but that's how he's acting too.  Then, we came home after stopping for a few groceries from VONS (which btw he didn't help me upload or put them away--the selfish...). Oh, I bought a few magazines and some gum to add to the cart at the store in vengence. Do I need to know what the lastest trends for fall are? Maybe. Or what celebrity is dating who? Hell, no. But will it make my dad spend more money than he has to? Of course. (It's not as if I don't like teen magazines because I do read them but I can live without them.)  My brother Ryan, who's as irritable as hell, comments 'Oh, you have no taste in food....oh, why did you choose that?' My response: where you there--NO, did you bring the food in--NO, then stuff yourself. That and I didn't tell him where the ice cream was or that we even bought it, well, Mr. Think-He-Knows-All can find it on his own.  Why is my family so damn moody?? Later, at home I found my siblings fighting over a ball. A stupid rubber ball. Of course, that triggered my mom. And well...the rest is chaos. Now, I'm not going to say that they're dysfunctional because they aren't but they freak out at the littlest things  way  too much.  On the plus side, I think I'm ready for my behind the wheel test. My permit expires on Aug. 14th and my test is on Aug. 10th. Think that's cutting it too close? It is! I can't believe it. One chance to make or I start all over again. I'll do fine if I'm not nervous though. And as long as neither of my parents are in the car with me (and they won't, yes!).         \n'''\n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
