At work Mara came so we played Spit.. what a great time. Then I played Al in spit and lost..and then in checkers.. and i lost again. But whatever it was fun lol. After work I had an orthodontist apt. which was not cool. He said that i have a problem with the way I swallow? how dare he! Well anyway neither of my retainers fit and i'm not getting new ones which is gay.. my teeth are probally going to move and I'm gonna be pissed and if he thinks he's getting me to put braces on again he's joking himself.   After that I went for a run .. a long one. It was exactly 50 minutes. I dont know how far really but on my schedual I'm gonna write 5 cause I'm suposta do that one day this week. Then I did some things that I was suposta be doing all summer, like step-ups and the heel-raise series. So I'm probally gonna be sore tomorrow.   I beleive tonight I'm going to Hoop City for the Hannan Varsity games, both girls and boys. The only person that i think will be playing is Eileen and i'm not even sure but I'll finish when I get back.    Oasis- Breakfast At Tiffanys   'You say the world has come between us, our lives have come between us. Still I know you just dont care.'                      Today started off average. I had work and i got hit in the head with a tennis ball while playing 'wall ball'.. i was doing good too haha. Jared Hill was there for a little and that was cool cause i dont see him that often even tho he lives right by me. I cant wait till next year when ill get to see him hopefully everyday at school. He always was on of my favorite people in the world. Tonight I went to heath's house. That was really funny in the beginning but then matt got pissed off and left. We were bustin around with him and i took&nbsp;his keys and he just freaked out.. like he was really serious. I dont know if i've seen him that way in a while but he got bitchy and left. We all kinda expected him to come back but he never did =\\ I called him and he yelled at me .. a lot and i'm really not used to that from him. I feel really bad. I'll say i'm sorry again tomorrow at the park and hopefully he'll get over it. But it was a really good night besides that. The guys were all busting eachother about being gay and stuff. It was fun. Now i'm hearing that craig and heath are talking and that's really good. Me and heath were talking about that today and i told her it would be great if they could make up. Mandie still seems pissed but i hope they all .. live happily after and everything. Espically cause they're all going on&nbsp;vaca in 9 days and i wouldnt want that to be shitty for any of them. Craig might only be with them for two or something i'm not sure how it all works out but w.e.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Matt is on and i'm talking to him. He's bitching that he worked all day and he didn't need girls 'playing mind games with him' .. alriteee you work at the park with me which is nothing and at a tanning place where you sit and watch girls sign in! You over react and are a drama queen.. but yet i'm still saying i'm sorry. Go figure .. more tomorrow      CCR - 'I wanna know,  have you ever seen the rain , commin down on me.'            \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
