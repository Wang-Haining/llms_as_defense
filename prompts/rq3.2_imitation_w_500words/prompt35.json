For this knife did cut too deep so for the last time I'm trying not to breathe  Once there was a fire in the lighthouse of my heart: I gave you so much more than just my love and you broke so much more than just a promise  Our planet vanished so devastatingly amongst the mists of time There was no treasure to be found at Rainbow's End somewhere behind Andromeda  I've been waiting till the end of december but no more will I ride for the winter solstice's child will pass away silently on a midsummer's night  So may you come now, my Dead Romantic Angel serenade Kyrahnean Hymns to me Hold me in your arms cover me with elder flowers and take me down to my beloved sea  I'm so tired, so tremendously tired Please wait for me under the midnight sun where I will sing and dance again and my laughter will be heard echoing down the hillside again...  Oh, how I tried to believe how I loved, How I tried to hold on to my dream; How I wanted to live - but now I'm going home to a place where love is more than just a four-letter word and as I kiss the memory of your goodnight I'm beginning to see the light...   Antichrisis - The Farewell                        Beauty is truth, truth beauty, a thing of beauty is a joy for ever. John Keats     Pity that there is so little truth in my life right now....caught in confusion twisted around in circles by what is real and unreal - I can still Love that is a Truth, I can still Dare that is a Truth, And I still have the Courage (or Stupidity) depending on how you look at it to risk everything on my desires.     Soul receives from soul that knowledge, therefore not by book nor from tongue.  If knowledge of mysteries come after emptiness of mind, that is illumination of heart. Rumi     Reaching out with everything I have needing to touch, needing to know that everything I feel is returned - When the real world meets will everything still hold true?  The fire rages inside me igniting me but not consuming me - I need to quench this thirst and feed this hunger burning within - passion must meet passion two souls aflame with desire and fueled by love.     Love under the linden tree      Be my druidess Be my everything Be my druidess Be mine  Around the Pyre, a circle of thirteen Thoughout these woods, ecstatic screams I look deeply into your eyes I smell your hair, caress your thighs  Now we'll make love by fire light A blaze so high it lights the night Long fingernails dug in my skin Yourself so wet invites me in  Our lust increased feeds desire As we combust, yeah we on fire I feel you shake so deep inside O oh scream my name and hold me tight  I'll do anything to make you come  Type O Negative - Be my Druidess           \n'''\n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
