  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic:\n\n'''\n       &nbsp;  i want to write like the guys at the slam.  there is some need to practice,  just to get used to the keys and the mind to finger effectually on that which is the keyboard.  i have never understood the people who can type without watching where their fingers were.  then again, I never was much of a typist.  &nbsp;  im insanely jealous of the poets on slam night.  they are theatrical and intelligent and sensible and beautiful  in giving me the right of audience to their emotions  though they know me not,  i hear their pain, their memories, their embarrassing dates, and their first loves.  poetry is the rawest of all the freedoms of expression.  art can give you the disguise of metaphor or color.  novels and movies give the illusion of candor, hidden in wit..  the hoarse voice of&nbsp; reality  is the poet’s domain.  &nbsp;  but for that reason-I shouldn’t care.  i am no poet.  i report the realities.  reality lacks style.  there is no finesse to reality.  or it wouldn’t be reality-it would be fox news.                  if you are a regular reader then you would have already seen part one. although i doubt you are..... if you dont know part one, then part two is equally as boring dont read either one.  i email the 'hello' program site, as i told you and they again erase my existing account. after so many swings at this program i email the blog site and say this:  From: incognito Subject: Hello is useless Date: Wed,  7 Jul 2004 19:14:02 -0700 (PDT)  the upload program, Hello, is absolutely ridiculous. i have had a few different user names (4!) and each one starts off working, and then on  the next visit it asks me for email verification, and never sends the  email. or sometimes the name and password fields are greyed out. i contacted their support and they didnt offer any solution except for clearing the email and starting over, losing the saved pictures each time. on the forums on hello's site you can find that many users are having such difficulties. i havent been able to post pictures to my site for days,  so i havent been able to post for days. not much of a weblog in that case,  is it? PLEASE find a service that actually provided the service it offers.  (Pretty reasonable right?)  and they reply:  Hi there,(hi there???? not even personalized!)  Unfortunately, we do not provide support for Hello. Please visit http://blahblahblah.plp for further assistance with this  matter.  Sincerely,            etc etc  So to which i replied:    no  shit ? so then offer me another option. (please note that i had already mention i had contacted hello support..)  i go through this computer generated crap all day, everyday lately. i need a computer to make sure my bank isnt screwing me, seriously. my bank withdrew 60 bucks of 'courtesy fees' last week. no i didnt overdraft, i called, indignant like, it seems their mainframe had a slight 'glitch' creepy. i wonder how often this happened  before  the internet... then i went to my employer's bank to cash my paycheck, and not only am i fingerprinted, but they charged me five bucks to cash a check drawn on the same bank! am i the only person who hasnt quite gotten used to paying money to get your OWN money??? i could have gone to cash my check for 70 cents at a gas station for god's sake! And the ATMs are just as bad. the bank charges me a buck and the ATM (MAC to the northerners) charges me a buck fifty. so to take out 20 bucks may as well count as 25. with the seven cents a year i get for interest, it is better to bury money in a coffee can in the yard! if you have alot of money then bank savings, iras', CD's-it's all you. but if you are me? banks are just places you go to cash your checks...if that.  going on with the computer generated annoyance... i hate talking to the fake person when you call somewhere: 'hi im irene, your automated assistant!- Please say if you want billing, service, or new orders!' i say, oh forget it.           \n'''\n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
