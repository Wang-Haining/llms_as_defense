CAMO!! Katt shouted as she ran through the hotel hall, clutching a brown paper bag. Wha AHHHH!! Camo starts to say as Katt crashes into him as he starts walk out a door. I got you something! she says, holding up the paper bag. Really?!? What? Camo asks excitedly.  New Scene! Now the couple is in the living room, with Sa2b and Foxy. Camo is holding up a bottle of mens cologne. What the heck is this? Camo asks as he reads the label. Cologne for you. I had some extra money, so I bought something for you. Do you like it? Camo reads the label.   The cologne that makes you feel and smell like a manly man! Side effects include  Camo looks at Katt with a forced smile. Lets just say my self esteem and ego have just reached 1,089. Just try it! NO!  Please? I think you should try it, Camo. Sa2b says. Me too! Foxy adds in.  Camo looks back at Katt, who is pouting her lip with a sad convincing look in her eyes. Oh, alright. Man, I hate it when she does the cute kitty face! Katt squeals, then tackle hugs Camo saying, Thank you! Camo just rolls his eyes and goes outside.  Outside. Camo sitson the roof of the hotel and sighs. I want to make Katt happy, but does that mean I have to give up my dignity? A lot of strangers now shout out YES! Camo gets mad, jumps up and shouts back, IT WAS A RITORICAL QUESTION! He sighs again, then says, Why not? He sprays himself with the cologne and walks down the street. He starts to notice all these women are looking at him strange. When he sees a group of women stalking him down the street, he starts to run away. But they chase after him! Ahhhh! Leave me alone! I have a girl friend! Ahhhhh!  Back at the apartment. Sa2b has come home from the pharmacy where Katt got Camos present. Did you know there are side effects to this stuff? He inquires from Katt. No let me see! She looks over Sab2s shoulder and reads the side effects. Side effects may include: nausea, hallucinations, coughing, and hoards of women chasing you till you get the scent off.  What!!! Camo, wait, Ill save you from the hoards of women! Katt runs to the door and picks up a conveniently placed wooden stick that is leaning against the wall.  Im coming for you Camo?!? Katt stutters off as Camo rushes in the living room where he lies down on the couch, exhausted from running around the entire city. Katt looks to Camo then to the hoards of women coming down the street. Ahhhh! Katt screams as she proceeds to run towards the hoards of women with the stick. (Skip the next few scenes *insert rave or elevator music*) Camo, Im sorry. Will you forgive me? Katt asks Camo, starting to pout her lip. Alright! Just dont do it again! Camo shouts. Foxy comes behind Camo and pours a bucket of water over his head. What the Why! He starts to chase Foxy all over the apartment. I was only trying to help! She shouts back at him. So ends this story! ~toodles~ -Dilussional Child-                      \n'''\n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
