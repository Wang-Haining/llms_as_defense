But sometimes it's just those things that everyone does now and then.. and then sometimes.. it's not. There's the little things like.. when my contacts aren't in, I'm going around looking for my glasses, when they're on my head [where I put them when I'm taking my contacts out]. And there's the looking under the desk for my shoes and having like.. a blind spot where they're under there but I can't see them, so I walk around the entire house before I decide I'll check under the desk one more time and they'll be there, waiting. And just this morning, I was looking around for an article of clothing which I needed because the packers were about to come in and estimate how much packing they'd have to do in my room, and I was literally looking for about 5 minutes until I realized I was already wearing it. And by that time, I was uber frustrated.   And though I've mentioned it, I'll do it again. I always have a problem finding my shoes. I just have some sort of blind spot for them or something. They'll either be by the couch or under the desk or by my bed or by the counter, whatever, and it'll always take me a second or third time looking there before I actually find them. Everyone does it, I know, so hopefully I'm not the only one who does it about a million times a day.  Okay, and is it weird that I'm singing along to Abra Cadabra and liking it?  Make me laugh, make me cry ...   On a side note.. did you know that you have to sign up [and possibly pay] for dictionary.com so you can get a 'premium' account. What's a premium account on  dictionary .com? A place for people without dictionaries to go and check out the kick ass things you can do with regular dictionaries? Oh, fun! Let's go sign up!.. in the way that, no, no it's kind of aud..                     Today I confirmed one of my long time suspisions. I'm afraid of time. Or.. I just hate it. Though, it's crazy, time is passing right now, but I hate time. I either want it to pass or just go so slowly so I can savor the moments.  Earlier today, I met somebody who made me realize this. His name is Kelly. After meeting him, we were walking down the street, passed the Los Altos Apt/Hotel building, and I got shaky in the knees and had to sit on the sidewalk for a second, replaying it all. I suddenly went into this total asshole person, angry that the time was over, the time of talking, the time of meeting, and visiting with this person. Someone who, I never had a clue that I'd meet. I never expected to. Maybe his brother but not him. You know how that is?  So.. maybe I'm afraid of time or of memory, or I just hate them both. Some people get extreme merriment or pleasure out of memories and are fine with the passing time, but I'm not. Sometimes I'll look back on memories and giggle, going 'oh that was fun, that was quite awesome!' but mostly it'll be 'why didn't I do that? what the hell was wrong with me? why did it have to be over so soon?'. I guess it's just the kind of person I am.  I can't stand it, either. I hate being an asshole when it comes around.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
