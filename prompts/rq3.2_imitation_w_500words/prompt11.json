(AP) � A woman who collected more than $70,000 from the Red Cross after claiming her still-living husband died in the Sept. 11 attacks has been accused of fraud, authorities said.    The scam fell apart when Donna Miller's husband walked in while a detective was interviewing her at home, authorities said.  Miller, 49, of Sparta, was charged Thursday with three felony counts of false pretense and released on $10,000 bond. Besides a possible prison term, she could face restitution costs if convicted.  Kent County Sheriff's Detective Steve Moon said Miller told officials at the American Red Cross September 11 Recovery Program that her husband, Michael, died when the World Trade Center towers collapsed on Sept. 11, 2001.  Donna Miller made the claim during the frantic days following the terrorist attacks and collected eight checks over 10 months, starting in November 2001, Moon said.  Red Cross officials contacted the sheriff's department after she was unable to provide documentation of her husband's death.  Moon said he was questioning Miller at her home about her supposedly dead husband when the man walked in.     There is no indication Michael Miller participated in the scam and he will not be charged, the detective said. '     Really?

Tom and Becky Furlong of Letts, which is in Muscatine County, hosted a John Kerry picnic on their farm last summer. Kerry invited the couple to sit with his family last night in the convention hall. Furlong, like Kerry, is a Vietnam veteran, and endorsed Kerry early in the campaign. Furlong says he was impressed with Kerry becuase he's 'a serious person of substance.' Furlong was on stage, briefly, too, part of a group of farmers who stood as another farmer from Kentucky gave a testimonial on Kerry. Furlong was elected an alternate delegate to the convention, and was sitting in the balcony earlier this week, and didn�t find out �til yesterday that he�d be on stage. He says the seat upgrade was �thrilling' especially since he wasn't sure his wife would even be able to be in the hall for last night's speech.'

News - Sleazy Guests Prompt Call to Ban Hotel Porn    Mon Jul 26, 9:12 AM ET    OSLO (Reuters) - Angry hotel workers in Norway want to ban pay-TV pornography to stop naked porn-watching guests calling room service to lure female staff to their rooms.   A typical trick by guests, mostly businessmen, is to call the front desk for extras, such as fresh towels, to get female company, said the Norwegian Hotel and Restaurant Workers' Union, reporting a rising number of complaints.  'Most room service personnel work alone. It can be very unpleasant to get called to a room to be met by a naked man,' union leader Eli Ljunggren told Reuters. She said the complaints ranged from sleazy remarks to physical assaults.       'Pornography does not belong in hotel rooms. (Really?)     Pay-TV should be limited to entertainment,' she said. Most Norwegian hotels, like many hotels around the world, have easy access to pornography channels in hotel rooms for a fee.
