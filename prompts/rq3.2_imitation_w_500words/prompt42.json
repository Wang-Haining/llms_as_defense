This prick is the head of another bunch who thinks that by blowing up cars, buses, mosques, people whatever that they will win over the hearts and minds of those they are 'defending.'  It's always obvious when the US gets serious about gettin in somebody's ass.  How you ask?  The same thing we have always been good at.  We just throw a shitpot full of money at the problem.  Have no doubt friends this is a very effective policy.  The US is going to give you 25 mill and set you up like a king anywhere in the world your heart desires.  Mr. al-Zaraqawi let me give you a little clue about how this is going to work.  The problem with you son is that you have now brought yourself very unwanted attention from the mightiest country the world has ever known.  You've killed thousands in your quest to prove your point.  And what have you really accomplished?  You and that other idiot Osama, while you are both obviously serious players, we have mastered the game.  You have now seen what we are capable of.  Dont be surprised when one of your people sees the greener pastures of America and freedom and of course 25 million dollars.  You people have very badly overestimated your limited capabilities.  It was an old Brooklyn mafia chief who said,'When the elephants dance together, its the mice who get hurt.'  al-Zaraqawi, I hope you've got a good tracker with you son, because I think I hear the elephants comin!   Arrick                        God am I sick of this moron.  This guy has been lying to the United States and the whole world longer than I have been on the planet!  We have a word in our President's second term, in his last year which we refer to as 'lameduck'.  Unless something critical comes up, this is generally a time for the President to get ready to make his exit, and only the most routine of matters gets through Congress.  Under those criteria, this idiot has been a lameduck for the better part of 35 years.  Get a clue over there would you people?  Those of you who want a Palestinian state, and I think there should be one, are never going to get it with this horse's ass sitting at the table.  Nobody in the modern age takes this guy seriously and most people haven't for the longest of time.  The next move is up to the Palestinian people.  You can blow up all the buses you want.  You don't even get to come back to the negotiating table until you are serious.  The most expedient and rightful way you could make this clear to the world, is to kick this guy's ass out in the street and get someone else doing your talking for you.
