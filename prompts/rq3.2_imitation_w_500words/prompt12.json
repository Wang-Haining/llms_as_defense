  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic:\n\n       it's been a while since i've taken a moment just to browse other people's blogs.  i find it interesting to read what other people have to say... (ok, except for the younger ones and their ever so abundant angst).    anyway... i have had the same blogs listed to the side (over there-----> ) for some time now, and sooner or later i will add some more... but out of boredom, i browsed 'their' blogs listed...   the end result:  we're all bored.  we all ramble, rant, vent, blabber, babble and just plain type.  some we're quite interesting, it isn't an easy thing to do when you 'shout' out your opinion on your blog for the 'whole world' to read.  nope, not easy because it inevitably means an email full of comments that you might not want to read.    and then there's the ones that i find myself checking up on every time i am sitting here at my computer... as if i need to check on a family member or friend... really now, this is like stalking.  i don't usually leave comments so i am a stranger in all sense of the word. so checking to see if you've posted has now gone from mere interest to a need.  need to check to see if you've blogged.  wonder why you haven't.  is something wrong, are you gonna come back and blog again?  omg what will i do if you don't blog again?  you'll be missed.    man, that is just freaky, don't ya think?    yeah, i am bored.  thanks for paying attention.  feel free to stalk :)                 yes, you read right.  i love traffic.  traveling at 55mph just to come to a screaching halt because the numbnut in front of you dropped his ciggarette in his lap and decided to hit the brakes while searching for it...  only to then pull over and out of the way but it's too late by then cuz my seatbelt has now tightened securely to hold me in place for the impending accident and i can't breathe let alone shout out what i really feel he needs to hear.  and when all is said and done and i've calmed enough to drive, i get back on the road behind idiot #2.  the cell phone user.  i have no problem with cell phones and driving, talk away, go ahead, i don't care.  but dammit.  dammit.  get a frikkin' ear piece cuz swaying on the road while trying to keep that thing in between your ear and your shoulder is gonna get you rear-ended by me!  get off the damn phone and drive if your too frikkin cheap to buy a hands-free attachment for your over priced phone!    ok, i feel better now, don't you?   the internet really needs a sarcasm font, it would be so helpful.    i know, i know, a rant that no one can hear, but i bet you've all been there.   now i need a drink.  cheers          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
