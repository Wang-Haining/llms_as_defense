It brings back memories of piano and ballet lessons where I received the same criticism... if only you could learn to count! I CAN count and I could then, too! However, I remember how fun it was to just play without thinking/counting, dance without memorizing steps... it felt like flying!   When I see Shubert, I remember how I could lose myself and my stress in the music and think I should start playing again... but every time I sit down with Shubert, he laughs at me. His former owner, my landlady, left him several humid summers with no air conditioner, no dehumidifier and his sound-board got wet. Now, even after tuning, it is only a matter of weeks before the pegs loosen and... well you can imagine. It is less like flying and more like crawling through...  Anyway, instead of playing the piano, I go dancing at salsa clubs. Well, unfortunately, the Taiwanese way is to take lessons, memorize steps and count in my ear. I'd rather feel the music have 'sweet nothings' whispered in my ear (even if I dance badly), but whatever... at least I can leave the counting /memorizing to someone else.                                    Wednesday Nite, May 12 - Salsa Party at Patio -  9:00pm!    &nbsp;    A friend and I arranged to meet at  Patio   (in the Neo 19 building near  Warner  Village )&nbsp;at 8:00 for dinner followed by a night of dancing.&nbsp;Patio  is across&nbsp;the city from my office, so I&nbsp;left 30 minutes&nbsp;before  the meeting time...&nbsp;One&nbsp;taxi ride later, I&nbsp;arrived to&nbsp;find  out that I had caught my shirt on something and unravelled the bottom hem.  Having come straight from work, I was already looking considerably less than  salsa-sexy!&nbsp; I ran to the nearest shop ( Mango ) to find a quick replacement. As Taiwan  stocks only smaller sizes... and being as a few years in Taiwan (everything  tastes better with a little pork fat, you know?)&nbsp;has increased my dress  size, my options are limited.&nbsp;5 minutes later and with my wallet  considerably lighter, I run to Patio to see if G is there yet. She isn't. The  host leads me to my table. We descend into a sunken retro pit! She shows me to  my circular gray fuzzy chair with a view of the geometric white balastrades and  the light patterns being projected on the ceiling. She also informs me that the  live salsa band won't start until 10:00- an hour later than advertised! (On weeknights, every hour is precious)       &nbsp;    G arrives and we order. The food was only mediocre, the prices were what I have come to expect in Taipei, but the  service... Well I would really like to know what the service charge was for! Not  only did the waiter repeatedly give the wrong dish to the wrong person and  forget to bring us various necessary items, he dropped food in my friend's lap  when clearing the table. Hmmm...      &nbsp;    Anyway, 10:00 arrived (as did many of our 'salsa  friends') and we moved into the red lounge area to hear the 'live salsa band'.  Hmmm... (again). In the first set, the band did not play a single salsa song!  They started with&nbsp;a love balad, then&nbsp;a cumbia number, followed by cha  cha cha and a Ricky Martin cover! We were actually looking forward to the band  taking a break so we could have some salsa.... but it turns out the DJ didn't  have even 1 salsa CD! Salsa Party indeed! We moved the party to  Barrio   before the second set started! And for all you Barrio fans, Barrio has started  charging cover on Wednesday nights! ($300 NT)      &nbsp;    Next Wednesday, I think I'll stay home and dance in  front of the mirror to my iTunes collection.      &nbsp;     &nbsp;     &nbsp;           \n'''\n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
