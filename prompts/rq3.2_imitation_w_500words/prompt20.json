My dear officer cheated on me. Yup. I used the word cheated. He is married. Yup, don't believe it but my dear sis saw it...and that is the conclusion,no wonder he wanted to take things slow.Therefore, she saw him after I met my dream guy.   Anyway, luckily I choose my Shariff or should I say that the Kelana guy came in my life at the right time. 3 days before he came back from Taiwan, Ive already made up my mind to be with Shariff Sah...eheheh.Its true ... if it is meant to be, then it will be.   How many times I tried to forget him, again and again memories with him will always emerged beneath my desperate soul. I tried all means to forget and hate him...very difficult. Shariff here, is a Taurus,  traditional Taurus Traits Patient and reliable Warmhearted and loving Persistent and determined Placid and security loving  On the dark side....  Jealous and possessive Resentful and inflexible Self-indulgent and greedy                  Yesterday, the 4 of us went to Bukit Batok, me, my sis, ayu n hanip. We went to meet Keris, they were feeling kinda of down. Pity them. After that, we went and have a drink at Mas Ayu wif the other Kelana guys. Hmm...ayu cracking jokes about Talib, all the way from Bukit Batok to Mas Ayu. We were out control...giggling and laughing our hearts out throughout the journey. Irony.  I woke up late this morning. Marking my karangan...the neverending ordeal. After this, Im suppose to meet my P6EM3. I just realise how happy I am. although Im shoudering a lot of responsibilities.   The other day, my sis saw Khai, presuming with his wife. Hmm...life, what can I say. Yet, the bigger picture is, trust, guys and marriage. Marriage is a huge responsibility... a commitment. Nevertheless, when to think of it back, everything make sense. Maybe, it was a good thing in getting to know him, yup...he hurt me, but if we were to look at it at another perspective, he had hurt his partner even more, the trust. Me, being the third party. Retribution, I do not want to see it coming. I love my dear Hanip so much. Even to think of it, will make me sick. Then again, if it is meant to be...then be it. In life we have to be strong in tackling problem. It can be him and it can be me. He told me,  feelings can change, which is terribly true.     2.55 pm   Just finish cutting the tickets, the alignment has gone haywired. Ismail has been bugging me on the tickets. Hmm...Im searching for the C.C chop, I misplaced it , somehow. Im tired. My eyes are tired. Im tired. Ismail asked me whether they can use the mirror room. I try to see what I can do.    5.55 pm  Hmm...at de spur of moments, things can change. Now, Im feeling restless. Sad.   ' Which is one is better, 3 years or one n a half year...'  I think it is better if it is 3 years, then I won't be leaving in denial.  An everlasting commitment... ' the person can be me or you...' it can be Me or you...  &nbsp;     Kris Dayanti & Ajai  \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
