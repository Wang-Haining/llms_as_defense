Anyway, today was my English Literature exam - an exam where it is by no means an exam on your knowledge of English literature and it isn't really an exam on  English  literature; my set text was Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck; an American. The poems that I looked at were written by an American, a welsh person, an Irish person and a Scottish person. No one technically English was involved in my English exam. But what is it to be English? They all speak the same language, some of their descendents could have quite possibly been English and an 'English' persons ancestors could quite possibly be Anglo-Saxons or of some other European origin. Who is English?  As it is indeed Friday night [now Saturday morning], I went out for a meal earlier, except on finishing the mile walk to the Indian restaurant, one of our party realized they had forgot something which meant that I had to get from the restaurant, back to the house, and back again - a two mile round trip - all in time for the first course. I did it, partly as they were delayed by a few minutes and partly because I ran a good deal of it. Getting back to the restaurant I arrived in good time to receive my curry. I would like to inform anyone considering doing a two mile run and then going for a meal, to go for something a bit more cooler, like a sandwich, curries just don't seem to be quite the right thing.  On the topic of sandwiches I recommend a Safeway Chicken and Bacon 'sub' [you know, one of those baguette like things which isn't], at Â£2.69 its hardly value for money but for a cold and wet May day it worked for me. Speaking of baguettes, Sally's Place provides an excellent guide to them. Let them eat cake.

And the hair. Well, quite genuinely it is big but certainly not clever; perhaps if I let it grow longer it might be but it's doubtful and it is a mega mess at the moment so best just get it cut.  Also I had a rather long and complex dream last night, consisting of two parts;   Part 1  I am with a group of people I know touring an old tower, at the very top there is the garrison of oversized  urlLink die cast figurines , one of them rides around the room on his horse and eventually we leave. Once outside I find out that they are evil and are currently under siege so I help in destroying them; they are going to come out and attack us and so in preparation we form a line and pass eggs down it until it gets to the final group of people of which I am one, smash them on the ground. I smash two eggs and when they hit the ground they turn out to be made of glass and are hollow, I fear that I might get in trouble for breaking them so I go in to the growing crowd.  As expected the door opens and the besieged come out but instead of being the model soldiers they are tourists who come out with their hands above their heads and carefully walk across the glass and are arrested. As they march out I see one of them dressed up impersonating my dead grandfather. They are evil.   Part 2  I am alone with a friend on the top of a mountain at an abandoned picnic area. Between one peak and another of this mountain there is a Chinese temple which, my friend tells me, contains lions and goes down there to tame the lions. I instead look around and find my father, together we get in a cable car and after calling someone it begins to move quite normally, except when it gets to the first support it shakes violently and stops, after a brief pause it continues but on each support it shakes even more violently, so much so that bottom and sides disappear and I have to hold on to a pole connected to the ceiling. During this life-threatening voyage I compare my plight to that of a soft toy holding on to a balloon, on hindsight I think of this as being very strange.  Eventually the remains of the cable car arrive at the other station and we walk through a cabin and meet a couple who run the cable car, we find out that we are in a foreign land and must get back to Britain, so we all go in their car, trying to get to a port. At one point we come across a river which we must cross, the driver decides to accelerate but when it hits the river it flips over as I had predicted. Somehow we find ourselves on the road again. On the journey to the port we run out of food and occasionally stop to get more but when it looks like we are running low on money as well, we stop at a van which sells food and the man gets out and while I am in the car some distance away, I can see him, he buys himself a large piece of meat and eats it, my mum [who has now also appeared] drives off leaving him stranded with the meat. We carry on driving until an undefined point where it all stopped. Sorry this posting is so long but I wanted to include it all. One last thing - DON'T vote for the UK Independence Party. I would list my reasons but this post is already too long so just listen to any debate featuring a representative of the UKIP and you'll see why.    \n'''\n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
