Christine and I could always be the “Asian Flowers” duo.&nbsp; We seem to have that lost and confused look down pat, judging by how people kept coming to help us with directions in Greece.&nbsp;   … having a bit of baby fever right now.&nbsp; There’s this incredibly cute but cranky Chinese baby boy in the nursery.&nbsp; I so just wanna pick him up and play.   … my jasmine plant is dying.&nbsp; She’s now under the care of my mom who’s spritzing everyday and trying to revive her.&nbsp; No greenthumb for me.   … had a lesson with a cute boy at KF.&nbsp; He punched me in the breast… it was a light punch, but still embarrassing.&nbsp; Things happen, I guess… can’t be as bad as them getting accidentally kicked in the balls.   … looking forward to the long weekend.&nbsp; Tonight we’re getting another dose of Gus and his band.&nbsp; Tomorrow’s plans to go dancing at the Garage416 party at Sunnyside for my friend’s birthday got cancelled.&nbsp; It’s too bad cuz I was looking forward to seeing him (don’t you love it how some guys just disappear once they start dating someone?!) and to hearing some good house music.&nbsp; Saturday, it’s BBQ time with the girls.&nbsp; Yum yum.&nbsp; Hari’s band is playing Saturday night too.. oh wells.&nbsp; Guess I’ll just catch his next gig.&nbsp; Hee.. I’m such a groupie.   All ranted out now :)                 \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
