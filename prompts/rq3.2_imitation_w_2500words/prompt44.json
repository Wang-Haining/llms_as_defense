I mean, those who know me know that I'm extremely comfortable with mine. So you can see why it's hard for me to comprehend why some people aren't comfortable with theirs.  My newest obsessions are mochas and astrology. There's some random facts that you can stick in your pipe and smoke.  *** 'So how've you been, Maggie?' Wayne would start off the conversation. It took all he had in him not to get up and just carry her to the bed in the next room. It'd been a while, but he still loved her. He wondered if she knew that.  'I've been okay.. I mean, not as okay as I was when we-- I mean, when  I  was living back in New York.' She paused, thinking carefully. 'Well, my sister is coming to visit me next week so that'll be fun.' She sighed, and set down her glass on the table. 'I miss New York though. I don't know why I moved all the way out here.'  'To get away from me,' he flattly sad. Though he hoped it wasn't true. They'd had a bad break up and she moved half way across the country. This was the first time he'd seen her since then.  'Don't say that because you know it's not true. Shit, I even made plans to move out here  with  you.' Her hazel eyes moved to lock with his. 'But life stuff got on the way.'  His eyes scanned her body, again. She looked so gorgeous and she was wearing a sweater that had been a gift from him. Again, he had the urge to just bend her over the arm of her chair but, though she was great in bed, catching up was something that must be done first.   While looking at her engagement finger and seeing the ring he'd proposed with gone, he whispered, 'I still love you, you know.'   He then looked up at her and saw her eyes gleaming with love and seduction. She smiled. 'I know. I love you, too.'   That's it , he thought. He rose from his chair and went to her's, pulling her up to him by her waist and kissing her long and hard, making up for all the lost time.  Her body seemed to go lip in his arms, but her mouth was still entertwined and at work with his. They collapsed together in her chair and their hands went while, reaching out to feel what was once felt.  As Wayne's hand headed to unclasp her bra, the phone shrieked. Their mouths parted, leaving them short of breath.   Maggie looked apologetically at him before reaching for the phone, one leg still over his leg, keeping his body close to her's.   'Hello?' She paused before slumping her shoulders and silently sighing. 'Hey mom.'  Wayne rolled his eyes and sighed with her before heaving himself away from her body and off the chair. He walked back to his own chair and picked up his jacket from the back of it. He then took his glass from the coffee table and quickly gulped the contents down before sliding on his jacket.  By this time, Maggie was carrying on a conversation with her mother, seemingly becoming annoyed. She looked up at Wayne, who's hand was on the doorknob, yet he was turned, facing her, waiting to get a word in.  Her mom was going on about her poolboy, who was apparently Mexican and kept eyeing her, which made her uncomfortable. Typical of her rich mother who had married for money and afterwards fell in love. 'Mom... mom! Hold on a second.'  She pressed the 'hold' button on the phone's base and set it down before rising from her chair and walking to him. 'I'm so sorry. You don't have to go.. I mean, you can stay if you're not too freaked..'  He betrayed his heart and shook his head. 'No, I better go, work in the morning and it's getting kind of late.'  He brought his hand up and tucked a tendril of her hair behind her ear before kissing her forehead. 'It was great seeing you again, Maggie. Really.'  And that was it. He smiled before turning and pulling open the door, walking out, and shutting it behind him, leaving her alone once again in her apartment. She turned, dejectedly, and walked back over to the phone, pressing the 'hold' button and lifting the phone to her ear. 'Yeah.. I'm here.'  /end                     Okay.. so I'm indulging in the act of doing stupid things lately. Not on purpose, of course. But sometimes it's just those things that everyone does now and then.. and then sometimes.. it's not. There's the little things like.. when my contacts aren't in, I'm going around looking for my glasses, when they're on my head [where I put them when I'm taking my contacts out]. And there's the looking under the desk for my shoes and having like.. a blind spot where they're under there but I can't see them, so I walk around the entire house before I decide I'll check under the desk one more time and they'll be there, waiting. And just this morning, I was looking around for an article of clothing which I needed because the packers were about to come in and estimate how much packing they'd have to do in my room, and I was literally looking for about 5 minutes until I realized I was already wearing it. And by that time, I was uber frustrated.   And though I've mentioned it, I'll do it again. I always have a problem finding my shoes. I just have some sort of blind spot for them or something. They'll either be by the couch or under the desk or by my bed or by the counter, whatever, and it'll always take me a second or third time looking there before I actually find them. Everyone does it, I know, so hopefully I'm not the only one who does it about a million times a day.  Okay, and is it weird that I'm singing along to Abra Cadabra and liking it?  Make me laugh, make me cry ...   On a side note.. did you know that you have to sign up [and possibly pay] for dictionary.com so you can get a 'premium' account. What's a premium account on  dictionary .com? A place for people without dictionaries to go and check out the kick ass things you can do with regular dictionaries? Oh, fun! Let's go sign up!.. in the way that, no, no it's kind of aud..                     Today I confirmed one of my long time suspisions. I'm afraid of time. Or.. I just hate it. Though, it's crazy, time is passing right now, but I hate time. I either want it to pass or just go so slowly so I can savor the moments.  Earlier today, I met somebody who made me realize this. His name is Kelly. After meeting him, we were walking down the street, passed the Los Altos Apt/Hotel building, and I got shaky in the knees and had to sit on the sidewalk for a second, replaying it all. I suddenly went into this total asshole person, angry that the time was over, the time of talking, the time of meeting, and visiting with this person. Someone who, I never had a clue that I'd meet. I never expected to. Maybe his brother but not him. You know how that is?  So.. maybe I'm afraid of time or of memory, or I just hate them both. Some people get extreme merriment or pleasure out of memories and are fine with the passing time, but I'm not. Sometimes I'll look back on memories and giggle, going 'oh that was fun, that was quite awesome!' but mostly it'll be 'why didn't I do that? what the hell was wrong with me? why did it have to be over so soon?'. I guess it's just the kind of person I am.  I can't stand it, either. I hate being an asshole when it comes around.                     Have you heard the 'such is life' saying? What does that really mean, anyway? Though I don't understand, it annoys me nonetheless. Because it's always said about the bad.. just like 'everything happens for a reason'. Sure. I believe that. But ever notice that whenever someone says it, it's always about something shitty? It's strange.   Onto another topic I was thinking about earlier, on the way home from the airport. Ever just stop to think about the life of a greyhound? Here's a greyhounds average life cycle: You're born, you're trained for about a year and a half, you begin racing, getting whipped, kept in small cramped spaces, you run until you literally can't run anymore, you retire around 3 years old, and then you die with scars all over your body from a life with nothing but work. 'Such is life' John, a friend of mine, says. But shouldn't it be different? Shouldn't it be different at some point? My dad says you shouldn't get a puppy greyhound because if you get a puppy, an adult will die. You see, if nobody rescues [houses] the greyhounds once they retire, they kill them.   I had a greyhound when I lived in Las Vegas. Her name was Fay and she wasn't quite three yet, but she wasn't fast enough to race. So if nobody adopted her, they would have killed her. Once we got her, her body was covered in many, many cuts and scars and she was extremely timid around humans. We had two little mini-chihuahuas at the time, too. But I loved Fay and I wanted her to be happy and free around me, not timid and scared. So everyday when I'd come home from school, I'd go and I'd hang out with her, just because. I'd pet her until she would fall asleep or I would pet her while laying down next to her and napping with her. She warmed up to me instantly, and to my dad, who loved her just as much as I did. But she was still quite timid around my brother and mom. It even got to the point where, when I would come home from school or I had free time, I would go down in the big front room of our house and get on all fours and bark at her and run around playing with her. I would get a bowl and fill it with water and whenever she would go get a drink and rest, I would go and get a drink from my little bowl and drink out of it like she did, and lay down beside her to rest. She was basically my dog. And she was soo sweet. My little chihuahua dog, Sampson, was like her little puppy, too. He was the same color, just so much smaller, and he looked a lot like her. He would hang out with her in her big huge cage [she didn't have to sleep in it, of course, she had the freedom to do as she pleased around the house, but she liked it in there] and act like her little pup.   Until the day my mom decides Fay was too big for our house so we had to give her away. I was completely devistated. I was out on a bike ride with a friend and when I came back to the house, Fay was being put into someone's car. It felt like something was being ripped out of me and chopped into little pieces. My mom promised me we could go see her but we never did. Even when I wanted to, I would remind them 'Mom, you promised! Can we go visit now?' and it was always 'maybe another day, honey'. I miss her even to this day. I still love her, and wish she were here. Wish I had more than a few minutes notice before she was taken away, wish that her entire life had been different. That she didn't have to endure the years of pain and not being loved until she got to our house. I'm just glad she was among the many greyhounds they kill when they don't have a home to go to once they retire. I wish greyhounds didn't have such cruel lives, that no animal did. 'Such is life'? No, life should be different.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
