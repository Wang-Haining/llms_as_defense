At work Mara came so we played Spit.. what a great time. Then I played Al in spit and lost..and then in checkers.. and i lost again. But whatever it was fun lol. After work I had an orthodontist apt. which was not cool. He said that i have a problem with the way I swallow? how dare he! Well anyway neither of my retainers fit and i'm not getting new ones which is gay.. my teeth are probally going to move and I'm gonna be pissed and if he thinks he's getting me to put braces on again he's joking himself.   After that I went for a run .. a long one. It was exactly 50 minutes. I dont know how far really but on my schedual I'm gonna write 5 cause I'm suposta do that one day this week. Then I did some things that I was suposta be doing all summer, like step-ups and the heel-raise series. So I'm probally gonna be sore tomorrow.   I beleive tonight I'm going to Hoop City for the Hannan Varsity games, both girls and boys. The only person that i think will be playing is Eileen and i'm not even sure but I'll finish when I get back.    Oasis- Breakfast At Tiffanys   'You say the world has come between us, our lives have come between us. Still I know you just dont care.'                     alrite well nobody came over tonight so i was ..lets say upset at first. But i didn't really talk to Mandie and Heath so whatever. I ended up going for a run at 9 and it was really good but then I started to feel sick so i walked some and then finished up. It was getting kind of scary tho because i felt like someone was following me and the srteets around me have very few street lights..and also things were making weird noises that i didn't like. Anyway on my XC schudual i'm writing that i did 3 even tho it was probally less because i was suposta to 5 one day this week and i didn't do that =\\  I think i'm gonna ask Carolyn if she wants to run with me when i have to do long ones like that. I feel bad not asking Krissie but i dont think I could keep up..I probally will ask tho.   I have work again .. 15 days left. just think it's all going towards my car which at the moment i want a white Jeep but we'll see how long that lasts and if i like it after i go for a test drive lol .. xoxo -Casey                           Here we go. My good good good friend&nbsp;Simko told me he liked me. I knew it was comming because someone slipped it to me. (lol thanks Mandie) But he was like .. 'what would it do to our friendship if i told you i liked you' but i just said i didn't like him like that but i hope we could have the same friendship .. so we do. I guess everything's cool with that. I kinda feel bad tho. I hope i dont lead people on like that. Especially&nbsp;him cause he's an awesome kid and I would never want to hurt him. Mandie told me not to break his heart so i tried really hard. Hopefully&nbsp;he didn't like me that much. I've known him for 5 months (since feb 14th) and they have been really great. We&nbsp;became good friends almost imediately and i would trust him with my life. I really hope that&nbsp;continues.&nbsp;&nbsp;xo *later days&nbsp;   Beatles- Black Bird &nbsp; 'Blackbird singing in the dead of night, take these sunken eyes and learn to see. All your life you were only waiting for this moment to be free.'                    Today started off average. I had work and i got hit in the head with a tennis ball while playing 'wall ball'.. i was doing good too haha. Jared Hill was there for a little and that was cool cause i dont see him that often even tho he lives right by me. I cant wait till next year when ill get to see him hopefully everyday at school. He always was on of my favorite people in the world. Tonight I went to heath's house. That was really funny in the beginning but then matt got pissed off and left. We were bustin around with him and i took&nbsp;his keys and he just freaked out.. like he was really serious. I dont know if i've seen him that way in a while but he got bitchy and left. We all kinda expected him to come back but he never did =\\ I called him and he yelled at me .. a lot and i'm really not used to that from him. I feel really bad. I'll say i'm sorry again tomorrow at the park and hopefully he'll get over it. But it was a really good night besides that. The guys were all busting eachother about being gay and stuff. It was fun. Now i'm hearing that craig and heath are talking and that's really good. Me and heath were talking about that today and i told her it would be great if they could make up. Mandie still seems pissed but i hope they all .. live happily after and everything. Espically cause they're all going on&nbsp;vaca in 9 days and i wouldnt want that to be shitty for any of them. Craig might only be with them for two or something i'm not sure how it all works out but w.e.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Matt is on and i'm talking to him. He's bitching that he worked all day and he didn't need girls 'playing mind games with him' .. alriteee you work at the park with me which is nothing and at a tanning place where you sit and watch girls sign in! You over react and are a drama queen.. but yet i'm still saying i'm sorry. Go figure .. more tomorrow      CCR - 'I wanna know,  have you ever seen the rain , commin down on me.'                         haha well today was deffinately a good one. Work was fine, last day is tomorrow so the pizza party is after but we're limited to like 6 trays cause last year we went crazy and i beleive the bill was like $206 and j. mac said he could have a banquet with that much.&nbsp;Whatever thoo. Bobby put ice down my shirt and no one did anything the whole day. He got really pissy and left like 7 times. Too bad he just drove around the block. Then he threw trail mix at me and i was like Bobby! i didn't do anything all day .. and he interrupted me and was like exactly! You havent done any thing all month except flirt with Al. So i yelled shut up and was a little embarrassed cause everyone knows it was true but i honestly dont care. Tomorrow will probally be the last day i see him for a year tho and i think i heard him mutter something about not dating sophmores so i was like .. whateverr.. After Salerno's i think Erin, Katie,and Xtina are comming over so that will be fun of course.     &nbsp;  I layed outside for a while today and painted my nails. Then i started packing and i'm deffinately not gonna have all my shit together by saturday morning omg. I cant wait for the beach tho. Me and eileen are gonna tear it up! I feel bad tho because carissa is going the same week or she was suposta and she was gonna bring me. But i'm going so she has nobody to bring. =\\&nbsp; We talked that over a little and came up with nothing.. So she said she's not going which makes me feel worse cause i could be taking her but idk. I'm gonna have a good time no matter what tho... Tonight i had Anna, Mackenzie, Leah, Tara, and Carissa over and we swam and went on the trampoline and that's always a good time. I'm glad i got to chill with all of them before i go away. I also got to talk to Timmy Washo on the phone and i just remembered how much i missed him! I think that was the first time i talked to him all summer and it was for like one miute. That's alrite tho. It's something to look foreward to with the school year even tho i cant beleive i just said that haha. Well i'm gonna go and i shall update later.     &nbsp;   Phantom Planet- California &nbsp; 'On the stereo listen as we go. Nothing's gonna stop me now. California, here we come, right back where we started from'                        alrite well this is gonna be long because my father had this guy look at my computer and they put all types of restrictions on it so i had to get him to take some of them away. grr it's all because of my brothers too. But whatever ill start with yesterday.  Me, eileen, lynn, and carissa went to eileen's grandparents house and swam in the lake for her b-day. Well me and eileen swam but it was a lottt of fun! some memories.. my sandles floating away, and the dog 'deer' pissing on the canoe haha. That night carissa, eileen, brian and me chilled at my house. Macart stopped by for a little too because he's not gonna see carissa for likee 11 days :o who by the way got her belly button peirced and i finally got to see it! haha my mom said it looked cute but i just dont want it done. But whatever..me and eileen jumped in the pool and it was a good time..it was suposta be a surprise party but yaknoww.. the St. Pat's picnic got in the way and some people just couldnt give that up for the night.. hmm eileen: 'I want to be normal Chet!' wow discussing Boy Meets World haha. Then she slept over and we went for a walk and got home at likee 12:45 ish lol shit that dirt road with NO lights was scarry!!.. and we stopped by Lynn's house since nobody could come with us. That was cool tho.   Today I just layed outside and read some of 'Lord of the Flies' ..which sucks. Oh yeah and then i was cleaning the edges of my pool haha but then i gave that job to my  brother John. Now I'm sitting here in a wet bathing suit trying to see what i'm gonna do tonight. I beleive that Mandie and Heather are comming over but i'm not sure who else so I'll find out and wirte more later.    The Who- Teenage Wasteland   'Don't cry, don't raise your eyes. It's only teenage wasteland...They're all wasted!' haha .. what a quote.                       Last Entry! For two weeks at least hehe. Today was the last day at the park. It was .. well i'll just tell you what happened. I gave this kid Earl four quarters for his dollar so he could get a soda. He realized i still had his dollar and started freaking out. He was like attacking me haha. Then he started crying and ran between the baseball field fence the wall next to it. I told bobby and him and a few ppl were trying to convince him to get out. That didn't work very well and the kids started yelling that Earl was stuck. I jumped down to try and help him up to find out that he had plenty of room even the way he was sitting. However i didn't and couldnt change the way i was facing but that's ok. So the whole camp decided to flock over just as i get inbetween the fences or whatever. But he came out as soon as he realized he had everyone's attention so i slowly made my way out with him. A kid was leading him out with a ball of yarn like he was being pulled out of a mountain avalanche. Then they clapped when he got out. But that was my day.. i just cleaned up arts and crafts after that. When the day was over we went to Salerno's. That was a party as always. Bobby took one sip of his beer and we wernt sure if he was drunk from that moment or just acting like an idiot as he claimed. He was just ripping people apart and all they had to saw was bob your drunk and the whole table just died laughing. I had like 4 or 5 peices of pizza haha. He asked why i was so quiet and i said that i had nothing to say. Which wasnt true at all but i didn't want to get the jokes turned on me which could have happened easily. I know i need to say something about Al now.. i just dont know what. There are so many things i'm just not sure anymore. Matt was saying how he asked how far we got and that he called me prude cause we got next to no where. But matt knows other stuff but i dont know what really went on in that convo. Everyone left and we barely said goodbye so.. till next year i guess. That kinda sucks =\\        After the party tho.. Erin, Christina, and Katie came over as our second year tradition. It was fun as always. The most eventful part was probally the drawing on me with permanent markers. They all signed their names on my legs and drew a few things here and there. It came off tho. Already actually which is interesting. Pen and stuff usually never stays on my body long. Like when i'm writing myself things to remember and then i cant read them. anyway...      Carissa called me twice to remind me that i was going to the pittston fair with her after i already knew that. However at 7:30 i called her and was planning on getting ready real quick and going but she was going to Matt's. Alrite no biggie. I chilled here with eileen and we watched Dirty Dancing Havanna Nights. Heath would be proud! I already miss her and Mand. But that was an amzing movie!!! I loved it soo much! It makes me want to move to Cuba and meet a hot guy and dance with him forever. ::sigh::       Eric Clapton- Tears in Heaven   'Time can bring you down, time can bend your knees.
