I'm just sitting at my computer like, extremely ill. I've got this fever, and I'm freezing my ass off in flannel. So, I decided that answering IMs isn't something I want to do. So, I put up an away message, and miss CASEY! 8 times. And I don't know his number, and I want to call him, and talk to him, but he's going golfing and i don't have my phone, GOSH!! This day SUCKS! Anyway, I was going to tell the world what I was getting Casey for Christmas, but, he told me he reads, so, sorry baby, you don't get to know. It's friday, the 28th. Which means, on Sunday, is....my one month! This is my...3rd relationship that has lasted over a month. Go me! Boys are so hard like that, you have to do stuff...wait, not like that. Gosh, nevermind, you sick freaks. Anyway, this is the three is my lucky number. I think. No, it is, and Casey is an amazing great guy. Yes, Alex, he is up to your standards, and your's to Nataku, and my father even likes him, even though Casey drives. It's a miracle that my parents trust me this much. Anyway....wasn't I GRIPING?!    I forgot my point....   Well anyway. While I was up late, coughing up my guts, I watched a great movie with Kevin Kline. 'The Emperor's Club.' IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THAT MOVIE SEE IT!! It is a great piece of work, and I loved it. It think it was one of like....three movies I cried during. One being 'Remember the Titans.', and then 'Divine Secerts of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood.' and now 'The Emperor's Club.' It is a guy movie, in fact, it is about a boy's school during the 70's. Kevin Kline plays a middle-aged Western Civilizations teacher, the Greeks, the Romans, Caesars, and all of the Emperor's of Rome, Willam Hundert. Let me tell you, Mr. Hundert is the kind of teacher that everyone wants to have for Western Civilizations. It's just a story about a boy's school, and it's a guy movie, go see it now!                    Annoyed, yes.   Ah, it's that time in every Shiloh students life that we all spend cramming for our exams. Our Midterm exams, the thing that can make your grade, or break your grade. So, right now, I'm sitting here listening to terrible music, and trying to cram info that I have no picked up over 9 1/2 weeks, without any of my notes, infact, without any information pretaining to the two WONDERFUL subjects in which I happen to have these exams in. Both of my core classes, with is like, so great, since they're on the same day. I can't complain too much. I mean, I'm reviewing for L.A.. And stuffing my mind of pointless history. Pointless history on pointless things I'll never need unless I'm on Jeapordy or I'm a histoian. Which means, God, save me from this class now. We all have those thoughts. But, since these 9 1/2 weeks went by so fast, what's to say the next 9 1/2 won't? Coach Waters, that's who. The satanic teacher that I have been oh-so-lucky to have teach me. As he reminds us daily, making us write long papers on relgions that we really don't care about. Making up do pointless speeches in class, for our peers to kindly sleep though.And then of course, there is the singling out and embrsassment of students, through a method he calls 'Roulette'. Sooner or later, I'm going to start playing that. With a gun. It's bad enough he's my World History teacher, making it impossible for me to get an A, he has to be at every Cross Country meet ever. His daughter runs. Comparison is never fun, and when you're slow, it's worse. It's bad enough I suck period, comparison is even worse. I've already measured up slow to the other 40-something girls on the team, why compare more? Because, it's a torture method. The only perk about this class is having Anna in there with me.  See, the thing with that is this. Anna and I had no classes together for the first...3 days. No lunch, we weren't even on halls close together. Then one day, Anna shows up in my first block. And then we have thrid together. We are...happy...about that.   Anyway. Hey, write me, and I'll be sure to answer. Gotta Gripe? Please, feel free to share.   Ja-na!                   urlLink deviantART: PseudoStars   Eeep, no update in forever. Sorry guys. That is my art site. Gr, I need photoshop. Yay for Jason! He's bruning me a copy of it. Finally. Lol. I finished my song. For L.A. I figure, I might as well, like finish that tonight. or tomorrow. It's not due until friday, but whatever, right? I'm going to start giving out business cards, so people can read this. Homework for the week would be...  Hefner: Antigone project and Antigone  Trial. Big fun. Here's my song.   Rainstorm Angel  Sitting all alone Everyone against her No where to call home  She knows the way to go She knows what path to take Never been treaded  Her side they do not take  CHORUS: Rainstorm angel Scared and all alone Your death will mark the curse That your family owns Realize your fault, king Stop her senseless death Or you’ll lose much more Than one innocent  She’s dead inside She’s been locked away Why can’t you see? Her life she’ll take  They can’t stop True loves flight With Haimon by her side She will end her life   CHORUS: Rainstorm angel Scared and all alone Your death will mark the curse That your family owns Realize your fault, king Stop her senseless death Or you’ll lose much more Than one innocent  Oh rainstorm angel, Now that you are gone The king now knows That fate cannot be wronged   CHORUS: Rainstorm angel Scared and all alone Your death will mark the curse That your family owns Realze your fault, king Stop her senseless death Or you’ll lose much more Than one innocent [4x]    took up a lot of room, eh? I'm gonna work out a tune for it later.  Huff: I've got a speech tomorrow. Must make outline...  Waters: i've got a test on Friday...must...study...  Neal: Dumb...dumb woman.  That's about it, you know....Gotta work on stuff now though.....grr...Work sucks a lot.   Hehe! i've got a date to homecoming! Hiya Chris!! If your out there reading this!! I'll see you tomorrow! (No personal details in Blogger world)   [Music]- Linkin Park- Nobody's Listening [Mood]- Emotionless. And stressed...and Well, Happy! [Quote]- 'Yeah, I washed it.' -Me [Gripe]- No going to Charolette. And having a lot of work.                    More to life.   Is it easy to say when you see yourself being hated, that you very well might be? It's sort of sad to view it like this, but it seriously could be true, couldn't it? Sometimes, and mostly when your in high school, you see yourself as always being judged. Now, what if your friends did this judging to you? I'm not all too sure where I'm headed with this, but, I'm sure you'll see this. For some reason, I'm feeling left out from 'Haterfest '03!'.  I have NO idea why. Okay, maybe it's because a lot of my friends are there, but some of them aren't. What of them? I'm just being how I was born to be. Except, I was invited. I just thought it would be logically to go to sleep early and then, you know, go to movies on Sunday, seeing as I have a meet tomorrow. It just had planned to go see a movie with Alex, Jared and Anna. But it's empty. I know half, or more, of the people at Homestaying think I'm a self-rightous bitch. Okay, I'm not saying I'm not, becasue you know what? I am. But it is so worse when other people tell you that you are. It's just annoying, so I should be glad I'm not going. Okay, wait, this started out as a drespressing post, and now it's like 'I'm happy I'm not going.'...I call it horomones, mood swings, whatever you want. But I do feel okay that I'm not going. I don't really need to surround myself with the large amount of idiots that will be present, do I? I think not. Plus, it's not like Jessie cares if I show up. So, it's more or less dejection. Oh. Dejection. Wow. Now I'm really happy about not going. I'm so odd. I never thougt I could, like do this, without the help of my shirk. I feel good. It's not like anyone wants to see me there anyway! It'd be like, breaking a taboo. Oh, well, does that mean I should? I could just see myself walking in and everything getting reeeeaallly silent suddenly. Wow....it's Ever After all over again, except, no prince, no di Vinici, no kick-ass costume, and no long hair...which would just strip the plot from that AWESOME movie anyway. I could compare it to The Princess Bride. Which would also kill that movie. Okay, Monty Python and the Quest for the Holy Grail. Yeah, the part with the French people! The ones that throw the cow. Yeah. People throw cows at me. I'm such a sad person, seeing as I'm listening The Dead Alewives, and talking about Monty Python. And seeing as the skit was...McGregor Kilts, I suppose it wasn't that bad. Oh yeah, 'Have fun sleeping.'...piece of shit...    ...I need a punching bag....    MUSIC:   Gob- LEMON-AID and MEST- Mother's Prayer.                    Hello Houston.  'You say If you were to wait Something just might change I say That i don't have the strength  to burn our fueling Flame.'  -The Starting Line.  That was the first song that popped up on my Random. It says in the song that Love can make you stay. Somehow, I have gained belief for this. I.E., Casey. For those of you that know the story, doesn't it make sense? It does to me. I figured out..That I have a new favorite song, by my new favorite band (I have a new one each week). First off, It's either 'Kissing you goodnight' or 'On my mind' by Alister. Which is a band that rocks. But it's great song. I also like 'Somewhere Down in Fullerton.' Which is a great song by the same band. Anyway. I decided that my favorite movie was Ever After today. I like Princess Movies. Like The Princess Bride, which is such a GREAT movie. It's got the guy from Robin Hood: Men in Tights in it, as Wesley. Gosh I could go on for hours about that movies...those movies. I could aslo go on for hours about Homestar Runner and the enviroment. I'm such a Marizpan! Any...way...  Song of the moment: Seriously? -[The Sorry Song]- The Troys.  GRIPE: The name of that BAND!  Other gripe: COCAH WATERS!!   MUAH!! KC is my baby!!!                  So much for my happy ending.    Wait. I have one.   So, it occured to me lately that just becauase my life has not been picture of perfection for the past two years of high school, or at least my romantic life, which, by the way, has been a flaming hell hole of bad relationships and carbon copies of 'The one', which I had thought, until most recently, I had yet to find. But, is life and relationships nothing but seeing carbon copies of the one that we are meant to be with? And what if we think we have found that one, and through a terribly tragic accident, the one, dies. So, how are we suppose to carry on with our lives? I have heared that if love is strong enough...that possibly you will join your love soon in the heavens, but sometimes that's really not the plan, is it? So, say 'the one' dies, a tragic car accident, and you didn't. You are now a single parent with...two children to raise, a new born baby that was not in the car and a three year old that was also not in the car. What are you, the single parent to do? How do you live without the one that you've loved for years? Frankly, I'm not to sure what I'd do. But rea;lly, do I need to worry about that?   So anyway....  I'm headed off to camp in Savannah at the college of Art and Design there. I'm a bit scared. I've been marveled as the best for a while at my non-artistic school...and now? Going to an art college will be hard for me. Accepting the fact that I'm not held in high esteem is very hard for me, especially when I'm taking life-drawing...with is not a good subject for me at all. Join me later this week as we finish going through the trials and tribulations of a young artist....   Such Bullshit sometimes.    Songs of the moment: 'Let's get it started' - The Black Eyed Peas   'My Happy Ending' - Avril, whatever song that Robot on Robot Violence played at their last show, and 'Mexican Wine' - Fountains of Wayne.   Gripe: the age thing. Still, my parents are so...odd sometimes.   And no matter what, I still love him.           \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
