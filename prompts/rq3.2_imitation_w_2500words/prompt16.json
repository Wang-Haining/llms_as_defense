The formula demanded that the ratio of the shorter part of a given unit to the longer part equal the ratio of the longer part to the whole. And this perfect ratio boils down to 1:1.61803 (about the length of your hand relative to the length of your forearm).  Phidias, Greece's most acclaimed sculptor, applied the Golden Section to his statues of the gods, with divine results. In 1509, Leonardo da Vinci's close chum, the mathematician Luca Pacioli, wrote a three-volume book called De Divina Proportione, which argued that the equation was the cornerstone of all aesthetic endeavor. Some art scholars even believe that Leonardo's Mona Lisa conforms to a version of the formula called the Golden Rectangle.  The 1:1.61803 ratio refuses to go away. In the 1860s, German psychologist Gustav Theodor Fechner put ten rectangles varying in their length-to-width ratios in front of people and asked them to select the most pleasing one. Guess which rectangles ruled? In 1994, a London-based orthodontist updated the experiment, measuring the faces of fashion models. He determined that they satisfied the Greeks' perfect ratio far more closely than the average face.  The latest, most user-friendly incarnation of the theory belongs to retired plastic surgeon Stephen Marquardt. He's devised a mask for applying the Greeks' Golden Section to the face. The closer your features conform to the lines of the mask, the prettier your face, supposedly. As you might imagine, supermodels like Cindy Crawford and Linda Evangelista fit gorgeously. Other folks don't fare so well.                      I am just keeping it short today because I am busy wasting time in other ways! One of my online hobbies (for both personal and professional use) is checking/editing/translating using online dictionaries and translation tools.  My favorite translation site is  urlLink Babel Fish . You can translate from several languages into several other languages. I tried this one with Korean first. I typed in simple phrases and the translations were almost always nearly perfect... even deleting subject pronouns as Korean speakers would... Complicated sentences are another story, however.   Now I use it for other languages, too... languages new to me like Spanish. Unfortunately, not all languages are represented. If you want to translate Serbian, you are out of luck! However, there are always ways around this. Just email me with your Serbian language needs and I will send them to Slovenian friend and translator extraordinaire (I hear she also does Croatian, Italian, German... ) or sign up for  urlLink  on-line Serbian lessons ! This one is fun as you can drag your cursor over the word and hear the meaning... or click the speech bubble to hear the phrase spoken...  Click below to translate this page!                           Over the weekend, I had the pleasure of joining some other expats at Saint's and Sinners Pub for the going away party for one of our acquaintances. Saints and Sinner's is your typical  American pub ... so generic, it could be picked up and dropped into just about any airport in the world and it wouldn't be misplaced! You know the type - with those old-fashioned American ads that someone obviously produces just for pubs like this one! Anyway, we all ordered. I must say that I must have been in Asia for too long, because I no longer notice if there is mayonnaise and asparagus on my pizza or hello kitty fishcakes floating in my soup. Peanut butter on a ham and egg sandwich? No problem!  This was not the case for some of the others. 3 people ordered cheeseburgers. Two of them ate half before decided the rest wasn't worthy of consumption. The third cheeseburger diner; however, decided this was NOT ACCEPTABLE. Being quite fluent in Chinese, she called over the waiter and ranted at him for about 15 minutes re: the poor quality of the stuff stuck between the two fluffy halves of the bun: What kind of filler was used? What kind of humiliation was inflicted on that ground beef? At first, I watched/listened in morbid fascination! Then a Wendy's commercial from the '80s came to mind and I had to laugh!  urlLink 'Where's the beef?'                                     In the future, Taiwan plans to  add&nbsp;fingerprints to the backs of ID cards. In some countries this is  already standard.&nbsp;In my&nbsp;second year of Japanese residence, this  feature was added to the alien resgistration cards. I remember feeling slightly  like a criminal as I stood there having my prints taken. (I don't know if  Japanese nationals have fingerprints on theirs). However, in retrospect, it was  more like stamping something with your chop as it wasn't a&nbsp;complete  'fingerprinting'. In Korea, my prints were taken&nbsp;properly (although not  reproduced on my card).       &nbsp;       Many Taiwanese are against having their prints on  thier ID card. Recently there has been a scandal over a personal data leak.  Financial agencies and credit investigation agencies leaking personal  date;&nbsp;government investigation agencies bugging telecommunications lines  and searching records... and law enforcement agents abusing power by selling  data gleaned. I am still not sure exactly how and to what extent the 'victims'  suffered losses... but they are demanding compensation. There are some calling  up just to find out if they were victimized without their knowledge. Anyway,  people are now asking how they can give&nbsp; their fingerprints to a government  that cannot prevent data leaks.        &nbsp;    Although Taiwan, like much of Asia, is somewhat  cash oriented, the use of credit cards is already more widespread than in other  countries.&nbsp;Many of my Taiwanese&nbsp;have as many as 5 or 6 (they can shift  their debt from one to the other each month to avoid paying any interest). But  what happens when all of society goes plastic and you can pay directly out of  your account as in North America... and&nbsp;a&nbsp;NEC sensor that read prints  directly from your digits rather than relying on ink prints is used as the ID  method rather than a password (the police in Japan&nbsp;is now using this system  of IDing)... or when all personal data is contained on one biometric 'smart  card'? Gattica here we come: Identification and passwords which check features  such as irises, veins, vocal pattterns and handwriting.&nbsp;Who knows... maybe  the biomentric smart card will be more secure?                            Hezachan,I see you have joined this weblog, but I have yet to see you post! How is Korea these days? Taiwan is getting hotter and more humid every day! Summer is upon us and me still with no summer vacation in sight.     Anyway, what are you up to this weekend? Any exciting plans? I am off to the office soon, so am unlikely to do anything too terribly exciting beyond keeping my office chair rooted to the floor. (Wouldn't want it to float away). Tonight, however, (if not too tired) I may try to get a little exercise - either at the gym or on the dance floor.     Tomorrow, I am looking forward to a wonderful day of grocery shopping and laundry! I still have a package of  kimchi , some  genip , one tub of walnut and anchovy side-dish (don&#8217;t be disgusted), and a container of  samjang  from when I was in Korea last... So I was thinking about actually eating dinner at home! Novetly of novelties!     Why do I never cook? It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t have a kitchen here - it&#8217;s just that I can never find the right utensils, I don&#8217;t have a properly working rice cooker, of course there is no oven &#8211;like Korea, only 2 gas burners... and most importantly, I have NO time. I wonder if I can even remember how to cook. I think the last time was December 2000 in Vancouver! I even made fruitcake that year to celebrate having an oven during the holidays!     Too bad my sojourn back in North America was only 6 months... &nbsp;Do you think the culture shock of being in a place where I could understand what everyone was saying might have been too great? Do you think I will ever truly be able to leave Asia?     Well, hope to hear from you soon...                                         Always in search of new sites to get ideas for  work... I LOVE books, sites with quizzes. Ok... so I may use them for a boring  purpose... to make teaching materials, but some are fun in their own right. A  few years ago, I started using  E-mode &nbsp;to get ideas... I think everyone  REALLY needs to know which breed of dog they are (Can it really be possible that  I am a chihuahua?) And as for me, I am glad to know that if I were an umbrella  drink, I would be a daquairi! I also found out that I am right brained, my true  color is green (but the color of my aura is orange). My strongest Chakra is the  5th one (that&nbsp;governing truth and honesty).&nbsp;In my past life, I was a  dog named Scooter living in Iowa.My best quality is my independence...&nbsp;and  the INKBLOT test reveals my subconscious mind is driven by  curiosity.      &nbsp;    However, E-mode has CHANGED! This is very sad  because now it's focus appears not to be&nbsp;on providing quizzes for  the&nbsp;Egoist looking for ways to waste time, but&nbsp;on running an on-line  match-making service and on making money. A couple years ago, all these tests  were free... even the&nbsp;more rigorous ones (like the Briggs Myers inspired  ones etc). Now you only get the initial result free and have to pay for the  details... Paying for the results&nbsp;might seem to&nbsp;indicate that one  takes the results a little too seriously! So&nbsp; now I am on the lookout for  new quiz sites.       &nbsp;    Quizilla is the one I checked out today! I tried a  test to find out which movie I belong in... The surprise is that it is a movie I have  never even seen. But glad to know Jack's creative world fits my curiosity and imagination.       &nbsp;       Nightmare Before Christmas!    urlLink   What movie Do you Belong in?(many different outcomes!)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla   This site is okay, but I am going to keep looking  as I would like to find one that is a little slicker and has fewer typos. I  realize this&nbsp;reveals insidious things&nbsp;about my personality, but I  don't care. Anyway, if anyone can reccommend a god quiz site, please post a  comment. Thanks.                        Well, truth be told, I think weblogging is a little hokey! I thought I would try this in order to have a means of keeping a journal... a task I am supposed to do for my Master's degree... and a pursuit I have had on hold now for nearing 2 years. Now over half a year has passed since I made my last entry and NONE of the entries have been about what I am studying! I was excited by blogging only when I found out that html coding was easy enough even for me - self-proclaimed technophobe.   Well, anyway, here I am again. The problem is that I have absolutely nothing profound to offer. I can only offer recent thoughts. Although I am no longer trying to learn Serbian online, I was searching for information on history and the arts in Eastern Europe (after having lengthy conversations re: such with the Russian wife of an American diplomat). Instead I came upon a story of  urlLink Elizabeth Bathory , the Blood Queen of (what was then) Transylvania - a woman who believed the blood of young maidens was the secret to youth.  This was a timely discovery as the movie Van Helsing just opened in Taipei. Normally, I dislike violent movies, but I am always interested to see in which new direction they will take the story each time. I am given pause to wonder what Romanians and Hungarians and all those living near the Carpathians think about what stories Irish Author Bram Stoker and the American film industry have saddled them with.                       Well... It has been an interesting waste of time trying to figure out how other people manage to do the things they do on their weblogs. There was a former colleague who showed me how to post pictures... Then, a web-designer friend offered to show me how to make clickable picture thumbnails on a given webpage. Well, I started out trying to find cafes with free wireless internet for our first tutorial... (We went to one far away, but I now know that many cafes in the Shida area -incuding cafe Odeon - have wireless). We met and I discovered I was missing key software - a working version of Photoshop (mine was an expired trial version) and Fireworks. SO... I went to the mac shop to fix this and ended up buying more RAM, installing MORE software and updating my system to the newest spiffiest OS I have used yet! Mac OS 10.3.4  Now I have succeeded in inserting my first clickable thumbnail! Please click on the swimwear picture in the entry on shopping below... Then congratulate me!          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
