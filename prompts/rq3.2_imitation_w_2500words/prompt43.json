(AP) - A 6-year-old boy who rescued a playmate from a debris-filled swimming pool but couldn't get himself out of the water has died.   Donald Houser-Richerme had been hospitalized in critical condition since June 7, when rescue crews found his limp body in a half-empty pool at an apartment complex.   He died Monday, Police Chief Tim Baldermann said.   Donny had been exploring the area with his younger brother and a 5-year-old friend, Karah Moran, when they found the gate to the pool area unlocked and went in.    Karah either jumped or fell into the empty, shallow end of the pool, then slid on debris into the water gathered at the deep end. Though Donald couldn't swim, he jumped in after her and was able to push her to a ladder, family members said. But he couldn't save himself, and authorities said he was under water as long as 20 minutes.    ``That family has been through an awful lot this past week, and throughout the whole ordeal they've shown a lot of dignity, class and strength,'' Baldermann said.    Authorities said they would not file charges against the owner of the apartment complex after learning a maintenance man had cut the pool's lock.   THAT KID WAS SUCH A BADASS!!! dude i'd LOVE to go out saving someone, i mean i guess it's sad he didn't get to live life but he made more of an impact with his 6 years than 99% of people make with their 80+. i say there's nothing sad about that he went out like most of us would prefer to, having just pushed his friend to a ladder despite the fact that he himself couldn't swim, then after seeing his goal accomplished, his friend safe, he went. nothing wrong with that at all, i'm jealous of the little bastard     ok, i just got back from new orleans so naturally i'm not gonna mention my trip in this post. ok, allow me to briefly touch on a subject thats been bothering me for 9 months or so, most of you know leslie cook, we went out for a while and it pretty much consisted of me babysitting her, so now we've been broken up for a little while and (shockingly enough) she's gone back to all the crap she was doing before (and granted, on the rare occasion, during) our relationship. it just pisses me off because she's obviously hurting and stuff and she just doesn't seem to 'get it' x y and z is bad, don't do them, it shouldn't be that hard, i feel sorta bad because i left a rather harsh comment on her xanga (http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=starryeyes88) which i'll post here because it's my blog and i feel like it (i appologize for whatever if you find it offensive, except you leslie, you need to hear this stuff) once again leslie, you have proven to us all that without some1 directly supervising you, you turn into a drunken whore, and once agin, don't you find that a little sad? all your morals, everything you claim to stand for, to live for, it all goes out the window the first chance you get, i'm gonna make a magical prediction now, lets see if it comes true, you're gonna go to big stuf, think oh my god i've been so bad, be 'good' for a month (hahaha if you can make it that long, my guess is you can't go a week) then go back to being a drunken whore again, like i said lets see if it comes true, i do need to thank you tho, if i'm ever witnessing to someone who knows you you have provided the perfect example of a hippocrit and the very embodiment of everything thats wrong with modern christianity, thank you for giving my lord a bad name by claiming to be a christian then turning around a muttering a 'fuck you' or a 'pass the smirnoff' in the same breath, please either choose one or the other, i don't know how you can expect anyone to ever hold any sort of respect for you...    -garrett-  (yes the last part is in the comment)  so thats whats been up in the last 10 minutes of my life, i'll probably update tomorrow about n-town  adios      I live in a house with 99 other people. They keep bringing these gasoline-soaked rags into the house -- their rooms, the bathroom, the kitchen -- everywhere. I keep telling them, 'Really, this is a bad idea: One of these days these rags are going to catch on fire and burn the house down.' They laugh me off. 'We have been bringing these rags in for long before you were here. There was never any fire' they say. Personally, I try to keep my room as fireproof as possible, but I know that when the house catches on fire, I will die with the rest of them. I would move out, but there is nowhere else to go. Really, I have tried to explain the dangers, but I always get 'God would never let that happen,' or 'We should really bring in fewer rags each day,' or maybe, 'We can keep our gasoline-soaked rags in the bathroom, to make more room in the kitchen,' or even 'I hear that someone is working on some kind of special cloth that will prevent gasoline from igniting.' I say 'But think of the risks: we could all die.' I hear, 'Actually, statistically speaking, only 3/4 of us would die,' or 'I have studies household fires at NYU, and I disagree, statistics clearly show that the casualty rate is most likely to be 35%. While bringing in fewer rags per day or working on making the rags harmless are probably good things to try, somehow I just refuse to be comforted. And I just can't get over the feeling that arguing over how many of us will die is just a waste of time. Sometimes we argue over whether many little rags or fewer big rags is more to blame for the problem. Some have been convinced that gasoline soaked rags really are a problem, and we should switch to Alcohol-soaked rags. Others say alcohol is too expensive, really we should switch to diesel-soaked rags. This argument seems to take up a lot of interest. The idea that we might have to keep a constant number of flammable rags in the house is just to bizarre even to discuss, much less reducing the total number. This frustrates me to the point of just not wanting to talk about the issue anymore. Lately I have had this thought, though: There really are not that many rags lying around just yet. Maybe if there were a small fire, it would get everyone's attention. Maybe then, the other 99 people in my home would come together to fight the fire. The home would be damaged, maybe severely, but if we manage to get the fire out, it might really focus every one of us that we really, really need to stop bringing gasoline-soaked rags into the house. Problem is, I don't want to light any matches. If I do, I will surely be killed by my housemates. But there is this one guy who is really, really careless with matches. It's not that he is deliberately destructive, just accident prone, and more than willing to play with fire. Maybe if I convinced everyone that he is the guy who should be doing the cooking.... I hope you will all join me in voting for Bush this election.  -Jeff B.&nbsp;The Dalles, Oregon      I'm waiting to give you whatever the world may bring I'd give you my lifecause I don't own anything. It seemed like the bottom was all that I had until now I'd give you my life if you'd give me yours somehow.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -further seems forever, new years project &nbsp; gotta love it man, sarah and morgan randomly dropped by last night (i love it when people do that) we hung out on my porch for 45 minutes or so, they're about to come over again, we're gonna mellow out to some chill music, incense, and herbal relaxers, it'll be a kickin' good time, maybe we'll go thrifting too, who knows! &nbsp; mitch hedberg rocks, but after listening to him for an hour i started to talk/think like him: &nbsp; i got a nosebleed one time and i thought i just had red snot, i ran over to my friend and he was like nah man, ur nose is bleeding.......all right &nbsp; i could never work out but if i did i would do push-downs the whole time, i call them push downs instead of push ups cuz it's good for my self esteem, see i like to think that i'm the one staying still and i'm just so damn strong i'm moving the whole planet......all right &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      i love catcher in the rye, one of my favorite books, molly and rachel have gotten me onto reading out loud with people, so who wants to have some salinger read to them? i chilled with boda and his friend monica last night, or actually really early this morning if you wanna get technical... it was fun, we hung out on the playgroud, did a coloring book, watched infomercials and played candyland, i'm addicted to my white honeydew tea from harry's, there's&nbsp;nothing better in the world, i'm convinced. i can't go to curiosa because apparently my mom can't get back the money for 'destination unknown' at mb *cough*b.s.*cough* but whatever, that should be fun as well... the murcury rev is an amazing band, give them a czech, and if you haven't looked at those links i put on my last post PLEASE do. wanna know something i was thinking about earlier, it's this: how many of you have ever heard of darfur? probably not many, even though it's almost universally considered to be the worst humanitarian crisis on the planet, over 10 million people have been displaced and over 2 million have been killed by pro-government militia's attempting ethnic cleansing of the non-arab population, if bush was really against the arab's wouldn't he make this a HUGE deal and encourage sanctions/other political action like most other western nations have done? ironically enough FRANCE is the one carrying the torch for this one, but bush hasn't said a word, you could watch american news all day without hearing it mentioned once, but if you go to any international news source it's probably the first headline you see, why? sudan doesn't have any oil, therefor bush isn't interested, bush isn't a religious fanatic or anti-muslim, he's just a deuchebag who needs cheap oil. so yeah, thats what's been on my mind  DISARM THE JANJAWID MILITIA!!!      1st and foremost, werd to all my homieez. that aside let me recap the day: didn't sleep last night because my stomach felt like it was trying unsucessfully to turn itself inside out which left me tossing and turning from 1 am to 8:30 am, at which point my stomach accepted defeat and allowed me to sleep for four blissful hours. after i woke up i figured out how to play terrified of flight by 764-hero (a very good song/band, czech them out if u get a chance) on guitar, wrote some more reviews on amazon, went out to dinner with the family then went over to jenny fisher's house to hang out with sarah, it was fun we watched zoolander (which i hadn't ever seen) then went out to northpoint to visit fish's bf ryan (who despite it being their one year aniversary had to work!) so yeah after that we went back to morgan's house and sat around for a few minutes, after which i got picked up by the magical ride fairy and whisked back home, i'm probably gonna do something with the thundercat hoes that were born unicorns like a phony madman later...     destination unknown was amazing, nathan and i ruled the system, i don't feel like typing out why right now though, maybe tomorrow, i just got back from a hot date with sarah, i think i had more fun in those few hours than in the entire last week, i love just being with her it's kinda crazy.  we went and saw the village today, i really enjoyed it but sarah didn't, she was expecting ur basic scary movie and was therefor dissappointed when it didn't deliver, i was actually rather relieved it was more than that, it turned out to be more of an expertly filmed two-hour sociology project, which was just FINE by me, i LOVE movies like that and this one definetly fit the bill.  after that we went and had dinenr at chili's good times, then we went back to her house and watched big fish, yet another most excellent movie. i made the best drink ever and i have no idea what to call it/classify it as, the recipe is as follows:  ingredients: 2 banana's 2.5 cups frozen strawberries 3/4 cup vanilla yogurt 2 scoops vanilla icecream 1/4 cup orange juice  directions: blend on high till it's done  i think it was the best drink i've ever had/made, feel free to make it urself (i may have screwed up the ammounts, i never actually measure stuff, eyeballing is the way to go)  till next time -  G  arrett  \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
