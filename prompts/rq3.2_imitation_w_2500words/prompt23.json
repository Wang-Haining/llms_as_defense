  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic:\n\n    Only an artist can truly understand an artist.   Sure, outsiders can and do appreciate our finished product, whether that be a painting or a novel.  But when we are in the middle of creating, they just don't get it sometimes.   We often here complaints like, 'When do you think you'll be done,' as if what we do has time limits like a 9 to 5 gig.  Or, 'Why can't you do that later.'  All you artists out there, ever try to remember what ideas were on your mind hours before?  Never happen, and you may have just missed an incredibly important creative moment.  Who knows.  Or, '[Sigh], again?'  That's the guilt trip.    These complaints are not always in the form of words either.  Sometimes it's just a look that says it all.  But the lack of empathy outsiders have towards our art is not intentional.  It's just impossible for them to understand how relentless, yet fleeting creative juices can be.  They don't know what it's like to be woken up in the middle of the night by an idea that has to be put down on paper.  They take it personally when you are totally distracted during 'quality time' because you're just not satisfied with that last piece you rushed to finish in order to be with your significant other.    That's the paradox we have to live with.  You're damned if you take more creative time and interfere with the 'quality time.'  And you're creation is damned if you cheat the creative time for the benefit of the 'quality time.'  Artistry is a beautiful burden, and we are slaves to its sadism.  It's a love that burns icy hot because it provides a soothing escape from 'reality,' yet can only be shared once complete.    Of course, then we have the joyous pain of letting our love go ... until we fall in love with our next text.   urlLink SerialThriller.com       One fan is just as important as one million.   I thought I might share a special email interaction I had with a high school student from Pt. St. Lucie, Florida this past February.  Since she is a minor, I will refer to her as Spring.  Names within the emails have also been changed to protect the family's privacy.

St. Lucie, FL  34984-4720  In her final email to me (which I unfortunately can't locate because she sent it during my transition from New York and Massachusetts), I believe Spring mentioned that she received an A for the essay, was invited to deliver it in front of the class and was given special praise for the extra effort she put into the project.    So what is the moral of this story.  Sometimes, especially when you are in the middle of writing a story, it can feel kind of lonely because you are the only person aware of the world you are creating.  It can also be scary because, as much as one derives self-fulfillment from its completion, acceptance by the outside world is always a concern and you just don't know whether it will be there.  It's important to remember that writing is an art, an expression of yourself.  Just as in this case, you may find appreciation from the most unlikely places.  I am primarily an author of hard core horror (though I also dabble in drama), yet a teenager who is not yet allowed to even read my books found a way to make a connection that enriched both of our lifes, no matter how brief our interaction.  Let's take that to the next level.  When you publish a story, it cannot be unwritten.  You are now immortalized and, some might say, the book is more important than your own life because it will still be here long after you have returned to your maker.    So, I am convinced that if you stay true to yourself in your writing, reward will find you.  It might not be the monetary reward every new author dreams about, but that type of gain won't make you a better person, husband, wife, son, daughter or friend either.    Did I write this?   urlLink SerialThriller.com           From my perspective, here are our 3 options:  1.  Least Desirable  : Joint purchase of your land/house, we purchase the next with a line of credit a.I would be on the deed to your house/mortgage b.Donâ€™t know whether we would immediately be able to open a line of credit.  Probably not until additional equity is built up. c.So there may be a long delay as you mentioned before being able to make our next move.  2.  Next Least Desirable  : You purchase your land/house, we purchase investment land/house same time a.You would have to come up with $20K ($10K for each purchase) b.Your credit would have to allow you to qualify for 1 mortgage by yourself and 1 with me as a co-signer c.You would have to service 1 and 1/2 mortgages, although I would also d.Construction time would have to be divided among the projects, extending the timeframe for selling the investment property  3.  Most Desirable  : You delay purchasing your land/home, we first purchase investment land/house a.You only have one mortgage (1/2 really), which would cover the land, construction materials and labor costs (including yours) b.We would come out of our pockets for the principle/interest payments c.When we sell the property, we could take our original $20K investment out of the proceeds as well as principle/interest payments d.You would have the money back to do your own deal and we would have mad cash for the down payment on our next deal and also its principle/interest payments e.We would be in 100% profit mode               Trepidation versus Motivation.   I'm currently on page 63 (Chapter 18) of my rewrite of  urlLink The Duality of His Life  (44,500 words).  I just realized something last night.  As I mentioned in my Blog entitled 'So what is a novel anyway?' (Wed Apr 21), I started this rewrite by getting rid of the first half of the manuscript, which left a text containing 22,500 words.  My first thought was to do a simple edit, since the manuscript was largely finished before I hacked it up.  Writing another 7,500 words to get it to novel length seemed more than I was ready to do, given the option of publishing it as a strong short story.  trepidation.  So I got my pricing and started the edit.  As I moved forward, I realized that their were a lot of opportunities for improvement.  I guess the best way to explain my initial trepidation is that, after the completion of  urlLink Sanguine Fluid , I was left with the feeling that it would be very challenging to write something this good again.  But I got into the zone again with Duality and, before I knew it, I had crossed the 30,000 word mark and was just 4 chapters into the edit.  It was at this point I realized that I was actually rewriting the story, not simply editing it.  It deserved a rewrite and I was just the man to do it.  My motivation became self-fulfilling.    Then I reached my second point of trepidation.  I crossed 40,000 wordcount and took a good look a stab at what my ultimate goal should be.  Through calculations based on my previous experience I came up with 70,000 words.  This initially took me back, but last night I just looked at it as doing the same thing I had just done over the last several months again.  I added 22,000 valuable words and I just need another 22,000 to 26,000 more to reach my goal.  Again, since I'm only on page 63 of a manuscript that is presently 132 pages long (8 1/2 by 11), I have 50% of the story remaining to be rewritten.  This is exactly were I need to be.  And the bottom line is, my creativity transcends each book I write.  The only limits it has are those that I artificially introduce.     urlLink SerialThriller.com         Thought for the moment Monday.   'The road to success almost always involves a series of rejections, until you meet someone willing to champion your cause.' - Luther Vandross  The very reason for self-publishing my own books is because I don't feel anyone has the right to tell me whether my stories are worth being out on the 'shelves' or not.  But, let's face it, every author's ultimate goal is worldwide distribution and marketing through a major publishing house.  I don't think it's worth expending any energy worrying about if it will happen.  The question is, when will it happen?  The answer is, in time.   Take Steven King's situation for instance.  After finishing his university studies with a B.S. in English in the early 1970s, King took a job as an English teacher at Hampden Academy in Hampden, Maine.  He lived with his wife Tabitha and at least one child in a trailer. Making ends meet was sometimes difficult, and the money that came from his short stories, published mainly in men's magazines, was very useful. It was during this timeframe that King also developed a drinking problem that stayed with him for over a decade.   King also began a number of novels. One of them told the story of a young girl with psychic powers. Frustrated with it, he threw it into the trash. But later, he discovered that Tabitha had rescued it, encouraging him to finish it as Carrie.  He then sent it to a friend at Doubleday and more or less forgot about it. Some time later, he received an offer to buy it with a small $2,500 advance.  Years later, the paperback rights sold for $400,000.  Do you think King's potential was fully recognized when Doubleday offered him that anemic $2,500 advance?  Nope.  And there are plenty of other examples of authors who achieved publishing success after being met with publishing indifference.  So stay the course.   urlLink SerialThriller.com    \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
