I guess I haven't dated anyone seriously for awhile now, and it hasn't really been a big issue.  I'm not the type of girl who needs a guy around to feel happy or to feel good about myself.  I'd like to think that I hold my own ground pretty well.  But lately I've missed that closeness.  I miss that feeling of knowing that someone could be thinking about you at any point in the day.  And I miss that hovering feeling that makes me feel so safe.  So what's the problem??  It just doesn't seem like paths are connecting.  I met a boy who I was into and who I thought was kind of into me as well.  So I put myself out there, but it just doesn't seem to be going anywhere.  Maybe I read him wrong or maybe he's just not ready.  Who knows.  Then this guy at KF asks me out last week.  I'm sure any other girl would be thrilled.  He's super sweet, has a good job, and owns real estate.  But I just didn't feel it.  And maybe that's my problem.  I rely so much on my gut feeling or what I feel in my heart that I'm not thinking straight.   I'm not overly concerned about finding someone or in a big rush.  I'm quite confident that my someone will come along soon and want to share in adventures with me.  But hey, if you know of any cute, sushi-eatin, music-lovin kind of guys.. you can always send them my way.                                  I was cleaning out email (yup that's how exciting my day off has been thus far, besides doing massive loads of laundry).. when I came across the Amazing Race emails Christine & I (aka 2 Asian Flower 1st time backpackers) sent from Greece last year:  ... The bus from the Athens airport to city center was long and bumpy.  Christine looked ill during the ride and Cindy tried hard to block the sounds of the smooching French couple behind us.  By the time we arrived it was dark and after 8pm.  We managed to navigate our ways to the hotel we planned to stay at only to find they were full.  The guy directed us to another hotel and we had to bargain with a 10yr old kid over the price of the room, only to lose.  ... We arrived in Santorini and tried to find our bus into Perissa beach only to realized we had less than 1 euro between the 2 of us.  Thank goodness for ATM machines!    ... Our 'taxi ride' was arranged through a travel agency which was actually just a boy driving us with a rental car. He turned up the techno music and we were off cruising down the mountain side at breakneck speed. The driving lanes barely fit 2 lanes of cars, however, our driver decided that was more than enough room to pass not just a car but a bus at the same time around the blinded corners. The scenery of the cliffs and water was beautiful - when we were brave enough to open our eyes.   ... Our short stay in Pireus consisted of a few hours sitting in the metro station and a few hours sitting in a cafe having old Greek men watch us eat our sandwiches very slowly. Pireus was definitely a dirty, fishy smelling place and we were more than glad to get onto our 13 hour ferry ride to Rhodes. We watched a movie about this psycho girl who kills her grandmother, social workers & others, then we were ready to sleep.   ... We also took a daytrip to the city of Lindos and climbed to the top of the Acropolis admist piles of donkey dung. Afterwards we washed our feet in the beach trying to avoid looking at all the old, ugly topless sunbathers.   ... The ferry was much, much older (think rusted life boats) and a lot more dirty (think old, ratty, smelly bus seats with no air circulation). The atmosphere seem to coincide with the clientele of the ferry. It became apparent to us early on that the ferry was also being used to transport criminals. We noticed a couple of shady, toothless men smoking at the table in front of us, handcuffed together, while another man sitting a few seats back watched over them. Interestingly enough, we were keeping a more watchful eye on the 2 men and their movements than their handler who seemed more fascinated by his cell phone.   ... The next morning we started our ascent up the 950+ steps to the Palamidhi fortress. We though we were making pretty good time when we were passed by a quick footed, middle-aged couple, practically sprinting up the steps. The size of the fortress was astonishing and the view from the top of the entire city was amazing.   ... From Nafplio, we headed to Sparta, having another Amazing Race-like moment as we caught the connecting bus from Tripoli. Picture 8 backpackers of varying ages, speeding down the streets looking for the bus stop, thinking we only had 10 minutes to catch the connecting bus from Tripoli to Sparta. We ended up following each other in circles until we found the bus stop (which was actually just a cafe). Thank goodness for Greek Standard Time, as we ended up waiting an additional 30 minutes for the late bus.   ... The view of Athens from the top of the Acoprolis may have been much more memorable had it not been for the brown/grey 'blanket' of smog covering the entire city.   ... We've come to the conclusion that a) prices are a lot more expensive than we anticipated and/or suggested by the guidebooks apparently with the introduction of the Euro everything in Europe is more expensive; b) We have no bargaining power when we are hot and sweaty after walking around with our packs AND they know it! c) We were much more anxious to drop our bags off and go exploring than we were willing to walk around looking  for a place.   ... We didn't do too badly though in regards to our budgeting.  We actually ended up with a few Euro left at the end of the day (we won't mention our thrifty meals of fast food gyros, supermarket purchases of large cartons of juice...)   hee hee.. can't wait until the next travelling adventure!                                 The thought of cancer just terrifies me.  I can't think of anyone who's life hasn't been affected by cancer in one way or another.    I usually try to make a point of not connecting emotionally with my patients because I think I would just go mental thinking about them all the time, but there are some faces who are permanently etched in my mind.  One of my patients had osteosarcoma and was pregnant at the time she was admitted.  They gave her a prognosis of 6 months to live and yet she still had a smile on her face everytime I saw her.  I also think of this elderly Chinese man who was coming in for chemo three times a week.  He seemed like such a frail man, but you could see the determination in his face.  I just can't get the sounds of him retching out of my head.  A little closer to home, a good friend and a coworker, are both having investigations done next week for cancer.  The wait is driving me bonky and weighing heavily on my heart.  Please send warm thoughts and prayers their way.                                 Let me just start by saying I have the bestest friends.  You guys make me laugh, keep me sane, and drive me bonky all at the same time.    Saturday I had the chance to catch up with a friend I've known since grade school.  Still the same Jen.  Not that I'm against change, but it's comforting to know that there are some things from your childhood that haven't changed too much.  Thanks for the reminder about grade 8 graduation.  Picture 4 girls dressed in frilly poof dresses standing outside 7-11 waiting for our parents to pick us up after the grad dance.  A guy gets out of his car and goes '12 or 13?'.  We yell out proudly '14!'.  He looks at us strangely and just walks into the store.  It took us a bit to realize that he was asking if it was our grade 12 or grade 13 grad.  And to think we were so offended that he thought we were only 12 or 13 yrs old.  Definitely a winning moment in the life of Cindy.  Had fun crashing a friend's friend's party again.  Although I'm a bit disappointed this time..  no twister game!  But hearing the story about my favorite electrical engineer setting his kitchen on fire and having his dorm evacuated while he was trying to cook  instant noodles  well made up for that.  Remind me that when we make dinner plans - we go out for sushi.  Today we caught the play China Doll at the Tarragon.  I was pretty amazed by how powerful the production was.  I get shivers thinking about how painful and crippling foot binding was.  It's hard to imagine that women were subjected to this in order to achieve what society considered an ideal beauty trait.  But then again, that was hundreds and hundreds of years ago, and look what people are doing today in their quest for physical beauty - plastic surgery, breast implants, liposuction.  Maybe we haven't progressed that far really.  Thanks again everyone for the great weekend.  Feels like home.                                 Feeling so blah today.  I'm stuck at work and finally have a moment to get some food into me.  Still have a kazillion things to do before I leave today tho.  Yesterday was the KF demo and I thought I was good to go when I woke up in the morning.  My leg felt not too bad, just a bit wobbly now and then.  My KF instructor even taped and wrapped my leg up real well just in case.  But it ended up going funny again during practice, so I watched from the sidelines.  I know I should take better care of my body but it kinda took awhile to get that into my head.  I guess since I'm a generally healthy person, eat well, exercise, etc.. I always thought I was pretty invincible and that aches & pains will just go away.  Yeh, I'm just getting old.  I think if you were to graph my emotional status and spending habits, you'd notice quite the positive correlation.  I'm an emotional spender, and that's a bit dangerous at this point with this funk i'm in.  I've already gotten a new phone, booked a hair appt & pedicure for this week.. what next?  hmm.. anyone want to run away with me right now and go on a vacation!?                                 Like many girls, I love the fantasy aspect of weddings.  I know reality is a different story, but it never stopped me from watching The Wedding Story on TLC religiously in the past.  More & more I wonder tho if i'm really destined to get married.  Making that commitment to someone is a pretty big decision.  I mean it took me 15min the other day deciding what pattern socks to get at the GAP.  How do you really know that someone is the one?  And people change, it's a part of life and growing up.  I am definitely not the same person I used to be 5 years ago.  So how do you know what each other will be like 20 years from now?    I'm not a proponent of divorce but I'm also not against it.  It's reality and it happens.  People make wrong decisions in their life all the time and we learn.  So where is all this stemming from?!  I went to a bridal shower last week and have another one this week, so there's been a lot of wedding talk going around.  But more so, my friend asked why I wouldn't give this guy who's divorced a chance and I couldn't come up with a good reason.  Besides the fact, my family would have a cow over it, it just doesn't feel right.  Maybe it's the baggage.  We all have baggage to some degree but some people have heavier baggage than others and an ex-wife just seems like a lot of baggage.  But other than that, he's apparently a super nice guy, has a successful career, and knows how to treat a girl.    Quick poll:  Would you date someone who's divorced?                                 Taste of the Danforth was fun last night.. but it sure takes some skill trying to eat your food while squeezing your way through the massive crowds.  I wasn't sure if I was ready for Greek food again after last year's trip and eating gyros or souvlaki every single night, but I managed to eat.. quite a lot actually (1 skewer of pork, 1 skewer of grilled octopus, 1/2 roasted yam, 2 salmon maki).  Sunday already.. back to the grind tomorrow.  It really hasn't felt like summer this year yet.. not sure why.  And Sept is quietly creeping up.  I miss those days where summer seemed to last forever, as Bryan Adams puts it.  It's strange cuz there's still 24 hrs a day but it just feels like it's going by so much faster now.  This hasn't been a good summer for me either.  My mood is just everywhere.. some days i'm bouncing off the walls, other days I just can't shake the funk.  I'm trying to suck it up, but I can't stop thinking about all the things I could be doing without the gimp knee (i.e. last night, they were selling belly dancing skirts on the Danforth.. the ones that jingle.. and I so wished I could take more classes).  Then it's like a downward spiral, I get sad, then I start thinking about other things that make me even more sad... like things I don't have in my life and friends I haven't seen lately who's company I miss.  But I think i'm ready to get on with it now and stop this moping.  Let me focus on the things I do have and the things I can still do.. like taking a cooking course and enjoying the company of people who are still around and care.  I can do this.               \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
