And of course, seeing as how my life is pretty much stagnant, nothing much happened. Well, except for the stuff I'm gonna talk about now.  I finally completed the beta version of the tradenet website. Of course, this was after much dragging of both feet (well, waddaya expect?). Kept adding and improving it. Probably gonna register a domain and get the site up and running by the middle of january 04. The delay being attributed to a lack of funds, and a means of which to transfer it to the web hosting company. My partner is gonna get his credit card in january, so that's when we're gonna set up the site.  And how could I forget the other main thing that happened. I flunked accounting. Oh my god. I flunked. I guess I could see it coming, from the moment I got out of the exam hall after the paper, I pretty much knew. I just flunked with 47 outta 100. I dunno. Is it worse flunking knowing that you are so close to passing or worse is you flunked badly? I'm guessing the former. Well, just cos it's borderline, I put in an appeal to the course coordinator. Not hoping for much but at least there is hope.  On the borght side, I did get distinctions for law and economics. I suppose that if you like a course, youre more motivated to do well in it. But then , you'd like a course if you find it easy to understand. Hmm, a catch 22 situation.  Well, Gonna get the appeal result this week. Crossing my fingers there. Other than those things of note, nothing much has happened. Guess that's it for now. Till next time.                     Well, I have this afflication called shyness. Everytime I talk to strangers, especially to one of the opposite sex, I turn into jello. I can't think, I start to tremble and I basically just freeze up. It doesn't happen all the time nowadays but it happened today at the YEN meeting.  I had to tell genevieve that I hadn't receive the invitation to the club mailing list yet. I though I could do it without any trouble but I was obviously wrong. I suppose that I care too much about what others think of me and my personality and brain just shuts down. She was trying to be nice but I didn't react to her being nice to me very well at all. I hope I didn't look too much like a dweeb.  But I'm working on this problem. That's one of the main reason that I joined yen in the first place. That is, to force myself into situations where I would have no choice but to interact with strangers, especially those from the opposite gender. I mean, if I want to get anwhere in life, I can't do it on my own. It's not to bad with people whom I know well, but there is still that niggling fear inside of me. That's why I've never had the nerve to get into any relationship.  You have no idea how frustrating it is to want something so bad but are to god damned afraid to just reach out and get it. No matter what happens, I  WILL  overcome this  disability , if you will. And the only way to do that is through increased interaction.  The other problem I have is that of positive thinking which directly affects my motivation. I don't want to say it as it's too overused but its the truth. It's all my parents' fault. Especially my mom. She's just so negative ALL the time. It might seem unfillial (I'm not known for that) to say this but it's all to do with her society and upbringing. They aren't generally known for their achievements. Now she's passed it on to me. The only positive thing is that now that I'm aware of this shortcoming, I can work towards eliminating it. I Have to be smart about it.  Talked to the yen guy I met through darren. Damn. I can't recall his name. He's a total 'Adam Knoo' convert. It might be unwise to turn evangelical for anything but in this case it's a positive thing. he should know that fanatic behaviour has a knack of turning people off. But the thing is that he made me realise how negative in my thoughts I've been lately. How small I've been thinking. So negative I am disgusted with myself. I will stop using the word 'tyr' and use the word 'MUST'. It's amazing how much difference a word and thought makes in your life. So I MUST come up with a study and work schedule on sunday and I MUST follow through with that schedule. There! That's settled then. I paradigm shift in actions and thought.                     Well kings has gone and gotten himself a girlfriend. Well smack me silly and turn me inside out. Wouldn't have thought that would happen anytime soon. Goes to show how life can sometimes blindside you when you least expect it.  So there it is. My kemosabe in bachelorhood arms has deserted me. Can't say I blame him though. Except the reason for him to get together with this girl are rather suspect. I'll never be sure whether he got together with her just to prove to himself that he could get a girlfriend or that he is really sincerely into this girl. Only way to find out is to just ask him directly but that would just make our friendship take a weird turn. Oh well.   Don't know how long he'll be with her. Seems to me that this girl is the controlling type. Scolded him for playing pool with me the other weekend. Maybe it's because they're in the 'honeymoon' period of their relationship and she doesn't foeel secure enough with him to let him out of her sight (claws).   Or maybe I'm just over analysing things. Nah.   Bleah.                     Damn! Been a long while since I added any new entries (not that anyone would care of course) But hot damn! Lazy bones strikes again. Sometimes I wonder why I bothered to have a blog in the first place.  Well, it's the school holidays now. Finished the exams. I hope to pass all four papers but we all hope for good things don't we. Anyway, the accounts paper was a bust. Same feeling as the stats paper last semester. Probably gonna flunk accounts. But there's always a chance I'll pass eh. heck same thing happened to stats last sm and I passed that one.  So tomorrow, or I should say today, I'm gonna go down to the registry of companies and I'm gonna register a business partnership with kumar. It's been a long time coming I can tell you that much. Gonna call the new company 'Epac Trading Company' in honour of the earlier supposed but on hold partnership with the other two future partners for Entrepac. Well, see what happens tomorow then.  Oh and I'm working on tradenet now. Damn I  loathe  programming. But I gave my word that I'll do it and I don't like to break it. Though sometimes there  are  extenuating circumstances. heck, there's always an excuse to not do something eh.                     I just read this  urlLink article , specifically the section referring to the remarks made by  urlLink Bill Cosby . In it he talks about the culture of victimism in America.  This got me to think about the culture of victimism in the civilised world as we know it today. I get tired when I hear people blaming everything but themselves for their less than desired life situations. Or saying that it's meant to be.  In my humble opinion, unless you are mentally incapacitated, you and only yourself, are responsible for the life that you lead. There is no two ways about it.  What is the point of blaming everything for your troubles? Why not get off your @ss and do something about it? I'd like to think that I am doing so through actively taking actions that has a specific life goal in mind.   You can't go anywhere if you don't have anywhere that you want to go to. So I suppose the keys is that you should decide upon a goal that you want to strive towards. But it's not just goal setting that's important. It must be with a sense of discipline that you work to wards your goal with.  Though that by no means guarantees success, success cannot be achieved otherwise.                     Slept at 10 last night. That's something I haven't done in such a long time. I actually can't remember the last time I went to bed before midnight. There's just so many better things to do than sleep. It just seems like a wate of time. Guess it finnally caught up with me. Woke up at half past 11 the next morning. A good 13 1/2 hours of sleep. Funnily enough it wasn't as refreshing as I would have thought it would have been.  I could actually stay awake throughout the lecture today. Can't say the same thing about paying attention though. That's what getting enough Zs can do for you. I must study econ tomorrow. Yes. Must. That's the power of suggestion. Saying and thinkng it are two totally different things when you turn them into action.  Saying that you MUST instead of Saying that you will TRY. Now I know. So I MUST complete the first three topics tomorrow. Not that I've got any better things to do. Yes, I know it's ambitious considering my procrastinative past. But I MUST do it. After all, I am answering it MYSELF. And lying to yourself is far worse than lying to anyone else, wouldn't you agree?                     It's a week and a half till the next semester begins. Man, the holidays flew past in a blink of an eye, didn't they. This is probably the last holiday that I will have to just laze around and do pretty much nothing.  The next holiday, at the end of this year, I'll probably be busy with the DPP project (one big mother of a research project) and with the starting up of the tuition centre. The following holiday, during mid 2005, I'll be in Melbourne at RMIT, for most of that month.  So that doesn't leave much time for breathers in between. Phew! From here on out, it'll be one mad rush. And that's just the beginning of life then.  I look toward it with mixed feelings really. On one hand, it'll be great to be able to start earning my keep. But on the other hand, I don't want to leave the security of school so soon.  But time marches on. And there is nothing anyone can do about it. All I can do is to face it head on and hope that life doesn't chew me up and spit me out. But that's just being pessimistic. Remember the glass is half full!                     Well, i was just in one of my rhetoric moods just now. I was thinking of how sad it was that good friends can grow apart as you grow up.  You gain new perspectives as you grow and those might now be the same as your friends. Like you're in different realities. Sometimes you grow apart because of differeing views and sometimes it's because of circumstances. Some of which are not under your control but most of which that are.  Things like gaining a new idealogical beliefs, new social groups or just something as simple as getting a new job. Any of which can cause you to not make contact as often as you would like. I used to believe that it was their fault for not keeping in touch. But then i realized that I was as much at fault as anyone else in my life.  People walk in and walk out of your life. You can try to keep them from walking out but ultimately, it's their choice. Guess that's why you have to choose your friends carefully. But then again, if you are too guarded in your choices, you might be artificially restricting yourself. Ah the choices we all make.  I've had many good people in my life. It's sad to reminisce on the good times past as you know the chances of regaining those timeas are slim to none. So there's no use dwelling on them. But you don't want to discount their value in helping to shape you into the person that you are today. And yet, you don't want to let them hold you back from become the person that you're going to be tomorrow. Sigh.  This doesn't happen much when you're a teenager but it starts when you reach adulthood. You wish to be as carefree as you were then. Letting your parents worry for you. Reality was just for other people. You lived in a cocoon, in your own world.  Ah the good old days.         \n'''\n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
