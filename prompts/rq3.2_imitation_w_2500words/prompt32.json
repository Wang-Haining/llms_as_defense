Isn't it strange that in your life there are millions of other lives intertwined. It reminds me of the Jainas in India. They practice extreme measures of faith and live extremely aesthetically. They eat once a week and spend most of their days meditating. When they walk, they even sweep with a small broom the organisms in front of them as to not step on them. They believe this because on a person's body there are millions upon millions of cells and Jainas believe that each cell has it's own soul and is on the path to liberation (the highest form is humans). So the act of bathing, scratching, moving, etc is killing of souls and is violence. They are truly the only non-violent religion. At any rate, I have a wonderful view of this hillside with raspberries, trees, grass and flowers. As I looked into the menagerie of vegetation, I thought how only a thin piece of glass and a screen held me back from a world (for the most part) untouched by man's hands.   I have probably mentioned my analogy for life already, but I think it's worth noting. Life is like the hottest summer day. The only relief in sight is a semi-long walk to the seaside or pool... There are 2 kinds of people. Those people who will walk regardless of anything because they know what they want and will accomplish their goals. Then there are people who will sit inside or under a tree and wonder what could have been or criticize the others.     Everyone knows how anti-flakey people I am. I hate it when you make plans and someone keeps missing them. Okay, I know I suck at returning calls and stuff, but this is different. I know it sucks I had to cancel like 2 dates with Rob, but one I did go to LA to spend his lunch hour with him.. that was nice. I really really REALLY like him, but he doesn't think so and I don't know how to tell him and make this up to him.. I mean, for Pete's Sake, I stopped swearing like a sailor for him, 95% of the time... (Sorry Paul and Tom).. 5% are accidents and usually moreso in my head! So I shake a fist!  And today wasn't really my fault either. I am taking a horrible class Accounting 101, don't ask why its a long horrible story. The abridged Reader's Digest version is I need a C or better to go to UCR and I am sucking ass in this class. Who knew the anti-capitalist would have no sense for business huh?? But I digress. I got a tutor, one of my so called friends who just got his Masters in the damn field. And so, I have a huge test on Saturday (its online so there is no teaching) and I made 4 appointments with my tutor and yea, yesterday morning he tells me he can meet me that day at 1pm... I was more than peeved and vexed. So, I had thought I would be able to study with Scott (tutor) and be cool to see Rob a couple times... Until the fool hasn't shown, and this is the second test I am not prepared for. Then of course my older brother is visiting, and you know there is no end to 'brotherly council.' Okay, I am done, hopefully Rob will read this and get more of a gist for where I'm coming from... When someone is upset with me, I kind of clam up so he doesn't know this stuff...   On a brighter note, I decided that going to a public library to study is a bad idea. I kept people watching and they become characters in my story and yea... too much time was lapsing and I grabbed a book on Van Gogh and so, yea, school library in a cubicle (I don't stare at people our age as much as children and older folks.... not in a pervy way either.) If anyone wants to see what is going on with my random short story synthesis, let me know... Cheers mates!     Well, I had a wonderful time yesterday with a certain someone. I didn't think hanging out at parks and cursing malls could be so enjoyable.. It sure had been awhile. We hung out from 10am-about midnight and I still found it extremely difficult to leave... crazy kid, how'd he do it? I haven't the foggiest! But the views were breath-taking, the conversation delightful and the other stuff.... exclusive Hehehehe... Let's just put it this way, it's all down in history for sure! I do recommend seeing the view from the Oddessey resturant where ever it is. Hopefully, this is just a beginning of more fun times to come. I just have to try not to be a smart-ass all the time, curse, correct constantly (though he swears its cute), and I think I will let him win an arguement or two now and again. *wink wink*   ~*~*~*~Brief pause at recollection of yesterday*~*~*~  What in Sam Hell was I talking about now?? Ok, I guess we should get some philosophical mombo-jumbo out of the way, since that is why I have this crazy contraption! I told Rob last night that no one lives for the moment, and everything you do is in preparation for a tomorrow which is uncertain of us ever seeing it. No matter how you think you are living, its apparent that it cannot be for the moment. The simple task of eating is to sustain you for a future moment and life. Work is to get paid in the future. So if one was to merely live for today, he wouldn't eat or work or even use the restroom because they are a waste of time and prevent you from enjoying the 'now'. I stuck up this conversation with my fav. prof and he said 'Is God living for the moment?' and I replied, 'God is not subject to time and cannot live, since he created time and life. He is eternal and cannot have personifications.'  I stumped him and presented my hierarchy: Goodness (God has to be all good for most people) God Time Earth Man Each is subject to what is before it and dominated by what is after it. That's all for now. My dog is in a crate crying and its sooooo sad, My Poopie baby!!!!!!!      Let's see, what is there to talk about? I enjoyed making an executive decision, too bad Rob didn't dig it too much.. especially when I called him a despot.. but oh well. He said he thought me being indecisive was cute... I don't know about that, everyone else thinks its annoying.  We had discussed religion and he doesn't buy into religion. Well, I remember at one point being an atheist.. but upon reflection I had discovered I was an atheist out of spite. Things happened that I didn't like, and bad things are perpetually happening to good people so why believe? Well, as logical as it may have been to me at the time; that theory did not hold up. Francis Bacon once said something like, 'A novice in philosophy rejects God, but an expert returns to Him.' I am not by any measure saying I am an expert. All I am saying is that, its harder to prove his existence than to be another great american skeptic. But I have been fiddling with a few possibilities. One, that man is innately good and does bad things (these bad things don't make him bad. There is a separation betwix act and man.) Or bad things happen to everyone equally just in different times, stages and ways, so no one is above this dealing. Thirdly, as Mia Farrow says, 'Life is about losing, and doing it as gracefully as possible.' Just as I said, no man can escape time, no one can escape a bit of bad luck and misfortune, and I would not want to. Granted I am super pessimistic anyway, but these things which seem to paralyze us for multiple moments and what makes us us. I do not think my life was at all as bad as some of my associates, though through different eyes I would see why other's would think it. And no matter how much pain is there, why wish something that made me whom I am today disappear, or block it out of memory?  I am resolute that things are not as bad as I make them out to seem, though I hate it when I am having my 'Pity Party, Table for One' moment, and someone interjects to tell me that. I want to experience all aspects of life. The good with the bad. Besides, there is can't be a rainbow without the storm, the light without the darkness, the joy without pain and the life without death. There are enough     Momentomori in life, without Rob reminding me of them.        Well as usual, when it rains it pours. I mistakenly told my mom that I would probably be working full time when I get to UCR and she flipped out. She thought almost everything was taken care of and I told her it would have been, but I opted not to use the parent loan of about $8,000. She reminded me of all the lovely things she hates about me comparing me to my brothers and various other people she usually loathes, but now wishs she had them instead. Then of course, she had to remind me of what a disappointment I am and how she has been calculating how much she has spent on me during the past years, and all the times I helped oput (which was every paycheck since I began working) would never amount to the debt and how she wishes she hadn't because I am not worth it again. She has told me that she refuses any help, money, even her name or signature. She also said, no matter what happens to me when I get out of this house she won't give a flying *bleep* because it doesn't matter to her anymore. That was my fun filled morning. Hmm... why do I keep getting depressed?????     Perhaps its the achy body from improper sleep talking, but I started thinking about the artists. Those back in the age of the Renaissance, particualrly. Those men and imexpressable talent and their works have withstood the test of time. Shakespeare, Milton, Homer, Lord Byron, Emily Dickenson, etc. So it begs the question to be asked. Undoubtedly, there are some people who's talent is no great that it is a tower and an immeasurable ruler to compare others by. But is there an artistic part in everyone? Somepeople (me for sure)would kill to be able to paint or draw. We love the work so much that to be able to contribute to society in that way would fill us with the most happiness... But alas, I can draw only cartoons, and I doubt the Louve will ever want a characature of my 10th grade Chemistry professor on its walls, next to greats. So I an a faithful patron at museums and try to live vicariously throuhg the works of those who suffered and gave their lives for their art. So that it wasn't in vain!  I was having a pretty yucky day a few days/weeks ago and I saw Rob, and he got me some Godiva chocolates... but of course it was 94 degrees so it melted... but the gesture was sweeter than the candy. We have been having some tough times... fighting a lot.. but we have been working through it and I think things will be ok. I know my moods can be a little annoying at times, but I think the way I make people feel when I am in a better mood more than makes up for it.. I hate to toot my own horn but BEEP BEEP! Thnaks hunny! I miss you... though I don't say it often enough for ya!     Things just have a habit of going from bad to worse. As a friend once told me, when you think you have hit rock bottom, the floor gives out on you. But oh well, I'd say I have my health, but I'm not feeling well. I'd say I have my friends, but I am just not going there... I have most of my friends and I thank God for them. And I will leave family and school out of this. At any rate, here is an exerp from a story I'm working on.  Please tell me the good and bad parts.   She was in a frenzy to get away from everyone she could. It pained her to be around anyone, even to be seen. She always felt alone, and that was this was the climax of her moments. But now, she craved to stay alone but couldn't. She tried to stop crying, the tears wouldn't. She tried to calm down, her heart told her it shouldn't. He kept following her and she tried to get him to stop. Finally, she gave in. She warned him about her moods and that he didn't want to be around. He replied he wanted to be there for her and she said she didn't. Then in a flash, it seemed like he knew she would hurt him more than ever, and he told her he would see her later. This broke her broken heart further. She thought he didn't care even when he said he did, and now it seemed absolute that he didn't. She had no right to be further upset, but she desperately wanted to believe him and only him. She wanted him to make everything all right, to take her in his arms and calm her. Now, she was devastated. As he turned and walked away, she stared in disbelief. Just as he turned back, she left. Resolute not to give in to anyone; to stay with her emotions alone. She was the only one here now. She is all she knows; she is the shroud of mystery, to herself especially.     '   She walked a ways, and it seemed that she couldn't remember where she was , or where she was going. She finally sat down on the street corner. Her eyes moved up the street to an unusual figure. A woman across the lane holding her child. The brown hair interlocked in the rough hard hands of the mother. The face was scrunched against her chest with his eyes closed as if he were in a deep sleep. But this looked strange, the mother was not singing a lullaby. She was screaming frantically and at the top of her lungs and shaking. Her voice and body shook violently as her tear stained face showed the rawest of pain. The sights and sounds sent chills up and down the spines of everyone within an earshot range.   Who would dare to go near this grieving mother? There was a helpless hopelessness in the abundant in the air this evening, and it seemed to foretell of the season to follow.
