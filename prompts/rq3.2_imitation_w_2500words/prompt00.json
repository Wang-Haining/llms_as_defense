They're so cute I can't stand it. Anyhew, they are eight week old  Golden Retriever/ Lab  mix puppies, a boy and a girl, and extremely friendly, playful, etc. At the moment, they are sleeping so I get a break, which is good seeing as Nick and I stayed up until 3 last night haggling over their names and watching episodes from the first season of Gilmore Girls on DVD.   I guess this makes up for the fact that I did not get to go to Florida after all, seeing as Ms. Beverly is still not feeling so well. I'm still going to Texas on Sunday, and really wish that I could bring the puppies with me, seeing as Nick doesn't really seem to care about them that much. However, I will have a 4 year old and 11 month old to look after, so the puppies will have to wait til I get home.   I missed an appointment with nice psychologist lady today...  grr ... Mom told them I am out of the country and told me not to pick up the phone anymore haha.   Nick and I still haven't decided on names yet for the dogs. We've settled on Luke and Lorelai, but Cody and Cassie are still cute names. Nick kept wanting Shrek and Fiona- I refuse to name such a cute puppy after an ogre.  Won't do it . He also tried 'Hercules.'  Oy.    Morgan got to sing for Kallen Esperian today. I'm jealous. My voice has disappeared to some foreign place and will probably never return again. Perhaps it travelled to Australia.. oooo ...I want to run away to there...  who's with me?  Mike's sister went to a rave and told me I should go to one... HAHAHA.   If anyone can think of a cute pair of names, please post them. Oh and you are more than welcome to come out and see them in the next few days, should you wish.   Today is the first anniversary of the microburst that occurred last year. It is also Madame Quinn's birthday.  Bonne anniversaire, Madame!    Any word on Saturday, kids? :) Please please please!!! Kate Camille saw Brad....  oooo ...                      All hail the return of the Governor's School kids! I am so very excited and have missed them terribly: Katie Camille, Morgan, Eric, Rachel,  EVERYONE! YAY!  I'm sure they all had a fabulous time. Morgan was apparently the choir slut.  Hehe . I saw Eric today which was glorious and he told me that he is directing Barefoot in the Park this year.  Lovely.  I am going to be doing the cabaret and it will great, simple, elegant fun.  I gave Miles a ton of the paperbacks which Mom and I read. She is reading The Notebook as I type this, most likely off of the sugar high from the  insanely lethal cookies  we had today. She and Xander and I had a grand time dancing to her mix in the car. Poor Xander didn't get to steal it though.  Sad.  Perhaps I'll steal it first.     We sit here Silently Watching the ducks  And eating mystery meat   We wait here  Lying  In a dandelion ring Tossing toothpicks in the air  We dance here  Serving  In a sea of comedy  With words we've never heard  We help here  Smiling Seeing it clearly A group of good hearts and minds  We laugh here  Waiting  Random anticipation  Falling over onto gravel   We love here  Reeling  Day like no other And the dandelions sing...                      It seems a lot of people have been incredibly lax on posting. However, I can fully understand seeing as we have all procrastinated. Yes, senior year is about to start.  God help us all.  But I do believe it will be fun. :) And stressful.  I took senior pictures yesterday and managed to have major panic attack beforehand. I thought I looked really, really bad. Once I got into the studio though, I must say Billy Ross is a god. And made me feel beautiful. Hurrah for nice people. And hurrah for the Torrid dress which made us all laugh cause it is so very  loud . 'I'm sorry... beauty makes me fog up.'  My question for this post is, why must money govern almost everything that we do? I feel like my life has turned into a Mastercard commercial, where they tell the price of things and then say something such as ' Spending time with an old friend... priceless .' Rawr.  But at the same time, amidst the financial woes which face us all, I am excited  beyond belief ... excited about initiation, cabaret,  Tempest ,  Cinderella ,  Dear Edwina , working the Voices of the South shows, prom, and figuring out where I am going to go for the next four years. It's amazing how everything has happened so quickly. This summer has been insane.  But good.   Must dash away to the land of the boonies. Mom put an ad in the paper about selling the goats and some lady is coming to possibly steal a few away this afternoon. I'll miss those little guys. Even the one that never stops calling. I didn't think I would miss them, but I already do. However, I have Cody and Casey to think of, and must go outside to keep them from ripping each other apart out of boredom. aeklrjgaleg  they are so CUTE!   Recommendation for the day: Look at the stars. If you wish, come out to my house and look at the stars.  They're beautiful.  Oh and get some TCBY. Yum.   'Et toi, tu auras les etoiles comme personne n'a...' - Le Petit Prince    Translation: And you, you will have the stars like no one else has. - The Little Prince      Je t'aime. Don't get too stressed out.                       Bonne anniversaire à toi  Bonne anniversaire à toi  Bonne anniversaire mon ami  Bonne anniversaire à toi    For those of you who do not speak French, that was 'Happy Birthday.' Too bad the dinner hasn't worked out yet. Maybe someday, huh? I hope you had a good birthday. And you may have the first Shrek CD but I am getting the Shrek 2 CD for you somehow so we can blare 'Hero.' I saw interviews from it the other day and it made me remember how funny it is all over again.    Next movie recommendation:   The Terminal . Very, very good movie. A bit long, but overall very cute. However, if you have not seen  In America , I will drag you out of whatever location you are in and place you in front of a TV with a DVD player so that you can see it and love it.   Muhaha  . My evil plan for the world- to make everyone watch a movie about a poor Irish family in Hell's Kitchen, New York.    ANNOUNCEMENT:  My favorite band of all time, Five for Fighting, can now be played on my blog. It doesn't come in very well as of yet, but it will be perfect bait for you to go out and buy  The Battle for Everything , their newest CD. Or you can get  America Town , the CD which features 'Superman' or  Message from Albert... , their first CD. I got their autographs when they came to Memphis when I was 14. OMG it was amazing as well as my first concert. So, in order to show the genius of John Ondrasik's lyrics, here is the chorus of 'If God Made You.'    Sunset sailing on April skies Bloodshot fire clouds in her eyes I can't say what I might believe  But if God made you he's in love with me   Happy Birthday, mon ami.                      If you haven't already, read the last post so you can see the amazing work of David Thewlis. It's really quite cool. I didn't want to put his poem on my blog because then someone would come after me for not asking permission. I checked, and my blog can be accessed through Google.  Yikes.    So, for those of you who have not yet talked to Miles, 1) do so immediately because she is an  amazing person , and 2) do so immediately because she has happy news. In honor of this happy news, I have written a poem (which is now Miles' away message... a great honor). Miles has approved my posting this, btw.    For... certain people... A Vision Without Shoes   It's been a time for the two of us  A time of separation But somehow, someday, there will be  A new time for celebration  I think these thoughts out of my window  As I ponder in shades of blue  And somehow you appear to me  A vision without shoes  You run away romantic-like  Cause you wish to see me now  You walk way longer than expected My house is three miles out  I hold these dreams so quietly  As so many people do And somehow you appear to me  A vision without shoes  I pull my door back hoping, thinking And all I can do is stare For my blue thoughts and dreams I guess Have somehow brought you here   I stand with fixed espression Til I get the urge to move  I move without a second thought  To hug my vision without shoes  Somehow I know this is temporary  Our day will come, it's true But now we remain here in this moment And you're a vision without shoes.    Leave comments everywhere!  I adore feeling loved. Like...  Miles: i love it Miles: love love love it Miles: itll be my away message.   My work here is done.  Sleep time now.                      Okay- you know how they say that everything is bigger in Texas? That totally counts with food. After flying down here and being one of the only people on the flight who spoke English, Paul took me to this restaurant called Chipolte's where you can order these burritos. But they're not like Taco Bell/Hell burritos... these are like 'YOU WANT A PIECE OF ME PUNK?' burritos. They are  massive . I think I ate like a fourth of it. *falls over from spicy-ness*   Kelly and I are going to go out to California Pizza Kitchen... ooo love. Stephanie's not in town yet but apparently she is on the Atkins diet now. She's tiny. Rawr.&nbsp;And OMG Grace is the cutest thing I have ever seen and loves my cell phone rings. Oddly enough, it is cooler down here than it is in Memphis. Muhahaha. Apparently Doris yelled at the MTAM kids today. I'll come next week! Silly disappearing Doris.   Just&nbsp;for the record, this comes from the most insane case of writers' block I've ever had, while&nbsp;also watching a four year old cousin and making sure nothing crashes on her head. Well, actually a glass shelf panel just&nbsp;crashed so this could take a while longer...&nbsp;&nbsp;    Let us lie here on the green    In our minds let's run away    To a world of simple ecstacy    On a not so distant day    Let your fingers travel down my back    Tracing down my spine    Let the spinning objects govern us    And dismiss any lost time    Naive I was and may well be    But I know how to feel    And as we stay up on the table    I question if it's real    Don't leave me here alone yet    For we still have yet to dance    As a magic tiny number    Brings about a strange, sweet chance    It's&nbsp;funny how time can govern    Such an act I've never known    Can we dismiss the seconds    And just simply let go?    I shiver at a new sensation    Want to pull you close to me    Doesn't matter where we've been or are    All I want is just to be    In this moment, in this place    Of new friends and circumstance    Let the walls come down between us    For a different type of dance    I promise I will never break    Your heart, and I don't fear    That you will ever, ever&nbsp;try    To tear me down, my dear    Sternum right&nbsp;down to the small    We'll travel down, a pair    I will be a euphoric version    Just as long as you are there    I wonder if it's possible    To miss you until it hurts    But for now you can&nbsp;remain here    And I will withstand the worst    Who knows where we have been before    Or where our future lies    For now I will just simply tell you    This has been a magic night.     &nbsp;  I'm sorry it rhymes-&nbsp;I couldn't help myself.   Listening to: Trace,  More Than This     Tu me manques.                         AAAHHH  I remembered the words to Morgan's and my song! Blast from the past...   Never thought it could    Happen to me yet    In this moment all my fears are gone    Trying to forget    The way I felt before    I have found you I don't need much more      Oh please let this moment last til forever   Let's just stay...      In this moment    Everything's changed in my life   In this magic    My world is now in your eyes       Standing here with you    Feel so different now    Can't remember what just happened cause    You are what I've searched for    My life's now complete    I hope you know    Just what you mean to me      Oh please let this moment last til forever   Let's just stay       In this moment    Everything's changed in my life    In this magic   My world is now in your eyes      Is this really real    Or is it just a dream   I don't care   I know I'm here right now   The past just flies away   The truth is all so clear   From this moment    You're all I hold dear       Oh please let this moment last til forever   Let's just stay       In this moment    Everything's changed in my life   In this magic   My world is now in your eyes       Repeat, End...     Lovely long day today, however, I am too tired to explain myself. Recommendations for today are Catwoman, The Bourne Supremacy, and Studio Movie Grill theatres. Gods, I tell you. Oh and I almost got into a car wreck... but that's another story.  Last night here...  sad.  :( God, I'm going to miss these guys. We're currently watching three of the most hyperactive kids I've ever met, who have destroyed  every room  except mine in this house. Kelly just gave me a copy of Aladdin the book in French.  YAY !   You're home!  And it's happy! I can't wait to see you.  Je t'adore, mon ami.           \n'''\n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
