RIDICULOUS. this definitely makes them hotter than the  urlLink liars  right now.   im not sure how i feel about jarvis cockers  urlLink relaxed muscle  project yet. if noel gallagher says attempts at avant garde'ness are needless, then THEY ARE NEEDLESS. either way, we need the sexy jc back, not the idiotic deranged misfits costume bullshit.                                you know what? im just going to get this out now. I LOVE HIPSTERS. SERIOUSLY. a hipsters life is seriously the source of oh so much hilarity! hello nyc! meg! jasmine! you know how it is! either way this is the best and funniest thing i've read in a while. this is a story about..get this... urlLink FRIENDSTER ! aimee now has the floor. ps i love aimee.  urlLink  CLICK CLICK   anyway someone explain to me the hype surrounding  urlLink tv on the radio  cause im not feeling it yet.. have they even written a song about nyc yet? everyone knows if you're living/from there you HAVE to write about nyc. interpol and the strokes did and look where they are now?  duhhhh     thora birch looking hot for the first time in her life? now everyone scatter to your american beauty dvd for the full on nudity scene! ps she was 16 while the film was shot? how did that even pan out?   tigre benvie! why oh why did you leave montreals' indie pop icons  urlLink the dears ? oooh scandalous not really. i guess hes going to school in toronto or something. not really. though i want to remind everyone that he was in the seminal canadian rock band THRUSH HERMIT! you'd also be able to hear him on the first  urlLink joel plaskett  record. im pretty sure being within 5 feet of joel plaskett for even a few mere moments makes you a genius. word to awkward alliteration. either way check out benvies  urlLink new project  whenever it actually stirs up.   if you havent already, watch  urlLink the rapture - house of jealous lovers video . good luck. i have no idea how anyone could possibly stay still during this song.                               hi my name is steve lam. im canadian and this is my music blog. NO, THAT IS NOT YOUR SIGNAL TO BOLT. i mean i know stuff! canada has *some* cred! paul anka put this town on the map! mad tv wouldnt be funny at all were it not for alanis morrissette bashings! and what actually sold the robin hood: prince of thieves soundtrack? why, bryan adams of course. i mean who cares if one of the  urlLink most important bands in the world  hates him.  anyway yah. this is most likely going to be your typical wannabe nyc blog. im sure i'll end up writing superfluous amounts of praise for  urlLink stellarstarr*  and  urlLink the stills , anger a few (re: wazillion) kids with my complete disdain for interpol, and all the while keeping the maple leaf/beavers/igloos/whatevs in mind by bringing you the latest news from canadian gems ala  urlLink destroyer ,  urlLink broken social scene ,  urlLink the sick lipstick , etc etc etc. who knows, maybe even the asian in me will whip out some hot  urlLink jay chow  gossip.   for now though, tim delaughter i love you. i dont care that you fronted for  urlLink tripping daisy . though i will admit 'i am an elastic firecracker' was on constant rotation when i first got it in like...1995? even so, puddle of mud ripped off your songs. i mean ewww. (GOD HELLO? 'she hates me' IS 'i got a girl'. EXACTLY). labels constantly drop your bands. when things are starting to look up, your band members OD and die. yet you come back with full on genius in the name of  urlLink the polyphonic spree ! unless you're not even alive im sure you've all heard of this band by now. but seriously CHECK THEM OUT IF YOU HAVENT. also, someone drive me to one of their double toronto shows on sept 29 or 30th!   urlLink whats worse than a terrorist? a child molesting terrorist   listening to:  urlLink the watchers  - two worlds                                  for those of you who've absolutely no idea whats going on ever, the strokes have been appearing weekly every tuesday this month on conan. im assuming they're going to finish off with 12:51 but where was THIS END HAS NO END? gaaaah. in case you missed them you can download each performance here (whatever happened/reptilia/under control):   urlLink thestrokesfan.com   yah so i dont really see why anyone would bother reading this blog. i talk about/bash all these nyc bands despite the fact that i dont even live in the same country! there are plenty others much more firsthand and informative than my sporadic babbling but whatevs i guess. i think im going to have to find some HOOK or 'thing' that i and only i do and write about. suggestions would be awesome. t'was my birthday last week and im too old to come up with anything fresh anymore. also complete and utter laziness ad infinitum. until then, boring nyc-wannabe blog it is! eat it.  ps thanks giulia/ urlLink new york doll  for the sweet mention!  listening to: talking heads - mr jones                               i cant shut up about marcus schmickler aka  urlLink pluramon . all i can think about when listening to  dreams top rock  (his other albums are all over the place in terms of genre ranging from IDM (yah yah thats like saying 'emo' whatevs blahbablh) and electronica) is MY BLOODY VALENTINE!!! if  loveless  was responsible for inspiring a wazillion shoddy shoegaze bands (the more i listen to  urlLink my vitriol  the more grossed out i get? i dont know i used to love them!) then it should also be noted that at least one sweet follow-up (AKA THE ALBUM IM TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW) came out in the aftermath.     julie cruises vocals (aka the roadhouse singer from TWIN PEAKS) remind me of a cleaned up  urlLink stina nordenstam , and although not nearly as eery and threatening as belinda butcher, her vocals are just so PERFECT. meanwhile pluramon has the whole kevin shields guitar sound down pat. i am writing like a giddy schoolgirl right now.   DOWNLOAD THIS PLURAMON TRACK NOW. its totally mbv's 'touch my breath' & 'loomer' combined.   urlLink pluramon - hello shadow                                   i just hurriedly scuddled home from the  urlLink broken social scene  /  urlLink metric  /  urlLink stars  show tonight. living in this city together with my dumbass taste in music, this was probably the third or fourth show i've gone to all year?   my sleeping patterns lately have been completely fucked, leaving me to wake up today at approximately 4:48 in such a light-headed daze i couldnt even tell if it was in the a.m or p.m. it ended up being the latter and so i completely missed  urlLink stars ' set. gahh. im sure they had fit into the set effortlessly as for those unaware, this montreal band (though originally from the nyc/williamsburg area but moved away from that scene. they roomed with one of the yeah yeah yeah's before the yeah yeah yeahs came into existence. uh wowwwww) is a fine mix between broken social scenes quieter moments and metric/emily haine's vocals. it might also have had something to do with the fact that every band tonight shared at least two members from the other bands that played.   the show was at a new venue in town that i've never been to before. somehow the place churned out the worst crowd i've ever seen in this city? jocks were ridiculously abundant, spewing out heckles you'd hear at a staind concert.  jesus christ they could have at least stuck with the 'less talk more rock' line? whatevssss. i overheard a group discussing how they were going to 'fuck shit up and mosh'. thankfully no one actually 'threw down', but apparently thats exactly what happened at the last hot hot heat show a few days prior? its time like that when this beautiful city is just a huge embarassment. i've no idea whats wrong with this place? its definitely not a canadian thing when toronto and montreal are churning out amazing bands lately while ottawa is just stuck as a frat rock haven. im off to nyc soon enough. WAIT FOR IT.   anyway back to the show. i had just arrived in time to catch metric as they opened with what i guess you could consider their single, 'IOU'. the lovely emily haines (imagine  urlLink weeping tiles ' sarah harmer crossed with uma thurman) danced and strutted around the stage as if she had no idea she was in a mini-skirt. the first half of their set was kinda weak, but it all turned around half way in as they finally closed with 'dead disco'. definitely one of their better songs but i was just glad they played 'the list' !   next, broken social scene came onto stage triumphantly with glass tiger as their entrance music! how glorious. the band was charming as their music was absolutely captivating. i've been spinning 'you forgot it in people' for over a year and a half now with prospects of seeing them forever so you can imagine the hype i demanded of them as a live band. everything they played, from 'kc accidental' to 'cause=time' to one of the best songs to come out in a while 'anthems for a seventeen year old girl'(featuring emily haines on vocals ahh!), came out so flawlessly and with such power i nearly lost it for every song. the only problem i had with their set was the fact that they played for almost 2 hours and and i was ready to keel at any time. the latter portion of their set was filled with a bunch of not-so-wonderful cover songs and was hindering the roll they were on. oh well...i still stick to my rule that no band really needs to play more than fourty seven minutes live. and thats a calculated fact. uhhh kinda. ok not really. but yah i'd seriously almost lost my faith in live music until tonight. they finally ended off with 'im still your fag'.    and with that, this 'fag' is off!                               JUST GOT BACK FROM MACROCK WEEKEND. despite the four million bands playing i think i only bothered to watch two or three? there was a point in the evening where i thought i was just going to give up watching live bands altogether until  urlLink plus/minus  and  urlLink mates of state  got on stage. both were phenomenal. can you believe the two members of mates of state are married and preggers AND still touring? its like  urlLink julie doiron  but waaaay cooler and less french.   lots of hang outs with some awesome kids sewn throughout the plethora of post-macrock afterparties! my new best friend forevs DANA and i were discussing nyc bands and i was reminded of  urlLink prosaics !!! i remember checking out their page a while ago listening to their short ass sound clips of joy division/new order'esque  urlLink failure  and instantly fell in love. its seriously ian curtis reincarnated. heres a full track of TEETH even though i dont think its their best track...NONETHELESS CLICK CLICK HERE ->  urlLink prosaics - teeth   i think im off to see the  urlLink JEWKNEECORNS  tonight. though im tired and may just stay in to celebrate/jack off to UNICORNS  urlLink UNI-PORN .                                  COMPLETELY UNRELATED NON MUSIC POST.   i think when most ppl go to nyc and know whats up they try to hit up all the hot spots before they get old and shitty. i should have gone to  urlLink misshapes  or something completely 'buzz' like that but NOPE. AS FOR ME, i just spent a whole day in manhattan trying to find a fitting pair of  urlLink levi's 518 junior womens jeans  with no luck whatsoever. i am awesome. seriously though is there no actual conversion from mens to womens sizes? ppl who work in clothing stores are worst than radio shack employees. THEY DONT KNOW ANYTHING EVER. i have a 30' waist. all i know is that size 11 in girly girl size is much too big for me. HELP ME OUT HERE!  anyway i'll be gone for a few more weeks. im stuck in dirty new jersey right now but i'll be all the way over in california in the next little while. please dont ask me why. im trying to think of any tidbits of blubbery i can drop here. we all know that  urlLink daft punk are remixing franz ferdinands' take me out . well guess what? they're also doing a  urlLink death from above  tune. i dont know which yet but i guess it wouldn't really matter cause most of their songs sound the same. they're still awesome nonetheless.   you know who knows whats up?  urlLink giulia  knows whats up. we both say keep listening to  urlLink film school !  urlLink click              \n'''\n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
