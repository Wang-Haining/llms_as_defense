And everytime I try to fly I fall without my wings I feel so small I guess I need you baby And everytime I see you in my dreams I see your face, it's haunting me I guess I need you baby  I make believe That you are here It's the only way I see clear What have I done You seem to move on easy  And everytime I try to fly I fall without my wings I feel so small I guess I need you baby And everytime I see you in my dreams I see your face, it's haunting me I guess I need you baby  I may have made it rain Please forgive me My weakness caused you pain And this song is my sorry  Ohhhh  At night I pray That soon your face Will fade away  And everytime I try to fly I fall without my wings I feel so small I guess I need you baby And everytime I see you in my dreams I see your face, it's haunting me I guess I need you baby  After all... After all...                              im always forgetting things. i was going to blog about something but now i cant remember. i was thinking about it yesterday and how it'd be a good thing to write about but its now today and i cant remember. sometimes i just dont pay close attention to things to remember and sometimes i truly just forget completely. today lindsay wanted me to get her a pop b/c i was going down to get myself one and i was walking along then my mind wandered off then i saw beth and i was like '..im spose to tell you something about kelsey and a pop...' see kelsey asked me to tell beth something about her pop if i saw and i saw beth but yeah. so anyways i continue my to the vending machines, i get there and get my pop then i cant remember what im spose to get lindsay so i walk clear back down to the french room to ask her again what i was spose to get her. i felt so stupid. and see i guess there really isnt any excuse for me forgetting about what kelsey told me....anywho if i remember i'll write.  breaking news  my grandpa is going to a nursing home! i have to go see whats goin on.                       Last nite was the game and we lost but we did good i think. i actually saw like a whole play where cj almond got a touchdown that was pretty cool and then i also saw another touchdown but i cant remeber who got that one but yeah i was so excited that i was yelling and screaming and wow it was awesome. then i saw and heard the impact when a midget and one of our players...cant remember who but they collided and i saw it and heard it and yeah they was hovering over both of them for a long time then our player got up and that a good thing but the other player was put on one of those board things and put in the ambulance. after we performed the national anthem for pre-game fireworks went off and that was really cool too i turned around to look even though we werent spose too then when we made the tunnel and football players ran through they had really cool like pyros that went off on either side of them as they ran through...it was so cool! oh and when we got a touchdown everytime the also had fireworks go off. itwas just way cool i though....whoo-hoo!   me and sarah went to the dance just b/c and partly b/c of something else but anyways we went it was super lame but we stayed til like 12:10 and then i drove her home and i went home and yeah it was really lame like last year but hey its homecoming why not go? there wasnt a whole lot of ppl there either....i didnt see any football or cheerleaders there so im assuming they had another party and yeah.  tomorrow i have a master class to attend for all-state preparations and i've never gone so i dont really know what expect. it think it'll be fun though.                        today just never ended...3rd period just kept going i thought it would never end and then after that just all my classes forever! now im  finally  home. i've had an exhausting day but, i didnt do anything really to make it exhausting. tomorrow will be  awesome !!! im leaving after band, then im just going home and will there til 3. there is really no point for me to even go to school tomorrow b/c here is my schedule for tomorrow: 1.  math  - n/t to serious there 2.  History  - crossword puzzle 3.  Indepent Study in Music  - i will be going to  studyhall  which im happy about 4.  Band  - ugh! we have to play 5.  Studyhall  - i actually have a studyhall that im spose to be in 6.  French  - i will again be going to  studyhall . we dont have class 7.  Phy Ed  - we'll probably weightlift so see there is no point to going to school tomorrow. moving on...i did learn something today though...i learned how to use some of the weightlifting equip. today. i cant lift very much but at least i can do it. i can lift anywhere between 50 and 80 for my arms. 80 is pushing it though and my legs i think anywhere between 30 and 60. lets talk about lunch...guys are  asses  especially the ones who sit w/ sarah and i. we do not have to take any of that crap! today really got to me and for the first time it was also directed toward me and i listened and it really hurt me. normally they just make fun of sarah and say really cruel things and laugh in her face and i always told her to not let it get to her but today it got to me. i really dont understand why they needed to rag on us i mean we didnt do anything to deserve what they said to us.  band...i needed to go to a mental institution  only for today during that period. too much  flute  this and that! ahhh! i wish school would just be done w/!                       the past few days/nites i've been in bed by 9:30 and normally 10:30-11 is when i go to bed but anyway my point is is that one nite i just crashed on the couch for a few mins while watching tv and the other nite i just went downstairs to bed and didnt even watch tv which is very odd for me. so last nite i went to bed and slept but i had a very weird vivid dream only now i cant remember it b/c im trying to remember it only this morning when i awoke at like 9:30 i was telling my dad the highlights of it even though he could care less but yeah so if i remember i'll write about it. but then last nite i also woke up which is i guess normal for me i mean i wake up at least once every nite but last nite i woke up at least 2 times but then i had trouble falling back to sleep and normally i dont when i wake in the middle of the nite but all i know is that my sleeping habits have been a litte screwy lately.   i've slowly been changing my  urlLink site . i've started a  blend challenge . and i made a new layout and i've also been making and posting blends. i think i might start making brushes and post them.                       so today was normal til 5th period. i have a band s.h. during 5th and so i went to the band room by myself b/c sarah had to take a math test so i was sitting there then i 'snuck' out to go to my locker and get my phone to call my mom to see if my private teacher had left her and e-mail and so i was talking and talking and mr. blair the chorus teacher came wondering back in the room where i was and was like everyone's spose to go out the football field and baseball diamonds immediately and so i was like mom i g2g go and i thought he was going to yell at me for talking on my phone but no so we was all out there and stuff and it was great then word got around that i was a BOMB THREAT! so then they moved us all over to our saviors Lutheran church and that was great too then we were told that if we had our keys on us that we could go back over and get our cars and leave or if our parents were coming to pick us up. so i called my mom b/c i didnt have my keys b/c my purse and stuff was in my locker and we arent allowed back into the school so yeah my car is sitting in my parking lot til who knows when i guess. so my day was very eventful.                       so last nite i decided to spend that nite at my grandparents house...yes i still do, i enjoy spending time w/ them and being on a farm outside getting,   'Gasp!' dirty!  . anywho so today i woke at 10 and then watched a movie,  Seabiscuit . I like that movie i've seen it several time and its just neat...then i took a shower. Before i went outside i ate some lunch then went out to mow the pasture. my goal this summer is to mow the whole thingy by  myself  but everytime i attempt it either grandpa comes out and helps or my dad. today i told grandpa i wanted to do it myself so then dad came out w/ his other lawnmower which is the new one and its awesome! it has power steering...anywho m.b. mowed w/ me. while i was mowing today i decided to work on my tan so i put on my swimming suit and mowed. im a little pinkish which is good. so now im home and i just downloaded two songs:  Gigalo  - nick cannon and r. kelly and  tear it up  - yung won, DMX, David Banner, and Lil Flip. i still like my rock music and pop music but now im into the r&b and rap thing.                        last nite dad and i went to  urlLink  knoxville   it was awesome! the  urlLink  World Of Outlaws   were there and they combined friday's races w/ last nites racing b/c of the weather on friday nite.  urlLink  Skip Jackson   now racing 2x who is my favorite racer did pretty well last nite. His first lap time trial was  16.200  and second lap time trial not as fast  16.254  that currently put him in the 4th fastest time spot but we still had 55 time trials left and after all of them he was 11th fastest Skip  was in 410 Heat # 3. He started in the second row on the outside which put him starting 4th out of 12. He came in 7th. He then started in the 410 B-Main. He was in the third row inside which put him starting 5th out of 21. He came in 5th and that ended his nite. Only the top 4 would transfer to the A-Main.  The fastest time trial of the nite was made by Chad Kemenah with the first lap time trial being 15.832 and second time trial lap being 15.851.  There were some crashes and my second favorite driver  ricky logan  crashed in the B-Main. i saw the whole thing from the moment its happened to the end. i saw that it was going to happen he got over the cushion and collided w/ the wall then he flipped like literally at least 5 times before landing on the ground. he was ok. another crash was erin crocker she hit the wall too but was fine. Jeff Mitrisin also had a pretty bad crash his was i think the first or second one of the nite and he's pretty good. Skip also hit the wall but it was nothing serious. they just had to push him away from the wall and he was off again only he had to start in the back of the pack. we didnt get home til a little after  5am . but it was worth it the racing was incrediable. also i forgot in the 360's there were a lot of first timers and there was this 16 year old kid who it was his first time ever in a sprint and he'd never raced anythig not even a go-kart and he made it to the 360 A-Main. he hit the wall but was fine and there were 2 laps left and he had to start at the back of the pack but he passed two cars in those two laps so im guessing that he'll be pretty good.         \n'''\n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
