I recently got some new channels that my parents ordered on the TV (Movie Central) and I never used to watch much TV but now I find myself in front of it for hours on end losing track of time slowly becoming a couch potato because these new channels have all the newest movies on and there is always something good to watch. I really got to break this TV watching cycle because I already don't get out enough because of my computer, school, work, and fitness and it makes time fly by so fast that I don't even realize what time it is and I finally get to my homework by 10 PM then I'm to tired and ill put it off to the next day and will give it to my teacher of late marks. Well, I have decided I'm going to try to break the cycle and add this to my list of monthly goals and resist the temptation of sitting on the couch after getting back from school.     I have recently started putting out my resume to get a head start on the whole summer employment thing and am really hoping that I get a job at this grocery store in my community(Especially since ill get a discount on FOOD!!). The reason I need a job is because with my habits of buying expensive protein powders, gym fees, saving so I can finally leave home and gain independence, entertainment(amusement park, movies, ect..), clothes, upgraded/new computer equipment and not getting much money from web design I really need a part time job that pays hourly wages like most people receive.  Well its 6 PM so I'm off to the gym and I promise, no matter what, I wont watch a minute of that dreaded brain melting TV and actually catch up on my homework especially since all my classes are academic this semester.                      It seems so ridiculous nowadays how people really don't live within their means. I hated being a child when my mom would complain about not having enough things of luxury like a bigger house, nice new cars, clothing that is ridiculously expensive, and a bunch of oversized flatscreen TV's. I don't understand the human tendencies to spend money on things they don't need and really cant afford and just dig a big hole for themselves in the long run. I know this from experience after watching my parents complain about money troubles all the times yet they were still making impulse buys even tho they were thousands of dollars in debt and had some serious problems which needed to be dealt with first.     When my family was considered middle class or rich we kept on running up bills for things we could not afford, I was really not a very happy child because we were constantly moving into 'nicer houses' which made it hard for me to make friends and my parents were always working to make more and more money which made for a very unhappy child since I was always neglected and a loner (thank god for my computer) and unhappy parents since their lives revolved around work and the only happiness they found was through alcohol (at least for my father).     I just think that too many people try too hard to be someone that their not and really try their best to impress others while never taking the time to make sure they are feeling good about themselves.      One thing that I learn time and time again in my life is everything has got to be balanced or your going to tip over. People need to learn how to balance relationships, finances, fitness, nutrition, work, education, fun, and all those other things that are essential to a persons life.  Anyways I got some things to do (play starcraft and review for finals) so I'm going to get to it. LAAAATE!                      I myself am non religious, most likely because I think like a scientist and demand proof which means that I cannot rely on good faith and also because I was sick of going to church as a young child because I found it extremely boring so as soon as I gained freedom to make my own choices I decided that I would not go to church. One reason that I do not believe in religion is because I notice that in the olden days religious leaders used to use censorship, fear, and propaganda in order to keep their followers obeying their orders almost like a militia or a corrupt government and they prevented improvements by banishing anyone who dared to believe that they had more intelligence then church leaders as another way to stay in power for longer. Another thing I do not like is in every religion there tends to be a reward that will be given to a righteous follower in the after life which seems ridiculous because if it really were true and we knew for sure that we would be getting a reward when we die churches would be packed and nobody would commit crimes and people might even try to kill themselves on purpose or like the Islamic cultures where the Muslim men become suicide bombers so they may be known as martyrs.       don't get me wrong now, to everything negative I believe there is a positive and 'modern' churches definitely give out a good vibe because they help people that cannot help themselves, they build a sense of community, people that attend church tend to make the world a better place, and it helps promote social interaction between people which does not happen as much anymore.    I myself could never possibly believe in a greater power that controls the universe, I personally believe that all of us organisms living on the planet earth somehow evolved from small bacterias that began to evolve to better adapt to the changing of the planets characteristics.  **Anyways its the weekend now and its late so I'm going to bed and catch up on some much needed sleep and who knows, maybe ill dream about some sort of greater power telling me something and I will create a religion called 'Brophism' ...lol well L8R!!**                      I have lived in surrey for 6 years now but when my family pretty much went from riches to almost rags because of family matters that involved drug abuse and bad tenants, we moved out of the nice suburban area that I lived in during my 'tween years'(10-13) and moved towards the downtown/industrial part of Surrey(Whalley/Bridgeview). In the first few years of living in this area I experienced new things and learned a lot about the streets while never actually getting involved with the wrong crowds or doing drugs. One of the things that gives the area I reside in a really bad rep is that it is known for is the poor people and crack addicts but sometimes the crack addicts can seem humorous because they do what I call 'the chicken dance' where their brain makes their body tweak out and have no control over their body for a short period of time. They also cross streets without looking which makes some drivers quite angry, yell at anonymous people for staring, smell really bad, urinate on public buildings out in the open, cause public mischief, and pretty much bring down the property value of everything around them therefore making them a threat to society.      The sad thing is these people, many of them came from good family's and some from bad ones but were neglected or just got in with the wrong crowd and it just went all downhill from there for them I suppose.      Although the city of Surrey has been enforcing the RCMP on these people with their patty wagons I always see when walking back and forth to school I sure do hope that they are not just locking them up to teach them a lesson because that wont do anything, they will be back on the streets in no time.      We need to help them get away from drug addiction and to just start their life all over again and maybe even use their past experiences to help out others in the past position.      If you think it is not worth our tax payers money to help these people, think of all the money that goes to basic healthcare needs for these addicts who are constantly overdosing and damaging their body's, causing pain and stress for family members, and always requiring special services such as welfare, needing food from the food bank and the way they drag down tourism, property value, and take up the RCMP's time for nothing when they could be educated and working to contribute to a greater cause, that being Canada.  **Anyways I hope you found that big mess of paragraphs enlightening, I am going to the gym now and hopefully my shoulder heals cause I guess I have irritated it a lot and I am still looking for a job so I'm going to try my luck handing out resumes in the industrial parts of surrey and I will update my blog again tomorrow if I am not too tired. L8R!!.**                       Just great! Its exam time, for students that tend to leave everything on the backburner like me are now making sure we know our stuff and handing in all our missing assignments in the last two weeks of school. This is the most stressful time of the school year where you miss a lot of sleep and study all night and wake up really early just to refresh your memory because these exams pretty much make you or break you in your future education and career.     I myself have to do quite well in my final exams because I consider myself a average student in everything except technology sciences such as computer science so I have to do well on my other finals or else I may be lying at a 'c-' or possibly even a 'I'(fail) if I do really bad on either my math or socials exam. Ontop of my final exams I also have my provincial exams which are completely new to me but I know they are used to compare schools all across British Columbia which will most likely be quite hard.      Last but not least I also have to take a extra class during the summer to graduate on time such as physics(cause I plan to get my electricians ticket) or math since I was taking a easier version of math when I was younger since I was so lazy.  ****Anyways this whole week is going to be extremely busy for me because I have to make flyers for a new store in surrey, Help a friend put up a neon sign at the mall, work out, do door to door sales, and study and do homework like crazy. So as you can see this week is going to be pretty insane with expectations coming from all over the place.**                     After being through Socials 11 and learning about WW1/2 I seemed to have developed quite a patriotism for Canada and have much more respect for our country as being a peacekeeper and being a democratic and socialist society even tho we also have a bureaucratic government. The reason I am thinking of joining the army is because I really feel like I take my freedom for granted and that I must pay my dues to help protect our country. Another reason I feel like joining is because I have always liked the idea of war and the strategies involved and I subliminally desire to be disciplined.      I realize this could be a decision that could put me in the grave at a young age but its always going to be on my mind. It is not like this is a final decision I have made because there are so many things in the technology field that I could really see myself excelling in such as a electrician, graphic designer, website designer, advertising multimedia, marketing, and since I've started working out firemen and police officer(and yes the soldier again) have come to mind. To summarize my talent or the type of person I am I would say that I am a very creative and technical person who takes risks to achieve greatness. On the other hand I can be unorginized, lazy, and paranoid about how economy will fall, world will end and things like that   For now I think ill just keep my mind on graduating with a good GPA.  Its late, Been great, write to you tomorrow mate.                         Yep, today I bought a pair of 200$ rollerblades because I think it would be a great way to get a cardiovascular leg workout and get around to where I got to go quickly during the summer. It was a young French guy from my gym that is always rollerblading all over the place that gave me the inspiration and initiative to get my blades and start practicing my quick turns, accelerating, and stopping techniques which is not as easy as you may think it is(got quite a few bruises in trial and error). Anyways I consider myself a pretty good rollerblader now and I plan on waking up tomorrow morning to go get a quick workout in, pack a lunch, strap on my blades, and possibly gather a friend or two to make a trip around the whole Stanley park seawall which is about a 7 mile trip.     Lately I have been extremely busy because of math 11 in summer school because I work out 2 hours in the morning then have to do 3 hours of homework in the morning, take a 30 minute bus to my school and get there by 12:15pm and work in that class till 3:30pm since 1 day there is equivalent to 1 week of normal school which means I get a shitload of homework per day, THEN! Go to work at 4pm constantly having to deal with rejection until 9:45pm then I get home and have about 30 minute of freetime and then I rinse and repeat the day. Sounds like I'm having a fun summer huh? ontop of that I gotta take up my weekends freetime up with my job at the PNE doing customer service courses and working preview days showing a bunch of old retired women a million dollar home and saying the same speech over and over again. It really is actually quite a fun job but it does get repetitive but atleast I get to communicate with people because people skills are very important.     **Well its late so I'm gunna relax and make myself a midnight snack consisting of perogies and 'Ren and Stimpy' gummy's**         \n'''\n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
