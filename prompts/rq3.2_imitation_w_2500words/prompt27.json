One way or another, I thought her words were worth posting...  GAIL SAID:  Editing is essentially the creation of reality. As a relatively prolific writer, I am too well acquainted with the editing process. I revise and revise, and revise yet again. From the 'raw data,' I re-arrange my text to present a completely different reality depending upon my goals for the specific written work. I want to win my academic argument, entertain my audience, or touch an emotional chord of someone close. I do so with integrity, and yet all these works present reality in a specific manner which is dependant solely upon the occasion for which I write.  Should it be any different for the filmmaker? Or for the television news editor for that matter? Do we have an expectation that it should be? Surely, Wag the Dog removed any such misguided notions. The events of the last year serve as evidence to that film's assertions; indeed, a surveillance photo of a truck or an unidentified container can be constructed into any reality, even weapons of mass destruction. The 'fictitiousness' of war, as Michael Moore labeled it, became the reality with which the world now lives.  There is a fallacy that we often slip into. Seeing is believing. I myself know how text is revised, edited, altered if you will. But we seem to suffer from the notion that our eyes do not lie. Words? What are those? The print on the page has form and substance in the sense that the wood pulp of which the page consists has concrete reality, as does the black ink with which it was typeset, but words still remain intangible constructs like the ideas behind them. Vision, on the other hand, reflects the 'real' world, a corporeal certainty, not a construct. Whatever our eyesight perceives surely must then be reality.  An experience like I-movie and even Garage Band, however, alters that perception. They allowed me to understand the level to which reality is presented, or distorted, through millisecond cuts, re-sequencing of events, and transitions. I discovered that music and slow motion in particular altered significantly what our movie was and what it presented versus the 'reality' of the profuse raw footage. Subtle nuances oddly possess some of the greatest impact. Even if we accept that we filmed reality, what we edited, the final product surely is not. Not in its entirety.  Accepting the integrity of a Michael Moore, is Bowling for Columbine reality? Does it not have a purpose, which serves the agenda of its director/editor? What about Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will? Spielberg's Schindler's List? Or Tarantino's Pulp Fiction? How real is a black and white zoom-in on blood infused water swirling down the shower drain, a distant image of the lone little girl wandering about a Polish ghetto in a red dress, or an almost fun-house surrealism of the powerful but disillusioned man wandering down a corridor lined with mirrors which multiply his image and project it far away from us and from himself.  Nonetheless, all these images present us with some segment of one of many realities. Our job as audiences, and as teachers of students who have become consumers of these images, is to learn to read the messages, decipher the images, and re-construct them into a critical view of reality.                       As much as instructors of all sorts cherish some kind of learning text (e.g., textbook, manual, video) to provide a framework for knowledge, are there people who actually   read the manual  ?  It’s true, I’m a reading glutton, and I’ll read anything! Product labels are especially fun – in particular when misspellings create great humor.  E.g., for all you Francophones, I recently bought bouillon cubes that gave the following instructions.  “Pour un couillon instantane…!!”  That is just too rude!!  Anyway, I have been known to read a textbook (although I have yet to read a computer manual). Like everyone else, I skim for salient points and then I construct my understanding based on headings and summaries.  By and large, knowledge rises from reading meatier texts (such as the books you are reading this term) to engage the mind/soul (though by “text” I also refer to all multi-genre or multi-media forms also known as multiple sign systems).  Once I’ve engaged the mind, I talk (a lot) to like-minded and non like-minded persons, I write – thoughts, poetry, and snippets of prose – I research and investigate, I dance, play music, and sometimes sketch…all to engage the senses.  Finally, when the two, mind and body have sufficiently been stimulated, I feel like I’m on my way to becoming literate in the field.  With enough practice, I may even become fluent.  One kind of  textbook  that may differ from all others is an on-line textbook or manual.  (Did you know that there is a pre-service teacher this past term who did her practicum   on-line ?)  While I’ve been actively using on-line language tutorials to learn php, or html – or simply going straight to the “how-to” sections of learning sites – something that was “transparent” to me was just made very visible today.  The interesting point that one of the other instructors (Kedrick James) mentioned in our meeting was the unusual capacity that hypertext may play in creating a “ganglia” of knowledge – where a nucleus (i.e., question) exists without the usual “end” in sight (i.e., answer).   When surfing through the excellent textbook source found on line called  urlLink  Language Across the Curriculum,   we find a very good place to begin the understanding of the importance language and (multi) literacy plays within every discipline.  To attempt to “grasp” through a single course of study (i.e., LLED 301) or textbook the breadth of the meaning of literacy, the role that forms of language and media play in education, and the techniques that may be utilized to build competency, may be more than one can reasonably achieve in short order!    Nevertheless, surfing an on-line “text” (especially when one is asking questions) offers something entirely unique.  What if, for every foreign word we were to come across in any given “text,” a link took you to yet another site that explained the term (historically, semantically, etymologically)?  Or a researcher’s name is mentioned  urlLink  (i.e., Vygotsky),  or a body of research  urlLink  (i.e., Semiotics)  ?  In other words, what would a story or textbook enable if hyperlinks were to carry the “narrative” from one point of reference to another?   In the on-line textbook under the heading called  urlLink  Context,   there are four subheadings, each contributing knowledge and skills for teachers across discipline areas.  Of the four distinct areas, Gender, Age, Multi-cultural, and  urlLink  Use of language,   I was particularly interested in the notion that specialized vocabulary often creates a barrier for understanding key concepts.  I certainly encounter specialized language each time I try to teach music skills to non-musicians.  The barrier that the language holds often seems insurmountable, for each special term (while resembling common usage, such as “beat” or “rhythm”) creates an impasse for the learner.  It is only when learners experience the language through  listening to  and  making  music that the vocabulary no longer guards its secrets.  I was also interested in the heading  urlLink  Reading Strategies   where three key questions are explored, namely, Why teach reading?  What is reading?  How can I tell if my student has a reading difficulty? As well, one finds  urlLink  strategies for reading   and  urlLink  on-line resources   for reading.  Another excellent section called  urlLink Grammar   contains a succinct history of the English language! All of these wonderful bits of information are a handy source of knowledge…nevertheless…  A few last thoughts continue to drift in and out of consciousness.   How will the use of hyperlinks affect the regular 'reading of a text?'  I remember when someone came up with the idea for DVDs to contain pop ups that you could click on, which would take you instantly to the director’s POV or some such info source.  I tried one and hated the 'interruptions' with the little pop ups (you could turn those off) right away.  I wanted the narrative in its entirety the first time round but the second time viewing was fun to click and learn.    The last thought deals with the phenomenon called the “digital divide.”  It is no surprise that we live in a  urlLink  digital divide,   and advocacy for literacy stretches beyond “reading and writing”  (once conceivably thought of as an “alpha-numeric divide”). We cannot ignore social, political and economic forces, anymore than we can ignore the role we play in bringing justice to those forces in the classroom.  Each time a “teachable moment” is missed that draws attention to the medium of words, computers and other forms of literacy, we forego the opportunity to empower children with the most basic of tools.  And that’s what words (ostensibly technologies) can do.  Empower the individual with a voice and a way of thinking!   Did you get through this text without clicking on a link???                       Leibniz once said, 'Necessary truths, on the other hand, are founded upon the principle of contradiction.' I like Leibniz.  At least in his thoughts I find some of my own.  The educational tensions we experience may stem more from the contradiction of being human as much as contradictions in pedagogy and  urlLink curriculum . It seems reasonable that we should inquire as to what makes learning real to students.  Just as it seems reasonable that we try to make ourselves 'real' to learners rather than 'fake.' Whatever may be the criteria for 'realness,' we sense that this matter is important.    Oddly, as educators we spend an interminable amount of time questing to understand knowledge (a philosophical branch called  urlLink  epistemology  ) but mostly shy away from  urlLink  metaphysics   (the branch of philosophy that grapples with matters of reality). Yet, the matter of 'realness' versus 'fakeness' continues to sneak up on us as it has through the ages from pre-Socratic times right up until the Wachowski brothers, who captured our imagination momentarily with the first   Matrix  installment.  Philosophers, artists, and scientists have been toying with 'reality' for the better part of the 20th Century and any  uncertainty  (Heisenberg) suggested by scientists can provoke peers to cry out, 'God does not play dice' (Einstein)!  It appears that contradictions are inevitable especially whenever a practical application is attempted.  Even when we give credence to the existentialist ideal that reality is merely  point of view , arguments never cease!  In general, scientists accept truth by consensus (more so than artists and philosophers?), for as long as skepticism exists and testing persists, there will always remain 'checks and balances.'  The trouble with philosophy and art, of course, lies in the fact that 'proof' is achieved through rational thought (i.e.,  a priori ).  Not easy to argue by  logic  alone!  Why anyone chooses to investigate problems that are insoluble has always puzzled the pragmatist (sometimes referred to as the 'practical' thinker).  The pragmatist, according to William James, is likely to 'turn his back resolutely and once for all upon a lot of inveterate habits dear to professional philosophers away from abstraction and insufficiency, from verbal solutions from bad  a priori  reasons.'  Should we wonder that American ideology was founded upon Pragmatists, particularly the educational system, since capitalism necessarily requires practical means?  Ah! Ideally, life ought to afford humans time enough for both philosophical musings and practical applications (if one so desires).  It takes pragmatism to navigate daily life, to find a companion, to raise children, to labor and to survive.  On the other hand, it takes a lifetime of contemplation to fall in love, to create art, to be curious about the world and to venture into the unknown.   PS I suspect that we have all practiced the art of  being real   or  faking it , at one time or another...(Nieminen vs Lecavalier anyone?)                        First day of class!  What an extraordinary group of individuals!  Each person, expressing so many interesting viewpoints from diverse contexts, contributed to a look at the fascinating paradoxes in education.  Can we connect some of the themes?  Go to the  urlLink  on-line textbook   to view the first link called “Context.”  You can surf the four topics,   gender, age, multicultural, language,   to uncover what language theorists are saying about literacy.     Here is what I wonder.  If spoken word is such a vital part of our linguistic heritage and given that we are such social beings (Vygotsky), why does our teaching in the 21st Century continue to be so didactic – so 19th Century?   According to statistics, the ratio between teacher and pupil talk shows that teachers are relentless in doing most of the talking!  That does not sound very sociable (would we expect a party host to do   all   the talking?) neither does it seem opportune since communication appears to be unidirectional! How droll is that?     A few of the following themes that arose from our introductions may lead us to unraveling the paradoxes:  (1) cultural attitudes and values (including parental, teen, administrative, teacher, government), (2) the teacher identity and sense of belonging crisis that ensues from questions like, “Why am I not taken seriously or valued?” – “What am I/they doing here?” – “What am I doing this for?” – “Do I make any difference?” – “Why is the system so slow to change?” – 'What is the meaning of life?'     Okay…so that last question is a bit too unwieldy. Still it holds a peculiar significance in the world of literacy insofar as what we value and the language we use are inexorably linked.  You most likely empathized, as I did, with a number of concerns that were voiced – and found some to be even more personally relevant than others.  Yet, despite the numerous subject areas, patterns were evident.  And there was an interesting undercurrent – a “ground” as it were – that may recede from our immediate view but that somehow connects all of these issues (i.e., “figures”).
