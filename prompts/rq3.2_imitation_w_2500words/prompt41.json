(23:12:59) Jood: YOU LAUGHED AT ME DYING (23:13:02) Alana: The getting eaten part was just an added bonus.            That was the greatest concert I've ever been to...ever! Ok, Peter Frampton was amazing on the guitar. For those of you who love the guitar I sujest you listen to one of his songs. But, STYX IS THE GREATEST BAND!!!!!!! I know most of you expected Styx to be old and crippled by now, but it has been more than 4 decades ago since Styx started (so they must be in thier late 40's, early 50's, or late 50's) but they were dancing around up there jumping over the equipment, doing highkicks, and sound exactly like they were in their 30's! Their voices even sound exactly the same! The person who played the keyboard (and did a lot of the lead singing) is officially my new hero. He's also really amusing. Randomly in the middle of the concert he turned to the rest of Styx and said, 'Well, we know you can rock, but can you...rag-time?' And he started playing rag-time on the keyboard and everyone on stage started square dancing. And all of Styx was steaming hot, with their tight, tight, tight, tight pants, esp. the keyboardist who had the tighest pants of all, and...well, I'll just stop there, for all of your sakes. It was awsome though, cause at first we had these really good seats, but the controls were right in front of us and the guy working it was standing right in front of us. We asked for better seats, and we got our own booth! The audience mainly consisted of beer belly, balding with long hair (that they probably grew out just for this concert), men that desperately needed to shave and brought thier wives (and really small children) along. The strange thing was, I didn't see anybody my age there. They were all either men and women and their really small children. I felt alone, but that was ok, I still had a great time. I saw a few guys around 18 years old (which was the closest to my age I saw) kept on passing the booth and winking and looking at me. I mean, they weren't horrible looking, but I knew it was just becasue they would either have to settle for me, or one of the Nas Car dad's sluts in thier 50's. There were a lotta drunk people. The guy in the booth in front of us was either on drugs or REALLY drunk (I think it was drugs). He kept dangling over the back of his seat and rolling his eyes and would sometimes curl up in a ball because the noise was too loud for him. Meh...The woman in the booth behind us though, was REALLY drunk. She had his high-pitched nazal voice and kept screeching into our ears, 'Play Lorelei!!' Yes it is a good song but it was getting to my head...I'm kinda glad that they never played that song, just to piss her off. 3 songs I wish they played that they didn't: The Best of Times, Lorelei, and Mr. Roboto (I didn't care so much about the last one). Oh, and I got a Styx Tour t-shirt! :) In the end I lost my sense of sight (because of the blinding show lights and from leaving my glasses on so long), my sense of hearing (from the huge speakers and Styx is a loud band), my voice (from all the screaming and singing), and I lost my entire sense of sense...wait a minute...Besides all the drunk people...the Styx concert was the greatest...all because of the keyboardist with those tight, tight, tight pants, and those...*ahem*...sorry...I shall conclude with... STYX ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! http://www.styxworld.com/    Come Sail Away   I'm sailing away, set an open course for the virgin sea I've got to be free, free to face the life that's ahead of me On board, I'm the captain, so climb aboard We'll search for tomorrow on every shore And I'll try, oh Lord, I'll try to carry on   I look to the sea, reflections in the waves spark my memory Some happy, some sad I think of childhood friends and the dreams we had We live happily forever, so the story goes But somehow we missed out on that pot of gold But we'll try best that we can to carry on   A gathering of angels appeared above my head They sang to me this song of hope, and this is what they said They said come sail away, come sail away Come sail away with me Come sail away, come sail away Come sail away with me   I thought that they were angels, but to my surprise They climbed aboard their starship and headed for the skies Singing come sail away, come sail away Come sail away with me Come sail away, come sail away Come sail away with me                      That was the greatest concert I've ever been to...ever!

Unfortunatly, it is unlikely that a 'cross-dressing day' will happen. The only day it is possible is Tuesday. Monday and Thursday we have off, Wednesday, is the awards ceremony for the atletic awards and honors, (Mrs. Braxton will be taking pictures) and obviously due to commencement we will be unable switch on Friday. (That is of course unless Katie is willing to give up her Versace dress or Cimmie plans on losing a hundred pounds so she can fit in a guy's outfit). Nevertheless, we have to do this switch on Tuesday, if at all. This wont work if someone forgets or backs out thinking 'Oh my God, if I cross-dress I won't graduate, because they'll expell me!' We need to coordinate plans since our only choice of a day is the next day we have school. We need to figure out something soon. My Idea is the following: In this 'chatterbox,' write your name if you are   willing  to participate. Maybe we'll do it if more than half the class is willing. After that, I'll make arrangements with people asking if they can let someone borrow their skirt or pants. I will also support requests so Emily can get in Kyle's pants. Below is the chatterbox and I hope this can happen with your support.   Write your First name, and whether or not you are willing to participate.      var chatterbox = 'no';         urlLink target='flooblechatterbox'  onClick='window.open('about:blank','flooblechatterbox','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,status=no,menubar=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,copyhistory=no,width=480,height=400');return true;'>  align='absbottom'>Talk   in my  urlLink flooble chatterbox, a free javascript chat tag board / shoutbox / tagboard program for your xanga, diary, blogger or weblog  |   urlLink logic puzzles, brainteasers      if (!chatterbox || chatterbox != 'ok') {  document.write('This  urlLink flooble chatterbox  is'); document.write(' temporarily unavailable. It will be back up shortly.'); }             \n'''\n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
