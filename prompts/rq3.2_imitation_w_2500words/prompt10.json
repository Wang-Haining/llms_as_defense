No, I'm not planning to get my teaching credential. I'm just a yoga teacher trying to make ends meet.   God bless these K-12 teachers. Especially the middle school variety. Those kids are nothing but obnoxious. Were we this annoying at that age?  Today is my first day administering a test as a sub. I'm in an 8th grade social studies class in Mountain View. And it's still the same old tricks. Sitting in unassigned seats. Whispering during the test.  Miss, I don't have a pencil.  But I can't complain. I'm getting paid to sit here and supervise some relatively obedient middle schoolers, blog, and otherwise fool around online.   There is definitely a zen aspect to subbing, and it certainly helps to practice deep breathing and mindful meditation on some days whilst teaching, or attempting to teach, or attempting to maintain sanity in the face of thirty unhappy freshmen. I think it's because you really have no choice but to be present. Each day is distinctive, always a new classroom, lesson, teacher's pet and class clown. If you're like me and tend to run later than earlier, it sometimes means waking up to an automated call from the sub finder at 5:30 am, going back to sleep until 7:20 and either hitting traffic or getting lost on my way to east San Jose, thereby ending up at school just as the first bell rings.   If there's a lesson plan, I'm golden. Of course, it's nice when there's a video to be watched. Although it can become a bit grating to hear the same Spanish telenovela every period for SIX periods straight. Elementary school kids are cuter, obviously, and easier to scare, but you actually have to read to them and teach them stuff. High school kids are usually independent and pretty intelligent, but a lot of the guys are super immature still. Like paper airplane immature. I try to steer clear of middle schools, perhaps just because my very first day on the job was horrific, and it was in an 8th grade science class. I sent 3 kids to the office, had to come home and immediately sleep I was so exhausted.  And now to my other blog. I'm starting one that's devoted to articles and information about...guess what... Y O G A! Check it out, tell your yoga friends:   urlLink http://yogafreedom.blogspot.com                       so i move to california a month ago. i am incredibly lucky to score a job just one week after arrival. not just any job, a job at GOOGLE, the search engine we all know and love. i'm a little hesitant to jump right into full-time work (i had just quit my job in austin a mere ten days prior) but my savings is pathetic, so i accept. in my initial phone interview, the woman says i may be overqualified for the job but i don't care. it's a job, it's a good company, and there are free lunches. so i settle in, get trained, begin working (reviewing adwords ads, you know - those little text ads that come up on the right hand side of google after you do a search). i score a cubicle next to the window and am pretty content to sit there all day listening to CDs and looking at porn sites. (it's a dirty job.) i go really fast. i sort of view it as a game - how fast can i go, how accurate can i be? it's basically proofreading, and checking ads against google's many, many policies which i cannot disclose lest i be sued for breaking the sacred NDA. treating your job as a game is not a good idea. looking back i'm thinking perhaps i was sabotaging myself. i hate advertising. too bad that's what my degree is in. i hate working 9 to 5. what a waste of a day! i left texas to escape from that. so anyway, i go to lunch with my fellow ants and we gossip about the people who've been fired, speculate as to why, and quietly pray that we will not be next. i never thought it would happen to me. that's why, last week when my manager who looks and speaks like he has a stick up his ass says to me 'do you have a minute,' leads me to a secluded conference room where an HR chick lowers the guillotine.   i turn into a complete basketcase. i start crying and blabbering. ohmygod what am i going to do i just moved here from texas how am i going to pay rent can't i have another chance why oh why woe is me. so i'm sad, offended, pissed off, scared. i go home to my friends' apartment where there are no less than 10 people (out of town visitors, roommates, friends) and cannot find a place of solitude. so i choose the room with the least amount of people and go in and sob. my mom calls. no way i'm answering that. thank you god for caller ID. but you know what? i got over it the next day. i started looking for other forms of income if you know what i mean. (kidding!) really, i am a yoga instructor, so i began to seek out yoga instructing positions. let's be honest, i'll probably have to work in advertising, or do some clerical bullshit or wait tables to make ends meet. but full time yoga will come sooner than later...                      It's really a miracle that I ever post to this blog. Information overload really gets me when I'm online. Especially lately. I'm checking eighteen email accounts, updating websites, randomly Googling, socially networking (orkut, friendster, mixermixer, can't you all just join into one?), IM-ing with friends and occasional strangers requesting naked yoga lessons, reading the news, and on and on. I think, 'Ooh, I want to blog.' But then I get distracted by flashing lights and the sound of new mail.   At long last, here I am. Today, and of late, I am keenly aware of the need to balance work and play. Focus and relaxation. Mind spinning and mind stilling. I spend hours on end going, going, going, and if I don't meditate a while, or go for a walk or whatever, I begin to grow tired, or stressed, or caught up in the details of Tuesday, May 25, 2004, 12:34 pm. Then I look outside and see the dogs basking in the sun and remember to breathe, close up the laptop and give it a rest.  I volunteer taught yoga and meditation at Sunnyvale Middle School yesterday. Some kids were attentive, others rude or bored. After school, they erupted into yells, formed into circles of cliques and digital rings. I wonder: why do twelve year olds have cell phones? Are we breeding a new wave of stress monkeys? Mommas, don't let your babies grow up to be materialistic.                     A quote from  The Power of Now  by Eckhardt Tolle. “The misuse of the word/concept of God gives rise to absurd beliefs, assertions and egoic delusions such as ‘My or our God is the only true God, and your God is false.’ ... No word can explain the ineffable reality behind the word, so the only question is whether the word is a help or a hindrance in enabling you to experience That to which it points.”  I’m not personally against the word God, but I totally agree with Tolle’s statements. How can God be narrowly defined? Is it just human nature to want to be right and have a single, neat answer choice which allows for no other options? The other day at a Zen Christian meditation, I had a strangely geometrical visualization of a bright ball of white light, floating in nothingness. I imagined people, or lines representing people’s energy, approaching and entering the ball of light from all directions. I felt very comforted by that because it reinforced my deep seeded feeling that there are many paths to the Truth (a.k.a. God).   Thinking about it the next day, I realized that logically, a single individual can only approach the sphere from one direction. But there are still other paths going to the same destination. So there is the need to balance the undying faith in one’s own path (which of course is never a straight line) with awareness of and respect for other paths as well. Certainly there are still paths that don’t lead to the light, but the main, ancient world religions, in my humble opinion, all qualify, at least when practiced in the spirit of pure goodness.  Then again, I wish I could avoid having to project into the future, to grasp for some sense of security that everyone is okay and will end up in heaven or enlightened or whatever. If I could do that, I would really be invoking “the power of now.”  Because naturally we don’t know and never will. It’s just a hope, and an optimistic one at that. But clinging to it makes even such a lovely notion turn into something self-righteous and detrimental.                       The Chris Crises   'Only two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity, and I'm not sure about the former.' - Albert Einstein   At the risk of sounding like a Chris-monger, I must admit that I have had eight relationshippy experiences with males named Chris. Seven horribly bad and one which is currently underway and so far so unbelievably good.  Chris 1 was basically a child molester. I was 14, he was 22. Sickening.  Chris 2 was older too, but at least only 18. I was 15. He invited me over to a small party at his house and fed me screwdrivers with cheap vodka. I got uncontrollably drunk for the first time there. He was my first kiss. We went into his bedroom and fooled around. Then, his best friend, Chris 3, entered the room. So there I am, naïve and drunk and hooking up with two guys at once. It was cool but a bit too much for me to process. The doubling up only lasted five minutes until Chris 2, the one I actually liked, left the room. Chris 3 basically forced me to go down on him, which I had never done and neither knew how nor wanted to. I gagged. Disgusting.   Chris 4 was minor, just a friend’s boyfriend who toyed with my emotions and cheated on her with me. If you consider kissing cheating.   Chris 5 was my prom date. Not a boyfriend, just a friend. My circle of friends gathered at V's house. All the girls dates trickled in, but mine was MIA. I ended up sitting alone with everyone's parents waiting after everyone had left for dinner. I drove myself downtown, sobbing hard along the interstate and found my way to the restaurant. I walked into the room we had reserved. Party of 30. I had composed myself but seeing all the happy couples was too much. I started crying. All the girls rushed up and took me to the bathroom. It was pretty classic. They were all reassuring me and being very sweet. He eventually showed up, three hours late and with no good excuse. I hate the prom!   Chris 6 lived in my dorm in college. He was a charismatic film student who resembled Brad Pitt and Benecio del Toro. He knew it too. I had a crush on him for over a year! RIDICULOUS. No serious drama there, but still. His name is Chris!   Chris 7 was my one jaunt with a younger man. He was twenty. My friend’s younger brother. He started sleeping over but we never made out or even kissed. It was just what I needed at that point. But then his innocent idealism began to annoy me and we ultimately had a bit of a falling out.  So the uncanny Chris pattern became a joke in my love life. Any guy named Chris was shot down instantly. One more snuck in though, the one from the plane a few weeks ago. He told me his name and a red flag went up. Luckily he goes by Christopher. He has somehow has managed to redeem the name, though obviously I will  never  call him Chris for short. (I hate Chris!)   This is it. The Chris jersey has been officially retired, sorry, no exceptions. Eight is enough.                       A week ago, my grandpa went to his final PCS (permanent change of station), as he called it. He died of complications related to cancer and Parkinson's disease. It has been a whirlwind week of driving, flying, hugging, emotions, visitations, ceremonies, crying, laughing. He had been sick for quite a while and on a gradual decline for a few years. He spent the last few months at a nursing home. I saw him in January and feel very blessed to have had the chance to say goodbye then. In fact, I wanted that to be my last goodbye but I was somewhat peer-pressured into viewing the body at the funeral home. I realize that this can help the healing process for some, but I have had a lifelong fear of the dead, death, and dying and absolutely did not want to see a lifeless Grampa lying in a casket. But I came around and I guess it wasn't so bad.   There was a lengthy Catholic mass/funeral at which I spoke. I did the whole gratitude thing. (If you're Catholic, you know what I'm talking about -- 'blah blah blah... Lord, let us pray.') I felt my voice was shaking but no one else could tell. Must have been my inner fear of being struck down in the house of God for consciously opting out of Catholicism.   He was a Colonel in the Air Force and therefore had a 21-gun salute and fancy flag-folding ceremony which was pretty neat. My Uncle gave a heartfelt, funny and moving eulogy. At least a hundred people came. Brothers, cousins, nieces, old friends and war buddies.   Maybe it's all the meditation and spiritual stuff I do, but I definitely feel that I am getting over my fears of death. In this case, it is almost a relief to know that he's no longer suffering from an ailing body. After all, we are just energy (souls, if you will) encased in these bodies. Once the bodies are finished with their earthly pursuits, our energy travels to another realm.
