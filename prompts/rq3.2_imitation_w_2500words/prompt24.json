'We haven't seen each other in 16 years and have a lot of catching up to do!' 'Awwwww, how sad,' said Mack, an orange weasel witha giant chipped tooth and red stripes, 'remind me to cry after I stomp your ashes into the ground!' Just then, a giant robot hand shot out and grabbed Noire, 'HEEEEEELLLLLPP!!' she screams. 'Hold on... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!' screams Sa2b as he is belted into a far wall. Soon everyone has left an imprint in the walls, except Hobbes who had cowardly jumped behind a dresser. 'HEEEEEEEELLLLLPP!!' Noire screams again. Suddenly, Hobbes' eyes start to darken. 'He's going feral!' exclaims Sa2b, who is picking up his teeth that had come loose. It's true. Hobbes had the ability to snap and go crazy at will, but usually only when he's  really  mad. At this point, he had only one thing on his mind:  Who are you, cutie?  His eyes became slits, his fangs got bigger, and 3 inch claws came out of each finger. The hairs on his back stand up, and he lets out a loud, 'RAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWRRRR!!!' With a couple fast slashes, plus a couple bruises, and robot go BOOM! Hobbes then returns to normal (if you can call it that). He then is tackle-hugged by Noire. 'Ohh, thank you, thank you, thank you! I thought I was a goner!' 'Umm, your welcome, but could you please stop choking me?' 'Oh, okay. Maybe I'll just do this.' Then she kisses him. Hobbes just sits there, bewildered. Usually, he'd be trying to put the moves on Foxy. He's never actually met someone who  likes  him. 'Um,' says Noire, 'did I do something bad?' 'Naw, just give it a bit to sink in,' explains Sa2b, who had replaced his teeth. Just then, Hobbes flies through the roof. 'WOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOO!!! I'VE GOT A GIRLFRIEEEEEND!! YEEEEEEEAAAAAHHHH!!' 'I guess he does,' says Noire.    THE END   -Sane Intolerant-                     'RUN AWAY!' the two brothers yell. As they dash away, they think about how handy it is to be able to run faster than a cheetah. 'Hey, wait a minute,' says Camo, 'why are we running when you could just teleport us back?' 'What, and ruin the fun?' says Sa2b. 'There's the hotel,' says Camo, 'get ready to turn.' 'No,' says Sa2b, 'then they'll know where we live. Just keep running.' So they pass the hotel and keep running for about 5 blocks. 'Ok,' says Sa2b, 'now we can teleport.' They both vanish in a puff of smoke and reappear inside their hotel room. 'Maybe we should lay low for a while,' says Camo. 'Yeah, I guess. Hey, want a DP?' said Sa2b. 'Yeah, sure.'   2 nights later...   At 12:00 at night the phone rings. '*Yawn*, hello?' says Sa2b. 'I know where your brother is,' says a mysterious voice. 'Yeah, he's in the bed next to me.' 'Wha, no, the echidna! He's being held at Area 13!' 'What are you talking about?' Suddenly, Sa2b remembers a small child and a giant thunderstorm. 'No way.... Thanksmangottago!' says Sa2b, and he hangs up. 'Camo, Camo, get up!' 'Euh, what is it?' asks Camo, sleepily. Sa2b whispers to him. 'No way!' says Camo. 'That's what I said. Come on!' The two teleport out of the room.   To be continued...  -Sane Intolerant-                     'HOLY CRAP, HE'S GONNA EAT US!' 'Thanks for pointing out the obvious, Sa2b,' says Knumchuck. 'Hey, look down there!' exclaims Foxy. They all look down and see a red cat. 'Hey, you're the girl I saw in the last part of the story!' *Danggit, you've already burned it down and thrown its ashes into the wind! Will ya give it a rest?!* *Geez, sorry!* 'Yeah, and my name is Katt. And that's the Reex.' 'So  that's  why it was called Reex Cave...,' said Sa2b. 'NO FREAKIN' DUH!!' everyone yells. 'Don't worry, I'll help you!' said Katt. Suddenly, she tears out a flat section of a stalagmite and picks up a few rocks. Strange thing is, she didn't use her hands! 'Hey, how are you doing that?' inquires Foxy. 'I'm telekinetic.' 'Oh, so you can move things with your mi-' 'SHUT UP!!' they all yell. Katt jumps up on the section of rock she tore off and floats up to the Reex while holding the rest of the rocks with her mind. She flings the rocks at the Reex and it lets out a roar of pain. Sa2b and company are dropped to the ground. 'Thanks for saving us,' says Camo. 'No prob,' says Katt. The Reex lets out another huge roar and everyone runs away in fear. Suprisingly, they all run at the same speed. 'Hey, you wanna come back to our apartment? I don't think you want to stay here any longer...,' asks Camo. 'Sure, that'd be nice,' says Katt, as she kisses Camo. Just before Camo accidentally trips from being distracted, Sa2b teleports them all out of the cave.  THE END  New HtGiT -Sane Intolerant-                     I see you have deleted your site Darkblaze. Anyways, even though SI is working through a story, I'm gonna type a short story about LALALAND! and stuff.    Typical Day in Lalaland.        I'm sitting at the rollarcoasters engine, trying to figure out what to do to make it even faster than it already is, when I see Alec, who runs the hotel, run very fast past me. I quirked my eyebrow, and walked in the opposite direction from which Alec was running. I see that all my fellow co-workers and friends are standing in front of a blazing inferno *KOOOOL!* Then I relized that it was a fire of fun and prettiness *which it usually is* and that it is actually the hotel. I knew know one else was there at the moment, cause it's MCAS time, dont cha know, and that people weren't burning alive. Erm. Anyways, I turned to Mandy, who runs the gift shop and asked 'What happened here?!!??!?!?' She doesn't answer me, so I turn to my friend Gage, who runs the tea shop, and see him stareing at Alec, who as just run back with a strange looking charactar by the collar. 'Fix this, Camo!' Camo, the weird guys name, (Camo: I am not weird!!! Me: Shut up *throws random object...and misses*)says with an attitude, 'And what if I don't wanna?' Alec gives him a serious look and says in a stern voice, 'Then I'll make you face Katt on DDR 1 million google times.' Camo looks horror stricken then, and fianlly gives in and says, 'Fine!' I stood back and watched Camo laugh manically as he put the flames out and Gage rolling his eyes, saying under his breath, 'Pryo/hydromaniacs...' I saw that the entire hotel was burnt to a crisp. 'Bye!' Camo shouted, just as the hotel re-appeared again *POOF!* only, this time it was green. So, at the end of the day, we all went back to our jobs, and I just tried and tried to figure out the rollarcoasters guts spilled out all over the floor. The end! PS-Camo is not the antagonist in the story. He's like both! (protagonist I meam)  -Dilussional Child-                          Here is more of my story. Suddenly, out of nowhere, a giant gargole attacks. There goes the roller coaster. Again, out of nowhere appease a popular videogame character VooDooVince. Vince takes a needle and stabs it into his head and the gargoyle runs away screaming in pain. 'Well that was weird,' says Sa2b, 'lets go check in at the hotel.' When they get to the hotel they see a familar face. It's A.J. The hotel manager from LaLa land. 'hey guess what?' A.J. asks 'I got a job hear because I'm the only hotel manager in this swamp meet.' Later that day, Camo and Katt go talk to A.J. to find out some gossip. He tells them that there is this morphing animal in this town that is a menice to the shops. He says that it approches as a sweet little kitty cat and than it turns into a giant tiger and starts to destroy the shops. If it gets made than it will transform into a gargoyle and wreeks havoc until it calms down, then it goes away. *Camo's eyes go blank and you zoom into his pupils going into a flashback. You see a baby Camo (isn't he so cute). He is playing with a kitty cat and it morphs into a tiger and it starts to carrie camo around in its mouth. Zoom out of Camo's eyes.* Katt says 'Camo whats wrong.' 'I don't know.' Camo respondes. 'Oh well, lets go out.' So Camo and Katt go around the swamp meet spending time with each other, going on all the rides. After they get off the newly built roller coaster, they see a black cat, (it's so cute). Camo and Katt decide they want to keep him,(it's a boy cat), so they bring it to Sa2b to ak him. Camo: Can we keep him. Sa2b: No. Katt: Can we keep him. Sa2b: No. Camo and Katt: Can we keep him? please, we will take good care of him. Sa2b: Fine, but you have to pay for the food. Camo: Why? Sa2b: Because I pay the rent. Katt: No you don't, we don't have rent. Sa2b: Um.....ah.....shut-up. After all this, they name the cat DarkBlaze, after the legendary animal. Little did they know that the cat they picked up was actully the one and only DarkBlaze and the same cat that played with Camo when he was young. When they got home, something was amise.  Part 2 later. -Darkblaze-                     ONLY IN AMERICA!!!!!!!!  Only in America - can a pizza get to your house faster than an ambulance.  Only in America - are there handicap parking places in front of a skating rink.  Only in America - do drugstores make the sick walk all the way to the back of the store to get their prescriptions while healthy people can buy cigarettes at the front.  Only in America - do people order double cheeseburgers, large fries, and a diet coke.  Only in America - do banks leave both doors open and then chain the pens to the counters.  Only in America - do we leave cars worth thousands of dollars in the driveway and put our useless junk in the garage.  Only in America - do we buy hot dogs in packages of ten and buns in packages of eight.  Only in America - do they have drive-up ATM machines with Braille lettering.  Only in America - are the least useful professions (professional athletes, movie actors & entertainers) paid so disproportionally much compared to people with normal jobs.                       Sa2b here. I have yet to tell you more about me. My last name is Tame (same with Camo and Knumchuck). Foxy's last name shall not be released for security reasons. Katt's and Hobbes' last name is Tygre. Pheen's last name is Niks. And finally, Leon's last name is Strechel. I also have some friends that don't live with me:  Cybe (last name not releasable): 18 yrs. Jane Strechel (Leon's sister and Cybe's girlfriend):18 yrs. William Blaine (everybody calls him B.B. for short): 7 yrs. Pyde Arack: 17 yrs. Giette Armour (Pyde's girlfriend and calls B.B. Baby Blaine): 17 yrs.  OK, Mack must be running out of robot ideas. Today he sent a pink robo-bunny holding a drum after us. I kicked it once and its battery fell out. Pa-the-tic. A guy downstairs came back from doing some marshmallow commercial. Before he could even get in the door another guy punched him into a wall. I think the first guy left an imprint. Katt and Camo (against his will) got the double's high score on DDR Max 2. And... hold on.   Gage just called. He told me to post that his dad got HULK on DVD. I've seen it already when it was in theaters. Well, I forgot what I was going to say before. Oh, well.
