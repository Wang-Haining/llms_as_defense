(but, hope is hope however faint.) as a result all the human or humanoid employees are on the brink of a mass exodus. so what, you say? well our old fearless leader used to do the schedule, guess who is doing it now? that's right ladies and gentlemen, yours truly. feeling like a traitor to the human race, i accepted the task of headwait (after they gave it to someone else and then took it back,) and now i am in charge of a handful of righteously pissed humans, some new to this whole drama. but what the borgs do not know is that like myself, another of the managers is actually human. and all hopes for the future of the federation depend on our subterfuge. wish us good luck and godspeed. (really, i am so dramatic sometimes... the whole startrek metaphor could have been bypassed by simply comparing the work situation to a playground screaming match over who is really the goose among all the ducks.)  category 2: money directly relating to the above mediocre crisis, money is tight. i am at work more, but making significantly less. i think the customers can smell the undercurrent of reality tv that is stinking up the place. the waitstaff is surly (more than usual,) and the new people are entering a hostile workplace. the new menu lists about a thousand things we don't have, and the food is completely inconsistent. patrons hate inconsistency- why do you think chain stores are so popular? (maybe the customers are borgs too!) human or not, they aren't coming in as much. (disclaimer: to those who still come in to drink their poison of choice, we appreciate and admire your bravery in light of the borg infestation. we should all hope to display such courage) and with paltry sales comes the other ugly twin, paltry tips. not to mention i have too many people on the floor for training. more people working + less people coming in=less money for all. in addition, school is starting at the end of this month. i was seriously looking forward to the loan disbursement to tide me over. well, sorrrie. disbursement dates have changed. no money is given out until  after  the semester is in session. what the hell sense does that make?? it is  my  money after all. well, eventually i will default on paying it back, right?  category 3: the return of the psycho amid all the aforementioned pleasantry, i get a call from the DA's office friday afternoon. 'uh yeah, we are gonna be going to trial on monday, maybe.' to which i tactfully reply: ' WHAT ?!?!? that is all the notice you can give me? after over a year of waiting for ya'll to get your shit together?' (saying it was tactful reply is called  sarcasm.  say it with me: sar-cas-m. very good.) beautiful timing, man. christ. for those of you who aren't privy to the happenings of my life prior to this blog, i have a bonafide psycho stalker. lucky me. without going into all the gruesome details, (that will be next week) the stalker is still incarcerated and awaiting trial. he has been offered a few plea bargains, (that is an offer to plead guilty to a lesser charge than the felony stalking charge. the state hates to pay for trials and would rather let the psycho go with a measly misdemeanors) but he does not take the plea bargain, because he won't admit to doing anything wrong. the guy is completely delusional. for example: after being put away for stalking me, he continues to write me letters from jail. smart. and the prison still lets him. am i the only one that sees the absurdity here? so anyway... i tell the DA that 'monday, maybe' is a tad vague. he says he wont know for sure until the day in question. obviously this is category of problem directly conflicts with the work category. so now i get to explain to the borg chiefs that, thanks for the 'promotion' and all, um i may need to schedule myself out next week because of court. you gonna go to jail? no. oh. i can see the confusion this causes the borg community, so i get to explain the stalker thing to them. lucky me. again.  men, borg or otherwise, never seem to believe me about the stalker thing. it is really annoying. my inner monologue always freaks out when i see the look of doubt when this topic arises: who made  you  judge and jury, asshole? you don't know me. you weren't fucking there. and it isn't even any of your fucking business anyway, fucker! it is sad how often this happens. now i know kobe bryant's accuser feels.  anyhoo, i call the DA bright and early monday morning. still no news. 2:30 comes and goes and still no word. i call again. 'oh sorry that i didn't call you back. looks like it will be next week afterall, maybe' aaaarrrrrrrgggghhhhhhhhhhh! the world had been overrun with borgs!  category 4: newton's law of motion #3 with all this crap going on there has been equal and opposite reactions to my (already fragile) state of being. i have a constant pain in my stomach, ulcer anyone? more headaches, and various other physical symtoms i don't want to go into. i made a Dr appt, but they were so booked that i get to wait till the end of this month to go, which is also the same day school starts (borgs) of course i have no money to pay them, (student loan borgs) and for all i know i will be in the middle of trial, dredging up last year's misery in front of a bunch of suit and tie types, (bureaucratic borgs) a jury, (some with that doubtful look i'll bet.) and the stalker himself. joy. it doesn't get any better than this folks.  since i haven't been feeling well, and i'm stressed, i do what rational people do. get wasted drunk. as a result, (damn newton) i seem to have abandoned the sensor (censor?) in my brain that tells me to shuttup. lately i have developed this bad habit of telling people exactly what i think- what i think isn't always pretty (as if you couldn't tell.) so if you want to know what i really think of you, just buy me a drink.                  i had finally gotten used to the old neighbors.  they were a couple with two dogs, a border collie and a sweet little ankle-biter.  the collie and my dog didn't always see eye to eye, but the ankle-biter and my dog had a bond.  the people they owned were a bit on the boring side, although very personable.  then,  they sold their house.   to people who cut down all the vegetation on their side of the property  and along our fence line.  with three dogs,  one obnoxiously yappy,  one sweet,  and one just downright mean.   i have to chaperone my dog into the yard, the mean dog looks like he is about to come over the fence and take a chunk out of him.  my dog plays it cool,  lifting his leg on our side of the chain link fence-  peeing directly on the frothing, growling,&nbsp;fanged, beast.   the yappy one is worse.  i can't go out and have a cigarette without inadvertently waking the entire neighborhood.  and the motorcycle?  forget it.  i may as well live in a dog pound.   the people of the family equally suck.  as i mentioned, there is no longer the lush green illusion of privacy between our yards.  that green 'fence' often provided enough of a buffer between us and the old boarders,  that we could forsake the polite hellos, and how are yous,  when we were respectivly outside and not wanting to be bothered.  not now.  the mr. of the house,  after destroying various wildlife habitats by ripping out trees,  is now constantly in the yard doing  something...    (doesn't this guy have a job??)   i am tempted to ask him to help develop a schedule where i can enjoy my yard, and he can run a chainsaw, rip up the deck, blast country music,  say i get sun, mon and wed?  he can have tues, thurs, fri and sat???? pleeze???  i have altogether given up on the idea of a tan this summer.  i really don't feel comfortable laying out in my yard when he is over there.  that see through metal fence doesn't provide enough cover for me.   apparently the mrs. of the house has no such problems.  today,  her rotund form was doing a yoga routine that brought to mind the death of a beached whale.  bitch.  how come she can roll around imitating a gran mal seizure,  when i am not comfortable baking my flesh in my own (fairly expensive) backyard?   i told the Bf that he shoud belch, scratch his ass, and pee alot outside, in order to offend the offensive couple enough to put up a privacy fence.   &nbsp;   &nbsp;                    right now I should be studying for a math test I have to take in two weeks. Ugh, I hate math. This is why I am boring you all to tears on the computer, so I can put off studying.  right now the dog is barking incessantly at the movers next door.  right now I am considering a muzzle.  right now I am also doing laundry, such a multi tasker I am, laundry, contemplation of dog-icide, procrastination of math studying, typing, boring my friends...  right now I am cursing whoever made downloading photos so damn complicated.  right now I am wishing I would have paid more attention to those godawful computer classes they made us take in high school.  right now I am wondering who will read this crap.  right now I really don't care.  right now I am thinking how strange it is that I have two close friends at 721 iron st and they probably don't even know that they are there together.  right now I am looking at the clock thinking I have 3 hours left before I have to go to work  math and work. Ugh.  right now I gotta get a life                 i promise to post b-day pics when(if)they become available. (see below post) it was lots of fun, even though we decided to get together at my work. MP and her man were there, as was my good friend KH and his friend. The BF came by after work, and of course my work crew was there, some working, some not. i might have paid for two drinks all night, and i think they were the BF's. my friends bought me a drink or two each, the bartender (MS!) bought me a few. my work friends kept buying me shots, and the regulars who were out on the patio got me a few rounds. the interesting part was that i think i was the least drunk at the end of the night, with possibly the exception of A? who just got off of work. one friend in particular, who said she wasnt going to drink much, (you know who you are!) decided at one point that she would be responsible for birthday spanking. although i had vetoed this idea earlier in the night, she ignored me and, damn she hits hard! its ok i teased her mercilessly the next day. at least no one sang. happy birthday that is, BF did a karaoke rendition of a guns-n-roses tune. it wasnt karaoke night, but that didnt seem to bother anyone. i lost some pool games, as usual, and smoked more cigarettes then i thought possible. we left before last call, (we have  some  dignity!) and met up at my place where the party continued, for  some  of us, ahem. then i kicked everbody out because i didnt want to embarrass myself further by falling over.  it wasnt a big bash or anything, but it was cool to hang out with all my (texas) friends in one day. CM in cali sent me a cute ecard, (who i have yet to email, sorry CM! i promise to get in touch soon)as did my mom who also donated funding to the broke 'incognito' fund (thanks mom!!!) to those of you that forgot, its ok i probably forget yours too.                  Just dropped the dog off at the parents. its awfully quiet around here all the sudden. boyfriends at work and i have to go to work soon too, but in my head i am already on vacation. until this morning we weren't even sure we could go--there were a few snags:  1)we want to take the motorcycle, but i'll be damned if i am going to ride for 5 hours in the Texas heat with 40 lbs of backpack on. so we order a luggage rack and bag for the bitch seat. the bag comes in, the rack it is supposed to sit on is on backorder. lovely. then why even send the bag? its useless with out the rack! the bag is too big to sit on the rear fender. plus the motorcycle is the 'other woman' and my boyfriend would cry if 'she' got any scratches on her behind. after calling the company, we realized we wouldn't get the rack on time. well shit. we already booked a room, got time off from our respective work places, etc. the BF called everywhere and finally had to order the rack through a local dealership. they promised it would be here in time, and although i had no faith, it was. (i am so pessimistic sometimes...)the BF picked it up today. When I saw it i was like - thats it ? just that little piece of metal cost over a 100 bucks? and caused so much frustration and almost cancelled our vacation? i could have made that in the garage! the BF wisely changed the subject. (I still have to come up with a alias for him, 'the BF' sounds, well, stupid) 2)weather. now that we have the damned luggage rack, it looks like it is going to rain some of the weekend. Bf brought up a good question--what the hell is the difference between 'isolated thunderstorms' and 'scattered thunderstorms'??? do the isolated ones have abandonment issues, and the scattered ones are just unorganized??? what the hell does that mean? it means we are going to get rained on. but we decided we are going to go anyway. 'its an adventure!' he says. why is it that when I want to go to the beach it rains? cant i have an adventure when it is nice out? so be it.   urlLink    pre luggage rack&nbsp; urlLink             \n'''\n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
