I really don't understand how she use her computer... and it turn out I have to completely erase everything and reformat hard drive and then reinstall windows... and I have to reinstall all the programs for her and stuff so it turn out to be a day job. There is conflict in her hardware and I have never seen so many blue screen of death for my life. For all the computer that I have fix and reinstall wondows and everything, this is the nastiest one. And it lead me to tell myself that I am never going to fix another computer for those computer incompetent people. Other then that my weekend was as usual, very boring, nothing much exciting is happening in my life. I think I need to join some clubs or something. But I am only going to be here for a few more days. So what should I do? Oh well, I guess I will figure that out tomorrow. Also, I think I am losing my touch on all these board games, I lost my monopoly game last night and I bankrupty and own my step bro 325 dollar monopoly money. I can't believe it... I think I am better in the game risk. :O) Anyhow, coolio... sweet sweet...                               CBC was great... they got a wonderful program tonight on fifth estate... they are talking about the stuff behind the war on Iraq... pretty interesting prospective... I have definitly learned something from it...  SARS... this got blown way out of proportion by the media... this is my prospective anyway... i was in Hong Kong just 2 weeks ago and it is not even close to be as bad as it was being said by the media... it is bad, but not as bad and dangerous... and don't worry, I don't have SARS... I left Hong Kong last Tuesday, so today was the 10th day that I was back in Canada... so if I have SARS, I should have it by now! hahaha...  As for interesting stuff... here is an interesting site that I have visit...  urlLink click here  some pretty interesting perspective on stuff... also click on Gulf War 2 on the right... it is a pretty funny animation that the author had put together...  Finally... I wrote an letter to the Queen's Journal Editor just before I leave for Hong Kong... I was so angry by my fellow Sci'03 (no names included here) when I wrote it, it was not even funny... and I still believe the person involve should be de-bossed... it drive me nuts that Queen's is such a non-queer friendly place... it is so so so bad... I even send a complain to Principle Leggett, he haven't reply yet... it had been 2 weeks, so I am disappointed in him also... overall I am just disappointed... anyway, if you want to read the journal letter, here is the link...  urlLink click here     Anyway, I got to study hard for my exams for the next few weeks... wish me luck... cooli...  Peter                               It is Christmas day!!! Merry Christmas to you all!  Every year around Christmas time... I always came to a realization on how much the world will be a better place if everyday is christmas? Everyone during this time of the year is so much nicer to each other that it is wonderful! How often will you have people on the street wishing you a happy hoildays? Not that often... and wouldn't it be great if this happens everyday? I think so... :O) Also, if we have Christmas everyday... then we will get presents everyday and that will be way cool also... although one of my friend Matt point out to me that, all of us are in fact recieving gifts everyday, but they might not nescessary materialistic gifts... and I think that's so true also... back to the christmas realization things, the atmosphere during christmas time is so peaceful and loving... it is incredible... last night when i was over at my friends house (my family wasn;t around so my friends parents invite me over to their house), we were watching a Christmas program on the Hostory channel and they were saying how the soldier in WW1 stop fighting during christmas time and how the german and the british soldiers in the front line are actually singing christmas songs together and shaking each other hand and stuff like that... it is wonderful... Christmas is simply a wonderful hoilday for christian and non-christian... it is the time of the year when all of us can get together with family and friends and share our love and joy... it is the time of the year when we can appriciate the accompany of each other and share our year stories... it is absolutly wonderful!  Anyway, I hope that you guys are enjoying yourself in this wonderful hoilday and once again, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!   Best Wishes,   Peter                               Hahaha... Matrix Revolution... hahaha... SO SO SO DEEP!!!  Anyway, back to my REAL life... everything is good with me as usual... I finally got my first subscribed issues of Advocate which I is very very very cool :O)  As for my love department, nothing happened as usual, but I guess I haven't been paying much attention to it recently neither so I guess that's ok :O)  As for meeting new people in town, got another new friend who happens to be a Canadian which is kind of cool I think :O) As for work, it is busy and crappy as usual... I just don't get any more time on my own... I am constantly working... which is driving me nuts... LOL... Hahaha... I donno... maybe the lack of sex and the over work is driving me crazy... hahaha, maybe I need to go pick someone up in the clubs or something... just kidding... although, for real, I really need to get a message... my body is all stress and in pain... anyway, right now i am trying to work out my plan for chinese new year hoilday... hopefully, i will get to see some friends back home :O) I can't wait!  Anyway, I love all of you guys, take care everyone... ciao... Peter                               (Sorry that I haven't update this blog for so many months, my life is pretty hactic right now.) First I would like to say, I have been back in Hong Kong for about 3 months now. I liked the city and I sort of liked my job but I wan't that happy and I feel pretty depress since I came in town. I really don't know why is that happening. It was only until tonight that I realized what's wrong with me! Tonight, Mikey, Dave, Stan, John and my friend Chad (not a boardie) have been trying to cheer me up because I was complaining about my love life. I was complaining about how I don't have a boyfriend. I was complaining on how nobody ever loves me and everyone only wants to be my friend. I don't know why I feel that way, but I just do. I thought that's the reason why I am sad and that's the reason why I am kind of depress but it is not.  I am not sad because I don't have a boyfriend, it was more like the fact that I am so far away from all my friends back home. For an example, Chad, a friend that I met from second year of university whom I haven't talk to for ages came online tonight. I immediately got so excited and I felt that I am the happiest person on this planet. Later on that night, a friend Adam from school and a friend Darren from high school also dropped me a line and I became even happier since. I think I am not sad because I don't have a boyfriend (althought that just increases my sadness) but I am sad because I don't get to talk to all my friends back home.  I have been saying I need a bf since I came out, and I have been complaining about my love life but none of these were the real issues. They were just the fuel to a more complex problem. My real problem is that I am not that happy here in Hong Kong. Not because of work, not because of the environment nor was it the culture or the people but it was more like I am bore and I don't know anyone. I want to chat with my friends back home but due to the time difference, it is very difficult. There is no where I can share my daily experience with the most important group of people in my life and that's why I am sad. I donno how can I fix this problem and I don't see there is any easy solutions, I guess I will just have to live with this and do my best to keep in touch. But I think I am strong and I will survive. As time goes, I am sure everything is ok. Hopefull that's true. Anyway, to all my friends, I just want to say I love you guys and girls. MUAH... Ciao. Peter                               As promised yesterday, I am going to post some picture of my china office.  1) Small building on the left is the sample room / Big building on the right is the factory    2) Main Entrance    3) Inside the Sample Room    So what do you think? Looks very clean and sexy right? haha... I swear it is that clean everyday and we didn't clean it just for the picture :)  In the sample room, there's about 120 workers. In the factory next door, there's about 450 workers. Beside this factory, we also have 2 contracted factories that manufacture for my company. Besides the 3 factories, there's many other beadings company and embroidiery company that we need to co-ordinate. It is quite impressive in terms of logistic point of view to make sure everything is running smoothly. We need to make sure each factory has the proper materials at the right time. We also need to make sure all the beadings and embroidiery finish on time for each factory.  In our own company, we used track code to keep track of the production status of each lot of products. At each check point (Material Cutting, Beadings, Embroidiery, 3 different step of Sewing, 3 different step of Ironing, Quality Check, Packing), we will scan the bar code of each lot of products to ensure everything is running smoothly. Most people don't understand how complicate this is. Think about it this way, if something got mixed up, there is no way to figure out which pieces of material is for which dress and for each size unless there is some point of reference. So computer helps a lot and help make things much easier.  Anyway, I am working on a big post right now to summarized my experience so far since I worked in Hong Kong. I will post some pictures of my trip to Italy, France, Dubai, Lebanon, New York, Las Vegas, etc. Hopefully you will find it fun to read. Take care for now. Ciao Ciao.  Peter                                WHY DOESN'T PEOPLE THINK?   Why doesn't people think before they do something? Sometimes it drives me nuts! For example: tonight I discover that my housemate took my laundry out of the dryer and then put it on the floor and mixed it with my other housemate dirty cloths. WHY WHY WHY? Can't people simply think about the fact that clean cloths wasn't suppose to mix with dirty cloths??? Now I have to put up a sign just so that this won't happens again! Sometimes I wonder why doesn't people spend two seconds of their time to just think about what they are doing before they actually do it!!!   Sometimes, thinking a little might actually be good for you... working your brains out a little will improve your situation awareness and your responds time to common problems. I sometimes really wonder, how do we actually think? Afterall, we were just a bunch of H2O and Carbon and some other atom mixed together... so really how do all of these atoms have the ability to think? This is just too weird... If you ever figure it out how do we think then let me know :)  Peter                                urlLink CBC - Canada Votes 2004   Election OH Election... it is election time again... It just gets people going on wonders who will win this election? Will there be a majority government? Will the Liberal lose? Will the opinion poll just be a bunch of jokes that people will vote for Liberal on election date anyway? Nobody will know until it actually happens...   As for voting, I was going to vote, but it is too late now... I didn't send it my ballot as it will not get back to Ottawa in time (for any overseas canadian, they need to mail in their ballot before election day to be counted)... so my vote will not counts... this is the horrible things about Canadian in another country who wanted to vote... it is not fair and they should have a better system of doing this... There's so many Overseas Canadian who will want a say in their government, in Hong Kong alone, there's an estimate of 200,000 Canadians who lives here... so there's a people who never have their say as to who should be their Prime Minister...   To me, I think technology will help... With our lives so connected with the internet anyway, why can't we vote online? If the government think this is not a safe approach... then why can't we vote at the Canadian Consulate around the world instead of mailing in the ballot? This is something the government should look into in future elections...   Anyhow... let's wait and see the results very very soon :O)  Peter oh Peter             \n'''\n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
