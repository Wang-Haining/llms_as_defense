Support John Kerry  --  I got results back on both catscans and MRI'S for my migraines and a 'growth' on my right rib cage.     As far as the migraines are concerned , everything was negitive and though they persist are being treated with meds.     The growth on my right rib cage is going to need further tests to either rule out or diagnose a list of diseases. There is apparently no connection between the growth and migraines which is a good thing. I am going to a surgeon for a consultation and I may have to have this removed via surgery. Sounds like fun to me ... :( .   What ever. Wil update when more info becomes avaliable .    --  I have been having re-occuring problems with my Dell ( what else is new ) . Well, I asked for a refund and to my surprise have be granted one . Dell wants 144.00 (15%) for re-stocking fee etc but otherwise I will be re-paid $844.00. This is great and thrilling news considering I was ready to really fight Dell for a refund.     I will be purchasing a new  iMac G5  when they are released and shipped during the month of September. So between the time of the return of the Dell and the arrival of the iMac , I will be using Ross's AMD comp. I am back at sqaure one here but with patience I will be happy with a fantastic and beautiful iMac.         --                          I have had a 'not so fun' last 8 months, and I often think about the events that have taken place. I often think of my Mother. I know I cant do anything about her death , but I like to think that she is still with me every where I am. Maybe I am holding on to the feeling that she is still around, maybe I gota let go but I dont know what to do.  Everyday still even 8 months later I wake up expecting to see my mom downstairs fixing breakfast for me etc. I still set 4 placemats at dinner sometimes. I guess I just gota get use to it and let go from this feeling of loss. The problem is,I dont know how.   There are many serious and tragic events that has happend to me since November 5th 2002, my life could be a fucking movie with all  the real drama thats gone on in my life. Not that I am looking for excuses but sometimes you just hit a wall that keeps you from functioning normally for months, as I have been experiencing.   I dont want to depress anyone. Just needed to vent.                      Ya know....  I mean my life hasn't been 'ideal' or fun this past year. I mean,,, its been awful. Today I went to pick out a gravestone for my mom. I mean, I never thought I would have to do something like this this early in my life. I guess,,, I always thought she would see me graduate and get married and have children etc. Isn't that what is suppose to happen? I guess not to everyone.  I probably should be more positive but its hard. I am going on this trip to Bermuda , with out my mom. I almost feel guilty in going. Nothing much I can do about it. Just have to try to have a good time.   Yes I go to the Hamptons etc -- ( i hate how people are like 'O wow the hamptons...' so what, people if you have nothing good to say, dont say it. I mean it doesnt make sense that people are get up in my face when I mention things like that. Ohwell. I guess thats just how 'society ' is.   Just gota think positive and have fun on this trip.   -------------------------------- Police Explorer meeting tomorrow night. I think it will be more peaceful then last time. We all did a good job at the carnival,, more of a time for celebration for that then anything.   Will update after meeting tomorrow night.    USA!                      Support our troops! --  Migraine was nothing serious, as so the the doc says.   --  I was discussing my take on women with someone and apparently what I want in a gal is to much to ask. :   'LanceA28: no but u see my point **** : No I don't.  Because you shop for girls like your at Circuit City buying TVs.  You want the most expensive one, the thin one, the one that looks nice, that people will be impressed with when they visit you. LanceA28: well i want more then a plasma tv. i want to know it intimatly ****:Yea, you want to sit in front of it every night, staring at it's beauty, you want to take it in for all it's worth.  The amazing technology.It doesn't matter what it says to you, what's on the screen, it's just that it's yourself, in your own home.  It's a status symbol and something to marvel at and you like it.The point is that you need to look beyond looks, so to speak.  People are not objects.  You should shop with a blindfold on.  What does looks matter if one's personality is horrible.  Sure, you don't want someone who's wider than your uncle's hummer, but your standards are unreasonable.'  Now what **** says is not exaclty accurate. I love women for who they are and for what they have to offer into a relationship. A relationship is a mutual thing. The dictionary stating a relationship to be, 'The condition or fact of being related; connection or association.' I agree , 100% .   Women are amazing and should alway be treated with 100% respect and with dignity. Any less is unacceptable in todays society.                       Support our troops!  -------------------  Well , Jen , My EX girlfriend and I are not getting along very well. Suddenly she realized that she lives in VA and its so far away for a relationship more then a friendship. Cant do much about it. I dont think I will see her again for a long time. She and I argued then she cryed, uggg, a mess. Lindsay had to be the middle person between us.  She didnt want to talk to me directly. I didnt realize it but she was having a hard time with the fact that we both want a relationship ,  but it would be near impossible due to distance.   She tends to party everyonce and a while and I cant trust her that well, god only knows who she will go out with behind my back and like 8 hours away!    Eitherway, if we did get together , life would move on , we would breakup and go to college etc. Any relationship would dwindle eventualy, we all will go our seperate ways at somepoint, meet new people etc. Ohwell.  So I found someone in JBHS. Is it a realistic person? I think yes.  I hope we speak more often. We have little conversations and just this year gotten to know each others names .   There is 1 other person that I have liked in the past but I dont see it working, as it didnt work the first time. We will have to see.  --  Carwash for Explorers at EMS 9-3 pm Saturday.

Support John Kerry --  As I sit and observe a teenage couple yesterday , I realize how good but often the ups and downs of a relationship especially at our age ( 16.17,18 ) is just to much to handle. I know some will tell u otherwise and the opposite of how I feel. But as I write this I cant help but think that its such a very temporary relationship and almost more problems come from it then good.  As most are aware that our buddy Ross , feels very strongly on this issue. He may tell you he doesnt want sex etc from a relationship right now and thats fine. I dont know how many of him are out there who dont want that . Either way .  So if we break all this down , what makes teenagers go out with one another? What is the reason? Obviously you want to be more then friends with the person but  how  far do you want to go with that? I just think that many teens are in a relationship for little or no reason at times , also not knowing what they want out of it and end up getting hurt in the end.  Bottom line:  Looking for a solution? Dont go out with someone unless you know what you want out of the relationship and how long it  could  last .                        Support our troops!  --   I got to thinking what it would be like if life had a ' rewind ' or ' pause ' button. Would you know when to use it ?   If you were to pause time trying to keep and capture a cherrished unstained moment that you will spend the rest of your life to reclaim , is it worth it, is it reality? These are some of the questions I ask. Some say memories are just images of good and bad. Memories are not just that but a taste of what was. Its a sense of of imagery that provides good and bad emotions , sentiment and soul. Sure the times are gone , but is it not worth it to rekindle a time that may once have been the summit of your life?   Would you change anything that was bad or good? And if so , what would be changed. After reading thus far , you may be thinking , whats the point of this because its impossible to rewind or pause time. Well I say to that , its provides reflection , rumination,speculation and  consideration.   I am not saying I would try to change the world but I would think twice on many actions of which I have taken. Ahh! But now I think that maybe what I want to change would cause more damage then good. The course of time etc would easily be off balance by changing the date I was born and my mom (med advacement reasons). Realistically I wish I could have changed the relationship with my father. I continue to think it was my fault that our reltionship is the way it is. Though I dont know exactly how I would start there, for that would alter my life so much for the good.    I have entertained the thought of being in specific places at certain times before something tragic occured.   This is just thoughts that have run through my head and I wanted to see them in writing. Ofcourse I can not do any of these things. Given what I would change I would probably try to apply the circumstance to the present time and deal with it from there.                       Well.... my life just goes up and down and right now as of this hour its very much down. My grandfather has got to get over my mother as do everyone else, but him inparticular. I just cant stand the arguments about stupid little things . We all take our frustration out lately on small problems and never address the real issue, thought and opinions are just buiding in all of our heads with out them being heard. Not good. I dont know what to do. All I know is,,, I hope the carnival is on tonight to get me out of the house and give me something productive to do.  I really have just gota stay out of everyone's way for a bit... I guess I am the one that causes all the problems around here. I never thought that till now,,, but its become very clear I have caused more problems then joyus moments. I think after the trip to Bermuda I gota figure something out---what I am not sure,, running away will not solve much,,convincing my grandfather to get help will never work,, what options do I have? VERY LITTLE!! :( .   I just gota get out of this house for some time. We all need this upcoming vacation. Brian and I will have a lot of fun because we can do what we want when we want. Tennis,golf,mopeding,jet skiing, u name it. :) ?   I just need to go to the carnival tonight, I need time away from home and doing something to take my mind off things. :(.          \n'''\n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
