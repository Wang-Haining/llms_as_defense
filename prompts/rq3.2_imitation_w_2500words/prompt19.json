I didn't think she liked me that much...(and who wants to be known as making babies cry??) but she actually warmed up to me later. I also saw a bunch of other aunts, uncles, and cousins. But I was mobbed by my grandma (from my dad's side) who then proceed to grope my ass while hugging me. I've noticed that my other grandma, and occassionally my mom, do that sometimes.  What is with the butt thing?  Leave me alone!! ::sigh:: It was still great to see them all again.       How kawaii!  It's s/t my aunt gave me from the cake.   I saw another lil cousin, Anica (she's 3 yrs old), which is always amusing since she's used to having her way and does that most hilarious things. She started to strip her clothes off because she had wanted to swim but Sophie (another baby cousin) had her suit. LOL. Geez, she's bold. Then again, I guess all three-yrs-olds are typically carefree.       Here's the b-day girl!  Eating my kitty...no!! Well, maybe she's attracted to the frosting still on it...                               Well, I failed my b-t-w driving test this morning. Yeah...I went into a shock at first. I didn't really think about it. But then I went throught this whole 'self-hating->angry->depressing->perky, oh well it happened ' phase afterwards. I kind of feel sorry for the poor soul that was with me (my mom). I lost the attitude when we went over to Office Depot to return s/t. A cute sales guy helps us out...hard to stay mad after that. I swear my mom has the ability to read minds. Because I was thinking of Baskins Robins and as we got out to the parking lot she said 'don't worry, I treat you to some ice cream.' Weird. So, I drowned out any depressing thoughts w/ a nice wafflecone of cherry jubilee that the lady literally doused w/ whipped cream and almonds (::it was too much but mmm...it was yum::).  Anywayz, I started looking at the plus side to this 'failed' test with an optimistic light. My consolation was that this test was  way  better than the practice test I took with John the driver instructor. That practice test went......badly, to put it in simpler terms. I mean this time, on the  real  test, I didn't make  any  dangerous manuevers or go in the opposite lane. I think that's a LOT of improvement. I still made a critical error today though. I made a nice right turn...but didn't stop at the RED light before doing it. Oops. And he intervened by telling me 'stop.' I was decelarating and going to stop! sheesh.   I mean it's not like I hit anything or maimed a pedestrian.    But I'm over it. Better luck next time I guess. I'm re-taking my permit exam this Fri. b/c it expires on Thurs. The receptionist showed disapprovement at my situation but oh well. She should happy that the roads are still considered safe and she doesn't have to fear for her life. Well, yet anywayz...                          After my hair was done (b/c I'm hopeless when left by myself), I went straight to the Lifetouch studio for my senior photos. I got the Silver pkg (which included two outfits along w/ the yearbook shots) and the cap and gown option. Now, I'm usually terrified of taking yearbook pictures...for me, at least, I always hate my pictures no matter what anyone tells me. In freshman and sophmore year, my hair was curled and lil too poufy---it looked like I had afro. Seriously. I hated it. In junior year, it was mostly straight but wavy---not so bad but I thought I looked way too happy in the picture. ::sigh::  Anywayz, the studio was so cool! Lots of fun backdrops. And it went by quick too...and painless. Fun, too. I recognized a bunch of people from school there. I was suprised that I wasn't nervous a lot---actually it would have been a challenge b/c the photographers were so friendly. Probably b/c they're pros, who knew exactly what they were doing---not like the bumbling fools hired at regular school photo shoots for the year, where the flash is blinding and the risk of blinking on film is high.  Well, I hoped these pics turn out good...I won't know till two weeks. Which reminds me that I need to pick up the stuff Kristine and I painted plus I need to do my b-t-w test...                           I'm only 16!I can't be losing my hair! That's for  really  old people! My hair stylist, Rozban, said so and tells me that it's probably due to stress. She informed me (and my mom) that stress can be caused by a wide range of troubles---academics, parents arguing, etc. Ha! I knew it! My family does give me stress. But I still want to keep my hair!! So, I'm suppose to use my mom's special shampoo b/c it's ph balanced w/ other good hair-care qualities. I always thought losing a little hair was normal (avg person loses 40 strands a day) but I guess in my case it's not a little but enough to start thinning my hair! WHY ME??!! Well, my session went nicely after that lil shocker. I had it cut to long layers so it's still mid-back. I luv that length! When I was little, I had long, straight hair but an unfortunate hair cut accident w/ my dad in the 3rd grade left me w/ hair chopped right below my ears!  Anywayz, Rozban styled my hair quite nicely afterwards (I was going to take my senior pics later). Shiny and sleek with bouncy curls at the ends. Best haircut ever! Made me forget about the whole 'hair ' thing. Besides if I use that shampoo, my hair should stop doing  that  and return to a healthy state in 3 weeks. She's also giving me a deal on this hair serum from Avaeda that keeps hair shiny and soft. It really does pay to have connections w/ a hair stylist. ^_^                            Well, today the DMV wasn't closed, it just didn't open till 8:30 a.m. instead of its regular 7:30. Why? That's thanks to the 'Saturday session' this week. I had to waited for over an hour in line. Not funny to me. I felt drained when the doors finally opened. Ya know the price for a permit doubles (???) when you have to redo it. ::sigh:: But, as I was in the lil testing room, there was a nervous 1st timer on my left and a confused immigrant on my right. I just sat all calm and checking off answers w/ confidence. However, there were a bit annoying. They seriously needed to relax. And to stop that tapping and frustrating sighing. Plus, never forget how the DMV doesn't care whether you have peace while taking the test. Annoucements were as loud as ever and the people outside of the room didn't have the decency to keep it down. Good thing I used to working under distractions.  Fortunately, I passed the written exam again. 100% this time (the lady turned the 100 into a smiley face). I had three errors the last time and now that I think of it, they were dumb questions to miss. But, oh well...c'est la vie. Now about that behind-the-wheel test...                           I'm currently writing up my UC essay assignment for AP English. The first two questions about academics and potential to contribute were very easy! But the third question is a toughie. It's why I'm out blogging instead of answering. It's an open-ended question. Sounds easy but no; I'm suffering from writer's block.  This is the part on the UC application where I put down anything that I think the universities should know about me. My friend Robert advises me to put a sad, sob story---if I have one. It's pathetic but true. Colleges really lap up heartbreak. It's too bad I've been mostly spoiled throughout my life. Damn. I can totally write a fictionally sob story but then (knwing my luck) I'll probably get caught. Then no other college will even think of perusing my application. Cheaters only cheat themselves. So I'm told.  I still think Mrs. Cutler (the AP English 12 teacher) is an evil slave driver. (I thought the same for Ms. Burrows--my 7th grade teacher, but I dubbed her a minion from hell.) I know this is AP, but  come on ! I have a life too. Well it's like this. In addition to finishing the UC essay (which I guess I appreciate, lord knows I would have procrastinated in November), I have to do an annotated bibliography for 25 essays out of the Fields of Writing (someone should burn those those fields) and another annotated bibliography for 20 'My Turn' essays out of Newsweek. Hmmm....I don't know about anybody else but that a LOT of analyzing! Oh the slave driver also wants the UC essay due Monday, Aug. 2nd, I have less than a week left. Oh joy.  Earlier, I sent an IM to my 'friend' Jessica. I used quotations because as of late I don't considered her a true friend b/c sometimes she is, sometimes she isn't. We're in a lot of classes and clubs together so I see her a lot. She's friendly when she needs me but when it's the other way around it's all ---> 'oh, sorry, I'm busy...I have music...I have this...I have a test...I have mono...' Well okay I made the last one up but she's really is like that! It's only academics (and the flute---out of all the instruments to choose...the flute...) with that girl. Another thing is that I would be talking to someone in class and she butts right into the conversation. All of the sudden I'm out of the conversation because she has steered it to something I either really don't care about or have no clue about. Or we're in a club meeting and she hardly acknowledges that I'm there. Well, that's  some friend . Honestly, that why I hardly study with her. Also, it's not as if she needs me there anyway; she can handle it herself---she is uber brainy.  Anywayz, I need to get back to the essay if I want to meet deadline. Bientot!                          Life's full of lovely random suprises. Kristine picked me up @ 10 a.m. and we went to TVHS to turn in our UC essays to Ms. Cutler. Well, we go there and Ms.Culter replies---'You didn't double-space?' At that point, I think my face blanched. I swear (and I doubled checked) that this lil bit of info was NOT in the instructions. So Kris and I rushed to my house, where we promptly had to retype her essay and print mine out with the correct spacing. When she was done typing it was 15 minutes to 11 a.m., our deadline. As I was finishing my corrections, I told her to warm up the car. It felt like we were doing a heist. lol. I then rushed out of my house like a mad woman into her car that was ready to go and we sped off (hmmm... I wonder how fast we were driving?). Kris pulled up to the front office and I  ran  out of the car to deliver the essay on time (last I checked we still had 5 minutes at the stoplight). lol I didn't even shut the car door. What an adventure! We're always doing crazy things like that. lol.  Anywayz, afterwards we treated ourselves to some Ben and Jerry's, which is surprisingly cheaper than B&amp;R. We were in the Town Plaza, so Kristine wanted to look at the pottery store, Painted Earth. We ended up staying there for about 3 1/2 hrs painting little star shaped ceremic boxes---she had also decided to do a ceramic car for her boyfriend. It was a ton of fun and way relaxing. teehee I got to get in touch w/ my creative, artsy side!                            My family went out to this chinese buffet for dinner tonight. The exciting part is that I got to drive there (in a separate car from my siblings and with my dad to supervise, of course). It was going good and I even parked correctly this time! lol. Not something that's frequent with me.  However, after dinner...I swear my dad showed signs of PMS. What's his problem? Kept screeching about take turn now, no this turn!! Well, if I could concentrate maybe, just maybe, I could pay more attention to the light. Wouldn't that be much better? Not to mention, safer? I should just ignore him completely and only pick up when he's talking about turning. There. Well, it's seems childish--but that's how he's acting too.  Then, we came home after stopping for a few groceries from VONS (which btw he didn't help me upload or put them away--the selfish...). Oh, I bought a few magazines and some gum to add to the cart at the store in vengence. Do I need to know what the lastest trends for fall are? Maybe. Or what celebrity is dating who? Hell, no. But will it make my dad spend more money than he has to? Of course. (It's not as if I don't like teen magazines because I do read them but I can live without them.)  My brother Ryan, who's as irritable as hell, comments 'Oh, you have no taste in food....oh, why did you choose that?' My response: where you there--NO, did you bring the food in--NO, then stuff yourself. That and I didn't tell him where the ice cream was or that we even bought it, well, Mr. Think-He-Knows-All can find it on his own.  Why is my family so damn moody?? Later, at home I found my siblings fighting over a ball. A stupid rubber ball. Of course, that triggered my mom. And well...the rest is chaos. Now, I'm not going to say that they're dysfunctional because they aren't but they freak out at the littlest things  way  too much.  On the plus side, I think I'm ready for my behind the wheel test. My permit expires on Aug. 14th and my test is on Aug. 10th. Think that's cutting it too close? It is! I can't believe it. One chance to make or I start all over again. I'll do fine if I'm not nervous though. And as long as neither of my parents are in the car with me (and they won't, yes!).         \n'''\n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
