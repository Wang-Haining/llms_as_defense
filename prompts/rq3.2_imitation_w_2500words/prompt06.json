Let's talk games.&nbsp; Unfortunately, there still is nothing outstanding in the gaming world.&nbsp; As I've said before, things have really cooled down since E3.&nbsp; If I do find anything, I will notify you as soon as I get the chance.&nbsp; However, here's a tip for online gaming:&nbsp; Don't do it unless you are using a computer.&nbsp; Online gaming platforms, such as Gamecube, X-Box, and Playstation 2 (actually, they are the only online gaming platforms&nbsp;as such) are easier to, and yes it can happen, hack.&nbsp; Hackers can access your memory cards and games via a connected online game.&nbsp; They can totally mess up your system or your memory card.&nbsp; The only safe online gaming is on a computer, and preferrably with some anti-virus and/or firewall software installed.&nbsp; Unless of course, some one comes out with similar protection later.  Want some earn some cash without even leaving your computer?&nbsp; Go to the  urlLink Nintendo Street Team &nbsp;website and learn how to become an Honorary Street Teamer and get $5,000 dollars in cash!&nbsp; What do you have to do?&nbsp; Simply go to the site every week, look over each team's photo albums of the event, cast your vote on which team you think did the best (and don't be prejudice and only vote for your local team), and come back the next week!&nbsp; Not only that, but there is a calendar with a list of events with times and places so you can visit one near you!&nbsp; Check out the wheels they travel in, play a few games, check out their sweet swag, and meet the team!  As for the anime world, your cable or satellite provider most likely will not offer it, unless your current provider can use the forward and rewind functions, such as Tivo.&nbsp; What a bummer.&nbsp; Either way, if you can watch it, you ought to get it.&nbsp; 24/7 anime...can life get any better?                  Dave Winer, creator of Weblogs.com, suddenly disabled 3,000 blogs the website listed last weekend, and no blog owner is happy. I owned one of those 3,000 blogs, and I am infuriated at Winer at this moment. The cause of the event was the extreme load the database was putting on Dave's servers, and his pocketbook, so he unplugged the servers.  Tablet PC's, the biggest flop of the PC market, is said to be growing in popularity in some places, but is still not taking of in the business field.  Sprint workers are mad right about now, the cell phone giant cut 1,100 workers from it's payroll.  After being mashed to a pulp by video game and movie companies, 321 Studios, makers of DVDXCopy, may be at death's door. The company that had once 400 employees is now down to 20.   Maxtor and Lynksys are getting married! Well, they're at least teaming up to create a wireless hard drive.  Apple's stock, (APPL), has reached an all time high of $32.74. Way to go, Apple!  Camera manufacturer Nikon has announced they may move away from film cameras. The little roll of brown plastic is finally going out of style.                   Hello one and all!  As previously stated, I am Jace.  I'll be your guy for all your video gaming needs, keeping you up-to-date with systems, games, and anything else you can think of.  So, to start off, let's go to this year's E3(Electronic Entertainment Expo) convention to tell you off the latest systems, or should I say, systEM.  Yes, this is it ladies and gentlemen:  The Nintendo DS!  Check it out!  This thing has 2 LCD screens which allows you to view your game from 2 prospectives at once!  For example, you could be playing a racing game.  The lower screen would have your racing view and the top would have a map and position listing.  Not only that, but they can reproduce a 3-D view and, like SP, are backlit.      Next we have the new Touch-Screen capability.  This thing will allow you to operate your games like a PDA!  Now you don't just have to rely on buttons!      That's not it!  This thing now has a Microphone port!  This means that you can use voice-commands to hand-clapping to perform basic operations!      Guess what!  Wireless networking!!!  You can now perform multiplayer tasks on a local wireless network with up to 16 players!  Quadruple the fun!  You have a range of up to 30 feet, but later you'll be able to go far beyond that, possibly by nationwide hub connections.  Also, there will be a LAN connection on which you could allow, theoretically, an infinite amount of players to connect at a hot spot and compete.  The protocol by which the wireless communication operates allows high response rates for real-time play and low battery consumption.      Messenger capabilities!  You can use a touch-screen keyboard or microphone to chat, send drawings, and more!      Wireless Game Sharing!  Certain games will be able to compete on wireless networks, even if only one person has the game!  Some will even allow you to test-play games!      As stated earlier, the system will have 3-D capabilities, which can surpass images similar to the N-64!  The 60 fps rate will allow details like fog effects and cel shading!      Speakers are now 16-channel and allows for a wider variety of voices, music, and enriched SFX.  A headphones jack is included for stereo sound.      Power management is excellent, using a rechargeable battery with low-energy consumption design.  It has Sleep mode functions as with SP, but also a new Standby mode!  The Standby mode is used mostly for multiplayer if the other is sends an IM.      The processing will be two processors: 1 ARM9 and 1 ARM7      The media format is new also!  They are now making compact cards with a semi-conductor memory, allowing lower cost, shorter manufacturing time, and more than 1 Gigabit of mem!      Finally, we have dual slots!  It will be able to read GBA games and developers are working on a way to connect between DS and GBA games!      Tell me this is not awesome for a portable sys!  But if you want to check it out yourself, you can learn just about everything I've listed here and more at http://www.nintendo.com/e3_2004/ds/index.jsp  Tomorrow: More about games displayed at the E3 convention!                 As Zach has already mentioned to you all, the current owner of the Lyoko Network is considering making me owner of the site.&nbsp; He still has not decided, considering I and one other person are valid candidates for the promotion, but I'm preparing in advance.&nbsp; I will also continue to search for space for my other forums, however, my time will be consumed with managing both.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to clarify a bit on the details of the transfer:&nbsp;  One-I am in no way ensured an administrator position.   Two-If I do attain an adminstrator position through the other candidate, I will have to clear all policy changes and additions through her.&nbsp;   Three-If I do attain administrator position with full site access, then I will require&nbsp;a temporary, but quite possibly permanent, a volunteer web coder/master (Sorry, but I'm a little low on cash at the moment.).&nbsp;   Four-Sending messages to me will require a stricter abidement when composing in sending (Again, I apologize, but I'm one of those people who get's frustrated and explodes if I get overwhelmed from being unorganized.).   Five-My time will be very limited to each site I manage, including this one.&nbsp; I will do my best to keep you all up to date with the anime/gaming world.&nbsp; Any volunteer help will be appreciated (Perhaps once I get some more cash, I can begin paying people that help, but at this point it doesn't look likely.).   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, let's get back to what I'm here for.&nbsp; Sorry guys, but nothing outstanding in the gaming world.&nbsp; As for the anime world, check this out:        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A new television station is coming soon to Cable & Satellite! Be sure to visit  http://www.theanimenetwork.com/  to get information on the new television station, which has the following anime on it's list:  All Purpose Catgirl, nuku-nuku  Angelic Layer  Arc the Lad  Aura Battler Dunbine  Azumanga Daioh  Blue Seed  Boogiepop Phantom  Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040  Burn Up Excess  Burn Up W  Chobits  City Hunter  Colorful  Dai-Guard  Eden's Bowy  Excel Saga  Full Metal Panic&nbsp; Gasaraki  Golden Boy  Gunsmith Cats  Kimera  Kino's Journey  Legend of the Mystical Ninja  Magical Shopping Street Abenobashi  Martian Successor Nadesico  Najica Blitz Tactics  Neo Ranga  Neon Genesis Evangelion  New Cutey Honey  Ninja Resurrection  Noir  Nuku Nuku-Dash  Orphen  Pretear  Princess Blade  Princess Nine  RahXephon  Rune Soldier  Saiyuki  Sakura Wars  Samurai X  Samurai X: The Motion Picture  Sin  Sorcerer Hunters  Sorcerous Stabber Orphen  Spriggen  Steam Detectives  Steel Angel Kurumi  Tekken  Those Who Hunt Elves  Voices of a Distant Star  Wild Arms  You're Under Arrest  Zaion  Zone of the Enders   The official Anime Network Countdown watch has begun. Anime Network is set to go live 24/7 this Tuesday, July 27, 2004. Be sure to visit  http://www.theanimenetwork.com/  for pictures of the event, and for more information!    -Quote From the Lyoko Network (JWagner12787)  Is this not awesome?                  Wal-Mart's test of their new RFID tage in merchandise has been quite successful. The RFID tags were used in stores and warehouses in the Dallas area. They say that the electronic tags will lower the amount of thefts, and keep their stores better stocked.  Apple is a clever group! They are attempting to get a patent on the translucent widow effect that is planned in the new version of Windows, (code named  Longhorn .) This is a big punch in the face for Microsoft.  This is a great move for Apple. Apple is planning to slow the intervals of releases of new versions of OS X. They are going to show off their new version of OS X, 'Tiger', at the Worldwide Developers Conference next month.  Nasal rap singer Eminem sued Apple for copyright infringement, but the judge overruled it, so Apple is back to their spotless record.  We may even have ANOTHER contributor soon, Heather Cheney will be providing us with Mac facts and tips. Expect her to make her debut this weekend.  This has been a Mac filled day!                    I apologize for not posting in a while. I have just bought  The Sims Deluxe Edition  and I can''t stop playing it. I'm at the library once again and the kids reading session is about to begin on the other end of the room. &nbsp; My former contributor and good friend, Jace Walker, has  urlLink written a novel  based on the hit French anime series, Code: Lyoko.&nbsp;On the home page,&nbsp;it's the first installation of Code: Lyoko - Chaos Factor. Jace is also constructing a forum on Code: Lyoko, so when that premieres you'll be some of the first to know. Heck, he's getting so successful I think I'll bring him back, if that's okay with my readers. Please comment on this post with your opinion. &nbsp; I also want to thank my readers for being with me this whole summer, making my website a wonderful palce to be. When I was thinking of giving up this site, people came to read and comment. After August 11th, don't expect a whole lot of posts during the weedays, for my first year in high school will be a busy one. Thanks again and keep visiting, because I think we're gonna be here a while...          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
