Jessie (fat cat - scottish fold reject) is sleeping on the floor. I find it odd that she sleeps on the floor, after all, the floor heating isn't that warm.  Recently, both cats have been sleeping on Arnie's (dogs) bed. It's really funny, because Jessie does the clawing thing (dig claws in, pull up, purr, dig claws in etc etc) as if she has standards, but actually being on the dog bed counteracts that.  Maybe if I gave them some butter, or cheese, they'd wake up. Arnie always wakes up if there's cheese...  I guess I'm just bored. Only two people online - Glen (Juggs) and Neo from NK. I wonder what happened to Superman. I mean - I was originally his sidekick, which is where I got the name SideKick from. And lanky - haven't seen him in a bit either.  Alot of people just slowly disappear. And you never hear about it because you're not in their index of friends, but you still miss them, because they're a common face. Someone you used to look up to fondly, or just joke around with.            Stevo asked me to go out with him!  He full on wants to take me out to tea with him!! RUN AWAY! RETREAT!  I gave him the whole distance lecture, how he could be some sick freak, etc etc. He doesn't get it. He wants to 'give me the world'.  Ho hum.  Today I woke up at 4pm. I got to sleep at 3 and woke up at 4. This is not good. D will come home tomorrow I think.  Tara's going out with a guy she hates. She's hoping to find some shit on him so she can break up with him guilt free. Shyanne (Sheila-Anne) is still pretty embarrassing. Why does no one ever believe I have been in a relationship!? Shyanne has said this before and said something along the lines yesterday. It's really kind of embarrassing. I mean, I knew at school I was really shy and everything, but is it that unbelieveable? Hmm, I wish I was some kind of weird person everyone hated on the net. That would solve alot of problems.  I feel really really used. I need my sister back in Ballarat and on mohaa and ts - everyone would 'love' her alot more than me.  I hate that word. I can understand why people use it, but I hate it. It's like telling a complete stranger to carry your bags. It's odd and uncalled for. Especially since every time you say it, it's like playing a completely new game - not just a new level but a completely unrelated game.  Silly peoples.  Edit: Ok, tonight I said that word I hate. And I meant it. And now I am confused - so please people, let me have a week to ponder this - don't ask questions, please. I need this off my chest, hence the reason I'm writing it here, but I can't.... tell you about it.             Stevo is taking everything a bit too personal.  Oh fuck.  Ok, it just occured to me what a fucking idiot I am. Daniel hasn't been around, hasn't spoken to me. He's probably read all this and said 'Fuck that bitch'.  Flucking hell.  Ok, well, I might as well just summarise my day, seeing as I'm here.  Uhh, pretty average. At around 5:30 or something, I was resting and fell asleep till 11 sometime? I don't know. But the dog was with me for about 5 minutes before my parents came back - I pretty much fell asleep then.  Uhh, we went on ts and abused people - it was actually really overrated. Achtung's been saying shit about how much he hates me.  It's funny listening to all their fights though.   RANDAL   An embolism in a pool.      DANTE   An embarrassing way to die.      RANDAL   That's nothing compared to how my   cousin Walter died.      DANTE   How'd he die?      RANDAL   Broke his neck.      DANTE   That's embarrassing?      RANDAL   He broke his neck trying to suck   his own dick.  *Absolute silence. Then...*      DANTE   Shut the hell up.      RANDAL   Bible truth.      DANTE   Stop it.      RANDAL   I swear.      DANTE   Oh, my god.      RANDAL   Come on. Haven't you ever tried to   suck your own dick?      DANTE   No!      RANDAL   Yeah sure. You're so repressed.      DANTE   Because I never tried to suck my   own dick?      RANDAL   No, because you won't admit to it.   As if a guy's a fucking pervert   because he tries to go down on   himself. You're as curious as the   rest of us, pal. You've tried it.      DANTE   Who found him?      RANDAL   My cousin? My aunt found him. On   his bed, doubled over himself with   his legs on top. Dick in his mouth.   My aunt freaked out. It was a mess.      DANTE   His dick was in his mouth?      RANDAL   Balls resting on his lips.      DANTE   He made it, hunhh?       RANDAL   Yeah, but at what a price.  *Silence. Then...*      DANTE   I could never reach.      RANDAL   Reach what?      DANTE   You know.      RANDAL   What, your dick?      DANTE   Yeah. Like you said, you know. I   guess everyone tries it, sooner of   later.      RANDAL   I never tried it.  *DANTE glares at RANDAL. Silence. Then...*      RANDAL   Fucking pervert.   From Clerks. That's pretty much the summary of Stevo/Achtung/HeadShot's fights.            I feel like writing again because I can't directly administer my words to whom I wish to.  However, the words do not come to me. They do not trickle from my soul into my limbs. They just sit quietly, biding their time. What are they waiting for? I have not a clue. I wish I could write what I want to, but when I think of the things I want to write, they seem to evaporate.  I told you how I seem, You replied with mercy, Compasion and disease, Yet you did not question, What it honestly meant, Yet you did not want me, And this is why I am, Betting against you.  You seemed impressed, pleased and driven, yet that did not help you, tell me what more to do, I am lost, I am puzzled, I have journeyed, I am resting, Can you help me? In my search, Can you assist in my hunt.  I need clarity, I need wise, Can you assist me, In my hunt?  Confused and bewildered, Is what I am, Have I done nothing, Or done it all? Should I go now, and flee this place, was it yes?  Please help me, find my will, please help me, find my place. I feel for you, drawn to you. I need you, to help me.            Fuck it all.  I have had it with dad's threats.  If he hits me ever, ever again. If he lays a hand on me, I am taking out an AVO. I am going to the police and I will get a restraining order. I don't care anymore. He's threatening to kick me out unless I 'pay my own way'. WELL FUCK THAT. If you were such a fucking great parent you'd respect me and give me a chance to GET HELP before making threats.  I so don't care. If I end up living in some foster home, under some stranger's care, with nothing but the clothes I wear, I don't care. As long as I know that he feels like a failure, because he is one, and god do we all know it.  Let me explain tonight:  He comes home from dropping off my perfect sister, and asks to 'speak with me'. I know what's coming. This kind of thing always happens. Anyway. Is as follows  'You're not going to school anymore. You're going to have to pay for everything now. You will have to pay for internet access, for everything.' So I walk into my room. He tells my mum that he had a talk to me about my etiquette on the phone (earlier today I took a call from him and wasn't very polite - basically I was in a rush). BULLSHIT HE DID. I pipe up from my room. He comes in. Oh great, here we go Basically a lecture follows, I tell him to please leave  - I actually said please. He stares at me and opens his mouth but before he can let out a word, I cut him off 'Goodnight'. He pretty much lunges towards me with his hand raised, I practically have to beg not to get slapped/knocked around. Fortunately I was able to get him to back down.  And he has the nerve to wonder why I don't tell him anything, why I rarely talk to him and the likes.  It's because he doesn't understand anything.  So here I am praying for my stanley knife, but knowing I can't get at it because Naoko is in my room.  I hope I fucking choke on my tears.  I so wish I was dead.             Hand in mine, into your icy blues  And then I'd say to you we could take to the highway  With this trunk of ammunition too  I'd end my days with you in a hail of bullets  I'm trying, I'm trying  To let you know just how much you mean to me  And after all the the things we put each other through and  I would drive on to the end with you  A liquor store or two keeps the gas tank full  And I feel like there's nothing left to do  But prove myself to you and we'll keep it running  But this time, I mean it I'll let you know just how much you mean to me  As snow falls on desert sky  Until the end of everything  I'm trying, I'm trying  To let you know how much you mean  As days fade, and nights grow And we go cold  Until the end, until this blood  Until this, I mean this, I mean this  Until the end of...I'm trying, I'm trying  To let you know how much you mean  As days fade, and nights grow And we go cold  But this time, we'll show them  We'll show them all how much we mean  As snow falls on desert sky  Until the end of every...   All we are, all we are  Is bullets I mean this  As lead rains, will pass on through our phantoms  Forever, forever  Like scarecrows that fuel this flame we're burning  Forever, and ever  Know how much I want to show you you're the only one  Like a bed of roses there's a dozen reasons in this gun  And as we're falling down, and in this pool of blood  And as we're touching hands, and as we're falling down  And in this pool of blood, and as we're falling down  I'll see your eyes, and in this pool of blood  I'll meet your eyes, I mean this forever               Hoorah for exotic accents. God I love the spanish/mexican one. &nbsp; It's interesting when you kindof already know something and when someone tells you something that others would see as crazy or immoral, you just accept it. It took a bit for me to actually have the opportunity to think about (ie; spin it around in my head a few times, exercise the idea etc etc). What only really annoyed me then was something different. &nbsp; It's cold, so I might go lie down for a while till I warm up or something. An early night more than likely. &nbsp; Mmmm, Thursday mum is working all day, but I have an appointment so god knows what I'll be doing. I want to rearange but alot of places have like, set times for people (ie; if you go thursday morning at 9:15, then you go every week at the same time, same day, for the rest of your relationship with said institution). &nbsp; Been listening to more of my sister's music. She took my laptop by mistake back to Melbourne. But it's really funny because she's using some of my pictures for avatars on msn. But some of them are completely out of context and look innocent :P &nbsp; So I guess, I shall end my post here.             Wonderful morning.  Dad's sick - got the flu or something, so he's home. Mum's working all day.  Lots of people online. Just no one I actually talk to :P  Hearshot Kid Disaster - Coheed & Cambria.  I love this song.  I listened to it alot when we went to Brisbane. I way wasn't over Dan when we went (and considering he lives in Brisbane - and I saw his friend every day), so it was a really depressing trip. The song kept me busy. I so didn't enjoy being in Brisbane. I'm glad we went though - simply because of my new clothes :P I don't know what I would do without my cargo's.  I'm sorry. For the lies I've spielt. Please forgive me, For my demise.  I apoligise, with all sincerity, Please accept this, I am alone.  I need who stood by me, supported and cared, back with me, return.  For you know who you are, and you know how much I need you, I'm broken and wrecked,  but I am too weak.  I want to turn back time, and remove all the tapestry, that dared ensue my life. Please, my worm.    \n'''\n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
