Just close your eyes (and read this at the same time! hehe) and think about this. There was a day way back in may, oh soo long ago ;). You were bored, and we were in our talking phase. You told me to come up, and I of course wanted to so I did. When I got there, we had our fun little LOTR trivia dealio, cause we are both dorks like that, but I love it. Then we went for a walk in dark hollow. Just a nice simple, fun, walk. The world faded away behind us, and it was just you and me. You found out I was nervous about you, and I still am just fyi, but that also meant I could open up to you. Then on the way home built up my courage and got to hold your hand. Such a lil accomplishment in todays sex minded world, but it meant a lot to me. And they lived happily ever after is the ending to that lil part. Cause it is is true, been happy ever after that, and I hope you have been too, deep down inside, where it counts. I know there has been a lot of shit going on, but I hope on top of everything, where it really counts, you are still happy. Thats what matters :-*  Now for part two of this. I dunno how much I will be able to talk to you till u get home, so I wanna explain this here so I can save those minutes that cost you so much. I was talking to Heidi today about how nervous I am that your coming home. I want you home, yeah, but I love being with you and don't want to screw it up. I really have put so much 'into' this month, and I just don't want things to fall apart once your home. So I am asking you to do me a favor. If I get too 'in your face' or overbearing or pushy or anything, just tell me to back off. I know you are going to need some space once you get home, and I am not the only person in your life and there are plenty of other people you are going to want to see. So just tell me if I am getting annoying before it makes you or me snap or anything. On the same token, I don't wanna distance myself or anything too. I know this all sounds weird, but me and heidi decided it made sense, so there, lol. I'm just not used to actually having you be here when I want to be with you, so things are going to be odd. But y'know what, that is us, i dunno what we would do if things were normal.  Now I am sorry there is so much to read on here. It is all weird since its out of order too, but oh well. I hope the rest of your trip is as good as possible. Hope the pool went well and no one freaked out or got mad. I smashed my hand today and my finger is swollen and my back is all sore, so it was a good day, nothing too bad ;) hehe. I love you.                       Read the post below this before this one.  I am in a much better mood now, cause I sat down and thought a bit more.  I think what is making the us stuff even harder is the weird way it happened. We had only been 'dating' for a month when you left. Hell only really talking for about another month before that. So two months then your gone a month. Now keep reading cause I know bad stuff is going through your head, hear me out. We didn't have very long to get to know one another, and so i think there are lots of bumps when we can talk for every now and then. I don't expect to hear from you everyday, every other day, hell even once a week i doubted when u left. When you left I just wanted you to go and have a great time, and I would be there to support you every step of the way. What its come down to now is stress and the distance and all that stuff, its just getting rough. I just kinda am starting to break down out of my supportive role and then feel horrible cause im not helping, thats all. Anyhow, back to the only two months thing. It could have been so easy to just wait until after you came back, like you thought about. Or to not want to stay as we are while you were gone, or so many other ways of giving up. Hell even at this point, you could be going off with guys and having a wild time, or we could be at each others throats in anger and such. All I know is that when you left, I thought to myself this is going to make or break us. Nothing has been broken so far :-* Its been hard as hell, I know, and it still isn't over and the last few days are just going to make it that much harder. But think about it, its been 24 days now that you have been gone. That is 3 and a half weeks after only talking to each other for 8 weeks. I thought it was definitely a good thing, and just goes to show that things great are to come. I love you, and I feel you return it, even though you are not here. Things have and will be rough the next few days, but you and I will come out on top, together, and stronger. I love you and am never letting go.  Also, please don't worry about calling me. If you are having a crappy day, I would be more than happy to help. But if you call just for my sake, don't. I don't wanna make that bill bigger than I already have. The only time I really want to talk to you before you leave is right then, right before you do leave, thats all. I also have to admit it just gets damned hard to say goodbye on the phone, so yeah thats the other part of that. Anyhow, I am rambling.   I love you, I hope the mail helped, even if you did have a crappy day and said it didn't and that you weren't feeling better. Like ive said, you're a horrible liar ;). That is all for now. I know youve prolly had an emotional rollercoaster with this and the previous post, sorrie, just had to spill a bit. Feel free to return the favour if you can, if not, no worries.  OMG, funny porn story just happened too. This will sound very, very ironic, but I found a band named budapest while you were gone. I wasn't hunting the name out, I was just clicking through random things online and listening. When I heard them I wanted more and so I have been downloading more songs by them. Well I was doing that when you called and so got up and left. I came back and on the screen there were all the search results, with hundreds of 'hot hungarian budapest love slaves' and what not, lmao. Well my mum saw it and was all like wtf, and i had to explain, in between my laughter. Hope you at least got a giggle out of it, my hungarian love slave ;) can't wait for *that* porn ;) lol  So there, end on a happy note. I love you dearly michelle, more than anything else. *mwah*                       well today sucked cause ive had a sever case of miss-michelle-itis all day. I just, yeah, miss you. A lot. I just want you in my arms and know everything is alright. I know this is going to all sound silly of me, but I don't want things to change. I don't want to have you come back and like hate me, or some other difference. I guess I am just paranoid or something, but its been going thru my head all day. All the people fooling around has me worried too a bit I guess. I know I shouldn't, but I do worry. I hope that isn't evil of me? I mean christen I thought was all like dedicated to derek and whatnot, and kevin is going off and having fun, and you have some un named guy hitting on you heavily and such. I'm sorry, I just jealous easy *sigh* I just don't want to lose you, that is what it comes down to. I love you and love having that returned, and i would never want that to change. You are wonderful michelle. see you in my dreams, where I will be alone no longer. *mwah*                       well today was a kinda long day, but oh well.  I woke up to my dad being in florida and my mum and bro still in ohio, was kinda weird, but oh well.  I did some summer reading work and I also scanned a lot of pictures, so that was productive. But then I got bored and had to find something to do so I eventually went to seans. Curry of course came along, and man is she getting annoying. I need a serious break from her, and much more time with you, or I am going to go crazy. I got to see steve and sean though, so that was cool. I still have yet to see the jodi though, too busy with steve, ugh. I have nothing wrong with missing someone, I understand that completely, but they have done nothing but blown everyone else off for like 4 days now. Blah.   You know what is cool though? By the time you read this you only have one full day and a good bit of traveling and then your here. I am coming out to the airport with ur mum now instead of alex, figured it would be easier and might make some inroads. I also felt bad going with alex as his car was near full and it was just kinda awkward. Oh well.  Well I have to get up early tomorrow, so I am off to bed, early for once. Have to make up for staying up till three this morning too. Plus, the best part is I get to see you again :) Love you much, *mwah*                       I dunno how much of the posts below this you will want to read cause of our convo today. Something about it just put me in the best mood. And I figured out how to phrase what I wanted to say. I don't want to ignore the fact you went to hungary when you get back, I want to learn and know what happened because thats what I would do if your here. I love you and want nothing more than to be with you. Basically, we have a lot of catching up to do :) in a very good way.  and hey :-P not to sound rude, but your time hasnt been that much worse cause ur there. I had my fair share of hard times and rough spots as well :-P hehe. All I know, is that no matter how hard one side or the other has been, I have been there for you (I hope) and you have been there for me. Its hard to 'just talk' if something is suddenly going wrong, but as much as possible its been good. I just wanna say thanks for everything. You didnt have to call me as much as you did and you coulda easily gone off and had a wild time, in many of those ways.. lol. You are wonderful, and I could not ask, imagine, or even dream of a better girl, friend, as well as girlfriend than you.  I'm off to see like three movies tonite, or maybe just two, or something. Don't worry, I am saving the notebook or arthur or whatever you want to see for you time, hehe.   Be Happy (somewhere deep inside) *mwah*                       its over. tonite is the last nite i sleep with you 4600 miles away. its the last time i wont be able to say goodnite at the same time. but it wont be the last nite i dream of you.  today was a good day, ive been giddy from the though of you the entire time. i cant freaking wait. i will prolly explain this day, as well as tons of others tomorrow, but here is what went on.  woke up and talked to u not long after, which sorted a good bit out, which im glad. i think that was the most upset we got with each other the entire time, and it was for no more than like 10 minutes, so id say that went alright. hell prolly woulda happened even if u were here. the end result would be the same though, i love you so damn much.  the rest of the day was un eventful. I had a UPS damage problem, so a guy is pissed at me, i had to ship some other stuff, i sold some other stuff, i scanned some pictures, i took a shower and damn those shower heads work wonders, neck and back feel much better. u really need to try it to understand.... nothing O:-)  went to seans in the lat afternoon. helped make dinner there then played a game of life. i almost won without going to college, hooray! lol then we went bowling, and i forgot how much fun that can be. then again i was just in a damned good mood. i was de-stressing, like i told me to, and damn u had a big part in that.  but yeah, im going to bed now, cause when I wake up, it will be that much closer to time to see you. and with that, i pronounce this chapter of the blog done. It will stay here as long as it can, but i doubt i will continue posting, as I now have the real wonderful you once more. I love you michelle, I do, I do. *mwah*         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
