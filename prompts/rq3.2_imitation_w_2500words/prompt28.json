I love the comments that are beginning to surface...if you haven't read everything on the blog yet, go ahead and surf...be sure to read the comments under each post...  I just had an 'aha' moment! Deductive logic (“It’s elementary my dear Watson”) brings fruitful ends! Science as a “way of knowing and doing” is a powerful method for discovery.  Whenever one is puzzled by a phenomenon, careful observation will often reveal a pattern, which then leads one to further investigate.  The result may yield uncompromising truths!  There is a reason for the 'time delay' between the second you hit 'publish post' and the time it is published!     It turns out that Blogger offers a special feature for the administrator.  Comments that are published are first sent to me to review via email.  Once I have downloaded your comment from the server, which I may want to delete if it is “inappropriate,” Blogger then publishes the posting.  That feature is an excellent one for teachers using Blogs with their class, as they may wish to censor or delete comments before they are published.      I recommend saving your comments in a word document in the event your posting is inadvertently erased.                        I just have a string of thoughts from today...more paradoxes…   I wonder what is meant when children speak of learning that is 'real' rather than “fake.” The  urlLink  24 Hour Film Contest   felt very 'real' to the students at Newton Learning Center. When pupils speak of 'fake,' what does that mean? What is the difference between 'academic' literacy vs. 'practical' literacy?  Is there such a thing as practical literacy (or is that called functional literacy)? For that matter what do we mean when teachers are admonished to make learning “meaningful” and connected to “real” life? Take the performing arts for instance, meaningful to me but not considered a “real” profession – worse, as my eldest daughter continues to seek the stage (aspiring actor), all I can hear in my head is – “get a real job.”  Hmmm.     So what do we make of literacy?  Into what has the term 'literacy' evolved since the time of the Gutenberg Press?  In the beginning it meant to be 'alphabetized' (the term used in French), and we acknowledge that mass literacy has been a key to the past 400 years of evolution in science, math, technology, economics, industry and so on.  Now we speak of multiple literacies but what does that mean?  Does it mean “literacy” that goes well beyond 'written text' the staple of the past 400 years of mass Western “literacy?”  What do the “experts” say?     Anyway…to be highly “literate” in our Canadian society is valued because of the link between the highly literate and the highly innovative. Yet in what sense do we mean “highly literate,” academic, practical, specialized (i.e., field-related), generalized?  Which form of literacy leads to the brightest minds (and I might add honed and focused athletes)? If this is our new “call to arms” for teachers in the 21st century…how will we get there?  What do we do with the minds that will never shine because of genetic barriers?  Moreover, what do we do with all of the “social” problems that make “literacy” issues trail in the dust?  Or is this somehow all related?  Hmmm...and the beat goes on...and the beat goes on...la di da di da...la di da di da...                        Gail Said:   Ok…Just like last time, I can't post the message. It keeps telling me either I'm not a member or my password isn't valid, and it won't let me go to the page where I can retrieve my password. Clearly, I am technologically challenged.    Anyway, I'm enclosing my comments.    The Power of Your Words  What power do words possess? Do they aggrandize or suppress? I considered this recently after reading Lewis Jacobs (1970)‚ chapter, 'The Raw Material,' about motion pictures as a form of creative expression. A filmmaker is a kind of artist, he asserts, like the painter, the composer, and the artist himself. He seeks to control and utilize his medium by harnessing the particular raw material of his medium in order to express his world. Regardless of the music, painting, artistic, or filmmaking medium, a man undertakes such creative endeavours in order to reveal 'man’s concern with being alive.' For what indeed is a man if he cannot examine his life and consider his worth and use his creative genius to express his deliberations. His deliberations and expressions are believed to be common, and the rest of us therefore can relate to him.   As a creative person who writes considerably, I could indeed connect with the concept of the vision behind expression. I have often recognized my own ability to write with a 'camera’s eye.' But in reading Jacobs, I also recognized that I did not see myself represented in his words. When he speaks of the artist, the painter, and the composer, the picture that comes to mind is that of Rembrandt, Leonardo, or Beethoven. When he speaks of the visionary filmmaker, I see Coppola, Hitchcock, or Spielberg, one of whom is in fact a dead white guy. I could, of course, alter the image to ... well, some woman, Penny Marshall perhaps or Barbara Streisand, because I will assume that they, that we, are in fact included in 'man.'   Yet, why do I consciously need to alter the image that comes to mind when these words are read? Why must I make the effort? There were and are women artists, painters, and composers. Do I know of any? I cannot say that I do. Do I know of any women directors? I’ve named but two. No more. But I purposefully bring them to mind now because I could not see myself in the language that he uses. Where was I?   Descartes asserted, 'I think therefore I am.' But we cannot form a thought without language; George Orwell showed us that. If language represents but only half the population, do I think therefore I am not?  Jacobs, L. (1970).   The Movies as Medium.  Toronto: Double Day, Ltd.                        How timely!  A good friend has sent me the link to an extraordinary gathering of thoughts for the 40th anniversary of McLuhan’s seminal work that began with the most provocative aphorism ever to strike our inquisitive minds on the topic of new media, “The medium is the message.” (Also, “The medium is the massage.” A playful turn of phrase demonstrating McLuhan’s penchant for language.)      Forty Years of Understanding Media: A Symposium  At the 2004 Social Sciences and Humanities Federation Academic Congress at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, on June 4th, 12:30 -  2 PM, The McLuhan Program in Culture and Technology at the University of Toronto and the McLuhan Global Research Network, in partnership with the Association of Media Ecologists North, InSounds McLuhan Oral history project, and other interested participants, will celebrate the 40th anniversary of publication of Understanding Media: The extensions of man.  urlLink more    urlLink  Read book on-line                         I hope Dieder will forgive me for putting a link to his  urlLink  blog  without first asking permission - which is mostly his book journal - but his latest post called 'Blogs hit the Web' with a link to Time Magazine is quite - well - timely!   And Sarah has also started her own  urlLink  blog  - her latest comments are responses to posts on Spord - some of you will be interested in reading.  I was thinking that an alternate assignment for the Scrapbook could have been creating your own Blog!  Dieder was able to include images (jpegs) that are either found on the web or (if you have personal server space) your own that you've stored.  I could have shown you how to do some  urlLink  simple html tags  to create links, block quotes, or to   italicize ,  bold , and  add color   ...etc.    I suppose a blog could appeal to many individuals...but then again...for some it may just seem like the same old assignment repackaged with a high tech twist... hmmm...  My practicum student, while introducing iBooks to her grade 2 class, said, 'They just accomplished in an hour what took me two weeks to master!'  The students were doing a web quest - seeking images - downloading them to the desktop and inserting them into a word document in order to manipulate the image. When I polled these 'savvy' 7 year olds, they informed me that they had been using computers and laptops (including wireless) since as early as the age of 2!!  Apparently TV is no longer the main competitor on our toddler's playtime...   Come to think of it, my two eldest had access to computers since they were toddlers also but the internet did not become sophisticated until they were well into their teens…so…the TV and the VCR were their buddies (and, later, video games like Mario Brothers). Yup…I can readily admit (sheepishly)…as a working mom…I will be forever grateful to Mr. Rogers, Mr. Dressup, Rainbow Brite, Sesame Street and the countless Disney movies...(especially The Secret of Nimh)   I was using the Internet as early as 1992, but by 1995 the World Wide Web was pretty much up and running as it is today with dueling browsers (a.k.a Netscape and Explorer), and my son was 6 yrs old!  He started downloading his favorite on-line games and playing with his friends across town since he was nine…  Now he’s an MSN and cell phone junkie…he surfs the web regularly for funny videos/blogs…he goes to a minimum of 3 movies per week (cheap theatres near home – great dating haunts for a 15 year old!) and watches 'The Family Guy' and 'Simpsons' on DVD – he reads voraciously (currently The Iliad) – plays Lacrosse religiously – and he was just presented with an athlete of the year award at his end-of-the-year assembly at school. While retro 60's, 70's and 80's are in...I'm afraid the 21st Century is truly his stomping ground!  I wonder what undergrads will say about technology by the time he's in university...  More things that make one say...hmmm...                       There is an ancient maxim that states, “Teach them correct principles and they will govern themselves.”  While this adage is devoted primarily to moral and ethical principles, it may be applied beyond.  Another similar axiom states, “Feed a man a fish, and he will eat for a day, teach him to fish and he will feed for a lifetime.”  Both adages are rooted in the notion of the existence of “universal” truths that intersect all knowledge (e.g., the scientific process as means to solve problems). Individuals who acquire skills and knowledge (i.e., become literate) begin to “see the whole schema” and “know how to navigate its system.” In the end, those individuals are “set free” or rather released from “external governance” exercising “free will” within the confines of culture and society. Anyone who labors to instruct seeks to help individuals locate the “inner locus of control,” i.e., the will to learn.  Thus, teaching is as much a matter of tapping into the interest and  natural  ability of a learner and deepening their knowledge as a means to engage their  will  to learn as it is a matter of broadening their horizons.    According to  urlLink  John Taylor Gatto (go to article),  schooling merely “dumbs down” human potential by keeping individuals from “growing up.”  Hmmm…Critics of education find it easier to disparage schooling practices than to find solutions…    First, though, we must wake up to what our schools really are: laboratories of experimentation on young minds, drill centers for the habits and attitudes that corporate society demands. Mandatory education serves children only incidentally; its real purpose is to turn them into servants. Don't let your own have their childhoods extended, not even for a day. If David Farragut could take command of a captured British warship as a pre-teen, if Thomas Edison could publish a broadsheet at the age of twelve, if Ben Franklin could apprentice himself to a printer at the same age (then put himself through a course of study that would choke a Yale senior today), there's no telling what your own kids could do. After a long life, and thirty years in the public school trenches, I've concluded that genius is as common as dirt. We suppress our genius only because we haven't yet figured out how to manage a population of educated men and women.  The solution, I think, is simple and glorious. Let them manage themselves.
