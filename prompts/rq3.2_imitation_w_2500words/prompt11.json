An agent confiscated the items Tuesday and gave Black Hole Store and Museum owner Ed Grothus an itemized receipt listing the things taken, Grothus said.      Grothus said Friday the items have been a big joke in his store for years.      'I had for years been jesting' that they were missing tapes from the federal nuclear weapons lab, and said he added the printed tape labels reading 'secret.'      The store's assistant manager, Frank Holmquist, said a man first came into the store to say he wanted to buy the props marked 'secret' displayed on the front counter.      Grothus, who worked at the lab as a machinist for 20 years before retiring in 1969, said he refused to sell them because they're conversation pieces for tourists.

What had been a mellow evening at Wente Vineyards, with the crowd even serenading her with 'Happy Birthday' at one point, turned into a rush for the exits by some fans angry by her encore tribute to filmmaker Michael Moore.  'She just had to do it,' one fan steamed as he headed for the parking lot. 'It was good until the end,' another yelled to TV crews waiting outside the concert.  'She's getting out of line; it's ridiculous,' said Cindy Williams of Livermore, as she left during the last song of the evening.  Ronstadt's encore dedication of the song 'Desperado' to Moore, the controversial maker of 'Fahrenheit 9/11' who she described Thursday as 'a great American patriot,' got her booted from a Las Vegas casino Saturday and drew cheers, some boos, and a few 'traitor' yells from the Livermore crowd.

Tom and Becky Furlong of Letts, which is in Muscatine County, hosted a John Kerry picnic on their farm last summer. Kerry invited the couple to sit with his family last night in the convention hall. Furlong, like Kerry, is a Vietnam veteran, and endorsed Kerry early in the campaign. Furlong says he was impressed with Kerry becuase he's 'a serious person of substance.' Furlong was on stage, briefly, too, part of a group of farmers who stood as another farmer from Kentucky gave a testimonial on Kerry. Furlong was elected an alternate delegate to the convention, and was sitting in the balcony earlier this week, and didn�t find out �til yesterday that he�d be on stage. He says the seat upgrade was �thrilling' especially since he wasn't sure his wife would even be able to be in the hall for last night's speech.'                       urlLink Newsday.com - National News : 'Police worry about Taser misuse&nbsp;   FORT WORTH, Texas -- Tasers, the weapons police use to immobilize suspects with a 50,000-volt shock, may be available at the mall as soon as this fall.   Scottsdale, Ariz., -based Taser International and retailer The Sharper Image are negotiating to make the store the only national retailer to carry Tasers.   The store would sell a variation of the Taser used by 5,400 law enforcement agencies nationwide. The consumer version is designed for personal security, and the cycle of electricity from the gun lasts up to 30 seconds.   'It's nonlethal, yet it's extremely effective,' said Steve Tuttle, a spokesman for Taser International. 'People can feel confident that they can knock down the most difficult of targets.'

On-Air With Ryan Seacrest To Halt Production   Twentieth Television yesterday announced that the Sept. 17 airing of the program, featuring KIIS/Los Angeles morning host and American Top 40 host Ryan Seacrest, will be its last. In a statement, Twentieth said it was its desire that On-Air appeal 'to a wide array of viewers, but, unfortunately, the marketplace's response was not as strong as we had hoped.' The decision follows Monday's announcement from Sinclair Broadcast Group that it would pull the syndicated talk show from more than 20 of its TV stations across the U.S.    On-Air has suffered low ratings since its January debut   , but Seacrest remained upbeat despite his show's cancellation, saying, 'I wouldn't have changed anything about this entire experience, and I look forward to building my business within Twentieth Television.' Meanwhile, XM on Monday quietly dropped its simulcast of KIIS's morning show, also named On-Air With Ryan Seacrest, on its 'Kiss' channel in favor of a more music-oriented approach.

'You know, I have to hand it to Warner Bros.,' Miami resident Tom Peebles said Monday.   'Catwoman was terrible, but it actually had one or two decent parts. I really have to say: It could have been a lot worse!'   Catwoman, loosely based on the DC Comics character, has similarly shattered other viewers' bottom-of-the-barrel expectations, offering a small number of redeeming features instead of the expected none. 'That one part where the woman pushes Catwoman off a balcony to demonstrate that she can land on her feet was sort of cool, I guess,' said Bangor, ME's Sally Burrows. 'And it was kind of funny when she ate, like, 10 cans of tuna in a row. Oh, and when she drank that glass of cream at the bar�that was, though not exactly funny, at least funny-ish. My kids seemed to like it. Well, Mindy, at least.' 'Mindy just turned 7,' Burrows added.

The movie came to the dusty Texas town of Crawford (population 750), best known as the home of President Bush's ranch, at the invitation of the Crawford Peace House, a group that has staged repeated demonstrations against Mr. Bush and his policies.  Most Crawford residents weren't excited about Moore's private showing.  'I haven't seen the movie but if it's like I've heard that it is, I don't think it should be shown here,' Crawford resident Hazel Hawkins told 1200 WOAI's Jeff Vexler.

Moore Slime  Having already angered science fiction writer Ray Bradbury by plundering the title of his best-selling novel for his own film 'Fahrenheit 9/11,' Michael Moore is now being accused of doctoring a newspaper headline shown in the film. Given that every media examination of the 2000 presidential election in Florida found that George W. Bush would have won a statewide recount, Mr. Moore was obviously hard up for headlines that would bolster his claim that the Bush forces had stolen the election. He wound up using one from The Pantagraph, a newspaper in Bloomington, Illinois. In the film a copy of the paper's front page from December 19, 2001 is reproduced with the headline: 'Latest Florida recount shows Gore won election.' The only problem is that The Pantagraph's editors say those words didn't run in its December 19 edition, but rather on December 5 and not on the front page. Instead the headline appeared in much smaller type above a letter to the editor, which the paper says reflects 'only the opinions of the letter writer.' The falsification of historical evidence here is calculated and blatant, and the paper is understandably demanding an apology. Given Mr. Moore's track record of 'hit and run' journalism, however, the paper's editors can expect to wait a long time.                       The Democratic Presidential nominee is making history!

John Edwards of North Carolina, while on a two-week, 3,500-mile trip through battleground states.              He was seeking to capitalize on momentum generated by last week's Democratic convention as a new CNN-USA Today Gallup poll showed he had gained only 1 percentage point over Bush.              The poll of registered voters showed Kerry leading 50 percent to 47 percent for Bush, compared to a larger lead last month, 49 percent to 45 percent. A Newsweek poll on Saturday gave Kerry a four-point jump, or 'bounce,' from the convention among registered voters.      The Bush campaign pounced on the Gallup poll to point out that Kerry was the first nominee of either party to receive no bounce from his convention since Democrat George McGovern in 1972.     A senior Kerry adviser dismissed the survey as an aberration.

Police on foot chased down the suspect in the first robbery, which occurred just about when Bush was stepping off his plane. The second and third robberies at different banks took place while the two candidates were addressing their respective crowds -- which was almost certainly factored into the thieves' thinking, police Lt. Don Gano said. 'Without actually talking to the bad guys, that's probably what happened,' Gano said of the robbers' timing. When police answered the first call, it further thinned their ranks, Gano said. Police were hunting for the other two suspects, who were both armed. They did not believe any of the suspects were aware of the others' plans.'                       urlLink Yahoo!

The unamused Canadian postal service -- whose carriers endure more than their share of real dog bites -- convinced Pet Valu Inc. stores to stop carrying Bark Bars, dog biscuits that come shaped like cats and letter carriers.  'This is not in any way, shape, or form funny for us, and to make light of that ... I don't see that as funny at all, not even in the least,' said John Caines, Canada Post's national media relations manager.  The pet store chain, which has 292 outlets in Canada, agreed to withdraw the treats after it received a letter from Canada Post saying that employees were concerned about the risks mail carriers face from dogs and unhappy with having dog biscuits shaped in their likeness.  Earlier this summer, a letter carrier from Chatham in southwestern Ontario broke both her wrists and had part of her ear ripped off when she was attacked by two pitbull-like dogs.  Caines said that in the first six months of 2004 there were 160 dog attacks on mail carriers across Canada. '                       urlLink Yahoo!
