I don't do much of that here... just so you know. Anyway...  Ameliou and I have been lamenting over the distance to our 2k4 friends. If it wasn't for sis coming down and my lil cuz in Orlando,  urlLink See Spot Rock  would not have rocked much at all. We need some nxgn connections in this area. I guess that comes with time... or  chance .  I said 'chance' just to make you wonder if I believe in the word.   I'll let you wonder.  Well, I had a 350 word blog ready to post. It was about friends and friendship. I hit the preview to read my own thoughts back to myself, then decided to Crtl-X. I'll let you wonder on that one as well.  The truth is, I don't know who reads this blog. Therefore I should keep some thoughts closer than others. Now you're really wondering. Good. That's the PO!NT.  While you're wondering;   Have you ever asked yourself why this blog is called 'What's the PO!NT?'?   What's your PO!NT?  Don't fall asleep without asking yourself.                                 When I wash a car I like to keep the  car  wet, and  myself  dry. Call me odd, but that's the way I like it. What I like, and what a kindergartener named Superman likes are very different programs.  As you know, we have a newer car. I've been looking forward to cleaning it all week. Finally, Saturday morning comes. I met with a client, then I'm off to clean the car. I started with the inside. I wanted it to feel brand new. I'm scrubbing, cleaning, wiping... you know the drill. I get done with the passenger side and move to the driver side and notice there are 2 little boys (kindergarten) hanging out in the carport next to me. They are playing with the hose. Awe, how cute. Cute until I became a target that is.  Most of you know I like to have a good time and horse around. This time was a little different. Not because my goal of cleaning the car was thrown off track by 2 cute kindergarten boys. It was different because I didn't know if washing a car and getting into a water fight with 2 kids is legal! So, after declaring a quick loss in the water fight (and realizing my car was NOT going to get clean today) I got the heck out of there.  Yeah I know, I'm a little paranoid. Had it been kids I knew, we would have had a BLAST. So, I left the kids feeling victorious, and came home feeling ticked at all the  social sponges  out there that make this world less fun that it needs to be. What a mess.  Someday it will all be different. I'm looking forward to that each day I get older.                                 I want to give a shout out to my big sis. Hey girl, I love ya big time. Hang in there!  Also, a quick welcome to CRobertson. Welcome buddy.  So, I’ve been thinking. (practicing what I preach) More like I’ve been observing, and then thinking. I think that might be good way to go about it.   Here’s the scoop.  This guy goes on a family vacation along with his in-laws. Everything is great until he butts heads with his mother-in-law over a minuet detail.   He explodes. They get in a fight. Everything is ugly.  However, being the good Christian he is, he apologizes. They fix things up, and vacation is back to beaches and sunshine.   As he recalls the story and sends up a “praise God” I can’t help but wonder how many people use God as an escape-goat for allowing their tempers to fly (among other things).  Now your saying to yourself: “Isn’t that the way it should work? Aren’t we supposed to go back and ask our brothers forgiveness if we hurt them?”   Yes, that is the way it should work. (pause) However, I’m watching people emotionally assassinate others over and over again, and rebound 20 minutes later with an apology. They operate from the belief that when they apologize, the other person is bound, required and obligated to forgive them, allowing them to go back to enjoying the beach and catching rays.  Doesn’t that bother anyone? It should! These people are using scripture as a safe place to hurt people. Their apology has become a tool to manipulate people into letting their sin be swept under the carpet and their own childish temper to go un-dealt with.   For them, it’s easier to go back and ask forgiveness that it is to control their temper. Besides, once they ask for forgiveness, it’s up to the forgiver to deal with it right? They think they have shifted the burden back to the offended.  Now, don’t get me wrong. I’m all about the forgiveness process. God has it in place for a reason. However, that reason doesn’t include manipulating people. The forgiveness process is about having a change of heart. It’s about rebuilding what was destroyed. It’s not about checkmarks and bourdon shifting.   Caught up in that cycle? Get some help.  Tired of being manipulated? Challenge the offender and reestablish boundaries. You don’t have to be a victim of spiritual manipulation.    That's my PO!NT for today.   urlLink “What shall we say then? Should we continue in sin that grace may increase? May it never be!”                                  I’m sure that most of you caught up on our mini-vacation at  urlLink PO!NT of Contact .  Be sure to check out the pictures at that site.  I’m sure no one knows, but I have been working on a VERY BIG project for OPMG. It’s a product I would like to launch this summer. I’m sure it will be a big hit in the CMS world. I won’t bore you with the details… or give away my brilliant ideas. =)  For those of you who have been keeping track, the CSA drama is over. I am still working with them; however the drama is down to a dull roar. I love those guys; it’s the Stone I get frustrated with. They help me rise above it though.  On another front: It sounds like I may have company on the drive up north this summer. My uncle Dan may be riding with me. I am truly looking forward to that! He is a great guy, and I think we will have a blast! I’ll be sure to post some pics of our trip.  Well, no big PO!NTS today. I have some rolling around in my head, and should be flushing them out… however; I have some work to do.                                 I know you're familiar with everyday brands like Lipton, Slim-Fast, Hellmann's, Axe, Dove and Surf; but did you know they are all part of the  urlLink Unilever  product family?   Uni-what?  Yeah, you know; the company that serves up over 177 BILLION cups of tea every day!  Anyway, I'm sure most people haven't seen their logo, because most people don't know who they are. Try this on for size:     One of the first things you will notice about this logo is that it feels very industrial. It looks like it belongs on the side of a GM parts plant. It's cold and un-friendly. Maybe that's why you haven't seen very much of it.  On a positive note, the logo is very distinguished. The straight lines command respect and dignity.  That aside, I wanted to let you know they have a new logo.     This logo is not only a LOT friendlier, but attempts to communicate who Unilever  is  as a brand. It incorporates 25 other identity pieces from their other brands, in an attempt to tell the Uniliever story. I think they hit the nail on the head. It's bold, friendly, open and all-around memorable.  Inspiring!                       As I looked at the photos of the tragic and inhumane killing of Nicholas Berg I was horrified.  I was confronting the images of our enemy - the people who would kill our families in the same way.  After observing these photos I want to ask you... Who would you rather lead our country?  John Kerry?   A flip flopping people pleaser who changes his tune...  A man who would treat this as a law enforcement issue rather than a matter of war..  A man who blames us first and our enemies second...  A man who would rather appease instead of taking the hard path of confrontation...  What about George Bush?  He has proven he backs up his words with action.  He calls us time and time again to remember that we are in a war.  This is not a law enforcement issue - we must see this issue differently.  He goes after those responsible and calls the best out of America.  He is a man of conviction who chooses a path he believes in rather than the politically rewarding and safe path.  In this time of terror I will choose the man who has principle, honesty, strength and believes in America.  I encourage you to think of your security and to vote for Bush.                           I have been catching up with an old friend via AIM this week. It has been great to connect with yet another guy that is headed in the right direction. He has killer Flash skills, and a big heart to boot. He gave me some  MUCH NEEDED  Flash help for the ' urlLink Ben site '. (thanks nD!)  AIM is a wonderful thing.  On another note:  Small Town Poets  have a new album coming out.  urlLink www.smalltownpoets.com   At one time STP was my fav band. They have been out of the biz for a few years starting families. I'm stoked about their return. They have been one of the most influential bands in my life over the years. They have so many songs that bring back memories. Kurt and I saw them in G.R. a few years ago. That was a concert highlight for the both of us. I like them for being real with their music. They don't write 'sing-songy' lyrics, or over Christianize everything. They are poets, and I like that. The combo of poetry and music is a powerful one.  Check em out at a  urlLink FCS  empire near you.                       'I believe that the president's leadership and the actions taken in Iraq demonstrate an incompetence in terms of knowledge, judgment, and experience,' Pelosi told reporters gathered to hear her remarks.     Some Dems Just Don’t Get It! 'The results of his (President Bush) action are what undermine his leadership, not my statements.  The emperor has no clothes. When are people going to face the reality?' 'Bush is an incompetent leader. In fact, he's not a leader. He's a person who has no judgment, no experience and no knowledge of the subjects that he has to decide upon.' '… the president's capacity to lead has never been there.'  'In order to lead, you have to have judgment. In order to have judgment, you have to have knowledge and experience. He (Bush) has none.'  In a time of war, these kinds of public remarks only provide encouragement and comfort to the enemy.  We are at war and our servicemen and women, day in and day out, put their lives on the line to stop evil tyranny and their terrorist activity.  Remarks like these only give more reason for the enemy to continue their attacks on our troops and freedom. These are not remarks made by an “enemy” of the United States….or are they?  Who really is responsible for these words?  None other than Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Leader in the House of Representatives.   Are these the kind of statements we would expect from leaders of our government?   Even though Pelosi voted against the war, she promised that Democrats would stand 'shoulder to shoulder' with Bush in the war on terror. Is this what shoulder-to-shoulder looks like?   At a time of war when America needs to come together, no matter what our political views may be, we find a leader in the Democratic Party, trying to pickup votes for a visionless party and presidential nominee.  Why is it so hard to understand that tyranny and evil will have to be confronted sometime and some place?  On our shores, in our cities, with far more casualties, or right where the enemy lives.                             I took Sunday away from the computer. I don't think I even checked my e-mail yesterday. It's my day to 'unplug.' Check out PO!NT of Contact for the details.  I will be posting some George W. stuff on my site tonight. They have a bunch of things you can use at  urlLink www.georgebush.com .  I have too many friends that are afraid to stand up for a political party. Some of them can't because they are in ministry. I don't think they are allowed to endorse anyone. It's something about church and state. I don't know all the details. The ones that are not in ministry are the ones I'm getting concerned about. I can't tell if they just don't care who runs the country, or they are trying to be politically correct about politics!   Here is what I see going on.  Too many 'Christians' are using God as an excuse to sit on the sidelines. They quote verses about how God appoints leadership. They also use 'relevancy' as their excuse. They think by not saying anything at all, they are avoiding a conflict that could somehow turn people off to Christ. 'You can't have that kind of conflict and be relevant in today’s culture.' or 'If you tick them off politically, you'll never win them spiritually.'   Here is my thought:  YOU will NEVER win them spiritually. That part is NOT up to you! Besides, if you want to influence someone, you have to have an end in mind. That means you have to have a value that you are pressing towards. Influence involves a reaction. A reaction involves an energy that must be dealt with.  The next big group I see is one that votes based on a financial agenda. They have ideals as to where they think money should go. Good ideals I'm sure. They want to see more funding to help the poor, aids patients, homeless and other charity groups. I guess I can see how those could be noble agendas. So, they vote for the party they think will help bring that kind of humanitarian work.   Here is my thought:  If you call yourself a Christ follower, you won't depend on the government to do humanitarian work for you. You will get your hands dirty, and do it yourself! Why? Because that's what Christ did! He didn't expect the Roman government to feed the hungry or tend to the sick. He did it, and then commanded us to do it!  That group may have noble intentions, it’s the trade off is what concerns me. If you vote for 'the little man' party, you may get your humanitarian efforts, but you loose a LOT of moral virtues that Christ followers hold dear. You know, things like valuing the life of an unborn child and the sanctity of marriage between a man and a woman (the way God designed it).   Here is my thought:  Since when did a financial agenda become more important that the fundamentals of our faith? There are plenty of financial pillars within the Christian faith that should be valued and adopted, but when did money become more important than human life? Why would you vote for someone that doesn’t value the same basics that you do? Is your financial agenda more important than that? WOW, I hope not.  Now, I’m not so naive as to think that George W. is perfect. I know there are things we all would like to see changed. What I’m trying to say is that I think we, as a church, need to engage others about politics. We, collectively, and individually have a lot of influence, and it’s O.K. to use that influence in politics.  My prayer between now and November's election will be that those who call themselves Christ followers will voice their beliefs. Stand for them. Share them. Vote for them.   I will not hope for tomorrow good things, while today sowing no good seed.  That’s my PO!NT.               \n'''\n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
