Now....Let's talk about the arrogence and itty bitty dollop of racism wrapped up in that pronouncement. Better yet, check out the following from the NY Daily News...not exactly a bastion of progressive thinking. ********** Jenna is unwanted  Not everyone wants Jenna Bush to teach in Harlem.   Artists and Activists United for Peace, a black and Latino public-action group, plans to express its displeasure with the First Daughter at a rally on Sept. 2, during the Republican National Convention.  'We don't think she is of a high enough moral character to teach school, considering her past adventures,' said group organizer John Penley. 'Her taking this job is keeping a black person from getting the job. We think she and her sister should enlist in the military.'  ********** Actually, her run-ins with the law combined with a teeny tiny drinking problem might keep her from getting a teaching license. Then there are all those 'morality clauses' which still lurk in most agreements.  Hmmmm...Any bets on Jenna actually teaching anywhere???   urlLink New York Daily News - Daily Dish & Gossip - Rush & Molloy: Martha's next move may soon be to jail :                      Let's see if the separation of church and state is still breathing. Looks like Rev. Falwell has openly endorse the Former Governor of Texas for president. The good Rev. did so in his capacity of being a minister. According to the NY TImes.  **** Mr. Falwell defended the right of a pastor to endorse political candidates in his personal capacity, even from the pulpit. Mr. Falwell said he often did this at his church, the Thomas Road Baptist Church.  'I support President Bush,'' he said. 'I support him on Sunday mornings from the pulpit where it doesn't cost the church or anybody anything. I make it very clear, just like at most African-American churches and many liberal churches, that as a tax-paying citizen I vote. And I tell people who I vote for.' *** Falwell is right, that he does have a first amendment right to tell his parishoners who he's voting for and who they should vote for. But if he does so, he can't keep is CHARITABLE status.  See ya in court Jerry.      urlLink The New York Times > Washington > Campaign 2004 > Citing Falwell's Endorsement of Bush, Group Challenges His Tax-Exempt Status                      Below is a link to Bob Herbert's column in today's NYTimes.  Here are a few snips. ***** What is troubling is Mr Bush's relationship with black Americans in general. He's very good at using blacks as political props. And the proposa are too often part of an exceedingly cyncial production.  Four years ago, on the first night of the Republican convention, a parade of blacks was hauled before the television cameras (and the nearly all-white audience in the convention hall) to sing, to dance, to preach and to praise a party that has been relentlessly hostile to the interests of blacks for half a century.  I wrote at the time that 'you couldn't tell whether you were at the Republican National Convention or the Motown Review.'  That exercise in modern-day minstrelsy was supposed to show that Mr. Bush was a new kind of Republican, a big-tent guy who would welcome a more diverse crowd into the G.O.P. That was fiction. It wasn't long before black voters would find themselves mugged in Florida, and soon after that Mr. Bush was steering the presidency into a hard-right turn.  ***** Bush is the worst sort of pol--Smile to your face, kiss your kids so long as the cameras are rolling. Then, once the cameras are long gone, have his minions knife you in the back...repeatedly.  That said, Kerry has got to a better job reaching out to African American communities. He needs to incorporate the all of the African American 30-ish and 40-ish year olds who cut their political teeth working in the Clinton administrastration and for the Gore campaign. Clinton and Gore did a relatively good job giving folks from all sorts of backgrounds national political experience.  Kerry ignores this experienced talent at his peril.   urlLink The New York Times > Opinion > Op-Ed Columnist: Bush's Not-So-Big Tent                      Today's Washington Post has an article that examines young people and rural poverty.   Briefly, while the percentage of urban poor is 16%, for the rural poor it's over 20%. Furthermore, poor rural children have less access to medical care, dental care, and a host of social services, governmental and non-profit.  This is consistent with what I've been seeing in my home town, which is located in Northern PA, in the foothills of Appalachia.   I've seen families devasted by the lack of health insurance, particularly when a child is diagnosed with cancer. The local people will do their best for the family running all manner of fundraisers, but as they saying goes, 'You can't get blood from a stone.'  Needless to say, the area leads the nation in per-capita military enlistments. With the military, a person gets a regular salary, regular health and dental care (the quality is questionable, but something is generally better than nothing), and somewhat decent housing. Of course, you do run the rise of going to Iraq. But the benefits are more than what many of these kids have ever seen.  Go read and learn.   urlLink Poverty Tightens Grip On Mississippi Delta (washingtonpost.com)                      No! Not THAT one silly, the former head of the Florida Christian Coalition, who now works for Mel Martinez's senatorial campaign.  What a PIECE of work.   From the Washington Blade.  Just a fast snip: ************* Throughout his career, both at the Christian Coalition and after, Dowless has had a long history of pushing an anti-gay agenda.  As far back as 1994, Dowless, then the director of the Christian Coalition of Florida, was quoted in the New York Times opposing the popular Gay Days event at Disney World in Orlando because it allegedly was a threat to kids.  “This whole day is focusing on sex,” Dowless was quoted as saying, “and when you put these elements together, there is the greater possibility of illegal activities on children or some harassment.”  In 1997, Dowless, still in his role as director of the state’s Christian Coalition, cheered when the University of Florida rescinded a student spouse ID card that had been given to the partner of a lesbian student. The card gave spouses of students special advantages, such as use of the university’s libraries and recreational facilities.  “Marriage should be reserved for a man and a woman,” Dowless told the Alligator, the student publication.  In 1998, Dowless successfully blocked a move by the state legislature to write the Religious Freedom Restoration Act into the state Constitution. The move would have prohibited discrimination based on a variety of attributes, including gender.   But, according to the St. Petersburg Times, Dowless opposed the gender provision, saying it would be a possible loophole for allowing same-sex marriages.  And in 2002, Dowless created a misleading phone message for Gov. Jeb Bush. The message, sent to 50,000 social conservatives in the state, claimed that voters should cast their lot with Bush over Democratic rival Bill McBride because Bush was “the only candidate who supports traditional marriage.”  But the statement was false. McBride did oppose same-sex marriage, and after a public controversy, the phone message campaign was pulled.  Just last year, Dowless was scheduled as one of 25 guest speakers at a “Reclaiming America for Christ” conference held Oct. 24-25 in Fort Lauderdale. Promotional materials indicate he spoke about grassroots organizing among conservative Christians.  ****** Now, would some one please explain again why outing is a bad thing??????    urlLink Washington Blade Online                      Henry Waxman asks a good question about the US and their spending of Iraqi resources...  Here's a snip from the UK Guardian:  Right now, Mr Waxman has a question on Iraq. In fact, he has several - and in typically robust fashion, he is demanding answers. What he wants to know is whether the Bush administration has been fiddling with Iraq's oil revenues.   He wrote to the Republican chairman of the reform committee on July 9, suggesting there was a serious case to answer. Subpoenas should be issued, he said, 'to investigate potential mismanagement of the Development Fund for Iraq (DFI) by the United States'.   The DFI was set up after last year's invasion as the depository for Iraq's multi-billion-dollar oil revenues and was administered, until June 28, by the US-led Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) - with notional UN oversight.  In particular, Mr Waxman is curious about 'the [Bush] administration's last-minute 'draw-down' of billions of dollars from the DFI for unspecified expenses' prior to last month's transfer of sovereignty. 'For example, $1bn [about �550m] was withdrawn from the DFI during the last month of the CPA's existence for unspecified 'security' purposes.'    urlLink Guardian Unlimited | Special reports | How has the US been spending other people's billions? : 'How has the US been spending other people's billions?                        Bush has a serious problem with the NAACP and it's HIS problem.   1. He blows off the annual convention, the first president who's refused to attend a single convention during his 4-year term.  2. Then he decides to be insulting. To quote the article in the Chicago Tribune, 'There are a lot of people I admire in the NAACP,' Bush said. But he added, 'I describe my relationship with the current leadership as basically non-existent because of their rhetoric.'  Ok...Mr. Bush name one person. C'mon.... you can do it. We're waiting.... Uh huh...I thought so.   W has employed the old, 'The group is ok, but the leadership is lousy' canard when dissing a long-established African American social justice organization. He makes himself transparent when he says, 'there are a lot of people..'  BTW: This is also the same weekend that Bush endorsed the Federal Marriage Amendment, which would ban 'gay-marriages' in the US.   What a bigot!    urlLink Chicago Tribune | Bush criticizes NAACP leaders                      The New York Times finally covers the outing story.  Here's a snip: ********** The election-year fight over gay marriage has altered the gay scene here in ways that have left some in the community - most notably gay Republicans - stunned and even fearful. Under intense pressure to separate their gay consciousness from their broader political identity, gay and lesbian conservatives are facing stinging ridicule in the very neighborhoods, bars and restaurants that were once unquestioned safe zones.   In recent weeks Lynden C. Armstrong, administrative director for Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, an opponent of gay marriage, has been called 'a Jew working for Nazis,' and 'a gay Uncle Tom.' During a recent dinner at a Washington restaurant, a friend loudly berated Mr. Armstrong in front of other patrons. He was even confronted about his political allegiance during a weekend getaway in Rehoboth Beach, Del., again, by people he considered friends.  'I don't feel like I'm being attacked by anyone in my office,' said Mr. Armstrong, 33, who is also co-chairman of the Gay, Lesbian and Allies Senate Staff Caucus. 'The attacks have come from other gays and lesbians, and that's hard. It's very hard for me to understand how they can do that. Most people know how difficult this all is for all of us.'  The tension experienced by Mr. Armstrong and others has been ratcheting up since February when President Bush formally endorsed a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. But it has reached fever pitch in the past two weeks, since Mike Rogers, a gay activist in Washington, began posting on the Internet the names of gays who work for lawmakers supporting the amendment.   'It's about exposing hypocrisy wherever we find it,' Mr. Rogers said.   ******** Poor, poor conservative queers. They work for brownshirt pols who campaign against queers, then they cry foul when other queers call them on their hypocrasy. Get over it.  The campaign is also designed to out the pols who spout crap, but are perfectly fine with queers, so long as we are silent.   Right.....   urlLink The New York Times > Washington > Proposed Marriage Ban Splits Washington's Gays                      Last week, 'Achieve' released a report which was HARSHLY critical of High School graduation tests. OF course, they claimed that the data indicated US students are generally dumb as rocks.  Gerald Bracey, my favorite de-bunker, goes after that report with a chainsaw. Enjoy!  ************** I first flew in an airplane in 1961 at age 21, a twin-engine NASA prop from Langley Air Force Base to Cape Canaveral.  I experienced a little queasiness.  I had not had any problem since then until coming back from Detroit last night.  But I determined that the bad feelings in my gut didn't come from the turbulence rocking the A319, but from what I was reading: Do Graduation Tests Measure Up?  From Achieve, Inc.   I give only two horrific examples, one of spun and misleading statistics on page 8 and a baldly wrong statement on page 15.   One graph on page 8 purports to show that while only 48% of the class of 2003 passed the MA high stakes test, MCAS, in math, 95% of the class of 2003 eventually passed..  The graph is from the Massachusetts Department of Education, which should arouse immediate suspicions.  Izzy Stone's basic assumption applies: governments lie.  It should be yours, too.     The problem with the graph is that it does not account for those who dropped out or switched to GED or other programs (in Florida the number of kids getting a GED almost doubled from 2002 to 2003).  When those are taken into account, the pass rate drops into the 70's, lower in areas that are heavily black and Hispanic.  And, of course dropouts and GEDs occur more in minority groups.  Removing these students from the MCAS-taking sample would automatically raise their passing rate, which is relevant to the next graph discussed.   This other graph is labeled 'achievement gap closing' and shows passing rates from 1998 to 2003 by ethnicity.  This graph is horsehockey.  The graph shows passing rates.  Passing rates tell you nothing about whether or not the achievement gap is closing.  To make a judgment about that, you need scores.  A passing rate shows you only how many kids jumped over the hurdle.  It gives no idea how high in the air they got.  My guess is that the minority kids who had to retake the test fell farther and farther behind as the white kids went on to study other stuff.  The report itself says 'the tests are not overly demanding' (p. 1), so while minorities are confined to studying this not overly demanding content, those who passed the test moved on (only 29% of African Americans and 37% of Hispanics passed initially, compared to 77% of whites).   Here are some actual scores that do bear on the achievement gap:   In 1998, whites outscored blacks by 90 points on the SAT verbal and 96 points on the SAT math.  In 2003, whites outscored blacks by 93 points on the SAT verbal and 98 points on the SAT math.  Some reduction in the achievement gap!  (The ethnic composition of the SAT testtaking pool was virtually unchanged over the span of years).     Similarly, on NAEP 8th grade reading, the gap was 28 points in 1998 and 36 points in 2003, while the gaps on 8th grade math were 33 points in 1996 and 32 points in 2003.  Some closure.   I found theses data at the College Board and NAEP websites.  It took about 20 minutes including typing these paragraphs.  Mike Cohen, Achieve's President, and Matt Gandal, a vice president know about these sites and it wouldn't have taken them any longer than it took me, had they wanted to look.  But they didn't.  Why?  I don't know but it's clear that the intent of the report is to persuade, not inform.  In some places it reads like it was funded by test publishers.   A paragraph on page 15 begins 'Because the performance of U . S. high school students in math lags behind that of students in other industrialized nations...'  This is simply not true.  Achieve is lying to you.   In 2000, OECD tested 15-year-olds in 32 mostly industrialized nations in reading, math and science.  The U. S. was average in all three subjects.  But...only three countries had significantly higher scores in reading, only eight in math, and only seven in science.  Most of the countries did not differ significantly from one another (http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2002/2002115a.pdf).    Even in the Final Year apples-to-aardvarks study of the Third International Mathematics and Science Study, the groups of American students most like their European and Asian peers were in the middle of the pack--right where they had been as 8th grades (see my critique of this study in the May, 2000 Educational Researcher).  Oh, by the way, while many final year students in Europe and Asia were getting ready for their national, life-determining exams, ours, knowing what at least the immediate the future held, suffered senior slump.  TIMSS tested American high school seniors with a test that meant absolutely nothing to them in the merry month of May (!).   Among the several thousand people receiving this post are about 800 education writers.  I urge them--and actually all of you--to be more critical of stuff like this bubbling up from the bowels of Achieve.     This report should never have been published, much less publicized.  Michael Kinsley once called the Heritage Foundation a propaganda machine masquerading as a think tank.  Achieve is working hard to assume that mantle as well.   Sincerely,   Gerald W.
