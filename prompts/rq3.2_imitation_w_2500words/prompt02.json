To Let Go         Tiffany Appleton  To let go isn’t to forget, not think about, or ignore. It doesn’t leave feelings of anger, jealousy or regret. Letting go isn’t winning and it isn’t losing. It’s not about pride and it’s not about how you appear, And it’s not obsessing or dwelling on the past. Letting go isn’t blocking memories or thinking sad thoughts, And doesn’t leave emptiness, hurt or sadness. It’s not giving in or giving up. Letting go isn’t about loss, and it’s not defeat.  To let go is to cherish memories, but to overcome and to move on. It is having an open mind and confidence in the future. Letting go is accepting,  It is learning and experiencing and growing. To let go is to be thankful for the experiences that made you laugh, made you cry and made you grow. It’s about all that you have, all that you had and all that you will soon gain. Letting go is having the courage to accept change, and the strength to keep moving. Letting go is growing up. It is realizing that the heart can sometimes be the most potent remedy. To let go is to open a door, to clear a path and to set your-self free.                    feeling quite down cos of e match jus now.. well.. its damn wasted.. played against combine red.. hrmm.. duno y my cousin n carmen was not arnd.. tink we're not worth their presence? haha.. b4 e match.. i already told XJ i had e winning feeling liao.. i really felt tt we cld win.. combine.. so wad? its nthg lo.. jus a name.. for e first 2 quarters.. we played hard n played well n e score was only like within 4-6 pts margin.. we were trailing.. but still tot we can overcome them.. until 3rd quarter.. wonder wad happened.. almost everyone relaxed.. den dey extended their lead.. n we end up losing.. by 26pts somemore.. damn man.. 65-39.. sian lo.. i scored arnd 1/5 of e pts.. heh.. 8 again.. it sucks man.. anw dis match.. i guess.. everyone in e team tinks tt we're bound to lose.. well.. i still tink we cld hv won.. cld hv la.. haiz.. abit disappointed.. if i were to be a coach one day.. dun tink i'll ever be.. hah.. i will NEVER tolerate players who're not serious n always fooling arnd.. its like jus now.. when e player made a terrible mistake n e coach pointed it out.. she can jus smile at e coach n look vy innocent.. i really wonder.. if she tk note of wad coach said n try not to repeat e mistake anymore.. is she serious abt e game not.. damn...                  tot of my past wif J.. u knw.. really used to believe in those one love one lifetime thing...? but after my rs with her.. jus deteriorated.. haiz.. tot things were really so wonderful with her.. but guess every couple will hv tt honey moon period.. after tt.. e love will not be tt sparkling anymore.. jus died-ed somehow.. mine din die.. but i tink hers cooled down.. maybe cos of studies? heh.. was really busy wif e stuff we had to manage.. moreover..
