  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic:\n\n             I have viewed photos of recently murdered Mr. Johnson in Saudi Arabia.  I also saw the photos of the murderous beheading of Mr. Berg in Iraq.  This is the face of the enemy people.  These people will never stop.  They themselves arent even sure what their endgame is supposed to be.  It is time once and for all to finish it.  Yes that's right.  Simply finish it.  Will we kill a bunch of innocent people in the process.  Probably.  Will we accidentally hit the wrong buildings or injure totally innocent people.  Yes Im afraid we will.  But that being said, it is simply time to finish it.  Wipe them out entirely?  Well I guess in the real world in which we all reside, that is  an impossibility.  But we take the same tack here that the FBI has taken with kidnapping over the years.  The FBI has practically stopped all kidnapping for ransom in this country.  Sure it still goes on all the time in custody cases.  But good old fashioned kidnapping for money...No pretty much gone.  And how?  Simple.  The FBI always got the guy.  They simply made it so if you kidnapped someone for ransom, you would get caught or killed every time.  Same principal should apply here.  If you kill an innocent American, anywhere on the planet, for any of a million stupid unjustified reasons, we should hunt you down and kill you. No matter what the circumstances or costs involved, if you harm Americans, we will harm you.   Simple.  Direct.  (Maybe even a bit brutal)  Unfortunate maybe, but extremely effective when dealing with people who dont understand speeches, just direct action.  Members of Congress, Members of the Cabinet, Mr President, please, Just finish it.   Arrick                           Are you kidding me?  The commission has decided in its infinite wisdom that it would like to reinterview Vice-President Cheney after he stated he 'possibly' had seen more intelligence information than the commission had.  OF COURSE he's seen more information.  He's the Vice-President.  Not to mention his varied services over the years to the federal government. (Including SecDef)  Mr. Cheney is a voracious reader and the government can generate some paper my friends.  He has probably had access to and read 1000's of documents that will never see the light of day.  Does anyone believe Mr. Cheney is going to march back to the commission and spill his guts?  Wake up people.  The Administration is adamant in it's assessment of the fact there was a relationship between Iraq's regime and the al-Qaida terrorist network.  I think in time they will be proven correct.  I believe the Administration is in possession of intelligence so secret, that it's leaking out would probably get real people killed.  How else to explain the Administration's position.  Even after the public pronouncement by the commission that there was no connection, both the President and VP stated differently almost immediately.  I do not believe this was done to win an election in November.  I think they know something that the rest of us don't yet.  There are times folks, WHEN IT DOES MAKE SENSE FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO KEEP SOME THINGS SECRET!!!  I believe this to be one of those times.   Arrick                       About time!  The United states has launched offensive military operations against the Taliban forces still in Afghanistan.  US Intelligence agencies in recent weeks have stepped up security apparatus around the country based on 'considerable chatter' by the terrorist network.  There has been considerable concern on an attack trying to intimidate the US elections this fall.  This military action is an attempt to keep the Taliban on the run and to disrupt planning for their continued activities.    It can only be hoped that any actions on the part of US and Coalition forces in Afghanistan, will shake the Taliban and al-Qaida leadership.  Osama bin Laden remains in the mountainous region there, and still is the most dangerous man in the world.  His ultimate capture and execution will end a lot of motivation for the people who continue to reek havoc around the world.  ANY ACTION OR MEASURE SHOULD BE USED TO ACHIEVE THIS PURPOSE!  There are times when the ends does justify the means, and this is certainly one of those times if there ever was one.  ARRICK                       Man did they blow this one!  The Court did what it has been famous for doing for two centuries.  They simply dodged the entire thing.  The man who brought the dispute is in a custody battle with his ex-wife, so the Court said he didn't have standing to bring the case to begin with.  The Court has a long and storied history of doing just this.  Dodging politically flammable objects by just blowing them off on a technicality.  What i didn't hear anyone ask was this.  So the man involved is in a custody dispute.  If the girl is still his daughter, then why doesn't he have standing to bring this suit?  Now don't get me wrong folks.  I think this guy is completely full of shit and he is only making a case out of this to get his fifteen minutes.  But having said that, he should certainly have the right to defend his daughter, especially if he is going through the judicial system the proper way.    To the heart of the matter now.  The Pledge of Allegiance is NOT a prayer.  It has no bearing whatsoever as to the mixing of religion and government.  It is simply a patriotic 'ceremony', and a very pleasant way to start a day or begin some special event with.  If you don't want to say it along with the rest of us, fine.  That is also your right to do so.  But don't expect the rest of us to capitulate to your obvious state of being out of touch.  America is a great country and this is just one way for the citizenry to show that.  Arrick                        I have searched and searched and I just cant find it.  I thought for sure I was doing something wrong, and as I continued to look I became more fascinated as to who would be the first to help me find it.  GOOGLE News with their superfast news page?  Nope.  How about world famous Ted Turner and CNN?  No, not here either.  Well if not them, then surely Rupert and the boys over at FOX News will have it.  Hmmmmmm........I just dont see it.  MSNBC?  I mean surely with Bill Gates at the helm I will find what I seek here.  NO Damnit, frustrated again!  What about our foreign friends?  Maybe they can help me find that which I seek.  BBC, my fine British cousin, how bout you?  Do you have it here?  NO.  How about Pravda our fine new Russian allies.  Do you have it hidden away there somewhere?  SKYNEWS?  Anybody???  IS ANYONE STILL LOOKING FOR OSAMA?  Well the sad truth is that no one is apparently minding the store and keeping an eye on the most dangerous man in the world.  Al-Qaida works in cycles for those of you who are uninitiated in the martial arts, and the summertime schedule in the US provides a whole plethera of target rich environments for those wishing us harm.  And yet as I searched through the main pages of the world's most recognized news sights, I couldn't find word one about this man?  Have these people forgotten about 9-11?  Are they ashamed to remind themselves as well as the rest of us about what happened that day?  Those of you in charge of these news organizations should take a hard look in the mirror and ask yourselves if you are doing your jobs to the best of your ability.  People care and they should be able to rely on what they are told.  But what about when none of you are doing the telling?  I hope the next time Osama is back on the front page of all of these websites, its not because he's killed another 3000 Americans.   Arrick                       Once again the al-Qaida have struck and shown their devious genius at the same time.  Five attacks, almost simultaneously, show again that this is a highly organized, supremely motivated group of terrorists.  The fact that the attacks happened in such a coordinated manner suggests that the leadership of this group is maybe much smarter in a tactical sense than they have been credited for.  The bold and daring attack shows also that we still haven't had the effect on disrupting their operations that we simply must have if we intend to stop this madness.  We have to go offensive, and stop standing around waiting for them to do something else for us to react to.  It has always been a bad thing in warfare to give the initiative over to the enemy.  They have the initiative now, at least for the time being.  And the sad thing is they just took it right away.  Remember folks, this is the same bunch of shits who completely changed the election results in Spain just months ago.  They think they can stop the new government in Iraq, they think they will win Saudi Arabia, and they think they will win here in November as well.  Any one who believes they will stop at nothing had better wake up.  Arrick                       And so it continues.  The al-Qaida have now beheaded a third foreigner, a man from South Korea no less.  How do they think this is going to help their cause?  Do they really believe that if they keep cutting people's heads off, and posting it on the internet, that all of a sudden world opinion is going to rally around them?  These people are extremists in the absolute sense of the word.  They think they are going to have total Islamic control of the world and that they are doing absolutely right.  There is only one way that has proven proper down through history to deal with such people.  Total annihilation.  Completely wipe them out.  Just days after the disastrous 911,  Vice President Cheney brought up an idea of having 'hunter-killer' teams established by the CIA and the American Special Forces Community.  The sole purpose of these teams would be to track and hunt down terrorists cells worldwide, and eliminate them.  The idea was rejected by several other members of the Administration as to extreme a reaction.  I could not disagree more.  I think the VP had it absolutely right the first time.  I think the development and deployment of such hunter-killer teams in desolate places such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Jordan, Indonesia, Malaysia, The Phillipines  and probably dozens of other places would be a fantastic way to take the offensive against this continuing worldwide threat.  I wonder how many heads would continue to be cut off if the full power and might of The United States military and intelligence establishment were fully unleashed?  How much more shit are we going to tolerate from these people before we decide there has to be a better way of dealing with it?  Arrick                        When seems to be the new question of the day my friends.  Not if but when?  Everyone seems convinced that after the al-Qaida bombed the Spanish rail line, they seemed to be at least partially responsible for changing the government over to one not as friendly to the United States.  This new government was democratically elected by the people of Spain in a free election.  Was the bombing of only a few days previously on everyone's mind?  Of course it was.  Was 9-11 on Congress' mind when we passed the Patriot Act?  Of course it was.  People react strangely sometimes when faced with extreme adversity.  WHEN the terrorists hit the United States again, and Im sorry friends but I truly do believe this is going to be the case, they will be doing so with the intention of influencing the American Presidential election.  Unfortunately for the al-Qaida, this is'nt Spain!  You see, this is the part about America everybody else just doesn't get.  When we get hit again, Im afraid that the average Joe Schmo who probably doesn't pay that much attention to politics is going to become involved in the process.  And then my friends they will elect in a landslide the man who they think will go out and kill the bastards who keep trying our patience.  Does anyone really believe that under these circumstances that John Kerry can beat George Bush?  Get your head out of the clouds people and remember who sits in the White House always gets the advantage as the incumbent.  Look at the team he has put together around him, and you see it's a virtual whos who of the US Government over the last 20 years.  Combine with this another attack on the homeland or the capture of Osama binLaden, and George will win running away.  The question is WHEN?   Arrick                           Are we ever going to learn from our pettiness?  Secretary Ridge over at Homeland Security asked last year to change the name of the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement to Bureau of Investigations and Criminal Enforcement.  This has apparently gotten a lot of panties in a wad over at the FBI.  In their minds, they simply can not allow another federal law enforcement agency to have the name 'Investigation' in it.  Does this sound like the kind of bullshit that the Secretary for Homeland Security, the Attorney General, and the FBI Director should be wasting a lot of time on?  It sounds to me like the same kind of crap that was going on when people in the field were trying to get the leadership to listen and stop the worst attack in American history.  You people are supposed to be the best and brightest.  It seems that all of the lessons supposedly learned since 911, (better communication among government agencies) has passed the three of you right on by.  Shame on you for wasting time on something so petty.  Settle this, and get back to the people's business.  If you guys aren't paying attention to what's going on out there, then who is?  Im very sorry to say that it certainly doesn't sound to me like we have reached that spirit of interagency cooperation that is so vital for our success in the war against terrorism.
