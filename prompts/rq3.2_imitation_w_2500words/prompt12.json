  "user": "Here is an example of the writing style you are expected to mimic (2500 words):\n\n'''\n       ok, tonight was the next to the last episode of  urlLink Last Comic Standing . the three finalists: Alonzo Bodden, Gary Gulman, John Heffron. did ya watch it?? huh?? huh?? huh??? that's ok, i did. so here it is: go to  urlLink www.votenbc.com  and vote for John Heffron. hurry, i'll be right here waiting for you to come back. ..................... ok, this is why you should have voted for John: now, don't get me wrong, i am not voting for the 'cute one', i am voting for the funny one. and overall, he is a riot. full of energy, funny, oozing humor, mass of ....wait, this is sounding yucky. trust me, he's funny. the other two had many high points, but there can only be one winner. hey, that's the rules.  i am not a huge fan of tv, prefer movies to channel surfing, but damn that show was funny. even if it was a reality show....  Some of the others that got the axe:  urlLink Kathleen Madigan , and  urlLink Ant , not to mention  urlLink Todd Glass , very funny people....  and i must mention...  urlLink Gary Gulman  reminds me of  urlLink Dane Cook  , has a lot of his manerisms....... dane is so much more than funny, he is a god.  one hell of a sexy god too.  ya know, in case that sort of thing is important for you to know...                  remember the days when the worst news on the tv was about that little brat down the street and his friends riding their skateboards on the newly paved road and the old ladies called the cops cuz they didn't want their street ruined by punks?   ok so maybe you didn't live where i did.  but i miss it.  the more i hear about the war on terrorism, iraq, oil stuff, the UN, the president of the US, the more i want to scream, pull out my hair, run about slapping everyone i see upside the head.   is that wrong?  cuz man, does it ever seem necessary.    i do not want to sound like i am belittling the seriousness of world events, by no means, i assure you, i am not.  but dammit.  wtf!  in the 'old days'if tommy spit on sally, tommy's mom would smack his ass red and send him to his room with no dinner and make him apologize too!  but now, tommy's mom would be doing hard time with murderers and thieves for child abuse, and tommy would have knocked sally up by raping her and their kid left on a door step somewhere, but that's ok, cuz there are programs to help both of them achieve their GED's and get a job that pays just enough to buy them cigs and beers.    hm, i sound like such a negative person.  wonder how that happened?                 how do you answer that question?&nbsp; especially if you've never been to another country.&nbsp; do you need to have a comparison?&nbsp; is patriotism supposed to be blind? &nbsp;  depending on your age, i'm sure there are a lot of answers to that question.&nbsp; maybe if you're older, seen some wartime, it takes on a new meaning.&nbsp; maybe if you're&nbsp;younger you lean towards arrogance at the whole idea of patriotism because all you've known all your life is what you have been handed and what you feel you're owed or missing.&nbsp;   whenever i hear on the news of someone joining the military because they want to 'serve their counrty' i cringe.&nbsp; do you really?&nbsp; do you honestly understand what that phrase means?&nbsp;  anger is easy, they bomb our buildings and kill our people, let's go bomb them and theirs.&nbsp; that'll work, have we learned nothing from history?&nbsp; unfortunately&nbsp;a flip side to that, letting the big corporations step in, make it all about money and power and yet again forget about the actual people involved...still we get nowhere.&nbsp; how do we know the 'democratic way' is the right way?&nbsp; we don't all subscribe to the same religion, why would one set of politics work if one God doesn't? &nbsp;  being a proud american is not a simple statement anymore.&nbsp; human beings as a whole have successfully managed to complicate everything.&nbsp; nothing is simple anymore.&nbsp; you can't be tolerant if you can't agree to disagree.&nbsp; our opinions have become our war-stance.&nbsp; do we feel like we have something to prove?&nbsp; or maybe we have something to disprove?&nbsp;   i have strong opinions, if you don't subscribe, fine, if you'd like to express your opinion, do so.&nbsp; it's always good to hear how others feel.&nbsp;   i am proud to be an american.&nbsp; yes, i've lived in another country but i don't feel that it is necessary to do&nbsp;&nbsp;to be proud of the country you live in.&nbsp; i believe in God to a certain extent.&nbsp; and i love the fact that here in america i can say this out loud and hear it from others without fear.&nbsp; if you want to pray in public, knock yourself out, i don't... but i also don't feel the need to dictate how you 'praise' your God.&nbsp; in being tolerant, you have to learn how to allow other people to have their 'freedoms', after all, isn't that what america is about?&nbsp; personal freedoms, personal rights.&nbsp;  too many americans today have adopted the notion that they are underpaid, underappreciated, unfairly judged or wronged in some way.&nbsp; maybe these people need to take a step beyond the borders just to see how 'rich' their lives really are and what great opportunites they have available to them.&nbsp; i'm not so blind to think that there aren't any people at all that have been wronged, i'm sure some issues are real and deserve attention and justice.&nbsp; if money is how you rate quality of life, you're missing out on so much.&nbsp; same goes for fame.&nbsp;  in my pursuit of happiness i expect only one thing, that you respect my personal space, which i have right here in my home, where i am free to turn off the television if i don't care for the programming, shut of the music if i don't care for the lyrics, seperate myself from my community if i don't agree with the way things are being run.&nbsp;  i vote so that i may retain the right to complain if i am not satisfied at the way things turn out.&nbsp; being inactive is the same as being ignorant.&nbsp; do something.&nbsp; because doing nothing and complaining is meaningless.&nbsp;   this rant all came about after watching the news... i don't normally climb on my soapbox and vent, especially here in my blog where i am sure to receive a heaping of shit mail for my views.&nbsp; i won't tell you who to vote for in the upcoming election but i will tell you i am voting for kerry/edwards because i am unhappy at the way things are going.&nbsp; i only hope you'll be active in how your country is run.&nbsp; being a 'fair-weathered american' is like only rooting for your favorite sports team when they are in the finals.&nbsp; i get angry when this country behaves stupidly.&nbsp; i am thrilled when we make a difference in another country.&nbsp; either way, i am still&nbsp;proud of my country.&nbsp;                    it's been a while since i've taken a moment just to browse other people's blogs.  i find it interesting to read what other people have to say... (ok, except for the younger ones and their ever so abundant angst).    anyway... i have had the same blogs listed to the side (over there-----> ) for some time now, and sooner or later i will add some more... but out of boredom, i browsed 'their' blogs listed...   the end result:  we're all bored.  we all ramble, rant, vent, blabber, babble and just plain type.  some we're quite interesting, it isn't an easy thing to do when you 'shout' out your opinion on your blog for the 'whole world' to read.  nope, not easy because it inevitably means an email full of comments that you might not want to read.    and then there's the ones that i find myself checking up on every time i am sitting here at my computer... as if i need to check on a family member or friend... really now, this is like stalking.  i don't usually leave comments so i am a stranger in all sense of the word. so checking to see if you've posted has now gone from mere interest to a need.  need to check to see if you've blogged.  wonder why you haven't.  is something wrong, are you gonna come back and blog again?  omg what will i do if you don't blog again?  you'll be missed.    man, that is just freaky, don't ya think?    yeah, i am bored.  thanks for paying attention.  feel free to stalk :)                 about 6 months ago, i decided it was time to get a&nbsp;DVD player.&nbsp; yes, i was addicted to VHS... or at least too busy to care to upgrade... so now that i've got this new toy i decided to go thru all the VHS tapes and minimize, make room for DVD's.&nbsp;  this weekend's winners, or at least the ones i watched again:  American History X -- how could you not love edward norton?&nbsp; rather violent but still....  The Sixth Sense -- nope, i didn't have it figured out till the end.&nbsp; which makes it a really good movie...  Fight Club-- hey, another edward norton, and yup, you guessed it, rather violent...  Bone Collector-- figured out the 'whodunnit' part but still, adreneline movie  The Mexican-- i thought this was gonna be a very lame movie, but it wasn't so bad...  Primal Fear-- &nbsp; richard gere,&nbsp;hmm, eddy again.... good movie, even if he was guilty. &nbsp; maybe i should 'ebay' the rest of movies in the box, that means i have to admit to once buying them... i'll have to give that more thought...                  i can't believe it's august already! where'd july go??? it's already 'back-to-school' shopping time (silent cheering from my chair) and my kids are SO ready to go back! ok, maybe i am more ready for them to go back, but whatever... one month vacation is plenty.  yesterday, i took my son to get some new sneakers.... he's 12, going on 35. he already knew what he wanted, mowed the lawn at least 10 times to earn the money for them. (mind you, our lawn is acres) so now he is the proud owner of a pair of sneakers that were more expensive than my entire closet of shoes. damn. but he earned them.  so while we're browsing the aisles for clothes for my daughter (she's 9) i can't help but notice there is no difference in buying for a 9 year old than buying for me (not a 9 year old). all the jeans, low rise, snug fitting in the seat, tops cut to fit, cropped to show off ... show off what? a 9 year olds belly button?! wtf. she found a pair of jeans to try on, slipped into the changing room and came out to show me. when she came out, she told me she didn't like the pants, (thank god) so i asked why...  'cuz I can't sit down in them without my bum showing.'  and that is what happens when you sit on the floor in a 4th grade classroom when it is circle time and all the kids sit on the rug in front of the teacher while she talks....  who decides what children's clothes should look like anyway? children in elementary school should not look 'sexy'. it's sick. it just is.  funny how all the boys clothes are baggy and loose fitting with a hundred oversized pockets on the jeans and t-shirts that are too big for me.          \n'''\n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
