I was poolside by 11:00 a.m. and didn't leave the deck until about four when Julie and I went for a drive out to the Frosty Treat.  I didn't even get that burnt; hardly at all actually but my tan is deepening.  Julie and I had a great afternoon in the pool trying out all the different toys and making arses of our self.  It was fun.  Ruth stopped by this relentless string of night shifts she on is really f*cking with her system.  I went down to Ch'town last night.  Good times...  I feel myself always on edge now when I walk into Ethan's place.  Usually one of us is in some type of 'mood' when we see each other but we both had yesterday off so we were in fine spirits.  We went to the Churchill Arms for supper...had a pitcher of beer gone before our food came...another pitcher for with our meal...and another pitcher for conversations sak!  Got home, did a couple of 'toot-too-too-loo-toots' and giggled myself to sleep.  (Sigh)  I hated to leave this morning...but work calls and three sleeps from now I'll be in Hali...and then on the 9, 10, and 11, Adam will be on PEI so I can't be slacking off right now!  Anyways, I best get to work...I think the only way I'll survive today is if I keep very busy!  TTFN                 Morning all!  One more day and it's the weekend...yippee!!!!!  It's been a pretty laid back week to say the least.  Tuesday after work, I went up to Ch'town for a bit...hung out with Donovan, then the two of us went over to Dave's for supper. Dave BBQ'd shark and it was delicious!!!! I went to see 'my man' for a bit afterwards and then headed to Ruth's for Big Brother and Amazing Race.  Yesterday, Pam (my co-worker) and I went on a 'field trip'  We went and hiked a trail near Stanhope because we're working with a community that is thinking of doing something similar.  We also stopped at the Island Preserve Co. on the way back; the owner put in a botanical garden so we took a walk through there.  We were back by about two but instead of going back to work, we each went home and pretended like our trip took all day!  I was poolside by 2:30 and it was HOT!!!!  It started out as a cool and dreary day but ended up being a scorcher.  Last night, I lazed around, went to Wallyworld with Ruth and that was about it.  Today should be a busy one at work.  I have a lot of paperwork to get caught up on.  I'm facilitating a Business Camp in two weeks so I have to start getting things in order for that.  Should be fun though!                     The pendulum of the mind alternates between sense and nonsense, not between right and wrong.    I read that quote today and it struck a chord so I thought I would post it.   New look for my blog today. I went to do a post and I just didn't feel like writing on a green screen. I didn't sleep well last night and I woke up with a headache...I'm feeling pretty pissy today. This template is called 'dark dots'...I'm feeling a bit dark today so I thought it would suffice.   Today, I could have totally used a mental health day rather then coming into work. I think I could have laid in bed all day today. Unfortunately, there is no such thing as a mental health day in the perfect Parnham residence... that being said, something is not right in the world of Cricki...Did I mention I'm how excited I am to be going to Halifax next weekend. That right there might do the trick! I need to get off this Island...aaaaaarrrrrgggghhhh!   Anyways, it appears that this morning my 'pendulum' is swinging more to the nonsense side of things...I'll quit my rambling and start my work.    xxxooo                         How's everyones weekend been so far?  Mine's been awesome!  Except for a slight hangover yesterday which I slept off in the afternoon.  Went down to Ch'town for Sam Roberts last night...I ended up listening to him and the Trews from Ethan's place.  I just DID NOT have the gumption to be amongst throngs of drunk people since I was only feeling so-so from the night before.  Ethan worked until eight and we were both starving so we listened to the tunes from his place...chowed down on some food from the Superstore and chilled.  It was a wonderful, relaxing evening.  Also, we watched the movie  Pieces of April  with Katie Holmes in it.  Have any of you seen it?  I highly recommend it...there were funny parts and at the end of it, I was crying and when I looked over at Ethan, he was crying too.  Doesn't that melt your heart?!?!?!  Very good movie.  Hung out at Ethan's this morning and now I'm off to the grocery store for provisions for tomorrow.  It's supposed to be 21 tomorrow with cloudy periods.  Sounds decent for the patio/pool/bbq party.  It'll be nice to get a group together here although there are will be people missed (like you Amy!!!)  I'm hugely looking forward to it though.  Anywho, I best get to it...Ruth is coming over later so i don't want to miss her.  Hope you're all having a fabulous day.   Ames:  I'm so glad to hear that the show went so well last night.  I'll hoop up with you via telephone soon so I can hear all about it!!!!                   Tonight I teach my first marketing workshops to the participants in the Young Millionaires Program. I’m here until 8 o’clock tonight so I’ve been pacing myself workwise this morning.  For some reason, I started searching friends’ names in google.  This is what I found so far:    urlLink Ruth Dawson       urlLink Adam Genge       urlLink Amy Sprague       urlLink Nadine Reeves       urlLink Julie Clow       urlLink Charlene Gillis       Some things you may have noticed... Although Nadine's last name is now Stevens...I put a link to Nadine Reeves only because the story of Nadine Reeves was about how her son had been killed by cops (not so happy) Julie (by far) had the most actual articles about herself or that she had written Charlene actually wrote that paper at Mount A And obviously, the others are not my real friends.  Kinda blows my mind that there are other people in the world named the same because as far as I'm concerned my friends are one of a kind!!!!  Corny eh?!?!?!                 Good Morning!  Did everyone have a good weekend?  Mine was pretty good.  Friday afternoon, I got off work a little early and headed for the beach...I was finally in the ocean for the first time this summer!  Surprisingly, it wasn't that cold.  It was windy as HELL though.  I showered at Ethan's once I got back and even after showering I could still feel grains of sand in my hair.  Friday night I had a few drinks and went to Baba's.  There wasn't much going on there and I was a little 'frizzle-frazzled' so I just kinda sat there in a daze.  Saturday, I slept in until 1:30!!!  I couldn't believe it!  Took the dog for a walk, then hung around Ch'town until 'my boy' got off work and we had supper.  Headed back to Summerside Saturday night and got a good night's sleep.  Sunday morning was started off with Coronation Street, of course!  Although Corrie isn't half as fun to watch by myself.  Watching it with Ethan, or Shelley, would be more exciting.  I worked a little bit yesterday and hung out with Ruth...this morning I just came in for a bit to talk to my boss and now I'm heading to Ch'town to pick up Ethan and head to the beach.  Can't wait!  Hope you all are able to enjoy the day...                 It's the weekend!  It's the weekend!  I don't have a whole lot of excitement on the go but it's going to be a busy one.  In 30 minutes I teach my first workshop of the summer for the Young Millionaires Program.  I'm not nervous at all; just excited to get going.  This afternoon I'm heading up to my folks to help with some gardening and then tonight I'm heading to Ch'town.  I'm gonna spend the evening with Donovan since I haven't seen him in FOREVER and then spend the night with Ethan.  Tomorrow is MY BIRTHDAY!  Yippee! I'm looking forward to a day of relaxation.  Ethan and I will get up for Coronation Street and then I think we're going to head to Cora's for breakfast then catch a movie in the afternoon.  Tomorrow evening I think Joanne and Jerry are going to have Mom and Dad down for a BBQ for my birthday.  27 years old.  I thought I'd have more accomplished by now but hell, if I dwell on it, I'll drive myself nuts so I'm just going to keep on movin' on.    Anywho, I have a little more prep to do before my workshop begins so I best get to it.  ******A huge WELCOME BACK to Nadine and Jonny...I can't wait to hear all about your trip!!!!!                 Hi all!  Work is busy today!  I just looked at the clock and it's 11:20...I've been working steady since I got in this morning.  It's nice to have the day off on Friday but it kinda sucks fitting 5 days of work into 4.  After being bummed about not talking to Ethan the other night, I ended up talking to him like 3 times yesterday plus one REALLY cute voicemail from him on my cell phone as well.  He's so cute!  Tonight they're having a 'hardcore BBQ' at there place.  Four bands...Buried Inside (from Ottawa), Doctor Unk, Cheers to Beers, Gruesome Feast and another band Poison.  I've been to the last two shows at their place.  The turnout is pretty amazing.  They do it all-ages, no alcohol allowed, and even though the kids are thrashing around like crazy their respectful at the same time.  Besides the bands, their BBQing veggie burgers and dogs, having salad etc.  I've chosen not to attend though, I'm opting for a night with my Ruby Tuesday.  I'll see Ethan tomorrow night and all day Friday!!!!  So yes, tonight I'm hanging with Ruth...we may veg and watch a movie, or possibly head into the Heritage Pub for trivia to meet up with some of the other nurses she works with. My cash flow is pretty limited so I'm hoping just to hang and watch a movie.  Anyways, my life is unexciting...I don't know why I'm continuing to ramble.  Hope y'all having a great day.                   I hope everyone had a great weekend; I certainly had a fun one!  I got home from work on Friday and immediately opened a 'cold one.'  Drank some beers with Joanne and Jerry and then we headed for the Quality Inn for the Summer Shake-up Meet and Greet. The Summer Shake-Up is put on by the Prince Country Street Rod Association every two years.  People bring their old cars from all around the Maritimes and it's basically a big 'piss-up'  I had alot of fun, got pretty tipsy and only spent five bucks!  Saturday morning, I taught a workshop for the YM Program and then headed to Ch'town.  I laid on Ethan's couch for about two hours feeling totally crappy and then we went out and about.  We went to Indigo, Ethan bought me a new book,  Straight Talking  by Jane Greene, a British author that I really like.   Amy: Remember me telling you about the book  Mr. Maybe  that I loaned Alana one time? This book is by the same author.  I've read a few of her books... Babyville, Jemima J., Bookends, Mr. Maybe,  and now I'm reading  Straight Talking .  It's not my usual forensic science mystery type book.  It's light, fluffy reading about groups of girlfriends and the trials and tribulations of womanhood.  They always tend to make me laugh out loud and I can often draw comparisons with 'my girls'  I also bought another book,  4 Blondes , by the author that wrote the book  Sex and the City  which inspired the TV series.  I'll dig into it next.  So yes, book shopping was the highlight of my Saturday afternoon.  I also picked up another Woody Allen movie for my collection.  Saturday night, Ethan and I ordered in pizza...some of his guy friends stopped by so I snuck upstairs to start reading my book while he stayed downstairs, drank beer, and hung out with the boys.  He came upstairs with me around 9:30 and we watched movies, etc.  It was perfect, totally relaxing...I love him!!!  Yesterday morning started with  Coronation Street , then I packed up, spent Father's Day up home, and crashed early with my new book.  I got to catch up on some phone calls...Congrats to Alana and Sarah for winning the Amazing Race on Saturday!!!!  Anyways, I have CRAPLOADS of work to do today...I'm taking Friday off and giving myself a long weekend so I best prepare for that.  I'm totally pumped too because Ethan is off on Friday...Joanne and Jerry leave for Florida on Friday...for the first time since I moved to Scummerside we'll actually have some 'alone time.'  Yippee!!!!!!!!  Hope you're all having a fabulous day!!!         \n'''\n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
