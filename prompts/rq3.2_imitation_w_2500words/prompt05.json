I know it takes more than just&nbsp;a title to help me reach that level of sophistication.                  Ok sometimes I think I live an ordinary life, but then nights like tonight happen. To begin I would like to state that none of this story is embellished or made up. This is exactly how it happened.  It started as an ordinary Tuesday night. I went to bible study. Then I went to Starbucks to get Juiced Up (see previous entry). Finally around midnight I get home. I turn on my computer to see if anyone’s online and to my surprise there is. So as I am getting ready to talk to some people my door bell rings. So I’m a little hesitant to go to the door this late at night. So I take a golf club with me and look through the peep hole and as I do there is a loud bang on the door at the same time scaring me half to death. I open the door and it’s the neighbor (the wife, which is important later on). She seems to be scared from something so I ask her what’s wrong. She told me that there were tornados on the way and they needed in my shelter. So I tell her ok, let me go get the gate unlocked and we’ll go to the shelter. She tells me she’s going to get her kids and stuff. So I decide to wake up my brother who is staying at my house tonight. I tell him about the golf ball size hail and tell him to move his car in the garage.  So we go out to move his car into the garage and he looks over at the side of the house weird. But doesn’t say anything and moves his car in and goes back to sleep. So I go to the side of the house where I see three little girls crying and running towards my shelter. Then I look down and there is the neighbor lady laying on the ground not moving. So I shake her and she doesn’t seem to be awake. And that is when I notice the smell of alcohol on her. She was blitzed. So I drag her towards the shelter with her heavy bag. When we get to the shelter she comes to. So I walk her down the stairs and tell her to wait down there while I go and check the tv out to see where the storms where.  So I turn on the tv to see what Mike Morgan has to say and to call Rosey, who I knew was just getting home from the juiced up session, to see what I should do. Rosey tells me to leave them down there and check up on them from time to time. So after Mike tells me that there are no actual tornados on the ground and its just high winds I decide to go and relay the message to the people in my shelter. I get down there and the girls are still in tears and keep saying they’re going to die. So I informed them that everything was going to be fine and there were no tornados and they could stay down there if they wanted or they can head back home. So their mom tells them to go back to the house. And she then ask me to help her with her bag. So as I’m zipping up her bag I noticed she had a gun in there that she has left over from when she was on the police force. So alcohol and guns. They don’t mix. So I grab her bag and tell her to go ahead and I’ll shut the shelter.  So I get out of the shelter and she’s waiting for me at the top. I close up the shelter and start walking to the front of the house and all of a sudden I feel her grab my butt!!! I panic and just start walking faster. As we turn the corner to go to her house she falls so I help her up and help her to her door. She invites me in her house with her. So I tell her that I have to get back to my house. That’s when she tells me how thankful she is that I was there to help in this great emergency and she then leans in for a kiss!!! So I quickly shut the door before she gets near me and come straight back to my house and lock the doors. Now I’m sitting here in disbelief that it all happened. But I’m writing this on my blog because I may later convince myself it didn’t happen.  Sometimes its better to have a boring same thing every day life. But I guess this way I always have an exciting story to tell. I hope you believe this story cause it really happened. I will never open my door again when there is a storm outside.                    urlLink    The Amazing Race&nbsp; urlLink     &nbsp;  The Amazing Race is my new favorite TV show. I absolutely love it! If you’ve been living under a rock this summer and haven’t heard of the Amazing Race you’re missing out!&nbsp; Here are my top 10 reasons why I like the show and why you should be watching it! &nbsp;  10. It’s the only reality show that has an Emmy…yes folks it beat out Survivor!  9. What other reality show can you watch where teams are going to different locations each week. Every Tuesday night I feel like I get a free vacation.  8. CBS picks the best teams to watch. This year we have a Christian dating couple, an internet older dating couple, father daughter , husband wife, bowling moms, brothers, twins, 2 other dating couples, once engaged, and my favorite the cousins. Usually you can pick one team that you are really rooting for.  7. The host! Alright ladies Phil is no Jeff Probst (Survivor Host) but he’s pretty dang close. Unlike Jeff, Phil really doesn’t talk , which I like. Sometimes during Survivor I get so sick of hearing Jeff voice his opinion. WHO CARES is always what I’m thinking. With Phil you don’t have to worry about that because he doesn’t talk! I like that! 6. The Fights! Each team has chosen their partner so they know each other pretty well! Nothing is better than watching partners get in a fight and then still having to be stuck with each other. It’s great!&nbsp;  5. Wednesday…yes Wednesday! Wednesday is the day my good friend Teresa and I discuss the show. We have some great discussions on our opinion about the show. Sometimes these discussions last most of the day, hey helps me get through the work day!  4. More fights! These teams not only fight with each other they also fight with the other teams. This week one team didn’t like another team so they bought the remanding airplane tickets so that team couldn’t get on the plane….harsh!  3. Stupid people that make the show. You’d be surprised how many DUMB people make it on the show. The brothers teams… they like to yell at the foreigners because they think that helps them understand English!  2. The fact that this is the only show that I seriously sit in front of the TV and yell at the teams like they can hear me! Sad as that is… I’m not joking!  1. Charla! I love her! She’s with her cousin Mirna. Charla is a little person (FYI little people do not like to be called dwarfs or midgets). She has seriously gone farther than I or American thought she would go. Just look at her, how could that not be enjoyable to watch!   Alright I hope I’ve convinced everyone to tune in next week! It comes on every Tuesday, 9:00 pm CBS.&nbsp; Happy tubing!&nbsp;&nbsp;   Review written by Lindsy Graham                    For many years there has been a debate in football over   urlLink  grass    vs.   urlLink  turf   . Which is better to play on. They both have good and bad reasons why to use them. For instance, Turf you can run faster and you never have to mow it. It's consistant cause its all man made. But more injuries can occure on turf. So then grass you don't get as many injuries, its safer for the players. but you can't run as fast on it and it takes a lot of maintanence to keep it nice and consistant. And now they have this new hybrid of turf that is like grass but is a turf type material. Weird. So anyway different players prefer different things.  Well This week we found out what   urlLink  Ricky Williams    preference was. He prefers the grass. He prefers the grass over turf so much he quit playing profesional football at the peak of his career. He is giving up 8 million dollars because he prefers the grass. But the grass he prefers is   urlLink  Marijuana   . Yes that is correct. Ricky Williams has given up football because he likes Marijuana too much. After failing his third drug test by the NFL he decided to retire because he is tired of living by the strict rules of the NFL. In an article on   urlLink  ESPN.com    he talkes about how he's always got away with it because of a supplement drink he would take that could cover it up. So he's pretty much admitting he uses Marijuana on a regualar basis. Hmm. Wait one second. Isn't Marijuana illegal. Shouldn't the police be paying attention to this. Why isn't he being dealt with? Seriously. I feel like i'm taking crazy pills. He has already admitted to it. Where is the law. Why aren't we dealing with this problem.   urlLink  Dwight Gooden    and   urlLink  Darryl Strawberry     both went to jail when they were caught. Why isn't Ricky going to jail or something. Is it because his hair made him look Jamacian so its ok. Maybe thats why he shaved his head so that the police wouldn't recognize him and now they can't arrest him. Seriously. am i crazy? What's your thoughts? do you even care?          \n'''\n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
