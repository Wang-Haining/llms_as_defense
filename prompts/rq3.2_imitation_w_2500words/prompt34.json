Yes, you're reading it correct; I posted about 6hrs ago, and right now I should be sleeping, but I woke up fucking almost 2hrs ago and haven't been able to get back to sleep...goddamn dayshift...FUCK I hate dayshift!  Swings to days really screws up your schedule...I went to bed last night at 5:30a, and now I have to get up at 5:30a the next day??!! what kind of shit is that?!  Ok, enough ranting.  God...well because I couldn't sleep, I can't stop thinking.  Thinking about the women in my life; or should I say lack-thereof...My one good friend is getting married, I'm happy for her.  I hope I can attend the wedding.  But here's a fucked up one - My other _good_ friend, who has verbally expressed that she wished we could be sharing the same sleeping quarters, hadn't talked to me in over a week until last night.  I find that a little disturbing, in addition to the fact that she only referred to me twice in the 2hrs we talked.  More often than I, she referred to a mutual friend of ours who has been there to help her recently in time of need.  I feel a little displaced, yet I can't help but be happy for her.  That's a problem I'm going to have to learn to deal with, stretching myself to lend a hand, but not recieving one in return...it's what I do, but it's also draining me.  'Alas, poor me, I am pitiful...'  I think I should post some poetry I've written....maybe one a day so you fuckers have to come back everyday to read another one...? ;)  How selfish is that shit :)                       Whoo!  Road trip, man.  And a helluva trip it was.  Mapquest said 4.75hrs, but in reality, I believe it was more towards 5.5.  I dunno, I SUCK at directions...  So I bought a car off ebay.  A beautiful black 1992 Saab 900 Turbo.  Leather, power everything, sunroof, the works.  So it's not really the preferred method of purchasing a vehicle, but it works.  The worst thing is that you can't look at shit that _you_ want to look at, not what the owner wants you to look at (good or bad).  But I said fuck it, for $2200 I can't lose.  They said the car didn't need anything.  KBB said list was like $2500 or something.  Anyway, Willis, Me & another buddy (sorry, man, can't remember your name!) drove all the way up to Fairfax VA (which, by the way, 277mi is a LOT farther in real life than is is on paper) to go pick up the car.  I paid for it already the night before w/Paypal, so I was good.  ----The trip there--- Well on the fucking trip up, my phone rings, and in my fumbling to see and answer the phone, I drop the directions and the shit FLYS OUT THE FUCKING WINDOW.  Great.  So now I have no directions to where the hell I'm going.  Note, I'm like half way there.  Well low and behold, it was the seller seeing how we were doing (I told her I'd be there at like 5, and it was 5).  She gave us new directions, and we finally got there,  all fine and dandy.  We also stopped for a break around this time to get something to drink, etc, and while we were browsing around the gas station, we said 'hey, NC sux and doesn't have a lottery. let's play'.  So I threw down $6.  ---The trip back--- On the way back, not more than 50mi away from our original destination, we stop to get gas.  We decided to cash in our lottery tickets, which yielded us a $10 profit!  So that paid for the 3 of us to eat at Wendy's.  (kickass :)  Ok, so Willis wants to drive the saab, but he can't get it in gear.  Hell, I had a hard time driving it.  The clutch pedal isn't doing it's job!  She always wants to go in gear.  Well, I found out when I got home, that you have to pump the pedal a few times to work; this means my clutch master cylinder is toast/leaking.  A cheap repair, just a little inconvenience.  So anyway, I was able to get her going at the gas station (chirping the tires sometimes, but better than stalling :), and I drove her all 277 miles back, no problems.  She runs great, and she's faster than the 760T :)    I'll try to post a link soon w/pics of my new baby.  Anyone want to buy an  urlLink '89 Volvo 760 Turbo Intercooler  for $2500?  She's only got 216k mi....                       that has to be the reason.  I swear to god....  QUICK - Don't think of an elephant!   give you a million dollars if you didn't.  but of course that's an impossible task just by saying it.  This is how I feel right now, at this point in my life.  I say to myself, 'self,' (that's what I say to myself), 'self, don't look at the women around you today, the women you just by chance happen across in your normal life.  In fact, don't even _think_ about meeting the woman of your dreams.'  I might as well NOT think of an elephant.  It's impossible, I cannot NOT think about finding 'her'.  it is my only hope at this point in time.  but back to the subject; I was msged by a mysterious person the other day.  To this day, I don't regret replying.  It was someone who I'd met probably 2mo ago, one time.  But they remembered me (as I did they, after they revealed themselves).  Turns out we have quite a bit in common.  As of yet, I have been quite unsuccessful in trying to rid my mind of her (not that I have attempted or even WANT to; quite the contrary).  Speaking vice versa, I can't say that I've had the same impact, but one can only hope; and hope that this isn't coming off as desperate as it  sounds  is.  'alas, poor me, I am pitiful'...  [and, close curtain]                       Well, as much has I HATE dayshift, I'm up now and I feel somewhat optomistic about getting some shit done.  I don't know what, just stuff.  I need to do an oil change, get my timing belt & tensioner changed, fix a damn broken bulb (that I bought 2 days ago!), and I feel like spending some money on computer shit, but I hate waiting for shipping, so I may just go carrouse around town and see what's up.  I'm feeling a little better than meloncholy, not sure why...I guess cuz I got off early today, but then I think, 'hey dammit, we got off early and that's all fine and dandy, but why did swing shift get off COMPLETELY?!  WTF WILLIS?!!'  God I miss swingshift.  Ok, I also need to pickup dry cleaning, I better not forget that shit.  I need to buy some food too.  Not sure what, but I'm getting sick of cooking shit.  I need to buy some premade, no-cooking-req'd food.  Snack food kicks ass.  Damn,  urlLink Jane Leeves  (on my desktop) is fucking hot.  I need this picture blown up and put on my wall.                       Yes, I went to the strip club tonight, w/Willis (no, the other willis :)  It was ok, at least there was only one fat chick, instead like last time, when every other chick was fat.  That was fucked up.  No, but tonight, willis had only been to one strip club, so we went tonight, got in free (thanks, military id card), and we played pool, saw the 'sights'.  I thought our waitress was VERY cute, and she was cool, not trying for tips, so that very much appeals to me.  I talked to her a lot (as much as I could), tipped her very well as that is her wages (tips only), and told her I'd be at book a million tomm at 1p.  If she shows, it's all good, if not, it's all good, only I know that god hates me.  But that's a given anyway.  I hope she doesn't think I just tipped & talked cuz I was 'drunk' because I wasn't.  As of now (only 1.5 long islands after), I have a small buzz.  So I know completely what the fuck I'm doing.  It gave me confidence to set myself up for another fall.  I know that's what's going to happen because god hates me.  The end. There is nothing left to tell.  When tomm falls through like a ton of fucking bricks, that is proof alone that I am god's wasteland.  My life is nothing that has importance to him.  So fuck him.  That's bullshit, and that's life.  Fuck, why do I even waste my time trying when I know that my plans don't mean dick.  If there's some other plan, then GIVE IT TO ME so I can stop wasting my time trying to make MY plans work.  It's bullshit.  It's a waste of my time  & energy fucking with them.  d a m m i t.                        Princess Amanda  Copyright Seth Evans December 7, 2001  Once upon a time, in a far away land, There lived a Princess, who dreamt of a man. A Prince if you will, who would come to her aid, A gentleman of sorts, whose love would not fade.  Her hair was of gold, and her skin was soft as snow, Her eyes shown like diamonds, like Marilyn Monroe. All the time thinking, of her future and her life, Her ambition of becoming, a mother and a wife.  All that she wants, is the prince that she dreamt of, To ride off together, and fall madly in love. They will live forever, in each other's heart, They can never be divided, never split apart.  Their love was so great, it was the envy of all, Nothing could compare, the rest seemed so small. Her dream came true, she had found her prince, Life is grand now, more enjoyable since.  An addition to the family, is the only thing that's missing, Something she's always wanted, thinking back, and reminiscing. A small bundle of joy, to bring into the world, Maybe she can say, 'There's my little girl.'                       Yes, I think I'm going to kill someone.  I found out today that I'm on dayshift next week.  And probably for a lot of weeks to come.  SON OF A BITCH.  I just do not understand why they want to kill me this way.  I am a night owl, mornings beat the shit out of me.  I swear to god, like every morning I have to wake up at some god-forsaken hour, it must take like a year off my life.  YES, that much.  So I woke up today at like noon (swing shift is THE SHIT, YO!) and I was all good and chillin, right, and then I get to work and I find out I'm on days next week and then for like the next 3 or 4 hrs I was the worst person in the world to talk to.  Not even  urlLink Lewis Black  could make me smile, I was so pissed off.  I could barely concentrate, let alone talk to someone in a civil manner.  But I guess it wore off...at least I'll be out of the shop learning new things.  ...fucking dayshift....makes me wanna puke....  And yes, I have to go in tomm morning, so I shouldn't be up right now typing this shit, but I felt I owed it to all ONE of you readers.  That's all she wrote, folks...                          Yahoo! is experiencing temporary communication issues with the banking network. Please try placing your order later. (7)    now I fucking dare you to tell me that I am not hated by someone.  no shit, this is the 2nd time I tried to attempt actually spending money to email a woman, and this is the fucking response I get.  fuck it.  I just need to spend that energy doing something that actually yields me results (you should've seen me the second I knew she was online; you would've thought I just drank 2 pots of black coffee).  but I _need_ that; a woman who just by her looks can give me energy I never knew I had.  Life I never knew I had.  to hell with it.  to hell with it all.  I'm not bitter towards others who have achieved what I only dream of, I'm truly happy for them, I just don't want it flaunted in my face.  ...maybe I need to start drinking.  heavily.  solitude, depression & I shall be as one.  everyone else can fuck off, I don't need your fucking sympathy, so save your breath.  really.         \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{{text}}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
