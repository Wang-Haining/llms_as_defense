Microsoft [or Micro$oft if you don't like them], and it wasn't really solved by them but their lovely 'System Restore' feature. Anyway...  Today I got my hands on a copy of  Practical Photographer  which is a very interesting read, quite inspiring to me really... I just need to get a camera.  Among my revision I also had to happen upon some bhangra songs, they're not that bad to be honest, not my thing, but most certainly listenable.  My apologies for this being like a list in awfully short paragraphs, so to end that I have one of my dreams to write up; I find myself as a soldier in a kind of marsh area which we are attacking, after a bitter fight forward I board one amphibious vehicle and advance forward where after climbing what looks to be an embankment, the vehicle becomes a small yellow boat.  I find myself the commander of a fleet of similar boats and we advance on the retreating enemy, about half way across this ocean of sorts, I predicted that they would try to counter attack. In preparation I drew up the rest of my fleet and readied to defend which we successfully did, now they retreated with no hope of winning so I paddle furiously with my hands to another similar dinghy, on getting close the solitary sailor jumps over board and one of my men jumps on to replace him [where he came from I do not know], we then paddle back with the extra boat. Well just another day with just another dream.              This was going to be quite a bleak posting but the events of the last five minutes have managed to cheer me to a level above that. Most notably is my newly found cruel hobby of engaging arguments with argumentative people who don't have a chance of winning the said argument. It's cruel I know but secretly fun.  I had another dream which I can recall again, I don't know whether it is the fact that I am recording them that helps me remember them or what but here is last nights; I found myself in a shop with my father, the shop sells a variety of 1930s toys, especially models of cars, boats and trains, the shelves are dusty and the shop keeper wears old clothes and looks tired, I don't know why we went in there but when we come out again we have bought the shop. The next day I start work in the shop and decide that it needs to be cleaned and that way it can become successful, I start my attempts at cleaning it but I get tired and put on an old jumper and over the coming days I find myself transforming in to the old shop keeper. Well in other news I bought myself a replacement copy of Dracula [Bram Stoker] as I had lost my original copy, £1.50 - a bit of a bargain really. I have decided to re-read it as well, beats revision...  Music: The Rolling Stones - Sympathy for the Devil Mood: Aloof Site:  urlLink http://www.bbc.co.uk/.../...             Its quite late and I shouldn't be doing this as late as it is but hey. Anyway, today was my English Literature exam - an exam where it is by no means an exam on your knowledge of English literature and it isn't really an exam on  English  literature; my set text was Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck; an American. The poems that I looked at were written by an American, a welsh person, an Irish person and a Scottish person. No one technically English was involved in my English exam. But what is it to be English? They all speak the same language, some of their descendents could have quite possibly been English and an 'English' persons ancestors could quite possibly be Anglo-Saxons or of some other European origin. Who is English?  As it is indeed Friday night [now Saturday morning], I went out for a meal earlier, except on finishing the mile walk to the Indian restaurant, one of our party realized they had forgot something which meant that I had to get from the restaurant, back to the house, and back again - a two mile round trip - all in time for the first course. I did it, partly as they were delayed by a few minutes and partly because I ran a good deal of it. Getting back to the restaurant I arrived in good time to receive my curry. I would like to inform anyone considering doing a two mile run and then going for a meal, to go for something a bit more cooler, like a sandwich, curries just don't seem to be quite the right thing.  On the topic of sandwiches I recommend a Safeway Chicken and Bacon 'sub' [you know, one of those baguette like things which isn't], at £2.69 its hardly value for money but for a cold and wet May day it worked for me. Speaking of baguettes, Sally's Place provides an excellent guide to them. Let them eat cake.

I mean there was nothing unusual, nothing to cause any emotion in me. Subsequently I am feeling quite tired for having had such an uninspiring day. Tomorrow I have my German oral exam, after calling my examiner a dragon last week (and yes, she did hear me) I am not entirely looking forward to it. On hindsight I think she not really like a dragon - more like  urlLink The Watcher  from Lord of the Rings [I'm not a big Tolkien fan, just someone bought me the game at Christmas which I felt obliged to play].  In other news a small ray of sunshine hit my inbox this morning with news that Ross Noble has returned from Australia to unveil his new show 'Noodlemeister'. Which is a good thing but it now makes my t-shirt for the 'Unrealtime' tour look somewhat dated. If anyone does want that t-shirt they can buy it off the site at the bottom as well as find listings for the new tour.

'Fine' 'Good' So went the guilty conversation between a pair of builders who were taking a sneaky break from work and me, the son of their employer who appeared to be bunking off school. Neither of us could blame the other and so the conversation went.  Anyway, I'm not bunking off school as it is still study leave and I've just had the gruelling three hour IT exam, while it is simple it is incessantly dull; the practice exam I had for it back in the winter wasn't so bad as half way through a wasp landed on the next persons computer which provided a quick break of humor but alas, today, nothing.  Prior to meeting the builders [who to be fair, deserve as many breaks as they want] and after the exam, I decided on a visit to town where I purchased a portion of fish and chips, I consumed a good deal of them but left one or two because I wasn't very hungry. Point is I went to put them in a bin and this lovely old woman decided to comment; 'oooh look, he's throwing some of his chips away'. Yes I know I am, and I dare say your friend can see that as well. Why comment?  To be fair I quite like the way old people are very talkative to strangers, they normally talk to me if I am either alone or with a female friend [never if it is me and a male friend or me with several female friends], and usually they only talk about the weather but its still nice just to think that unlike the rest of our society, they can remain happy and content as well as confident to talk to strangers.  Finally while returning home I had the misfortune to be involved in a drive by in which I was 'shot' at by someone with a water gun. This has happened twice now, next time I will be sure to do something - what exactly I will do I am not sure of but who ever it is in that blue car with water guns will regret the day they crossed swords with the Don. I mean me...

Except I have to go in tomorrow. Then next Monday, and Tuesday... Well it was the last  official  day. According to my shirt I'm God and I have enough 'good luck's to repel a lot of those cursing chain mails.  So I have spent over 12 years of my life in education now, taken from society and not given anything back. A pleasing thought that. Last night I found myself watching Question Time from St Andrews featuring some 20 something who I announce to be very irritating. On the issue of  urlLink a 14 year old becoming pregnant and having an abortion without the mother's knowledge  she said that it showed that the government's health and education departments have failed. Now I am not a great supporter of the current British government isn't this a little extreme? It's like saying that because one crime occurred, the police have failed. This same woman had this annoying habit of calling 'here here' to anything anti-government - I dare say that if it was announced that Tony Blair 'smells' she would have called 'here here' to that as well.  On a more personal note I finally asked someone to the prom and she said yes. Now I need to find my self a tux and everything else that goes with it... She's worth it though!    Music: The Lightning Seeds - Sugar Coated Iceberg Mood: Quite happy. Site:  urlLink http://www.faultline.co.uk             I cook. I iron. I clean. I am the 21st century house husband - well maybe not but that's what I have been doing a lot of these past few days. I've spent most of the day losing time to trivial activities [in other words I took a siesta this afternoon] instead of revising for my  politically correct  German test tomorrow.  Its one thing to be hit with buzzwords like 'equal opportunities' and other social issues during lessons designated for such wastes of time but I think its taking things too far to be able to understand that: Ich halte Gleichberechtigung für sehr wichtig Which roughly means; I think equal opportunities are very important I could also inform you of how to say how to say something is racist or sexist... isn't this going too far? What are majority of people going to do with a GCSE in German? Some may go on to A Level, and then maybe take it to degree level but that's quite rare, shouldn't we focus on things that  will  be of use, not how to talk about people being 'der Gruppendruck' [peer pressure] or 'die Arbeitslosigkeit' [unemployment]. Let's focus on what will be of use, not what's 'politisch korrekt' [I think you can guess that one].  Oh I also had a dream last night; I am back in school [again] and I'm feeling quite lost, suddenly someone who I used to be seeing for a while runs up to me and talks to me briefly, she then moves in to kiss me but instead tears the flesh of my face. She runs off and I also go off and see a small year 9 girl who tells me that she ate my face. I respond 'yes, she did eat my face'. I carry on and no one else notices my absent face. Like I always say; Fetch Freund.
