Saturday, me and my brother in law spent 12 hours working with a skid steer loader (bobcat is brand and the one I rented was brand new, it was a big SOB) and got all but the hopper end done.  The hopper is the deep end, its 6 feet deep, 4x6 sq with the sides sloping down to it.  I hired some hands today to finish out the hopper end. It all needed to be dug by hand.  It would have taken me about 3 weeks to finish, what 3 guys plus myself did in 5 hours today!    I also have all the post for my fence dug, wife and I have 4 set ready for concrete, tomorrow will finish the other 5 and pore concrete around them.  tuesday we should be able to put the fence back up. What the deal is, my backyard sloped as much as 2.5 feet from my patio to the back fence.  we used the dirt from the pool to level it out.  Thus I had to remove a big portion of the back fence, raising it up as much as 2.5 feet.  This week we should have the fence done and sides done.  And one of my 3 inspections done!  I will update later this week.                  This weekend I decided to take a break from the pool and go to the lake with the inlaws.  Big mistake.        Saturday about 1pm I twisted my foot jumping from the shore to the boat.  Twisted it bad.  Finally about 4pm, I gave up and told them to take me back to the dock and to the emergency room.  It took an hour to get to the dock and that was a long hour, unbleivable pain, foot swelling up, every little bounce hurt.      So my sister in law and son take me to the emergency room in Dennison Texas.  Sister in Law was the days designated driver so lucky her!        Now mind you the last emergency room I had tried to get into was 17 years ago, Parkland hospital in Dallas, the worse emergency room in Texas at the time for a Saturday  at 1am.  (was appendix's, and they never did see me, finally left and went to a Catholic hospital across the street and they 'saved' me! huh and you thought only right wing religous nuts saved people!)      So I was expecting the worse.        We drive up and sis in law goes and gets a wheel chair sitting outside, and wheels me in, they have a triage set up right at the entrance, no one there, but someone at the reception checking someone in.  sis in law goes and ask if anyone is working triage, 'yes let me buzz them' Soooo, female nurse comes out.   Now mind you I have always had the most respect for the nurses in a hospital over anyone. they have the 'crap' jobs.  they in my opinion are the ones that do the hard work.  Like a construction worker, the bricklayer lays the brick, but the architect gets the credit. so this nurse comes out starts the 50 questions.  Now I dont have a problem with the 50 questions, I would want someone to know if I am alergic to something, so they dont kill me,  Although she did ask one silly one.     Nurse  'so do you have any medical history?'    Me     'No, I am 38 years old and this is the first time I have ever been to the Dr.'         Here's your sign!  actually what i said was, 'well I am 38 so yes, can you be more specific!' Nurse  'have you ever had a Heart attack, diabetes, aids, head cut off, that kind of thing!' Me     'well no, unless you count the first time I saw my wife and I sure thought I had a Heart attack!'  Ok I didnt actually say that, I just said 'ohh no, nothing like that' the nurse was nice and laughed as did the male nurse that was taking my blood pressure.  The blood pressure, I was thinking with all the pain I was in and all, that it would be real bad.  NOPE,  125 over 72   Little high for me but I guess itll be ok!  so then we have to goto the receptionist.  What a bitch.  If she had been my waitress I would have asked for the manager.  Why is it that people that work in hospitals are so damn mean and rude?  I wish I had brought my 2 x 4!  Even my son thought she was rude. I thought about it along time on why she and others that are not nurses or Dr.'s are so mean and rude and can come up with no acceptable reason. Do we think that the waitress at chillies likes waiting on drunk a-holes all day?  no, but she keeps a smile on her face all day.  Is it because they get paid nothing?  if that is the case leave and become a waitress!  She was having a bad day?  Hello bitch, i just messed my foot up, hurts like hell and ruined a vacation, but I was polite to you!  hell me being polite to anyone wether I am hurt or not is something!  but i treated you and everyone I met that day with respect, unlike you!  hell that wench she dont desereve the 2x4 she deservers the 2x6 with dung dipped nails sticking out of it!    she sucked!   anyway, they get me back to emergency room area and take my wheel chair away.  sis in law and son go back to lake since she is the designated driver and everyone else would need ride back to house, plus I figured I would be along time getting fixed up. so, Dr. Franklin, comes in we chat, he sends the x-ray technicians (some more rude a-holes, I hope that wench that moved my foot onto the x-ray board got athletes hand, from my athletes infected foot! she was another beatch!  I guess she was having a bad day also.) so seemed like forever since I was in such pain, but they had to take more x-rays but finally dr. says several hairline fractures and bad sprain on foot. walking boot, crutchs, some nice drugs and take it easy on foot. Now one thing I have learned in the last 2 years is,  ask, many many questions, 'ok, take it easy how?  can i still do the chandelier and leather with the monkey or is that out?'  'what is the name of that drug your prescribing?  let me write that down, and what does it do?  can i drive after taking it?  the nurses got a little tired of me asking 1000 questions but I kept at it, (one nurse said it will be on the prescription bottle, I said thats nice but I want to write it down myself,   she gave me a pen let me write it all down and I am glad since my med insurance had em change name brands to some off brand stuff)   so i take some good drugs, and they release me.  I crutch my way outside, and no one is there waiting on me,  I find a chair outside and sit, drugged up in the cool shade and reflect on.... hell i dont know what i reflected on,  kind of drugged up, no pain!  total time from talking to triage nurse to sitting outside, half stoned, under 2 hours! I was very impressed!   Nurses all nice, and Dr. was very informative.  shocked is a good way to put it.  Now mind you,I told myself I was going to start paying attention to the medical stuff next time I went.  since sister and sister and bro in laws are DR's and Nurses, and I always bad mouth them, I wanted to be specific on what they did wrong.  Maybe It has always been the receptionist and the technicians that are rude beatchs, and I just blame it on the dr.?  One key is ask the Dr. anything you dont understand.  I mean anything.  I had him get specific on alot of stuff, yes I could tell he was kinda tired or frustraded? with me but once I got it i let him know.  and I thanked him, not for treating me so much but for explaining all that I asked.    No more vacations this summer, I am just gonna finish my pool and go take one in it!  And Dr.'s are still not that smart!  (thats for you Suzz)                wife son any I got another 4 foot of the pool floor done yesterday. Heat index of around 100 when we started late in the afternoon, early evening.  we have 8 feet left to go.  we can get 4 foot done today and 4 foot done tomorrow.  even with the heat index of over 100.  Friday evening will be spent cleaning up the bottom, (it still has mud and dirt in the deep end from the rain last week)  clean up sides, finish electrical and plumbing.  will either put the liner in sat or sunday, more than likely saturday afternoon. will spend sat am finallizing the cleaning and getting ready.  still have along way to go, after the liner is in, have to get all the forms built for the deck, that includes getting another 10 yards of sand, and 10 yards of dirt to level everything with the top of the pool.  Once the deck forms are done, i call for another inspection.  they inspect bond wire/electrical at that one.  when that passes we can start pooring the concret decking.   We will have to pour approximatly 525 sq. foot of decking.  that will take some weekends!  we are doing exposed aggregate.   i found a guy that did it himself and posted the how to on the web.   urlLink  link to how to on concrete             The sun came out  yesterday after 6 days of rain! I was able to work on the pool yesterday evening.  Today should be sunny, and also all weekend.    I should be able to get all the walls up, and concrete collar around them done.  Its suppose to have a heat index of 104 degrees today. And I am happy as hell!  I can drink alot of water, get in shade for breaks, but at least I will be working on my pool.  For those that are interested,  as of now, I should have 7,500 in cost for the pool when Im done. That is for a 14 x 28 foot pool with a 6 foot deep end and 6 foot wide stairs.  and that also includes all the concrete decking im doing.  That same pool made with gunite with me being my own contracor,  would cost about 16,000 to 18,000  and if I had just hired a pool company would have been about 25,000 to 30,000. Also I leveled my yard, and did not destroy any of my shrubs or plants.  A pool company would have ruined alot of them plus tore up my grass in the front yard with there tractors.  It does pay to do it yourself.  Dad might be coming to help this weekend, I sure hope so, I need it.  I will post a pic I have of him driving the backhoe.  He was like a little kid on that thing, quit funny to watch.              urlLink    Unibomber poker kid.&nbsp; urlLink     First things first.       The weather has been rainy all week, but today on the way home the sun came out.  We have a chance of thunderstorms the next few days.  It they miss us the ground will be dry enough to work this weekend.  I am hoping for the best!       The son, daughter, wife and I are playing a family texas hold em 'poker tour' at the house.  Son and daughter came up with the rules.  My son takes his games very serious.  That is him, trying to hide himself so we wont be able to 'read' his expressions and figure out what he has.      The daughter, the first night, bluffed a huge pot out of me and the son 'the profesional' players.  She had nothing, but played the giggly 'I got a pair of aces'  and we fell for it.  She didnt win the tourny but that one hand made her night!  Its the little things that make your day more often than not!  (holly cow, hearsedrv the philosipher?)      Me and the wife went on a double date last night with her brother and his wife.  My kids baby sat his 15month old.  We have not been on a date in ages.  I am a grouchy old fart that hates people and hates eating out, that is why its been years!     Met at bro-in-laws house after work, went to dinner. Now I hate restraunts.   Last night our waiter is 'Todd'.  some young punk, earings in both ears, half a brain, happy how the hell are you buttwipe.  I hate that crap.  This guy wasnt too bad, but most I cant stand.  'HI, MY NAME IS STUPID, HAPPY, DUMB, GOOD LOOKING, YOUNG, BITCH, AND I WILL BE TRYING TO MESS UP THE WHOLE MEAL FOR YOU TONIGHT, AND I EXPECT TO GET A 20% TIP WHEN I AM DONE!'   I waited tables and never acted as bad as they do.  To me a waiter should never be seen or thought of.  A good meal is when you dont know for sure if your waiter is a guy or girl.  The best restraunt I ever took my wife too, the waitress/waiter?  was awesome.  She or he took our order, brought the right drinks and brought the food.  thats all, and damit that is all I want.  If I wanted some young female to flirt with me I would be at a topless bar, hell!  Just bring the food and drinks and stay away from me.  Leave your 'flair' in the toilet were it belongs!     Now 'todd' did mess up in the worse way though.       My drink.     I drink bourbon and coke.  I love the taste of bourbon mixed with coca-cola.  Not pepsi,not Dr. Pepper, but coca-cola.       BUT, NOTICE I SAID BOURBON?  FOR THOSE THAT DONT DRINK OR DONT WAIT TABLES.  BOURBON IS MADE ONLY A CERTAIN WAY AND ONLY IN KENTUCKY.  NO WERE ELSE.   JACK DANIELS IS NO BOURBON  JACK IS A WHISKEY.  HUGE DIFFRENCE.     Well stupid, who I have been calling 'todd' brought me a 'jack and coke'  when I sent that crap back, he asked what was wrong.  I asked 'what is that?'  he said Jack and coke like you asked for, 'no I asked for Bourbon and coke'.....'ohhh well its the same thing'   Susie were is my 2 x 4?       http://www.straightbourbon.com/  That link above,  all waiters and waitress's should read.  Its in english.  Learn it, live , be it! Other than stupid not knowing crap about his job, it was a really good dinner.  I didnt say bad things to the waiter, and enjoyed the company.  The meal was ok, nothing like my wife cooks but slumming once in awhile is ok.   BUT IT GETS BETTER!   We goto a 8:10 movie.  The stepford wifes.  Now the movie was ok. nothing bad nothing great, I enjoyed it, sitting next to my hottie!  but the fun part is, we go in, and just after they take our tickets, they have a ropped off area.  Little sighns, 'line for 12:01am showing of spiderman 2 is here.  and damned if 4 hours before midnight there are uhhh there are, well there are, ohhh hell,  there are some freaking geeks sitting down, waiting for the midnight showing of the premier of spiderman2. Not kids mind you, but people over the age of 16. And it gets worse. There is a guy, probably 18? 17?  and he has a spiderman uniform on!! I kid you not!  He is wearing a spiderman outfit, sitting in a roped off area, in a major metorpolitian area, waiting for the premier of spiderman2!  Made me wish I had my spiderman undroos on!  Me and bro in law got a great laugh out of it! He is a police in that city and does security at that theatre, and he said 'you should have seen the re-release of star wars!, all guys my age, waiting hours dressed up like star wars characters!' dont ever call me a geek again!  I may know alot about computers but Im no GEEK dont put me in the same cat as them freaks!  Well, I am hoping that I can get alot done this long weekend on the pool.  May the rain gods move to west texas were its needed!         \n'''\n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
