Im going to miss him and it has only been a day and yet here I am looking at his photo... again and again as if the world is going to come tumbling down.  Yup...his job is kinda time constraining,him an officer in the army ... I have to live with that for the rest of my life. Yet, I am happy with him. There's chemistry and we could talk about anything from weapons,politics or even the simple terminology of self reflection. I feel safe with him...maybe he is my knight n shinning armour who  has come to save me amidst the confusion. He was so sweet,the day he called me before he flew off, he said ' In any decision that you are going to make, I will say yes to it all,I wiil support you and at the end of the day, I will always be there for you,' I almost cried when he said that, Ive been waiting for someone to tell me that.  Dear Khai,my knight and shinning armour, come back to me when your job is done...   Untukmu Khai  Untukmu Ku saluti benang-benang sutera, menjadi perhiasan setiap pereka, menjadi keinginan si dara jelita, menjadi rebutan si putera raja... Setiap lirikan mata, Setiap gerak geri bicara, Ku perkemaskan tenunan, Ku halusi perasaan, Lalu,dengan perlahan redup matamu ku perhatikan, Lalu aku relakan... mereka istana pasir, dari embun-embun kasih.  - 3.4.2004                  tired...the whole day in school was spend in meetings. A friend of mine sms me saying that he had just came back from a short getaway. At first I was so relieved that he message me...then again. Believing in your feelings can really be difficult...especially when the other party does not feel the same way.To cross a friends path thats another issue...hmm,did some surfing on the net,discovered some beautiful poems.  This poem captured my heart,it goes on like this,  A Dream within a Dream by Edgar Allen Poe   Take this kiss upon the brow! And, in parting from you now, Thus much let me avow- You are not wrong, who deem That my days have been a dream; Yet, if Hope has flown away In a night, or in a day, In a vision, or in none, Is it, therefore, the less gone? All that we see or seem Is but a dream within a dream.  I stand amid the roar Of a surf-tormented shore, And I hold within my hand Grains of golden sand- How few! yet how they creep Through my fingers to the deep, While I weep- while I weep! O God! can I not grasp Them with a tighter clasp? O God! can I not save One from the pitiless wave? Is all that we see or seem But a dream within a dream?  Been thinking of a certain someone that I really like...once upon a time. When everything was so  colourful, the air was sweet, the trees were beautiful...hmm.Thinking that it was meant to last forever n ever. Indeed, it only existed in fairy tales.True enough.                 Yesterday, the 4 of us went to Bukit Batok, me, my sis, ayu n hanip. We went to meet Keris, they were feeling kinda of down. Pity them. After that, we went and have a drink at Mas Ayu wif the other Kelana guys. Hmm...ayu cracking jokes about Talib, all the way from Bukit Batok to Mas Ayu. We were out control...giggling and laughing our hearts out throughout the journey. Irony.  I woke up late this morning. Marking my karangan...the neverending ordeal. After this, Im suppose to meet my P6EM3. I just realise how happy I am. although Im shoudering a lot of responsibilities.   The other day, my sis saw Khai, presuming with his wife. Hmm...life, what can I say. Yet, the bigger picture is, trust, guys and marriage. Marriage is a huge responsibility... a commitment. Nevertheless, when to think of it back, everything make sense. Maybe, it was a good thing in getting to know him, yup...he hurt me, but if we were to look at it at another perspective, he had hurt his partner even more, the trust. Me, being the third party. Retribution, I do not want to see it coming. I love my dear Hanip so much. Even to think of it, will make me sick. Then again, if it is meant to be...then be it. In life we have to be strong in tackling problem. It can be him and it can be me. He told me,  feelings can change, which is terribly true.     2.55 pm   Just finish cutting the tickets, the alignment has gone haywired. Ismail has been bugging me on the tickets. Hmm...Im searching for the C.C chop, I misplaced it , somehow. Im tired. My eyes are tired. Im tired. Ismail asked me whether they can use the mirror room. I try to see what I can do.    5.55 pm  Hmm...at de spur of moments, things can change. Now, Im feeling restless. Sad.   ' Which is one is better, 3 years or one n a half year...'  I think it is better if it is 3 years, then I won't be leaving in denial.  An everlasting commitment... ' the person can be me or you...' it can be Me or you...  &nbsp;     Kris Dayanti & Ajai          After reading my previous post, it lead me to think, saya ni orangnya berjiwang-jiwang. Hmm...enough of that sweetness in the air, the cloud nine, the everlasting cotton wool and being dragged back to the ground. Yesterday was the MAEC meeting, yup...we are going to have the gigantic group around...its not confimed yet but then again the glitters that we see in their eyes...can outshine the indoor stadium,hmm,im just exaggerating huh..     My sis and I decided to stay on because of these words...' We wont be in the CC, without you guys around,' hmm...so touched by what my dear bro Ayu had to say. And again we decided to stay on because of our dear ...Mr Zahidi Rahman, our supportive chairman. He actually begged us to stay. Thus,this year the first project is sponsored by the Heritage Centre with the help of us the MAEC.  Yup...the outlining of the budget, the Arts, and the most important thing the objective. For Mega Perdana...I don't really care. Mega Perdana had already been auction for the mere of $5,000. The so called Chairman is responsible for this.   Therefore, Singapore expect the next ala Gentarasa or even a bigger event to be truly organised by MAEC Siglap South and the Giants...  Yesterday, Rizal called, he told me to write lyrics for the group. The theme, hmmm...something to do with Paruh... belum berilham hamba...  13 days to go, Khai. : )   'Love is not a matter of counting the years... it's making the years count.  --Wolfman Jack Smith                 yesterday was a very tiring and long day...woke up late to school. Hmm...had our Malam Anugerah Dikir 2004 penilaian...everyone was there.The emotional part was seeing them,the so called ' orang lama of the dikir barat world ' together after long years apart. Today,got an email... procedures on the registration to enrol on a degree programme in UM .still thinking,got the green light from my family.hmm...maybe I should enrol,there's nothing much left for me here,macam sedih gitukan... My friend told me, have you ever heard of the story about the Science teacher and her jar, the science teacher,put a few golf ball inside the jar,still its not full,the she put in some pebbles,followed by sand and the water. Then she said, in life we have to priorities,who are the golf balls,who symbolizes the sands and so on and so forth.The golf balls are people that are dear to you,people who meant a lot to you,the sand and the water symbolizes the so not important people,those that you can live without.Look here she said,you have to put the golf balls first,not the sand or the water.If you were to put the water first,you cannot put your golf balls...put the golfballs,then the pebbles,then the sand...then the water,you have to know. True...my families are my golf balls...the people that are dear to you.A friend told me that I kept making these stupid mistakes due to the fact that Im lonely, ehheheeh..more of a pathetic twisted personality. Now,Im a bit focus,confident tak tau asal...mungkin dah penat...mungkin. Adakah yang benar itu benar...tidak benar.                    Im hurting again...that's the irony part,I don't know why I am feeling this way. I can feel my heart bleeding thou...its happening again.Yup...as if a knife,slowly piercing deep through me. Yesterday, I went out with him and he brought up the issue of one of the gerl's group. I was so pissed off... yup... I totally lose control and the worse part, it was only like  30%  of my anger... bursting...it was not a full blast,then again.. it did make an impact.I kind of settled in when he crack some jokes about the boriah tingy...hmm,he is sweet...very sweet.  Guess what...7 new messages.Hmm...so many people I've blocked from my msn.Missed chatting with Shariffah aka yan, been busy lately...hmmm...  Again, let us analyse what the hell am I suffering from...is it an infectious or contagious disease...heheheeh, maybe I need to rest for another month or was it a pure act of jealousy..nah,that would be the last thing.... then again, maybe if you love the person too much, I would just like to imagine him being wrapped up neatly,in a package,put it in my closet,far away from all the girls as possible.At one point,I tend to become restless,twitchy and uneasy when he mentioned to me about his x.Im not a paranoid.To look at my past, I do have loads of Xs but then was then. Perhaps,Ive never been ditch before.The feeling must be overwhelming.Hmm...sad to say this,I think he still loves his x...that's it!! I couldn't sleep because I think he has feelings for his x. I feel terrible now...inferiority lurkes again. What a jughead, how can I not see this.. thats why I am feeling miserable..it has nothing to do with that masked man... Shucks...hmmm...jiwa retak pulak saya ni... Hai...how love can makes you a desperado and defy the norms.merepeknyelah saya...: ) Im listening to... Ada Apa Dengan Cinta...apa nak jadi hafidah,yeah...away feminisme and what is left of it...                     Guess what...a fren of mine by the name of Zai called, he hated when I call him that, the kelkatu man.heheeh,hmm...he sounded suprise. He asked me, ' Do you know that .....in your CC,' I said ' Yeah,Ive discussed it with Ayu,' The matter of the fact was, I dont really care...I mean the C.C stuff and more...Im in cloud nine you see and the only thing I can think off when Im marking and stuff like that is to think about my dear Khai in Taiwan.Has he eaten,taken his bath or the most important thing does he look at the stars every night and think of me, like I think of him.ehehhe.    The irony part here, is that Ive known him...what like nearly two months perhaps and the impact he gave me.I have to admit, the first time I met him,it was a mutual thing, a fren thing, like I meet my other frens. Then goes on to the next meeting plus the hours we hang on the phone.hmm...kita boleh bergayut berjam-jam.    Seldom people can just have the same chemistry bonding with me and the one that I want to be with is not just any Tom, Dick or Harry, he must be confident but at the same time humble... Any Tom, Dick or Harry can be found anywhere,under the drain,clubhouses,brushing their ego or just looking at themselves in the mirror and telling it straight to their face that they are big time losers.   Being in a relationship is not just uttering a few words like  I love you  or  I want you  , being true to each other,and to truly feel at lost when the other party is not around. Nevertheless,his picture or his last words somehow cure the emptiness inside.  I don't understand on how sometimes relationship is build on  a stupid lie. To be truthful is a responsibility to the loved ones.When you commit to someone, you don't only give your words...its more than that.     Something to digest ....Les Brown - I believe there are three kinds of people. There are winners, who know what they want and understand their potential and the possibilities. They take life on. Next are losers, who don't have a clue as to who they are. They allow circumstances to shape their lives and their self-image. I believe there is a third group as well. This consists of potential winners whose lives are just slightly out of alignment. I call them wayward winners...          \n'''\n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
