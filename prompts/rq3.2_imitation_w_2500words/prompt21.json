It is believed that these mysterious establishments sprang from the coffee-house culture of the 18th century, specifically after an ill-fated experiment with pig's milk at an establishment in Cheapside had unexpectedly explosive and colourful side-effects.   By Victoria's reign, Emetic Cults had risen in tandem with the Temperance movement, in that they encouraged abstinence by permitting patrons to drink until the inevitable occurred.  urlLink Dickens  mentions them in Dombey and Son:   The next morning, refreshed after a visit to Bleasdale's purging-house the previous evening, Dombey again returned his attention to the matter of Paul and Florence ...  Sadly, by 1855 these unusual establishments had fallen from favour and by 1860 only Bleasdale's remained. On the centenary of its closure in 1963, Westminster council attempted to re-establish it, only to fail when three aldermen were hospitalised.                 From 1880 on, open-air vertical lidos were very popular in London. Requiring little more than some water, a tiled surface and a large diving platform to erect, they sprang up across the city and attracted great crowds.  The largest and most lavish was in St John's Wood. The Wellington Road Vertical Swimming Ponds and Spa was centred around a 45 feet-high cube of freestanding water that visitors could dive into from the tallest diving platform in the world or walk into at ground level. But you had to be careful once inside, because a nasty fall could result if you fell out of the side.  It was, of course, most popular in summer, when people could pay their penny and just stroll in for a refreshing dip, but it froze into a solid block of ice in winter. Nevertheless, it could still be seen surrounded by small children, either because their tongues were stuck to it or, in the bitter winter of 1948, because they were admiring the lithe body of Walter Samuels, who loved the lido so much that he refused to come out and had to wait until the spring thaw of 1949.  Unfortunately, the growing popularity of 'baths' or 'pools' eroded the visitor-base of the vertical lidos and one by one they closed. The Wellington Road was the last, and only closed in 1957 after it was found to breach section 1.1a of the new planning act, 'Gravity: Compliance with'. But even today you can meet people who'll tell up they regularly 'swam up the Wellington'.                 Wren wasn't the only one to have grand designs for this fair city. In 1951 architect and intellectual Thaddeus Roshanak unveiled his new for a rebuilt London to a breathless crowd in Methodist Central Hall. Roshanak was an arch-modernist and his plan displayed the clear influence of Le Corbusier's  urlLink Plan Voisin  for Paris, but was far, far more radical.  Under Plan Thaddeus, Central London from Ludgate to Bayswater and from Charing Cross to Regent's Park would be demolished. In its place would rise a new, modern city of gleaming white towers and broad, straight avenues. The railway stations would be combined into a new 72-platform central station, linked by tram to  urlLink Paddington Airport , where Oxford Circus now is.  So far, so predictably Corbusier-style. But Roshanak's genius went further. None of his new streets would have corners, which he despised, and would thus only run east-west. Pedestrian traffic would be carried by looping travelators arranged in a stylised form of the  urlLink coat of arms of the Royal Institute of British Architects . In a nod to the city's destroyed heritage, the 40-storey residential and business tower blocks of the centre would be thatched. The central station would only accomodate inbound trains in order to promote tourism. And the new city would be entirely nuclear-powered, with each flat and office having its own reactor.  Understandably, the radical plan met with a mixed response. The National Trust called it 'barbaric'. The Royal Fine Arts Commission wanted to know if it was 'some kind of sick joke'. Malcolm Muggeridge praised its 'excellent benches'. And the  Evening Standard  was so horrified it refused to come out for four days.  In the end, Roshanak lost his fight for the plan and it was consigned to the dustbin of history. Intensely disillusioned, Roshanak quit architecture and became a freelance mermaid.                 1. The gig will use enough cabling to stretch all the way to Paul Simon's home town of Pydehark, New Jersey.   2. A brace of specially trained stunt condors has been shipped in from Argentina and will be released for the closing chorus of 'El Condor Pasa'.   3. Art Garfunkel's rider includes a handbag-sized can of Charles Worthington No More Frizz hairspray, a 500ml bottle of Body Shop Vitamin E Body Lotion and a copy of the 12th edition of Chambers Guide to the Legal Profession.  4. Diana, Princess of Wales, is known to have been a big fan of Watership Down and psychics believe there is a 95% chance that, if the duo play 'Bright Eyes' at midnight tonight, her spirit will appear floating above the memorial water feature that was recently erected in her memory.  5. Other celebrity visitors tonight will include Euan Blair, Salman Rushdie and H from Steps.  6. Peter Gabriel will come on towards the end of the gig to do some backing vocals in that yelpy way he has of singing.  7. One of the few things that Art and Paul have in common nowadays is that they both suffer from hay fever, so the park's grass has had to be temporarily removed and replaced with astro-turf.  8. Rumours that Paul and Art can't stand to be around each other these days are totally untrue: in fact, they will share a trailer and will doubtless be keen to continue the game of chess they have been playing since 1972.  9. Paul Simon is, in fact, two inches taller than Art Garfunkel, but a clause in their contracts dating back to 1959 (when the duo were a skiffle act called Simofunkel) states that Art will not perform unless wearing stilts.  10. The auto-tuner used by Paul Simon's guitar technician was confiscated at US customs because apparently its case can easily be dissambled and turned into a lethal terrorist weapon powered by the chemicals used to scent the moist towelettes offered to passengers in first class on Virgin planes. Luckily, however, the canary used by the crew to detect poison gas leaks has been found to chirrup a perfect A and tonight, this will be used to tune Paul's guitar.

In fact, similar debates have been raging in London for almost 2000 years.  In Roman London, this controversy first reared its head after the unveiling of a new mosaic of the fall of Carthage at the forum. Its depiction of the violence inflicted on the stricken city was said to be graphic, and within a week a man was found two street away cut into half-inch squares. The mosaic was swiftly covered up.  Another notable instance was the infamous furore that surrounded the growing popularity of  urlLink magic lantern picture shows  in the 1830s. At one particular establishment - Messrs Lagrange And Their Coloured Light Amazeum - a show entitled 'Mrs X Walks Her Dogs' is believed to have sparked a craze for dog ownership - a harmless enough pursuit, you might think, until you consider that the show ran as an unending loop and thus led to several cases of exhaustion and The Vapours.  Indeed the Lagranges' establishment seems to have courted controversy. A showing entitled 'The Wronged Customer Wreaks His Bloody Revenge' was accused of directly leading to the Umbrella Salesmen Massacre of 1839. The Lagranges hotly contested this claim, but undermined their case by following The Wronged Customer with an attraction called 'The Satisfied Customer Gives The Lagrange Brothers All Their Money'.  We shall not linger long on the Punch & Judy killings of the 1890s but to say that the culprit was almost certainly a man in a crocodile suit rather than an actual crocodile, all shows at the time carried clear warnings that that was  not  the way to do it, and that the murderer's modus operandi led directly to important safety laws that finally banned the inclusion of six-inch nails and lead shot in sausages.  On a related note,  the world’s first clockwork orange  was shown at the Great Exhibition in 1851. The spring-driven geared citrus could be an orange at three different speeds, easily adjustable by switch, and only needed winding every four hours. It was a popular success, easily outselling Stevenson’s Patent Steam-Piston Pear, which had a tendency to overheat.                 Traffic has been an abiding bugbear of Londoners since Roman times. As  Fetlock's London Chronyk  pointed out in 1475:   'The Streetes doe so heave Wyth carts and theyr beastes of Laboyr that this Chronykler wasse layte for his worke agayne and didde gette a Ryght ticking-off fromme the Manyger of his Line; and suche is the heaving of the Beastes that their Dirt and Manyure does mayke manye a Pedestryan heave also.'   In recent times, though, much of the motorists' ire has been directed at Traffic Wardens, who issue fines to illegally parked motorists. With these custodians of the yellow line again heavily in the news, we revisit the three most extreme cases of wardens overstepping the mark:  1. Parking services had to be suspended for three weeks in Islington in 1994 after it emerged that wardens were ticketing items of street furniture including bollards, benches and street lamps. While the council approved of the wardens' zeal and creativity, it found it self-defeating to end up paying the fines itself.  2. A 1990 plan to force drivers in the borough of Wandsworth to carry a warden in the front passenger seat of their cars at all times, believed to be the 'final solution' to traffic violations, was abandoned after an 'extremely successful' pilot because it cost too much.  3. Haringey council's innovative and more cost-effective policy of summarily executing errant motorists was scrapped in 1999 after three years of operation because of the escalating problem of abandoned vehicles and health and safety concerns.                  Netto Ockwell was born in a disease-ridden swamp south of the Thames in 863 ( urlLink map ). He rose to prominence in 885 after his shirt fell apart during a drinking competition and he preached a fiery sermon on the spot about the importance of low-cost clothes.  Despite having no religious training from the church, or indeed any training at all, he rapidly acquired a following thanks to his vehement and often expletive-laden sermons in the area - mostly on no particular subject other than the audience being 'fuckers', which was believed to be an imprecation against the sin of fornication - and his habit of falling into a deep meditative trance at about 8pm every evening until noon the next day. Thanks to his diminutive stature, he acquired the nickname 'Little Ockwell' ('Lidl Ockwell' in old English).  Reports of his demise vary. Some of his more ardent supporters claim he was burned at the stake by the church for heresy. Others claim he set himself on fire demonstrating one of the cheap lighters he was attempting to sell. All accounts agree, however, that he miraculously exploded and was consumed by flames within seconds - possibly a byproduct of the enormous quantity of lamp oil he drank.  Although he was never officially beatified by the Vatican, the area became known as 'Saint Ockwell's'. This became 'St. Ockwell' in 1705, and by 1840 was commonly abbreviated to 'Stockwell', the name it bears today.                 London has been the venue for many pioneering public health schemes over the years, ranging from  urlLink John Snow's work to identify the causes of Cholera  to  urlLink Bazalgette's construction of the sewer system . But for every breakthrough in public health, there have been numerous horrible failures. Here we list the top 10.  10.  Typhoid: Nature's Beautician for Healthy Skin.  Pamphlet, 1871.  9.  Dr Feniloe's Radium and Lead Cutlery.  Withdrawn 1894.  8.  Barking Spa.  Renamed 'Northern Outfall Sewage Works', 1904.  7.  The Killer In Your Home: Why Privies Belong At The Bottom Of The Garden.  Book, first and only edition dated 1922.  6.  Lawnmower Repairs For The Under-Fives.  Book, pulped 1971.  5.  Botulicks.  Popular frozen-milk snack until 1959.  4.  Our Friend Anthrax.  Government film produced 1952, shown twice.  3  AIDS: It'll Probably Go Away By Itself.  Pamphlet, withdrawn 1982.  2.  The Daily Mail.  Various stories including 'New Asylum Seeker Breast Cancer Threat to House Prices', 'Flirting: The Cancer Connection' and 'Did Nostradamus Predict BSE Using The Bible Code?', 1971-2004 and on.  1.  The Rat Diet.  Controversial nutrition advice until 1348.                 This isn't London has been inundated by two emails from  urlLink Fizzwhizz  and CS. Here they are ...    Four killings and a film deal   Quentin Tarantino's most recent films were originally to be called Kilburn 1 and Kilburn 2,  writes Fizzwhizz . They were to be set in the eponymous north London suburb and featured an angry housewife's attempts to get revenge on the man who sold her a jar of gefilte fish so dodgy that it gave her husband a bad stomach upset and left him unable to attend his own daughter's wedding. The Lucy Liu character was originally to have been a comedy Indian grandmother played by Meera Syal; Bill was to have been a self-conscious upper-class fop played by Hugh Grant.   However it was decided to move the setting to America and increase the martial-arts content of the movie after studio executives became concerned that a gentle ensemble comedy would not afford sufficient opportunities for a video-game follow-up.    Taxloss responds: I heard a similar rumour. Apparently the posters were to be based on the traffic markings on West End Lane,  urlLink an influence that can still be seen .     “Of course, this is nothing like the food we had at the Medicis”   The first Italian restaurant in London opened almost 300 years before the creation of the Italian state, in 1582,  writes SC . Its proprietor was one Carlo Ghiradino, who had left his mother’s house at the tender age of 41 to bring the secrets of her kitchen to a wider audience.   He set up shop on Dogspit Lane, in the heart of the capital’s epicurean district. He could not forget home entirely, though, and honoured the tiny city-state from which he came – Tremestino (turn left at Piedmont and please drive carefully) – by covering his wooden tables with its distinctive red-and-white checked flag.   Before long, Carlo was the toast of Elizabethan London and his humble hostelry echoed to the sounds of fashionable diners exclaiming: “I remember this place when it was actually run by Italians” and “Of course, your actual Tuscan fisherman will eat something entirely different”. Soon, Ghiradino was able to enhance his décor with miniatures in oils depicting himself welcoming celebrities of the day such as Sir Walter Raleigh, Kit Marlowe and, on one memorable occasion, Queen Elizabeth herself. It was reported that she did not like the gnocchi.   Ghiradino was truly the city’s first celebrity chef, but his fame did not last. After being falsely accused of being a Venetian spy – a rumour first spread by a jealous member of the Worshipful Company of Gammon Fashioners – he was imprisoned in the tower. On 17 April 1587, he was doused in boiling olive oil and flash-fried with garlic before an audience of jeering Londoners. His last, agonised, words were: “No, you must  tear  the basil.”    Thanks, guys!           \n'''\n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning.\n\nText to be modified:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
