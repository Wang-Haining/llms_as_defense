My choices for entertainment this evening, after the&nbsp;family&nbsp;got bedded down,&nbsp;were numerous:     Watch the donks' convention  Break out the telescope and gaze at the Moon  Blog  Fix the kitchen chairs  Assemble the dresser for the baby's room  Re-organize the pantry  Fix the fridge's ice maker  Sit on the deck and drink copious quantities of rum   Number 1, watching the donks convention was right out, as I've heard it all before and I can't afford to break anything and the discharge of firearms is discouraged in this community.  Number 2 was out; while it's a rare clear night around here, it's also Garbage Night; so the hour I had for being outside got consumed with other endeavors.  Numbers 4, 5, 6, & 7 got shot down, as the rest of the family is sleeping and I shouldn't make any excessive noise.  Number 8 is not an option, as I can't in good conscience sit on my ass when there's so much yet to be done.  Fortunately; I found a happy alternative:&nbsp; blog and drink copious quantities of rum               Sigh     I've been falling below my self imposed standards for frequency in blogging lately.  Sorry.  Imagine that, letting Real Life get in the way of the on-line existance.   urlLink Lileks  is on vacation,  urlLink denBeste  is giving it a miss for the Dog Days.   urlLink Whittle  is kinda back, with another teaser about the forthcoming 'Tribes' essay and the book.   urlLink Frank  is still working out the kinks; and  urlLink Misha  is just falling flat with me lately ('.....it's not you, it's me.....').   urlLink Ann  is mailing it in once a week.  My Brothers-in-Blog on other endeavours seem to be missing as well.  My personal theory is that everyone is resting up until after Labor Day.  Once we're in the electorial home stretch, I believe the blogosphere will positively glow with a white hot brightness.  Lileks hit upon something a couple of days ago: SBHFS (Sudden Bush Hatred Fatigue Syndrome) where you just can't take it anymore and need a break from it all.  Maybe that's it.  Maybe we've reached our limit of all the baseless hatred spewed by the left and their willing accomplices.  Maybe we need tin-foil hats of our own, to insulate our brains from the barrage of crap that gets shovelled on a daily basis.  Maybe we should drink more.  I don't know.  There are a few giggles out there;  urlLink Ironbear  has a list of definitions that makes you think and chuckle.  And I recently discovered  urlLink VodkaPundit ; go read his '50 Things' lists for some ponderous laughs.                    So anyway  I found myself in a bookstore in the mall this afternoon.  Man, did that put me in a funk.  They had a display of Reagan 'memorabilia' books on an end cap and, being in AnnArbor (aka 'Moscow on the Huron')  every other shelf  on the end cap had al franken's book of psychotic ramblings, interspersed with the Reagan books.  Keep in mind that I had to walk past roughly two pallets of billyjeff's thousand page 'Love ME' yawn-fest and a life sized cardboard cut out of michael moore (how many trees had to die for that?) just to get into the store.  So I end up in the 'Political Commentary' section of the store (go figure) and I'm already pissed off, and there is a shelf of billyjeff's book and a shelf of hitlery's book.  Retching, I staggered away, bumbling into the next aisle.  Down on the bottom shelf, certainly not 'Alphabetical By Author', I find it.  I grab the only three copies on the shelf and go back around the corner where I interspersed the clinton's books with  urlLink Ann Coulter's   urlLink  'Treason'  .  The Missus is still asking me just what the hell was so funny in the mall.....  Maybe we should start a Movement.  Sure it's not quite like Hoffman's 'Steal This Book' or Arlo Guthrie's 'Alice's restaurant' movement, but it sure would be fun.  The next time you are anywhere books are sold, do a little stock shuffling.  'Treason' juxtaposed with billyjeff's or hitlery's books makes a nice statement.                       Since we're on the subject of bumper stickers, allow me to comment on a couple I've seen lately.  &nbsp;  The first was on an old Ford Ranger pick-up; it was styled after the current GWB-04 campaign stickers, except it read 'Re-Defeat Bush in 04'.&nbsp; Clever.&nbsp; OK, so they're still spewing the 'stolen election' / 'selected, not elected' bullshit.&nbsp; Do the math, moron.&nbsp; They didn't defeat GWB, he won.&nbsp; Period.&nbsp; Of the 43 lawsuits filed regarding the 2000 election results in Florida, 41 were filed by algore's team after&nbsp;every recount came up with the same result.&nbsp; Bush won.&nbsp; So take your ratty-assed pick-up with expired plates and the pizza delivery sign suction-cupped to the roof back to Delusion Central and stay out of my way.  &nbsp;  The other was on the bumper on both of the cars owned&nbsp;by people whom I love and respect.&nbsp; They take hard earned and well deserved great pride in their cars and do not place 'graffiti' on their vehicles.&nbsp; On each bumper rests a small (4' square), tastefully executed decal stating 'Outsource Bush'.&nbsp; I honestly didn't 'get it', so I asked what it meant, beyond the obvious vitriol.&nbsp; I was harangued for about 45 minutes about how GWB has personally outsourced all the decent jobs in this country.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Hmmm.&nbsp; I pay pretty close attention to the news, but I don't recall the President signing any Legislation entitled 'The Great Authorization for US Companies to be Required to send their Work Over-Seas and Divert the Profits to Halliburton Act' of 2003 or what-ever.&nbsp; I mean, I'm not being purposefully obtuse here;&nbsp;if you can point out the specific things the current administration has done or allowed to happen that resulted in this whole big 'outsourcing' issue, I am more than willing to listen.&nbsp; I may even take up the cause, if the evidence is compelling enough.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  But again, I pay pretty close attention to the news.&nbsp; I see all the economic indicators pointing in good directions.&nbsp; I see Crazy Al over at the Fed raising the prime rate because of inflation concerns, it seems that the economy is growing too fast.&nbsp; I see the left backing away from the '3 million jobs lost' line of crap as it evaporates in the harsh light of reality's noon-day sun.&nbsp; At last count, we had re-couped 2.7 million of the 3 million jobs lost&nbsp;after 11 September&nbsp;2001.&nbsp; (Note to the left: Does that date  mean   anything  to you?&nbsp; Those of us who do not suffer from a cranial / rectal inversion realize that we had a rough 4th quarter in 2001; through now fault of our own.)  &nbsp;  I'll post more 'bumper sticker' musings as they come to me.&nbsp; If you've seen any good bumper stickers (for either side of the debate), please drop me a line at  urlLink heywoodblogger@yahoo.com .                      urlLink Rachel Lucas  offers some excellent commentary on&nbsp;Flight 327.&nbsp; Go read&nbsp;all her posts in the 'Gimme Valium' series right now.  This whole 'Flight 327' thing should drive us all into some serious introspection:&nbsp; what would you have done if you were in Annie Jacobsen's seat?&nbsp; I'm semi-observant and obnoxious enough and my voice carries well; I'd like to think that I'd have been spouting out a very loud running Keith Jackson-esque play by play commentary regarding the goings-on in the cabin.&nbsp; What would I have done if I were travelling with my wife and children?&nbsp; Would I have been more vocal, or less?&nbsp; And why?&nbsp;   If there were Air Marshalls on the flight, what were they doing?&nbsp; The in-flight magazine is not that interesting.&nbsp; Picture all the sheeple, talking in hushed tones and passing notes, waiting for someone (else)&nbsp;to Do.Something.&nbsp; Are we still so deeply embedded in political correctness that the 'Todd Beemer'-type personality is rare?&nbsp; Where is the man (or woman) who would stand up and say 'Hey! WTF are you people doing?&nbsp; Sit down or we'll kick your ass'?&nbsp; To continue in&nbsp;the line of thinking that Rachel explores, prior to 11 September we had no frame of reference, no hard reasons to overcome our political correctness to question 14 Arab-looking men merely on the basis of their Arab-looking-ness.&nbsp; We have such a frame of reference now.&nbsp; I agree with her: the next time I get on a plane and see a congregation of Arab-looking men, I'm going to be singing like a canary, and not worry about who I piss off.  Go read Rachel's posts, follow the links&nbsp;and sit down and do some serious soul searching.  &nbsp;  I'm actually waiting for the left to bring Flight 327 up as an example of GWB's failure to do something about terrorism at home.&nbsp; It is an election year, after all.                   It strikes me that we have never layed out who we are and what this blog is all about. OK, you can guess that we are Right Wing types, but that would be judging the book by it's cover.   My brother-in-blog and I discussed putting forth a 'position paper' at the onset of this blog, but as we are both fookin'  busy  we haven't gotten around to it yet. Suffice it to say that while we agree on most issues, we will probably find areas where we don't see eye to eye. We both have our 'hot buttons', issues about which we are (individually) passionate.   I describe my self as a 'Constitutional Conservative' and often joke that I'm so far to the Right that I scare most  Republicans . I'm the guy who carries a copy of The Constitution with me  Every.Where.I.Go.  Why, you ask? I do so because The Constitution is the second most mis-quoted document in the history of mankind (the bible / torah / koran / et al. is the first most mis-quoted document).&nbsp; It gives me great pleasure&nbsp;to produce a copy of The Constitution&nbsp;for some whinny liberal hippie type and say 'Really? Here. Show me where it says that.'   Whilst this is a collaborative blog, we do not collaborate on our posts.&nbsp; He posts, I post; but never 'We' post. I'm sure we'll let you know if we ever do co-author anything.&nbsp; Hell, he won't even return my phone calls.....'Heywood who?' indeed.   That said, if he posts something that you don't like, take it up with him. If I post something that pisses you off (and chances are good that I  will  do so), take it up with him. No, wait.....I meant take it up with me. While we operate as separate entities, we each take full responsibility for the content of this blog.&nbsp; In the event that there is something Greg posts that I disagree with, I will offer my rebuttal, all the while&nbsp;vigorously defending his right of expression.&nbsp; We're both so  Constitutional  about these&nbsp;things.&nbsp; Something about '.....our Lives, our Fortunes, our Sacred Honor.....' or some-such (Yes, I know, I'm mixing Constitutional and Declaration of Independence metaphors; bite me)    And yes, I use a 'screen name'. Listen, the Federal Witness Protection Program has gone through a lot of effort and expense to date; I'm not about to go and blow my cover now.&nbsp; The name harkens back to the day in the mid-1990's when I was a (very minor) Big Player in the IRC world; it's been my nom de plome (gawd how I hate using french phrases)&nbsp;forever and I'll continue to use it in this idiom.  &nbsp;  We are working on fixing the glitch with the Comments, if you feel the need to slap me around in the interim e-mail me at  urlLink heywoodblogger@yahoo.com .                \n'''\n\nPlease rewrite the following text to match this writing style while maintaining its core meaning:\n\n{text}\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and [/REWRITE] tags.",
