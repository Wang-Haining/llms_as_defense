Good mood today, I joined the Priesthood.  Yea I know what you must be thinking, well think again because.....I am a volunteer Priest in the CoS (Church of Satan).  Our local priest is ill and will be in hospital for a few weeks so I am taking over :D  Today my most listened to songs are: Barenaked Ladies - Who Needs Sleep (thanks to Katie) George Michael - Amazing OZONE - Dragoste Din Tei (thanks to Jess) Our Lady Peace - Not Enough (thanks to Taylor) Camel - Stationary Traveller (courtesy of Michael) Boyz II Men - End Of The Road (courtesy of my Mum) Sarah Connor - Bounce (thanks to Katie)  Today I have had great fun, spent a few hours with Jason downing shots and playing poker (I lost as usual).  I haven't seen Lisa for 2 days, no biggie, she is going up to Cardiff with me, except she will be shopping (with my credit card *gulps*) but we will link up after the game.   Lame Excuse of the year (so far): 'i'm not ready to be in a relationship right now' next day she is with Joe & still is, lame excuse or what???  Ant                      The prey of the beast screamed Bloody murder The line is so fine between Hoping and hurting Former believers they beg for release As love looking down on them Smiles and picks his teeth Trapped in between heaven and hell He knows all the secrets And don’t want to tell There’s nowhere to run and there’s Nowhere to hide Love knows you all too well He will find you  Love is the ghost haunting your head Love is the killer you thought Was your friend Love is the creature who lives In the dark Sneaks up, will stick you And painfully pick you apart  Love is a poet, love sings the songs Pointing his finger you follow along Voice are calling, The monster wants out of you Paws you and claws you, you try not to fall  Love is the leech, sucking you up Love is a vampire, drunk on your blood Love is the beast that will Tear out your heart Hungrily lick it and Painfully pick it apart  Love is a ghost, haunting your head Love is the killer you thought Was your friend Love is the teacher who lives in the dark Sneak up and stick you And painfully pick you apart    Concrete Blonde - The Beast                      I smash the glass into my face Cutting through to my disgrace Disregard for bone and flesh How can I be in such a mesh of unlikeliness? I smash my likeness  At my fingertips With this blade turned in on me Cutting an ancient tree A cutter in a forest of industry Upturning usurping  Love me Hate me Help me Save me from me Hold me Hurt me Stop me Take this love out me  Anger tinged with sadness It's always been like this Place the dagger 'twixt my breast My nearest and dearest I hurt it I hurt me Hurt everything around me There's nothing no trace Still cutting to find the place  Love out me! Love out me!  Anger tinged with sadness It's always been like this No nothing no one no more No no no no I can't take this  Love me Hate me Help me Save me from me Hold me Hurt me Stop me Take this love out me!  Love out me! Love out me!  Siouxsie And The Banshees - Love Out Me    When it rains it just has to fucking pour - still no financing - R is so unstable that it is difficult for me to hold on to what strengh I have - I keep digging and digging - deeper and deeper - I think I'm scraping my baby toes now.  Only good thing this morning is that I finally reached my ex husband well technically still husband but we have been seperated for quite some time.  Seperation papers are ready to go he just has to have them notorized on his end - send them to me I do the same - we file and hey presto 8 years of my life down the fucking drain.  Although I try not to dwell on the ending of our marriage I can't help but be very thankful we did not have kids.  We had some amazing times together but once again I had someone lie to me right from the beginning about interests so when I decided to get back into the scene all hell broke loose around me.  Now I'm repeating the pattern with R why can't the truth be told at the beginning?  There are other women to be with, to fuck, to lie to in order to get them into bed why does it have to be me?  3 years of my life.....choking down my needs - trying to explore different things with him and then getting no feedback - For almost 8 months now he makes me cringe when he touches me - I need to be honest with him I need to tell him so he can move on but I am afraid to do that alone - He has become so violent and angry that I never know from day to day what is going to happen - What I did with his cc may have been a little over the top but I *did* have his permission - I never gave my consent to be physically or verbally abused - It is over, done, finished it will end - the only question is how to handle it.  I need to love who I wish to love - with no conditions attached the only thing I ask is honesty - I need my lover or lovers to support me emotionally -rofl - it might be financial for a month or two as well - I need to have space for myself without someone stomping off in a tantrum because I am working.  I can only be me and if that is not enough then it is best to move on.    My heart is leading me to a new path one that is unknown but feels safe - it feels right whatever may happen I will know that we had the courage to try.  Lead me into temptation Save me with your healing hands Show me the fires of creation Baby be my holy man  Flames in the Garden of Eden Heaven in pieces at my feet I faced the raging ruin Of a million sleepless nights I need to rest my weary head On your resurrection bed  Storms across the horizon Whirlwind tuggin' at my sleeve Just when my heart was turning To an icy shade of blue You came into the night Held me so close How the hell ya found me God only knows  Lead me into temptation Save me with your healing hands Show me the fires of creation Baby be my holy man  Lies in the Valley of Evil Like shadows fallin' 'cross my eyes When there's no santuary You came and turned the storms away You made the darkest night in my life Into Judgement Day  Lead me into temptation Save me with your healing hands Show me the fires of creation Baby be my holy man  I see forever in your eyes For your love I would make any sacrifice, yeah  Lead me into temptation Save me with your healing hands Show me the fires of creation Baby be my holy man  Lead me into temptation Save me with your healing hands Show me the fires of creation Baby be my holy man  Lead me into temptation Save me with your healing hands Show me the fires of creation Baby be my holy man  Lead me into temptation Save me with your healing hands Show me the fires of creation Baby be my holy man  Lita Ford - Holy Man                        Beauty is truth, truth beauty, a thing of beauty is a joy for ever. John Keats     Pity that there is so little truth in my life right now....caught in confusion twisted around in circles by what is real and unreal - I can still Love that is a Truth, I can still Dare that is a Truth, And I still have the Courage (or Stupidity) depending on how you look at it to risk everything on my desires.     Soul receives from soul that knowledge, therefore not by book nor from tongue.  If knowledge of mysteries come after emptiness of mind, that is illumination of heart. Rumi     Reaching out with everything I have needing to touch, needing to know that everything I feel is returned - When the real world meets will everything still hold true?  The fire rages inside me igniting me but not consuming me - I need to quench this thirst and feed this hunger burning within - passion must meet passion two souls aflame with desire and fueled by love.     Love under the linden tree      Be my druidess Be my everything Be my druidess Be mine  Around the Pyre, a circle of thirteen Thoughout these woods, ecstatic screams I look deeply into your eyes I smell your hair, caress your thighs  Now we'll make love by fire light A blaze so high it lights the night Long fingernails dug in my skin Yourself so wet invites me in  Our lust increased feeds desire As we combust, yeah we on fire I feel you shake so deep inside O oh scream my name and hold me tight  I'll do anything to make you come  Type O Negative - Be my Druidess                         Beauty and sadness always go together. / Nature thought beauty too rich to go forth / Upon the earth without a meet alloy. George MacDonald     Finally the breaking point..I am still not sure how I feel - relief is dominant, not having to live what has become a lie.  He is enjoying the fact that his family and friends look upon me as the one to blame - it will be the last enjoyment he will ever feel before I leave.  One of the worst things you can possibly commit to each other is lying about how you feel.  Although I laughed my ass off when he called me a cow and I shot back that the reason I won't fuck him is because he looks like a skeleton and then told him I was looking forward to him coming home :)  Never piss off a bitch that has control of herself regardless of R's opinion.  In November of last year there was no will to live, no will to follow my heart - I was embraced by the dark and all I wanted was to sink further down into it.  I'd say I've improved significantly since then - I will follow my heart, I will follow my dreams and I WILL live.  If I leave Canada there are good friends that I will miss dearly but thanks to the invention of pen, paper and the internet the loss should be minimal.  I need to be supported not knocked down every time I try to do something - he still thinks my company is a huge joke but he keeps forgetting that I am still looking for a part time job if needed to supplement income.  ROFL....once again he called me a liar, stupid and crazy - he feels that I am incompetent to make my own decisions...hehe...the only reason he thinks that is due to the fact that we are through beyond any shadow of a doubt.  ROFL....he wants to know the date of every Dr's appt so he can go with me - I told him he would have to wait in the waiting room if he wished....Ding, Ding back into the ring.  He found out today that I have been having my Dr document the bruises - and instead of blaming himself for his lack of control - he believes that it is me that is completely at fault....at least I am free of him for the rest of tonight and possibly tomorrow as well...please wish me luck on that one and if possible let a platinum credit card with a $50,000.00 limit land in my lap....pretty please Te Precore Dulcime Supplex *bounce*  He is still trying to get me to give him all my passwords on the computer and I won't do it....I will not surrender to him....I will never give up...I am keeping my fingers crossed that an answer I am waiting for on Wednesday morning is YES!  I want to be in the arms of the man I love and I hope he feels the same because we may be together soon.      Pain's deep... but it passes, after all. It's passing now but love remains.      Ciao everyone I really should finish the baby blanket that a friend is buying for a baby shower.     Spoken) Come over here!  Some girls, they like candy, and others, they like to grind, I'll settle for the back of your hand somewhere on my behind. Treat me like I'm a bad girl, even when I'm being good to you, I don't want you to thank me, you can just spank me. Mmm.  Some guys like to sweet talk, and others, they like to tease, Tie my hands behind my back and, ooo, I'm in ecstasy. Don't slobber me with kisses, I can get that from my sisters, Before I get too cranky, you better...  Chorus:  Like hanky panky [hanky panky], Nothing like a good spanky [good spanky]. Don't take out your handkerchiefs, I don't wanna cry, I just wanna hanky panky. Like hanky panky [hanky panky], Nothing like a good spanky [good spanky]. Don't take out your handkerchiefs, I don't wanna cry, I just wanna hanky panky guy.  Oooo.  Please don't call a doctor, 'cause there's nothing wrong with me, I just like things a little rough and you better not disagree. 'Cause I don't like a big softie, [no], I like someone mean and bossy, Let me speak to you frankly, you better...  (chorus)  Oooo, yeah.  Spoken:  What about? Yeah. That's an interesting... Oooo. My bottom hurts just thinking about it.  [She wants you to] Treat me like I'm a bad girl, [She needs you to] Even when I'm being good to you. I don't want you to thank me [Don't thank her], you better...  (chorus)  [Hanky panky] Oooh, yeah [Good spanky] Get the picture? [Don't wanna cry, I just wanna]  That's the way I came into this world, The doctor said, 'Lady, she's a beautiful girl.' He gave me a spanky and the doctor smiled, So give it up, honey, 'cause I want it. Yeah. [Hanky panky, good spanky, don't wanna cry, I just wanna] (okay, okay I'll fess up its Madonna)   ******************************************************************************************   I ache for the touch of your lips, dear, But much more for the touch of your whips, dear. You can raise welts Like nobody else, As we dance to the Masochism Tango.  Let our love be a flame, not an ember, Say it's me that you want to dismember. Blacken my eye, Set fire to my tie, As we dance to the Masochism Tango.  At your command Before you here I stand, My heart is in my hand... Yeech! It's here that I must be.  My heart entreats, Just hear those savage beats, And go put on your cleats And come and trample me.  Your heart is hard as stone or mahogany, That's why I'm in such exquisite agony. My soul is on fire, It's aflame with desire, Which is why I perspire when we tango.  You caught my nose In your left castanet, love, I can feel the pain yet, love, Ev'ry time I hear drums.  And I envy the rose That you held in your teeth, love, With the thorns underneath, love, Sticking into your gums.  Your eyes cast a spell that bewitches. The last time I needed twenty stitches To sew up the gash That you made with your lash, As we danced to the Masochism Tango.  Bash in my brain, And make me scream with pain, Then kick me once again, And say we'll never part.  I know too well I'm underneath your spell, So, darling, if you smell Something burning, it's my heart... [hiccup] 'Scuse me!  Take your cigarette from its holder, And burn your initials in my shoulder. Fracture my spine, And swear that you're mine, As we dance to the Masochism Tango.
