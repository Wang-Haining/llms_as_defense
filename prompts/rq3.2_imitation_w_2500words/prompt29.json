With my voice as his counselor, telling him to stay strong The music played by his beating heart, so soft so soothing was the song  With growth my experiences gathered to determine his destiny His past preserved by my memory, miseries melted by sanity I was blinded by ignorance but exposed his thoughts to knowledge The clouds showered tears of relief, levitated his belief in full fledge  Now the deficiency has dissolved, replaced by the presence of gratefulness My perception explored the deep waters of emptiness How can I step into the shoes of a struggler and not slip Listening to my conscience, it’s like conversing with a dumb man and reading his lips  Stepping into the light from the midst of shadows Bringing my head above the water, anger was shallow He swallowed, after tasting the delight of escaping danger Reoccupying my shoes, sweat drips off the soles of a stranger                  “Product Of Sin”  Virgins fornicate on a night with a full moon and trigger changes in the equinox An entire day of darkness, blackness pervades the air with the wind The sun never rises, light disguises as shadows The birth of innocence, the womb was infested by sin The placenta was the tears  of Christ protected, showered, I devoured divinity My birthstone fell from the sky as ice and shattered into signs of zodiac  Sucked knowledge as milk, inhaled parental acceptance, exhaled the negligence of hate In the presence of peasants, living was unpleasant but happiness had wealth  Inhibition of pain, evanescence of sanity, an introduction to despair   The stars melted when I cried, the nights got dim Time deceived my fragile little mind, the days vaporized with the past I hid in the attic when in fright; I slept in the cellar when the thunder tried to shatter my future I inherited a curse, but blessings poured when it rained, unfortunately the clouds were dry The strange fruit which came from the trees with missing roots, the product of impatience and disobedience                    “Quills, Ink and Scrolls”  I heard the screams within a whisper I heard the laughter in the midst of a cry The pen is bleeding feelings, from the veins of a sinner A cut from sharp words, personification strikes as my thoughts die  The ink is flowing like a stream, the pages are hot springs, the words are steam Dens of lion are tamed by insight; snakes are being charmed by my inscriptions  The sea is my tears, the shore is my voice, the horizon is my imagination, which shines with a gleam Communication between pen and paper, figures of speech controls my diction  From liquid to lexis, potential energy at it’s finest Boom, boom, boom is the sound of heartbeats exposed to poetry  Extracted from the essence, this is my reminiscence in earnest The identity is erratic, lives forever never extinct, unlimited evolution opposes history  Incarnated by ink, breathe life into manuscripts, a reflection of my mind so focal Reading this is tangible, the margins are flammable, I light the book on fire, it smokes when recited by vocal Turns to ashes and returns to the dust, grows as a burning bush on the summit of Sinai Keeps me warm, harm dissolves at high temperatures My footprints remain at the roots, my fingerprints reveal the presence of truth and emerge as fruits                      “An Oasis in the Wilderness”  A child scorned by his mother before he’s delivered  Shivered in the womb, the lake of life, the maternal river Phobia of a premature birth, the earth’s tomb captures her desires The efforts retire, the struggles expire, not knowing where they’re going Lost in the fears of haunted memories as her blood pressure gets higher  Credulous of her infected fate, zeal of impatience infested her ability to wait Intended aspirations proved to be bait, the hate of life was the hook Thunder shook her bosom tremors awake her from slumber The negligence came in numbers, her experiences too petrifying to be remembered  Amnesiac past, pediatric care was lost, burning respiration turns to frost  Yearning to free the predicaments, clearing of dark smoke and the suffocating scents Her feelings fluctuated with terror and looking at the mirror She was puzzled by the presence of no reflective image Her mind sizzled with vigor and rage  She salvaged her pounding heart from sinking in her blood The wrath eased, the burdens ceased, she was rescued from her knees Even though her dungeons had no keys Miracles sparkled her eyes, a halo sprayed when she smiled Rescued from turmoil her seed emerged from the soil  Germinated by the truth, developed into her roots Evolved into happiness, her problems resolved, found an oasis in the wilderness                  “Product Of Sin”  Virgins fornicate on a night with a full moon and trigger changes in the equinox An entire day of darkness, blackness pervades the air with the wind The sun never rises, light disguises as shadows The birth of innocence, the womb was infested by sin The placenta was the tears  of Christ protected, showered, I devoured divinity My birthstone fell from the sky as ice and shattered into signs of zodiac  Sucked knowledge as milk, inhaled parental acceptance, exhaled the negligence of hate In the presence of peasants, living was unpleasant but happiness had wealth  Inhibition of pain, evanescence of sanity, an introduction to despair   The stars melted when I cried, the nights got dim Time deceived my fragile little mind, the days vaporized with the past I hid in the attic when in fright; I slept in the cellar when the thunder tried to shatter my future I inherited a curse, but blessings poured when it rained, unfortunately the clouds were dry The strange fruit which came from the trees with missing roots, the product of impatience and disobedience                    “Profoundly Written”  I can’t help talking about death  It’s the only reward after all the failures and accomplishments I slept before I woke only because that’s the way its meant to be I had a dream while I was awoke  Things don’t always happen the way they should I was a sleepwalker, died in my dreams but was reincarnated when I woke  Tasted laughter in a smile, devoured humor in a joke  Wasted tears when I cried for no reason, but still nobody cares My experiences are similar to a manual Annual memories dissolve with age, another defect of animals  Affected by time, an effect on the mind, the future sublimes Felonies and crimes are prevalent and occur like chain reactions    Life is given and taken at the same time, interception of birth and death Even diaries are eavesdroppers that can’t be trusted Promises are shattered by disgust, secrets rusts and reveals Foes and adversaries slams the doors and tease  My pursuit of happiness they seize and step on me like leaves No one believes but instead they deprive and deceive  Challenges in life, tested but resisted, rested and rejuvenated  Waited but my shadow was impatient Hurried but my mind lingered  Advancing and climaxing, throughout earths adventure Maximizing my chances of survival by not trusting another creature Sympathizing with the air, poetry is like a sanctuary of scriptures                  “Untitled For a Purpose”  Watching my blood flow with the river, they join at the confluence  Splashing against the rocks like waves with a vengeance  Lost in the meadows of my memory, living my life in the past tense  Told the truth while lies blow in the form of cold wind, then condense  As I brainstorm the words pour in the form of rain Thoughts  give birth to ideas without a name My thoughts are flammable similar to propane Ignite it and it explodes in the form raw pain  Listening to the wind with the ears of a mammoth I hear echoes of a pin drop, still soaring to the top Attracted to lights like a moth  My skin feels like silk, my flesh is covered by cloth  I’m an active volcano, the lava is my blood My perception is almost perfect, roses and lilies emerge from a developing bud Smiles flood faces, the sound of waves crashing on the shore is heard in laughter which is softer,  when I cough the phlegm make a heterogeneous mixture with the mud  When in deep thought my mind soar higher than satellites Salvation cannot be bought, my burdens grow out my bones like stalactites  While in the dark bright lights devour my fright, my shadows devoured by trees  White flags of peace, my pants sag way below my knees Nothing can make me believe in rumors I don’t consider most jokes to be humor  I choke the necks of snakes till it breaks Snap the spines of backbiters in three, that’s a felony, a crime It’s all bad intentions locked away in my mind Life is affected by time, heartbeats recorded in seconds Ten minutes without a breath Death sings your dirge with a rhyme, the undertaker keeping records  The spirit leaves the body never to return Mind cremated, heart burned, face dilated, skin covered by ferns The nerves in your body has cease being nervous Your headstone is left untitled for a purpose                  “No Tuning Back Now”  With no conscience, it strikes with a vengeance, unexpected, premeditated like an avalanche  Veins dry like a broken branch, as fast a rocket launch, your untimely departure haunts, the minds of humans vulnerable to death, stiff body with a stench  Hands bloody, no scientific study can stop this blood dripping, electric shock with static, hair sticking out like wires of a fence  Extremely diaphanous, see right trough the cumulus, the clouds screen the beam of the sun when it shines, but everything seen isn’t what it seem  Clean smell of the blossoms that bloom when kids scream, pollinated by insect, nature had no defect, but now the ozone is destroyed because of our neglect and lack of acceptance  Scientific inventions of plastic, anesthesia flushes away the feeling and my skin feels like bricks Sympathetic when you’re sick, taste of garlic when I lick, rendezvous with destiny, never seen the worst of me, there’s more resistance to come when it time for defense  Apple crushed, cider to a brew, new innovations the sea is no longer blue, because the sky is now white, from the smoke precipitated acid rain burns the kite which once flew But it no longer flies, increasing hunger, lives in danger, but only in certain places, another suffers the curse of races, but unfortunately only one chance  No turning back now, sky’ll soon turn to black, no time to pack when it’s Armageddon, a day in history, the stop to all mystery, the coming of the lord, prophecies were true, we had no clue, but now we do, no turning back now, nothing we can do, no more existence                          “A Fiery Fate”  A prisoner in the mind, another spontaneous defect of mankind The memories of a blind man dissolved in the sand The miseries of pain conflicted with the brain Making it difficult to stay sane  Can’t maintain the ability to refrain, the rain came when he cried The skies turn red when he felt a pain in the head The shackles broke but he’s ignorant to freedom The manacles of his illiterate conscience hindered his wisdom Addicted to gum chewing his life away  Predicted his outcome with intuition A predilection of the righteous opposition  An atheist baptized in the shadows of death He followed and capsized to drown in his own sweat His breath was seized by the incarnation of death Pleased by his self sacrifice, received by hell because of suicide  Phlegmatic with no pride, married to the devil’s bride Divorced the levels of humanity  Rewarded with a sanctuary of fire An ever-blaze of haze with a nonexistence of hours and days  No burning to ashes, water and thirst never matches In a world where he elevated  The sun generated caloric calamity with a density that penetrated then burst The concentrated flames dispersed throughout his fiery spirit and parched His punishment couldn’t have been worse                   “The Dust”  Exhaling smoke out my nostrils, the words make me cough Humor and jokes stimulate my voice, some things just make me laugh Obstacles shattered and broke, witnessed by my eyes as ignorance revokes Sage spoke with vintage; maturity frowned at sinister smiles with intentions to provoke  My veins are pipelines supplying my body with fuel, exposed to pain blood is flammable Red blood cells spark and ignite the ventricles; my heart burns with anguish, my voice emerge as syllables Avoiding perils because my beating heart is vulnerable, drenched like a cloud Waiting to explode, the soliloquies sound so loud  Illusions sprung from insomnia, blossomed and emerged as strange fruits Tasteless according to tongue, useless considering the absence of truth My vision was blurry, colors dissolved with the air My face was painted pale, my body blended with the deserts, my spirit ascended as a prayer  My blood, sweat and tears reappear as an oasis, my bones as palm trees Metempsychosis configured, the rebirth as elements of nature, now my children has painless knees                  “Experience’s Uniformity”   Burdens crawling in my skin like insects, my veins are like a garden of vines The river Jordan has dried, my thirst is in drought, my bones harden with time My vision was stolen by bats, now the daylight is blacker than asphalt in the night Nocturnal shadows offer insomnia, I refused they diffused, haunted, I was daunted by fright  Emeralds glow from my eyes, my fear was bald, and bravery conquered the grave Spiritual minerals are minimal, I tried but the sweat dried, stepping into the soles of a slave Greed within cause internal bleeding, infests the mind like a disease Blisters even when it whispers, crystal tears break into pieces, as broken promises increase  Stitches in my scars, cut from a sharp edge, bleeding stars shine crimson, but my heart still beats Sleeping under the bed, six feet when I’m dead, but instead my body is cremated by heat Making love with the opposite sex as cumulating sins repeat Maturation form gums to teeth, introduction with life another person I meet Friendships and companionships converted in adversaries, as envy deletes  But even through the fire my heart still beats I’m prepared, ready for whatever; I’m the same human being, the same person from head to feet          \n\nPlease rewrite the following text to
